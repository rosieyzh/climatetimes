How Frack Waste Became Exempt From Regulation,Zahra Hirji and Paul Horn,"Oct 6, 2014","Key event was in 1988, when the EPA decided to classify most oil and gas waste as 'non hazardous,' even though it contains dangerous chemicals.  
¶In the small town of Nordheim, Texas, residents are trying to stop a commercial oil and gas waste facility proposed for a large plot of land less than a mile away. They worry that the Texas wind will carry toxic air emissions into the town and across the campus of the local school.¶The residents' effort is hampered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's decision in 1988 to classify most oil and gas waste as ""non hazardous,"" even though it contains chemicals, including benzene, that are known to cause health problems. The industry lobbied hard for the non-hazardous classification, arguing that the cost of treating the waste as hazardous would be exorbitant.¶Here's a look at how the exemption came about, and a recent effort to repeal it.¶READ: Open Pits Offer Cheap Disposal for Fracking Sludge, but Health Worries Mount¶Click to enlarge¶",0,1000
"Richmond, California: 2 Arrested Protesting Kinder Morgan Pipeline",,"Aug 01, 2017","¶Back in the U.S., two protesters in Richmond, California, were arrested Monday outside the gates of a Kinder Morgan oil terminal, as they locked themselves to oil barrels in a nonviolent protest against the company’s plans to build a new Trans Mountain pipeline in Canada. The project would triple the capacity of an existing tar sands pipeline in British Columbia to 890,000 barrels per day. Opponents also want the company to halt shipments of tar sands oil to refineries in the San Francisco Bay Area. This is Richmond activist Andrés Soto of Communities for a Better Environment.¶Andrés Soto: “The higher sulfur content leads to faster corrosion of steel, that led to things like the explosion on August 6, 2012, here at the Chevron Richmond refinery. But also it creates more greenhouse gases and more particulate pollution. The greenhouse gases are destroying our atmosphere. And the particulate pollution is creating death and disease in our fenceline communities, like Richmond, California.”",0,1000
Attenborough Warns Humans Are “Exterminating Whole Ecosystems”,,"Jan 23, 2019","¶In Davos, Switzerland, global elites are gathering at the World Economic Forum this week. While some of the world’s wealthiest people discussed economic and business issues, other speakers, including renowned British natural historian Sir David Attenborough, sounded the alarm on the dangers of climate change.¶David Attenborough: “It’s difficult to overstate it. We are now so numerous, so powerful, so all-pervasive, the mechanisms that we have for destruction are so wholesale and so frightening, that we can actually just exterminate whole ecosystems without even noticing it.”¶That was David Attenborough speaking with Prince William on Tuesday.¶Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro also spoke at the World Economic Forum, calling on business leaders to invest in Brazil, citing the country’s biodiversity and “abundant mineral riches.” Environmentalists say Bolsonaro will speed catastrophic climate change through deregulation and by opening up vast swaths of the Amazon to agribusiness giants.",0,1000
Paul Krugman on Climate Change’s Surprising Analogy,Janet Allon,"June 23, 2014","¶On the one hand, Paul Krugman gives former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson some credit for breaking ranks with his fellow Republicans and acknowledging that climate change is real and urgent in an Op-Ed article in Sunday's New York Times. (Of course, these kudos are a sad sign of just how unreasonable Republicans have become—to give them credit for bravery for simply acknowledging reality. But that's where we are.)¶On the other hand, as Krugman points out in his Monday column, Paulson's call for a national tax on carbon emissions is an empty gesture. It ain't gonna happen. ""A carbon tax may be the best thing we could do,"" Krugman writes, ""but we won’t actually do it.""¶The question, Krugman suggests, is whether we will do any of the second-best things to combat catastrophic climate change. And given today's political climate, it's a big question. But here are the second-best things that Krugman asks Paulson if he (and his fellow Republicans) will support:¶If we're lucky.¶It's a big if.",0,1001
New Threshold: 2015 Saw Average Carbon Dioxide Levels of 400 PPM,,"Oct 25, 2016","¶In Canada, 99 people were detained by police Monday at a demonstration on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, demanding Prime Minister Justin Trudeau reject the expansion of the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain pipeline, as well as all new tar sands pipelines and infrastructure. Among those arrested was Clayton Thomas-Muller, a climate activist from the Cree Nation in northern Manitoba.¶Clayton Thomas-Muller: “We know that they’re just trying to test the waters for tar sands pipelines to get that controversial tar sands oil that’s been killing Dené, Cree and Métis people in Northern Alberta with cancer, poisoning their food systems, poisoning their water systems, spreading climate chaos across the planet. Justin Trudeau is not the Disney prince that the media has been painting him out to be. He is in collusion with Big Oil. And we’re here today to support these young people, these brave warriors, for the sacredness of Mother Earth, to let him know that he needs to reject the Kinder Morgan pipeline.”",0,1002
