Israeli Environment Minister: We Will Continue to Support Paris Climate Accord,Deborah Danan,4 Jun 2017,"TEL AVIV – President Donald Trump’s decision on Thursday to pull out of the Paris climate accord will not sway the Israeli government in a similar direction, Israel’s Environmental Protection Minister indicated, remarking that the country “is not an American colony.”
“We are not an American colony,” Minister Ze’ev Elkin (Likud) said. “The working assumption that Israel needs to change something in its conduct because the U.S. president has decided to withdraw is wrong.”
“The agreement does not affect the Israeli economy — quite the contrary,” he said. “We placed an emphasis on the decreased use of coal and this is reducing air pollution in the state.”
“Just as Trump said that he was elected to represent Detroit rather than Paris, we were elected to represent Jerusalem and not Detroit,” Elkin observed.
“We can contribute our part and act to decrease greenhouse gas emissions, but without American involvement the world will have significantly fewer tools to deal with the issue,” Elkin said.",1,1002
How do you attend a Distant Climate Conference Without Flying?,Eric Worrall,"June 19, 2019"," Guest essay by Eric Worrall h/t Dr. Willie Soon – Swedish climate messiah Greta Thunberg has a problem. She desperately wants to attend climate conferences in New York (September) and Santiago (December), but unlike most greens she is serious about avoiding air travel. How do you cross the Atlantic Ocean without flying?  I’ve got a few ideas, but I doubt arriving by luxury transatlantic cruise liner is quite the down to earth minimalist image Greta wants to project.  Some of Greta’s fans have suggested telecommuting, but if this was a solution surely all greens would be telecommuting to climate conferences, instead of scarring their personal consciences with distasteful but ecologically necessary air travel. I’m sure you are all as keen to help as I am. Perhaps we can all pitch in, help little Greta figure out how to attend those crucial climate conferences in far flung locations, without compromising those heartfelt climate principles which have attracted so much global media attention.",1,1003
Watch: Gerard Butler Battles Mother Nature in Trailer for Climate Change Disaster Movie ‘Geostorm’,Daniel Nussbaum,9 Jul 2017,"The weather strikes back in the latest trailer for Warner Bros. climate change disaster epic Geostorm, released by the studio this week.
Gerard Butler plays Jake Lawson, the mastermind behind a series of inter-connected satellites in Earth’s orbit that can control the planet’s weather. When the system malfunctions over Afghanistan and turns the country into an icy wasteland, Lawson must travel to space to repair it; but he soon learns that the whole satellite system is triggering massive disastrous weather events, including destructive tornadoes and tsunamis.
The plan to save the world includes a plot to kidnap the President of the United States (Andy Garcia) and a whole lot of careful maneuvering through scenes of epic climate-related destruction.
Dean Devlin, who wrote and produced Independence Day, makes his directorial debut with Geostorm. Abbie Cornish, Ed Harris, and Jim Sturgess round out the cast.
Geostorm is in theaters October 20.

Astronauts Condemn NASA’s Global Warming Endorsement,Dan McGrath,"April 11, 2012"," By Paul Bedard In an unprecedented slap at NASA’s endorsement of global warming science, nearly 50 former astronauts and scientists–including the ex-boss of the Johnson Space Center–claim the agency is on the wrong side of science and must change course or ruin the reputation of the world’s top space agency. Challenging statements from NASA that man is causing climate change, the former NASA executives demanded in a letter to Administrator Charles Bolden that he and the agency “refrain from including unproven remarks” supporting global warming in the media. “We feel that NASA’s advocacy of an extreme position, prior to a thorough study of the possible overwhelming impact of natural climate drivers is inappropriate,” they wrote. “At risk is damage to the exemplary reputation of NASA, NASA’s current or former scientists and employees, and even the reputation of science itself.” Read the rest at the Washigton Examiner. See the press release, full text of the letter and all signers at CFACT.",1,1003
Merry Christmas Everyone!,Anthony Watts,"December 25, 2018"," I’ve been able to take some much needed time-off, thanks to Charles Rotter aka “Charles the Moderator”, but I wanted to say how much I appreciate this opportunity to reach around the world with our message, and to touch lives. I’ve been given a great gift. I also wish to thank Kip Hansen, who was instrumental in me getting back on my feet by helping my employees recover after the devastating #campfire. I very nearly lost my business due to the fallout. Thanks to everyone who helped. The situation is slowly turning around now, and I have hope. In 2019, there are going to be some changes, good changes (though some may not see it that way) and I hope to rejoin daily operations. Look for some announcements soon. In the mean time, I appreciate you all; the readers, the moderators, the guest contributors, and even my detractors, because you fuel my fire. I wish you all a Merry Christmas, wherever you are, and a happy and prosperous new year in 2019.- Anthony  h/t to Raphael Telis for the graphic",1,1005
