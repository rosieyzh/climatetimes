Germany says it plans to take a more active role in Arctic affairs, citing the far north's growing ecological, political and economic significance as a result of climate change.
Cabinet passed a resolution Wednesday declaring its intention to send German experts to advise the Arctic Council. It also plans to campaign for an expansion of environmental protection areas in the Arctic and explore the potential that the increasingly ice-free Northwest and Northern Passages have for shipping during the summer.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Tuesday after a meeting with Nordic leaders that her country, which is an observer in the Arctic Council, will ""keep an eye on the strategic role of the Arctic.""
Merkel said Germany would seek to prevent the Arctic from becoming ""an object of ruthless exploitation and natural destruction.""",0

It was a funeral for ice.
With poetry, moments of silence and political speeches about the urgent need to fight climate change, Icelandic officials, activists and others bade goodbye to what once was a glacier.
Icelandic geologist Oddur Sigurðsson pronounced the Okjokull glacier extinct about a decade ago. But on Sunday he brought a death certificate to the made-for-media memorial.
After about 100 people made a two-hour hike up a volcano, children installed a memorial plaque to the glacier, now called just ""Ok,"" minus the Icelandic word for glacier.
The glacier used to stretch six square miles (15 square kilometers), Sigurdsson said. Residents reminisced about drinking pure water thousands of years old from Ok.
""The symbolic death of a glacier is a warning to us, and we need action,"" former Irish president Mary Robinson said.
This was Iceland's first glacier to disappear. But Sigurdsson said all of the nation's ice masses will be gone in 200 years.
""We see the consequences of the climate crisis,"" Icelandic Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir said. ""We have no time to lose.""
Jakobsdottir said she will make climate change a priority when Nordic leaders and German Chancellor Angela Merkel meet in Reykjavik on Tuesday.
""I know my grandchildren will ask me how this day was and why I didn't do enough,"" said Gunnhildur Hallgrimsdottir, 17.
The plaque, which notes the level of heat-trapping carbon dioxide, also bears a message to the future: ""This monument is to acknowledge that we know what is happening and what needs to be done. Only you know if we did it.""",0

Alaska has been America's canary in the coal mine for climate warming, and the yellow bird is swooning.
July was Alaska's warmest month ever, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Sea ice melted. Bering Sea fish swam in above-normal temperatures. So did children in the coastal town of Nome. Wildfire season started early and stayed late. Thousands of walruses thronged to shore.
Unusual weather events like this could become more common with climate warming, said Brian Brettschneider, an associate climate researcher at the University of Alaska Fairbanks' International Arctic Research Center. Alaska has seen ""multiple decades-long increases"" in temperature, he said.
""It becomes easier to have these unusual sets of conditions that now lead to records,"" Brettschneider said.
Alaska's average temperature in July was 58.1 degrees (14.5 Celsius). That's 5.4 degrees (3 Celsius) above average and 0.8 degrees (0.4 Celsius) higher than the previous warmest month of July 2004, NOAA said.
The effects were felt from the Arctic Ocean to the world's largest temperate rainforest on Alaska's Panhandle.
Anchorage, the state's largest city, on July 4 for the first time hit 90 degrees (32.22 Celsius) at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, 5 degrees higher than the city's previous recorded high of 85 degrees (29.44 Celsius).
Sea ice off Alaska's north and northwest shore and other Arctic regions retreated to the lowest level ever recorded for July, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado.
Arctic sea ice for July set a record low of 2.9 million square miles (7.6 million square kilometers). That was a South Carolina-size loss of 30,900 square miles (80,000 square kilometers) below the previous record low July in 2012.
Sea ice is the main habitat for polar bears and a resting platform for female walruses and their young. Several thousand walruses came to shore July 30, the first time they've been spotted in such large numbers before August.
Effects were less obvious in the Bering Sea off Alaska's west coast. Lyle Britt, a NOAA Fisheries biologist who oversees the agency's annual Bering Sea groundfish survey, was on a trawler east of the island of Saint Matthew during the first week of July.
""The temperature out there for us was in the high 70s,"" Britt said. ""On those boats, everything up there is designed to conserve heat, not vent heat. It was unbearably warm inside the boat.""
On the ocean bottom, Britt's crew for the second consecutive year found scant evidence of a ""cold pool,"" the east-west barrier of extremely cold, salty water that traditionally concentrates Pacific cod and walleye pollock, the species that make fast-food fish sandwiches, in the southeastern Bering Sea.
Alaska's wildfire season started in April. July's dry and hot temperatures extended it. An expected rainy season marked by southwest winds pushing up moisture and soaking fires did not show up on time, said Tim Mowry, spokesman for the state Division of Forestry.
""It extended our fire season through the month of July,"" Mowry said.
Alaska by mid-July can usually free up crews to fight fires in other states, but only about 15 people have left this year. High fire danger around Anchorage, the Kenai Peninsula and the Matanuska-Susitna Borough has kept crews in Alaska.
""We've pretty much held on to all our resources in-state at this point,"" Mowry said.
A burn ban and water sprinkler restrictions remain in place for Haines, just outside the Tongass National Forest. July extended a drought in the rainforest, said Rick Thoman, another climate expert at the International Arctic Research Center.
Cities in the southern half of the rainforest have limited or no hydropower because of low water levels. That means power has to be generated by burning diesel fuel, Thoman said.
July was the hottest month measured on Earth since records began in 1880, NOAA reported Thursday. And a United Nations report earlier this month warned that global warming threatens food supplies around the world.
But Alaska's recent heat has had silver linings. Barley and other crops are ready to harvest, said Stephen Brown of the University of Alaska Fairbanks Cooperative Extension Service.
The growing season has been extended by a month, and if extra days become the norm, they will expand what can be grown in the state. Brown used heat radiated from his blacktop driveway to grow fruit not usually seen outside greenhouses.
""I've got a bumper crop of tomatoes and jalapenos this summer,"" he said.
On the other hand, the weather has stressed birch trees and left them vulnerable to leaf-eating insects.
""That gives the leaf miners opportunity to really whack them good,"" he said. ""I'm looking at my lawn right now, and I need to rake leaves.""
Brettschneider, the climate researcher, sees mostly negative effects from the hot July and climate warming. Alaska looks the way it does because of the temperature regime, he said, and in 50 years, Alaska may look like Idaho.
""We should expect changes. We should expect the forests to be in different locations. We should expect wildlife to move. We should expect plants to move. And in many cases, if they can't move fast enough, we should expect them to just go away,"" he said.",0

Scorching temperatures this year broke records, including July becoming the hottest month ever recorded on Earth, scientists said Thursday.

The average global temperature in July was 1.71 degrees above the 20th century average of 60.4 degrees, the hottest temperature that month since scientists began keeping track 140 years ago, according to meteorologists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
The previous hottest month on record was July 2016.
The period from January through July was also the second-hottest year to date on record, tying with 2017. The global temperature during that time was 1.71 degrees above the recorded average of 56.9 degrees, according to NOAA.

However, in some parts of the world, including North and South America, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and the southern half of Africa, it was the hottest year to date.
Ahira Sanchez-Lugo, one of the organization's National Centers for Environmental Information scientists, told ABC News in an email that as the temperatures continue to warm, extreme events such as heat waves and droughts will continue to become more common.

""As the frequency and intensity of these extremes change, we become increasingly vulnerable as these changes can affect our health as well as our food and water sources,"" Sanchez-Lugo said.

Heat warnings slammed much of the eastern half of the U.S. -- from Kansas to Ohio and North Carolina to New Hampshire -- last month.

On July 19, several heat index readings came close to setting records throughout the eastern region.

Some of the temperatures the following day, in places like New York City and Philadelphia, were expected to be the hottest in several years.

In Europe, a heat wave in July produced the highest-ever temperatures in Belgium and Germany, while the Netherlands saw its hottest day in 75 years, according to The Associated Press.",0

Carbon dioxide levels in Earth's atmosphere rose to levels the planet hasn't seen in 800,000 years in 2018, underscoring the impact of irreversible -- and increasing -- environmental damage due to human activity, according to a new federal report.

Carbon dioxide and other major greenhouse gases, including methane, and nitrous oxide, continued their rapid increase last year, while global sea level rose to its highest on record, according to the American Meteorological Society's State of the Climate in 2018 report, released on Monday.

Global average sea level rose to a new record high in 2018, rising for the seventh consecutive year, according to the report, which was compiled by 470 scientists in 60 countries.
Global average sea level was about 3.2 inches higher than the 1993 average -- the year that marks the beginning of the satellite altimeter record. Global sea level is rising at an average rate of 1.2 inches per decade.
Globally, upper ocean heat content reached record highs in 2018. Oceans absorb more than 90% of Earth's excess heat from global warming and sea ice was at a near-record low, the report said.

""This places 2018 as having the fourth warmest annual global temperature since records began in the mid- to late 1800s. The four warmest years on record have all occurred since 2015,"" the American Meteorological Society, led by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said in a statement. ""There were also more high, and fewer low, temperature extremes than in nearly the entire 68-year extremes record.""
""Several markers such as sea level and greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere once again broke records set just one year prior,"" it added.
The report came just days after a United Nations climate panel concluded that efforts to divestment from fossil fuels alone wouldn't be enough to limit warming from climate change, saying issues including deforestation and agriculture must also be addressed to drive down greenhouse gas emissions.

Land-surface temperatures have increased nearly twice as much as global average temperatures, the report said, as human activities on land have released more than 20% of global emissions.
Protecting forests that absorb carbon and reforming agricultural practices could play a large role, according to the report.

""Land plays an important role in the climate system,"" Jim Skea, co-chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said in a press release.

""Agriculture, forestry and other types of land use account for 23% of human greenhouse gas emissions,"" he said. ""At the same time natural land processes absorb carbon dioxide equivalent to almost a third of carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels and industry.""

Former Vice President Al Gore called for unity and urgency in the American response to climate change, saying he was encouraged by growing climate activism around the world, but alarmed by what he said is the imminence of irreversible, continuing environmental damage.

""There’s both bad news and good news,"" he said in an interview with ABC News Chief White House Correspondent Jonathan Karl. ""The problem’s getting worse faster than we are mobilizing to solve it. However … we now have an upsurge in climate activism.""

Gore acknowledged that climate change is ""a global crisis that requires a global response,"" and that to be successful, climate policies require international cooperation. But he held that the U.S. has a responsibility to facilitate this cooperation.

""The United States of America -- and only the United States of America -- can provide the necessary leadership to rally nations around the world to do the right thing,"" he said.Al Gore tells @jonkarl that climate change is ""getting worse faster than we are mobilizing to solve it,"" but the ""good news"" is that ""we now have an upsurge in climate activism at the grassroots in all 50 states ... and in every country in the world"" https://t.co/GU8je00r20 pic.twitter.com/Kz7Swtr1dM
And with Democratic primary voters ranking climate change among their top five issues, 2020 candidates have made addressing it more central to their campaigns. Gore said on ""This Week"" that while he would not comment or advise on specific candidate’s plans, he felt encouraged that the issue has become more of a political priority for Democrats.

""I would always like to see more time devoted to it,"" Gore told Karl. ""But I have to say, yes I think that it's great that there are so many of these candidates who are really making it their top priority and who are really focusing on introducing bold plans.""
For the Trump administration, however, the approach to climate change has included rolling back environmental protection policies, including those implemented under President Barack Obama, from repealing Obama-era regulations on methane in September 2018 to relaxing safety measures on offshore drilling in May. In 2017, Trump announced his intention to pull out of the landmark Paris climate agreement, saying it crippled American job growth and manufacturing.
Gore met in December 2016 with then-President-elect Donald Trump for a conversation on climate change and the Paris Accord and in the interview with ""This Week"" that he was hopeful before the meeting that even under a conservative administration, there could be progress made on climate policy. More than two years later, however, he said that were he to meet with Trump again, he would do so, ""without any expectation of reasonableness or responsiveness.""

""I did think at the time that there was a chance he might change on climate when presented with the facts,"" Gore said. ""I was clearly wrong about that… He doesn't want to change on it.""
In the same interview, Karl asked Gore about the possibility of impeachment proceedings against Trump. The Judiciary Committee, led by Rep Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., is investigating whether to recommend articles of impeachment for what Nadler has said is ""the obstructive conduct described by the special counsel."" Gore, during his vice presidency in the Clinton administration, saw impeachment proceedings from up close and said he supports the course of action Nadler has decided to pursue.

""Not seeking accountability for what appear to be credible allegations that crimes were committed, meaningful crimes, runs the risk of normalizing that behavior,"" Gore said.

With impeachment on the table and climate policy virtually off it, advancing climate policy during the Trump administration could be difficult. But the surge in climate activism around the world, Gore said, is good news. He also indicated that wind and solar power were growth industries for the economy.

""This is the best way to create millions of new jobs,"" he said. ""This is where the economic growth of the future is to be found.""",0

A United Nations panel says countries around the world need to adapt food systems to limit climate change, including adopting more sustainable agriculture practices and altering diets to eat less red meat.

Agriculture and other uses of land around the world contribute more than 23% of greenhouse gas emissions, according to the report and warming from climate change could start to make food more expensive as heat, drought or extreme rains make crops less productive.
The report released on Thursday points out that some aspects of global food production are inefficient, including that 25 to 30% of food produced is lost or wasted. As populations grow in developing countries and those populations consume more meat and processed foods the demand for food will also increase and put more stress on resources like water and competition for land.
Representatives from the U.N. panel said they don't tell people what to eat but that more plant-based diets and sustainably-produced meat can have benefits for both the climate and human health around the world.

""Balanced diets, featuring plant-based foods, such as those based on coarse grains, legumes, fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds, and animal-sourced food produced in resilient, sustainable and low-GHG emission systems, present major opportunities for adaptation and mitigation while generating significant co-benefits in terms of human health,"" the report says.

Climate and agriculture in the U.S. say the shift would have multiple benefits, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, improving health and providing new opportunities for farmers.

""The good news is that if you eat a more nutritious diet there's a good likelihood that if you're substituting legumes, and whole grains and vegetables and fruits for meat then you tend to also reap some real environmental benefits,"" University of Minnesota Professor Jason Hill told ABC News.
Walter Willett, an epidemiology and nutrition professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said the way we use land in the U.S. is detrimental to our health because there's so much emphasis on producing corn and soy for animal feed. He said the U.S. needs to produce massively more fruits, vegetables, and nuts instead of crops for animal feed, processed foods, and ethanol.

""That big 45 percent that we're feeding to animals and is basically making us sick by too much beef and pork, it's destroying our land and our resources at the same time. We're losing at both ends, we're losing by the destruction of the environment and we're losing by making people sick, so how can it get worse than that?""

Willett and other experts also said the U.S. would have to look at its system for supporting farmers, which heavily subsidizes crops like corn and soybeans, and incentivize sustainable farming practices and producing more healthy foods.

""We need to look at every foot of our land and think about how can we best use this to promote production of healthy food as well as do that in a sustainable way. These really are issues that are a collective responsibility, we can't put it all on the farmer,"" he said.

Amanda Shapiro, editor ofHealthyish Bon Appétit magazine's wellness site, said they have already seen their readers asking for more vegetarian recipes or recipes that can be easily adapted to be vegetarian or vegan. She said people in the food space are more conscious now that you don't have to label yourself ""vegetarian"" or ""vegan"" to reduce your consumption of meat.

""There's really a much more broad idea of what health means and I think more and more the shift toward vegetarianism for climate reasons I think our readers are thinking about health not just in terms of their health but in terms of the health of the planet,"" she told ABC.

But Shapiro said if people are willing to be creative with flavor and incorporate healthy fats, a plant-focused diet can be just as satisfying as one focused on meat. She said especially with so much seasonal produce this time of year, which has been the focus of the Healthyish ""Farmer's Market Challenge,"" ""there's just no excuse not to feel inspired by plant based cooking.""

For practical tips, Shapiro said home cooks should think about recipes they already like or are excited to try and experiment with a plant-forward version, like making meatballs from mushrooms instead of pork or using less meat the complement the other ingredients instead of the main element of a meal. She also said playing with different spices and sauces, as well as healthy fats, can keep food interesting and filling without focusing on meat. ",0

Human-caused climate change is dramatically degrading the Earth's land and the way people use the land is making global warming worse, a new United Nations scientific report says. That creates a vicious cycle which is already making food more expensive, scarcer and less nutritious.
""The cycle is accelerating,"" said NASA climate scientist Cynthia Rosenzweig, a co-author of the report. ""The threat of climate change affecting people's food on their dinner table is increasing.""
But if people change the way they eat, grow food and manage forests, it could help save the planet from a far warmer future, scientists said.
Earth's land masses, which are only 30% of the globe, are warming twice as fast as the planet as a whole. While heat-trapping gases are causing problems in the atmosphere, the land has been less talked about as part of climate change. A special report, written by more than 100 scientists and unanimously approved by diplomats from nations around the world Thursday at a meeting in Geneva, proposed possible fixes and made more dire warnings.
""The way we use land is both part of the problem and also part of the solution,"" said Valerie Masson-Delmotte, a French climate scientist who co-chairs one of the panel's working groups. ""Sustainable land management can help secure a future that is comfortable.""
Scientists at Thursday's press conference emphasized both the seriousness of the problem and the need to make societal changes soon.
""We don't want a message of despair,"" said science panel official Jim Skea, a professor at Imperial College London. ""We want to get across the message that every action makes a difference.""
Still the stark message hit home hard for some of the authors.
""I've lost a lot of sleep about what the science is saying. As a person, it's pretty scary,"" Koko Warner, a manager in the U.N. Climate Change secretariat who helped write a report chapter on risk management and decision-making, told The Associated Press after the report was presented at the World Meteorological Organization headquarters in Geneva. ""We need to act urgently.""
The report said climate change already has worsened land degradation, caused deserts to grow, permafrost to thaw and made forests more vulnerable to drought, fire, pests and disease. That's happened even as much of the globe has gotten greener because of extra carbon dioxide in the air. Climate change has also added to the forces that have reduced the number of species on Earth.
""Climate change is really slamming the land,"" said World Resources Institute researcher Kelly Levin, who wasn't part of the study.
And the future could be worse.
""The stability of food supply is projected to decrease as the magnitude and frequency of extreme weather events that disrupt food chains increases,"" the report said.
In the worst-case scenario, food security problems change from moderate to high risk with just a few more tenths of a degree of warming from now. They go from high to ""very high"" risk with just another 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) of warming from now.
""The potential risk of multi-breadbasket failure is increasing,"" NASA's Rosenzweig said. ""Just to give examples, the crop yields were effected in Europe just in the last two weeks.""
Scientists had long thought one of the few benefits of higher levels of carbon dioxide, the major heat-trapping gas, was that it made plants grow more and the world greener, Rosenzweig said. But numerous studies show that the high levels of carbon dioxide reduce protein and nutrients in many crops.
For example, high levels of carbon in the air in experiments show wheat has 6% to 13% less protein, 4% to 7% less zinc and 5% to 8% less iron, she said.
But better farming practices — such as no-till agricultural and better targeted fertilizer applications — have the potential to fight global warming too, reducing carbon pollution up to 18% of current emissions levels by 2050, the report said.
If people change their diets, reducing red meat and increasing plant-based foods, such as fruits, vegetables and seeds, the world can save as much as another 15% of current emissions by mid-century. It would also make people more healthy, Rosenzweig said.
The science panel said they aren't telling people what to eat because that's a personal choice.
Still, Hans-Otto Pörtner, a panel leader from Germany who said he lost weight and felt better after reducing his meat consumption, told a reporter that if she ate less ribs and more vegetables ""that's a good decision and you will help the planet reduce greenhouse gas emissions.""
Reducing food waste can fight climate change even more. The report said that between 2010 and 2016, global food waste accounted for 8% to 10% of heat-trapping emissions.
""Currently 25%-30% of total food produced is lost or wasted,"" the report said. Fixing that would free up millions of square miles of land.
With just another 0.9 degrees F of warming (0.5 degrees C), which could happen in the next 10 to 30 years, the risk of unstable food supplies, wildfire damage, thawing permafrost and water shortages in dry areas ""are projected to be high,"" the report said.
At another 1.8 degrees F of warming (1 degree C) from now, which could happen in about 50 years, it said those risks ""are projected to be very high.""
Most scenarios predict the world's tropical regions will have ""unprecedented climatic conditions by the mid-to-late 21st century,"" the report noted.
Agriculture and forestry together account for about 23% of the heat-trapping gases that are warming the Earth, slightly less than from cars, trucks, boats and planes. Add in transporting food, energy costs, packaging and that grows to 37%, the report said.
But the land is also a great carbon ""sink,"" which sucks heat-trapping gases out of the air.
From about 2007 to 2016, agriculture and forestry every year put 5.7 billion tons (5.2 billion metric tons) of carbon dioxide into the air, but pulled 12.3 billion tons (11.2 billion metric tons) of it out.
""This additional gift from nature is limited. It's not going to continue forever,"" said study co-author Luis Verchot, a scientist at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture in Colombia. ""If we continue to degrade ecosystems, if we continue to convert natural ecosystems, we continue to deforest and we continue to destroy our soils, we're going to lose this natural subsidy.""
Overall land emissions are increasing, especially because of cutting down forests in the Amazon in places such as Brazil, Colombia and Peru, Verchot said.
Recent forest management changes in Brazil ""contradicts all the messages that are coming out of the report,"" Pörtner said.
Saying ""our current way of living and our economic system risks our future and the future of our children,"" Germany's environment minister, Svenja Schulze, questioned whether it makes sense for a country like Germany to import large amounts of soy from Latin America, where forests are being destroyed to plant the crop, to feed unsustainable numbers of livestock in Germany.
""We ought to recognize that we have profound limits on the amount of land available and we have to be careful about how we utilize it,"" said Stanford University environmental sciences chief Chris Field, who wasn't part of the report.

A United Nations climate panel said in a report on Thursday that divesting from fossil fuels alone won't be enough to limit warming from climate change, adding that issues including deforestation and agriculture must be addressed to drive down greenhouse gas emissions.

Land-surface temperatures have increased nearly twice as much as global average temperatures, the report said, as human activities on land have released more than 20% of global emissions.

Protecting forests that absorb carbon and reforming agricultural practices could play a large role, according to the report.

""Land plays an important role in the climate system,"" Jim Skea, co-chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said in a press release.

""Agriculture, forestry and other types of land use account for 23% of human greenhouse gas emissions,"" he said. ""At the same time natural land processes absorb carbon dioxide equivalent to almost a third of carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels and industry.""
Zeke Hausfather, an analyst will the non-profit research group Berkeley Earth, said it's important to look at the impact of climate change on land separately from global averages because those affect people the most.

""The whole world has warmed by about 1.1 degrees Celsius, 2 degrees Fahrenheit, from the pre-industrial period, but if you look at the land areas they warm about 50% faster,"" he told ABC News, adding that the difference is partly because oceans have a greater capacity to absorb heat.

Berkeley Earth's analysis of land-surface temperatures over the last 250 years have found that those temperatures have increased about 1.5 degrees Celsius in the same time period, with about 0.9 degrees of that occurring in the last 50 years.

Frances Seymour, a senior fellow from the World Resources Institute whose work focuses on forests, said there's a circular relationship between climate change and the health of global land and forests because both release carbon dioxide and capture it.

Destroying forests actually releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and those trees no longer can absorb additional CO2 that otherwise enters the atmosphere, she added.

""Deforestation is a significant part of the problem, but better management of the forests is an even bigger part of the solution,"" she said. ""It's not just the carbon spewed into the air when a forest is converted into something else, it's that lost opportunity to keep that natural carbon-capture-and-storage factory up and running.""
The report also emphasized that people in southern and eastern Asia, northern Africa and the Middle East likely will bear the brunt of the effects from continued depletion of vital water and land resources, according to the summary.

Hausfather said that while most of the focus in the U.S. tends to be on domestic impacts of climate change, countries that emit less greenhouse gas suffer the most as temperatures and sea levels rise.

""One of the big challenges of climate change is the many ways the people who are least responsible for climate change are the most affected,"" he said. ""You can build a sea wall around Manhattan -- it's a lot harder to build one in Bangladesh.""

Thursday's report is part of a series the U.N. plans to produce on climate change in the buildup to a climate summit next month in New York.
Hausfather said warming in the Arctic or Alaska is a better indicator of the impacts of climate change on land, where, he said, some places have seen average temperatures increases as high as 3 or 4 degrees Celsius.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced this week said the temperatures in Alaska this July were the highest on record, almost 5.5 degrees hotter than the average summer month.
Previous reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have raised concerns about the world's progress in meeting the goal set at the Paris Agreement -- limiting warming to 2 degrees Celsius.

An oft-cited report released by a panel of hundreds of scientists last year warned that greenhouse gas emissions needed to be drastically reduced as quickly as possible to limit warming from reaching levels where effects become ""irreversible.""

The last five years have been the warmest in recorded history, according to NOAA. ",0

Seventeen countries -- home to 25% of the global population -- are facing ""extremely high"" water stress, according to the The World Resources Institute, a research non-profit.

Several drought-stricken places around the world have experienced water crises in recent years, with populated cities like Cape Town, Sao Paolo and Chennai inching toward ""Day Zero,"" the day when taps run dry and water is no longer available.
In the 17 countries facing water risk, from India to the Middle East to North Africa, agriculture, industry and municipalities are sucking up 80% of the available surface and groundwater every year, according to WRI's Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas, a tool that ranks water stress, drought risk and riverine flood risk across 189 countries.

This means that even ""small dry shocks,"" which the nonprofit says will likely increase due to climate change, can produce ""dire consequences.""
""Water stress is the biggest crisis no one is talking about,"" WRI president and CEO Dr. Andrew Steer said in a statement. ""Its consequences are in plain sight in the form of food insecurity, conflict and migration, and financial instability.""

The most water-stressed regions on Earth are the Middle East and North Africa, also known as the MENA region, and home to 12 of the 17 at-risk countries. This region could experience the greatest economic losses from climate-related water scarcity, between 6% and 14% of GDP by 2050, the World Bank found.

One possible solution could be to harness the wastewater in this area, 82% of which is not reused to generate a new source of clean water.
India ranks 13th on the Aqueduct list of water-stressed countries, but has more than three times the population of the other 16 countries combined, according to WRI.

While Chennai in southeast India is in danger of its reservoirs drying up, Northern India faces severe groundwater depletion, according to WRI.
""The recent water crisis in Chennai gained global attention, but various areas in India are experiencing chronic water stress as well,” said Shashi Shekhar, former secretary of India’s Ministry of Water Resources and senior fellow of WRI India. ""India can manage its water risk with the help of reliable and robust data pertaining to rainfall, surface and groundwater to develop strategies that strengthen resilience.""
The Indian government is taking critical steps to alleviate the crisis, including placing all water issues -- including supply, drinking water and sanitation -- under one government umbrella. The WRI said the country can also pursue more efficient irrigation, collect and store rainwater, and conserve and restore lakes, floodplains and groundwater recharge areas.
More than a billion people currently live in water-scarce regions, and as many as 3.5 billion could experience water scarcity by 2025, according to WRI. Smaller pockets of extreme water stress even occur in countries with relatively low water stress overall.
Global water crises are stemming from more than just drought. Increasing populations degrade freshwater and coastal aquatic ecosystems, and WRI found that global water withdrawals have more than doubled since the 1960s due to growing demand -- with no signs of slowing down.

Water stress poses threats to human lives, livelihoods and business stability, and it is ""poised to worsen unless countries act,"" according to WRI. ",0

Greenland, home to the world's second largest ice sheet, is melting at such an alarming rate that scientists are warning it's on track with worst-case scenario models for the year 2070.

On Wednesday alone, the island lost 11 billion tons of ice, according to the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI). That's enough water to fill 4,400,000 Olympic-size swimming pools.

Video from science journalist Laurie Garrett went viral, showing melt water gushing under a bridge in Kangerlussiauq, a small town in western Greenland at the eastern end of a deep fjord.This is a roaring glacial melt, under the bridge to Kangerlussiauq, Greenland where it's 22C today and Danish officials say 12 billions tons of ice melted in 24 hours, yesterday. pic.twitter.com/Rl2odG4xWj
Greenland has been enduring the heat wave that last week baked Europe, breaking temperature records in five countries. Now, it is accelerating the annual summer melt of the ice sheet and causing massive ice loss.

""The current melt rate is equivalent to what the model projects for 2070, using the most pessimistic model,"" Xavier Fettweis, a Belgian climate researcher at the University of Liège, said.
There is ice melt every year in the Arctic with slightly warmer months. But temperatures across the ice sheet have reached above freezing, even climbing into the 70's Fahrenheit on parts of the coast, and warmer winter months mean that the ice is less likely to recover.

Since June, 240 billion tons of ice have melted, per DMI. In comparison, 290 billion tons were lost in all of 2018, and August, the last month in peak melting season, has just begun. Melting season also began a month earlier than usual this year, according to DMI.
Scientists are noticing that these kinds of heat waves are becoming ""more and more frequent,"" Marco Tedesco, a polar scientist specializing in Greenland for the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University in New York, told ABC News in June. At the time, another pocket of air led to clear skies and therefore more solar radiation, baking the eastern part of Greenland and melting 2 billion tons of the ice sheet.
While that melt was shocking, it pales in comparison to the one on Wednesday, as evident in the chart above.

Researchers believe these events are connected to the jet stream, or polar vortex, becoming less stable, which creates high-pressure systems that can be sustained for longer periods of time and leads to the ""exceptional melting,"" Tedesco said.
A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in April found that the melting of the Greenland ice sheet has contributed to more than a half-inch of rising ocean waters since 1972, making it the largest contributor of new water into the ocean every year.

The warming has accelerated so much in recent years that about a quarter inch of the additional water occurred in the last eight years, the study found.
On average, the Greenland ice sheet produces about 270 gigatons of discharge in the oceans per year, Tedesco said. Since 2003, the ice sheet has contributed about 10 millimeters over the last 15 years, and scientists expect that number to increase as the earth continues to warm, which would equate to about a 1 meter sea rise by the end of the century, said Martin Stendel, senior climate and arctic researcher with DMI.

President Donald Trump has continually cast doubt on the science behind climate change and rather than address it, has relaxed environmental regulations and withdrawn the U.S. from the Paris climate accord.

During the Arctic Summit in April, his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo heralded the melting of the sea ice as an economic opportunity: ""Steady reductions in sea ice are opening new passageways and new opportunities for trade,"" he said during a speech on the sidelines of the summit in Finland. ""Arctic sea lanes could come before -- could [become] the 21st Century Suez and Panama Canals.""

Pompeo was scheduled to visit Greenland, but he canceled hours before to fly back to Washington for White House meetings.",0

A teen from Ireland may have found the solution to rid world's oceans from the microplastics that are near impossible to remove.

Fionn Ferreira, 18, designed a new method for the extraction of microplastics, or particles of plastic less than 5 millimeters in diameter, as part of the Google Science Fair, an online competition open to students between the ages of 13 and 18.
The procedure, inspired by an article written by physicist Arden Warner, involves using non-toxic iron oxide to clean up oil spills, according to Ferreira's project study. When he tested the method on water containing a known concentration of microplastics, the plastic particles migrated into the oil phase, and the fluid was able to be removed using strong magnets, he wrote in his project synopsis.

He first produced microplastics to remove from the water and then extracted them using his method. Ten of the most common microplastics were used for the experiment.
Ferreira concluded that his extraction method would remove 85% to 92% of microplastics in samples. The next step would be to scale the project up to an industrial level, he said.

""From this I can conclude that using magnetite with a minimum of oil forms a viable method for the extraction of microplastics,"" he wrote.
Ferreira won the science fair's grand prize -- a $50,000 scholarship fund -- for his project.

""I am so proud to have been named the winner of the 2018-2019 Google Science Fair,"" he wrote, adding that the experience allowed him to meet several scientists and engineers associated with Google.
Ferreira was inspired to launch the project after growing up near the shore in West Cork, Ireland, where he became ""increasingly aware of plastic pollution of the oceans,"" he said.

""I was alarmed to find out how many microplastics enter our [wastewater] system and consequently the oceans,"" he wrote. ""This inspired me to try and find out a way to try and remove microplastics from water before they even reached the sea.""
Because he lives in such a remote area, he had to build his own equipment and lab to conduct tests and experiments, he said. On his website, Ferreria describes himself as not only a scientist but a musician, gardener, educator, entrepreneur and innovator.

Scientists have found microplastics in the furthest reaches of the ocean, from the deepest waters of the Mariana Trench to the Arctic and Antarctic, and the entire marine ecosystem is contaminated, researchers say. Plastic typically ends up in oceans through rivers after it is washed down drains by rainwater or blown by wind into bodies of water that flow into rivers and ultimately into the ocean.
Since it is extremely difficult to remove plastic -- especially microplastics -- from open ocean water, experts have leaned toward prevention -- such as transforming industry standards, consumer habits and beach cleanups -- as the solution to mitigate the snowballing amount of plastic dumped into the ocean each.

Ferreria's method may provide environmentalists a way to clean wastewater of the tiniest particles of plastics that never break down and remain in the water indefinitely.
Ferreira said it is ""essential to find efficient and effective ways of extracting microplastics from wastewaters"" before they reach the oceans.

""There is no doubt that the most effective way to reduce microplastic pollution in oceans is to use less plastics and ensure that plastics used can be recycled and separated to prevent them from entering our wastewater, but the reality is that more and more of the products we use contain plastics and potentially degrade into microplastics before entering our wastewater,"" he said.",0

Researchers and members of the Icelandic community will commemorate the first lost glacier with a plaque and memorial service at the site where it once stood.

The Okjökull Glacier in Borgarfjörður, West Iceland, lost its glacier status in 2014 after it significantly melted down, according to Rice University in Houston. Now, as ""dead ice,"" the former glacier is simply known as ""Ok.""
A century ago, the glacier covered 5.8 squire miles of mountainside and measured in at 164 feet thick, but has since shrunk down to about .39 square miles and 49 feet thick, according to The Guardian.

On Aug. 18, scientists will join Icelandic author Andri Snær Magnason, geologist Oddur Sigurðsson -- the glaciologist who first declared Okjökull as ""dead"" -- and the Icelandic Hiking Society to present the monument to citizens, according to Rice University.
Magnason authored the text on the plaque, which, ""This monument is to acknowledge that we know what is happening and what needs to be done. Only you know if we did it.""
The former glacier was the subject of 2018 documentary ""Not Ok,"" in which anthropologists Cymene Howe and Dominic Boyer said that scientists fear all of Iceland's 400-plus glaciers will be gone by 2220.
The plaque is the first monument dedicated to a glacier lost to climate change, Howe said in a statement. The group behind it wanted to created a ""lasting memorial"" to the glacier, hoping it will raise awareness about the rapid decline of Iceland's glaciers, she said.
""By marking Ok’s passing, we hope to draw attention to what is being lost as Earth’s glaciers expire,"" she said. ""These bodies of ice are the largest freshwater reserves on the planet and frozen within them are histories of the atmosphere. They are also often important cultural forms that are full of significance.""

There are more than 100 bills that still need to be voted on before Oregon’s legislative session ends this week, but it’s not clear that any of the Senate’s Republicans are going to show up.

The Oregon Senate Republicans walked out last week over a scheduled vote on a bill relating to climate change regulations, and they haven’t come back since.

The Senate’s 11 Republicans went into hiding -- with rampant speculation about their whereabouts – in and effort to bust the state-mandated quorum that is required to hold votes. Of the Senate’s current 29 members, 20 have to be present to vote. When the 11 Republicans left, that left only 18 senators dealing with the pending votes, and therefore, not enough to move forward.

""We've heard rumors all over the place,"" Rick Osborn, the communications director for the Oregon Senate Majority office, said of the Republicans whereabouts. ""We've heard Idaho. We’ve heard Montana. We’ve heard Washington. I think I heard about somebody in California. I don’t know if they’re together or separate but they appear to be out of the state.""

The idea of simply walking out of the job in order to prevent a vote is not actually new to these senators, as they pulled a similar stunt in April.
Osborn said that the Republicans walked out over an education bill in April, but there were enough Democratic votes to pass the measure without bipartisan support. But in order to avoid a similar incident unfolding, Osborn said that both sides struck a deal not to flee the state.
""They gave us their word at that point that they would not do this again and in exchange we lost a piece of legislation that had to do with gun safety and a piece of legislation that had to do with vaccines,"" Osborn said.

That deal apparently fell apart, and now Osborn said that there are more than 100 bills that still need to be voted on before the legislative session ends at midnight on Sunday.
Among the outstanding bills are budgets for the education and forestry departments, which Osborn warned is particularly troubling ahead of the summer and forest fire season.
The bill that allegedly prompted the most recent walkout – H.B. 2020 – is essentially done, with the Senate president saying this week ""that particular bill does not have a path forward"" because there were not enough votes among Democrats to have it pass without other support.
Osborn said that he assumes that negotiations between Senate Republicans and Democratic leadership is continuing -- including the state’s Democratic Gov. Kate Brown who issued a stern statement on the issue Tuesday.

""This is not the Oregon Way and cannot be rewarded,"" Brown said in her statement. ""The Republicans are driving us away from the values that Oregonians hold dear, and are moving us dangerously close to the self-serving stalemate in Washington, D.C.""

The Oregon Senate Republican caucus did not immediately respond to an ABC News request for a comment about the walkout.

For Osborn, the issue is not only one mired in frustration over elected officials ""running from a vote you don’t like,"" but also the fact that they tried to avoid this.

""When they came back [in April] we gave up a couple of bills and they gave their word they wouldn’t do this again, and they did this again,"" he said.

A group of Republican state senators in Oregon remain in hiding after walking out of the state Capitol over refusing to vote on a climate change bill.

Eleven Republicans refused to show up to work on Thursday and went into hiding in protest of HB2020, a bill that establishes a carbon cap, in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Industries that emit carbon dioxide -- power plants, manufacturers, etc. -- would have to buy an ""allowance"" for each metric ton emitted, thereby reducing the incentive to produce carbon dioxide in the first place.

The goal of the bill is to cut greenhouse gas emissions 80% by 2050 versus 1990 numbers.

But the purchasing of allowances would likely mean costs are passed down to the consumers, and prices for gas or diesel would increase -- a position untenable for the Republicans holding out from a vote. Rural Oregonians, who drive longer distances, and farmers, who use heavy machinery, would likely be disproportionately affected.
Without a quorum, the legislature cannot legally vote on the bill.

The stalemate continued into the weekend.

""I don't think you're going to see us anytime soon,"" Republican Sen. Herman Baertschiger Jr, the state Senate's minority leader, told Portland ABC affiliate KATU by phone Saturday evening.
The senators are being fined $500 per day as they skip out on work.

A GoFundMe account was started to raise money to pay off the absentee politicians' fines, which had raised over $37,000 in two days as of Saturday night. State ethics laws prevent the senators from accepting the money, however, unless the donations are tracked through the government's filing system, called Orestar.
""Public servants are chosen by and entrusted to represent their constituents, and working for the people of Oregon is an honor and a privilege,"" Kate Kondayen, deputy communications director for Oregon Gov. Kate Brown, said in a statement Tuesday as legislators threatened the walkout. ""Playing games and avoiding tough conversations is a dereliction of that responsibility and trust.""

""Governor Brown has always dealt fairly and transparently with the Senate Republicans, and trusted them when they gave their word they wouldn’t engage in further walkouts earlier this session,"" Kondayen continued. ""She expects them to honor their word and if not is prepared to call upon those resources available to her -- including authorizing state troopers to bring senators back to the Capitol and, if necessary, calling legislators back to Salem to complete their work over the summer.""

GOP senators walked out earlier in the legislative session over an education funding bill, but that impasse was quickly broken when Democrats agreed to kill two other bills, according to KATU.
State troopers were indeed searching for the senators on Friday and Saturday, Brown said.

They were unlikely to find state Sen. Tim Knopp, who told KATU on Friday he was not even in Oregon anymore.
""I am in a cabin near a lake,"" Knopp said during a Facebook video chat interview. ""And that's about all I can tell you.""

The 11 senators who are MIA include Baertschiger, Cliff Bentz, Brian Boquist, Fred Girod, Bill Hansell, Dallas Heard, Knopp, Dennis Linthicum, Alan Olsen, Chuck Thomsen and Kim Thatcher.
Knopp criticized Democrats calling for their return in an interview with KATU, saying they were ""hypocritical"" due to a walkout staged by House Democrats over a redistricting bill in 2001. Brown, who was Senate minority leader at the time, called those actions ""very appropriate"" in an interview with The Associated Press.

The walkout got even stranger on Friday, when Democratic state Sen. Elizabeth Steiner Hayward tweeted a text message she had received, saying, ""The Senate will not be meeting tomorrow (Saturday). The State Police Superintendent just informed the Senate President of a credible threat from militia groups coming to the Capitol tomorrow.""

No such militia showed up on Saturday, but the Capitol hallways were empty.

Democratic senators, at least, planned to return to the Capitol on Sunday.",0

An unusual warming pattern has caused the Greenland ice sheet to melt at ""unusual,"" potentially record-breaking rates, causing it to dump even more water into the already-rising ocean, experts told ABC News.

The weather has been so warm -- up to 59 degrees Fahrenheit above the mean in some areas -- that 2 billion tons of the ice sheet melted on just June 13, according to Polar Portal, a website run by the Danish Meteorological Institute, which monitors the ice and climate in the arctic based on scientific models.Yesterday (13th June), we calculate #Greenland #icesheet lost more than 2 Gt (2 km³) of ice,, melt was widespread but didn't quite get to #SummitCamp which was just below 0°CThe high melt is unusual so early in the season but not unprecedentedhttps://t.co/Ftg0fkC7AK pic.twitter.com/Y4jQ1FoFRZ
In addition, the warming season began about a month earlier than usual, DMI announced last month.
The warm temperatures on June 13 and 14 resulted from a pocket of air that led to clear skies and persisted for a long period of time over the eastern portion of Greenland, said Marco Tedesco, a polar scientist specializing in Greenland for the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University in New York.

The clear skies created more solar radiation, which heated the ice sheet and promoted the melting, Tedesco told ABC News.

Scientists are noticing that these events are becoming ""more and more frequent,"" Tedesco said. Researchers believe it is connected to the jet stream, or polar vortex, becoming less stable, which creates high-pressure systems that can be sustained for longer periods of time and leads to the ""exceptional melting,"" Tedesco said.

Last week, the temperatures were ""very warm,"" even for summer, which hasn't yet started in the region, said Martin Stendel, senior climate and arctic researcher for the Danish Meteorological Institute.

About 40% to 45% of the ice sheet was melting on the hottest days, a new record for that time period, Tedesco said.News from @ZERO74N : The 15th of June is the long term average date for 50 % #snowcover in the central part of the #Zackenberg Valley (1998-2017). While last year it was still around 100 %, this year all snow was gone on this date. Imagery data from #sentinel #Greenland pic.twitter.com/kB2VEm9Yek
A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in April found that the melting of the Greenland ice sheet has contributed to more than a half-inch of rising ocean waters since 1972, making it the largest contributor of new water into the ocean every year.

The warming has accelerated so much in recent years that about a quarter inch of the additional water occurred in the last eight years, the study found.

On average, the Greenland ice sheet produces about 270 gigatons of discharge in the oceans per year, Tedesco said. Since 2003, the ice sheet has contributed about 10 millimeters over the last 15 years, and scientists expect that number to increase as the earth continues to warm, which would equate to about a 1 meter sea rise by the end of the century, Stendel said.
About 40% of Greenland experienced ""unusual"" melting as a result of the unseasonably warm temperatures, which included a considerable amount of sea ice, according to DMI.

A photo taken by Danish Meteorological Institute climate scientist Steffen Olsen on June 13 shows dogs running across the sea ice in northwest Greenland, the surface of which had melted, making it appear as if they were running on water.
The water remained on top due to the rapid melt and few cracks in the ice, so there was nowhere for it to go, Stendel said.

The sea ice is more than a meter thick, which made it ""perfectly safe"" for the researchers to cross, he added.

The warming season in 2012 set the record for the amount of melting in the ice sheet, according to experts. That year, melting reached more than 90 percent of the ice sheet and continued past the typical peak of high pressure from July through August, Tedesco said.

In 2012, the high-pressure system also began in April, which promoted more solar radiation and triggered a melt at the beginning of the season, Tedesco said.

The Greenland ice sheet contributed about twice the amount of water into the ocean that year, Tedesco said. While the record for the largest-ever melting was set that year, there is a possibility that 2019 could beat it, Stendel said.
The ice sheet formed from thousands of years of snow layers accumulating on top of each other, Tedesco said. The weight of the top layer of snow would cause the snow below to begin expelling air, compressing the ice and making it denser.

Not only does that process take thousands of years, but it requires that the snow deposits do not melt in the warming season, Tedesco said.
An abundance of snowfall during the winter months not only adds to the mass of the ice sheet, but also makes it brighter, which reflects the sun more and acts as a ""blanket"" for the ice, Tedesco said. This can slow down the melting in the warming season.

However, if the snow goes through multiple melting and freezing cycles, such as what happened in the past week, it transforms into ""metamorphous snow,"" which tends to absorb more solar energy and causes the ice to melt sooner, Tedesco said.

This past winter did not see a lot of snowfall, according to Tedesco.
The rapidly rising sea levels are important to note, not only in terms of the next century but perhaps in the next decade or two, Tedesco said.

The sea levels surrounding New York City have been rising at around 3 millimeters per year, Tedesco said.

For example, if someone were to stand in the Hudson River in New York City where the water barely covered his or her feet in 1871, that same area of water would now come up past knee-level, Tedesco said.
Scientists expect the rising sea levels to exacerbate weather events such as storm surge, tides, rain and precipitation, Tedesco said.

One thing people should be especially aware of is the permafrost located in the northern arctic regions, particularly Canada and Siberia, that is trapping greenhouses gases, Stendel said. If temperatures rise more than 10 degrees in the arctic, the permafrost will become unstable and could release the greenhouse gases.

While this may not affect the frequency of strong storms, such as hurricanes, each individual storm could become stronger because warm air can carry more water vapor than cold air, Stendel said.

In addition, people should expect more of what is already occurring -- wet regions will get more wet, and dry regions will become drier, Stendel said.

Since a large portion of world's population live near coastlines, this could -- and already has -- lead to deaths and billions of dollars in damage, Tedesco said. ",0

The Environmental Protection Agency finalized its replacement for Obama's signature climate policy on Wednesday with a rule officials say will still reduce greenhouse gas emissions but critics say is not aggressive enough to slow the effects of climate change.

The Clean Power Plan, which never went into effect, was a signature policy proposed by President Barack Obama to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change. The policy would have required states to submit extensive plans on how they would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by requiring power plants to install new technology or switching to more renewable energy sources.

But under President Donald Trump, the agency says the Clean Power Plan went too far by trying to shut down coal-fired power plants.
The replacement, called the Affordable Clean Energy rule, would make it easier for the facility to stay open by letting states set their own goals on targets to reduce releases of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. States can choose from a list of EPA-approved options to improve existing coal-fired power plants, a provision that critics say could make it easier for utilities to keep the facilities open instead of moving to cleaner energy sources and eliminating the use of fossil fuels.

A senior EPA official says the list of technologies approved by the agency does not include carbon capture or technologies to capture and store carbon, because the agency found it was not cost effective. The official said EPA would reject state plans that propose using carbon capture to comply with the ACE rule but that doesn’t stop facilities from using the technology on their own or states from requiring it under state law.
Administration officials said the announcement fulfills one of President Donald Trump's campaign promises to repeal the Clean Power Plan, which they say went out of EPA's authority to close down coal-fired power plants.

""This is another example of the president doing exactly what he said he would do when he ran for office,"" White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said Wednesday.

""We can't deny the fact that fossil fuels will continue to be part of the energy mix both at home and abroad,"" Wheeler said, adding that it will help the U.S. develop new ""cleaner coal"" technologies.
Democrats and environmental activists have called for the government to take a more aggressive role in combating climate change, including reducing the use of fossil fuels and drastically reducing emissions of CO2.

The EPA says its proposal would reduce greenhouse gas emissions more than the original Clean Power Plan when compared to 2005 levels, but former EPA officials who worked on that plan say that the Trump administration can't take credit for those reductions. Many utility companies have made the decision to close coal-fired power plants in favor of cheaper options, such as natural gas, and critics of Trump's EPA argue the reductions would be even more dramatic if the government pursued harsher regulations.

""To the extent that the agency is either explicitly or implicitly, through its analysis, taking credit for reductions that are occurring as a result of private sector business decisions, that represents a kind of abdication of responsibility on the part of EPA,"" Joe Goffman, former EPA administrator for climate under Obama told reporters on Monday.
Former EPA administrator Gina McCarthy said the rule is essentially toothless and that more aggressive regulations are needed to dramatically reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change.

""I believe this is the first rule in EPA’s history that acknowledges the existential threat of climate change but by the agency’s own admission does absolutely nothing to stop it,"" she said in a statement.

""The Trump administration has made painfully clear that they are incapable of rising to the challenge and tackling this crisis.""

Under Trump, the EPA has also discounted the benefits of the Clean Power Plan that would reduce other kinds of pollution like tiny particles that contribute to smog. The requirements proposed in the original plan would have required new technology on coal-fired power plants that limit all kinds of pollution but the EPA now says that goes outside the scope of a rule intended to limit carbon dioxide emissions and is covered separately under more specific rules.

Democrats and environmental groups will likely challenge the rule in court. States will have three years to submit their plans to reduce carbon emissions and EPA will have another year to review and approve the plans. ",0

Only three states in the U.S. have passed laws banning single-use plastic bags as the global war on plastic production and waste continues to escalate, a new study reveals.

Plastic bags, when discarded, clog sewage and storm drains plus entangle and kill an estimated 100,000 marine animals annually, according to a study released on Wednesday by Reuse This Bag, which makes custom reusable grocery and shopping bags.

The average plastic bag is used for 12 minutes, and
shoppers collectively use about 500 billion single-use bags each year, which averages out to about 150 bags per person, according to the study.
""Luckily, we’re starting to see communities around the U.S., and the world, mobilize to reduce waste by banning, taxing, or otherwise limiting the use of these plastic bags,"" the study states.
California, Hawaii and New York have all banned plastic bags on a statewide level.

California's ban took effect in 2016, according to The Associated Press. It bans all single-use bags at large retailers and imposes a 10-cent charge for paper bags, according to the study.
While a state-mandated ban has not been issued in Hawaii, all of the state's counties ban plastic bags but generally still allow for use of 100% recyclable bags, the study states.

New York passed its statewide ban on single-use plastic bags in March, but it doesn't go into effect until March 1, 2020. Individual counties in the Empire State will also have the option of charging 5 cents per paper bag.

Four states -- Delaware, Maine, Rhode Island and New York -- have mandatory recycling or reuse programs in place.
Ten states, including Arizona, Florida, Iowa, Idaho, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi and Wisconsin, have passed preemptive bans on banning plastic bags, according to the study, which drew on pubic information from the National Conference of State Legislators as well as state-level and country-level reports.

About 200 U.S. municipalities have banned or taxed plastic bags, which has had largely positive outcomes, according to the study.

Washington, D.C., imposed a 5-cent tax on all single-use plastic bags after studies found them to be the single largest source of pollution in local waterways, the study said.
San Jose, California, has seen an 89% reduction of plastic bags in storm drains, a 60% reduction in rivers and a 59% reduction in residential areas since a ban was put into place in 2012, according to the study.

In Seattle, the study says a 48% reduction of plastic bags in residential waste and a 76% reduction in commercial waste has occurred since the ban took place in 2014. In 2010, there were 262 tons of plastic bags in landfills, but that number had dropped to 136 tons in 2014, the study states.

Elsewhere in the world, 32 countries have passed laws banning plastic bags, according to study. Nearly half of those countries are located in Africa, where plastic bags frequently clog drains, leading to increased mosquito swarms and the spread of malaria.

In Kenya, making, selling or importing plastic bags could land the perpetrator a fine of up to $19,000 and four years in jail, according to the study.

A full ban on plastic bags was adopted in China in 2008, leading to a reduction of about 40 billion bags. India passed its ban in 2002.",0

This is an Inside Science story.

(Inside Science) -- If the world were on track to meet the Paris Agreement goal of less than 2 degrees Celsius of global warming, methane levels in the atmosphere would theoretically be dropping. Instead, they have been rising since 2007, and shooting up even faster since 2014. A perspective published today in the journal Science discusses the potential causes and consequences of our planet's out-of-control methane.

Methane decays in the atmosphere faster than carbon dioxide does, but it is a far more powerful greenhouse gas. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, a molecule of methane will cause 28-36 times more warming than a molecule of carbon dioxide over a 100-year period. Recent data shows that methane concentrations in the atmosphere have risen from about 1,775 parts per billion in 2006 to 1,850 parts per billion in 2017.
The emissions targets in the Paris Agreement were based largely on data from the 1990s and early 2000s, when methane levels were flatter, said Sara Mikaloff Fletcher, a climate scientist with New Zealand's National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research in Wellington and first author of the new article. The only emissions scenario that achieves Paris Agreement goals in climate models assumes that methane levels have been declining since 2010, when in fact they have been rising since 2007, she said. There may be other ways of keeping climate change under 2 degrees Celsius, but they would involve compensating for rising methane with more drastic cuts to other greenhouse gases.
Scientists aren't sure why methane levels are rising. A 2017 study attributes about half of the increase to cows and other ruminant livestock, which burp methane as they digest food. Another contributing factor could be that people are releasing more fossil fuel emissions while burning less wood and other biomass.
In Mikaloff Fletcher's view, the most alarming possibilities are the ones we have little control over. Rising temperatures could be triggering wetlands to release more methane, and changes in atmospheric chemistry could be slowing the rate at which methane breaks down.

Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, in unveiling phase three of his Democratic presidential candidacy's climate agenda, has an eye cast towards the global stage - and is looking to reimagine American foreign policy through the lens of combating climate change.

“The United States and the world stand at a crossroads unlike any we have encountered before,” Inslee said in a statement on Wednesday. “Within the next decade, either inaction will set in motion a worsening global climate crisis that will lead to devastation, or our nation and the world will respond decisively to build a modern, green and just global economic future. The choice is ours.”

He detailed his policy during a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, on World Environment Day – and timed close to the anniversary of President Trump pulling America out of the Paris Climate Accord.

Climate change is emerging as one of the 2020 election cycle’s most pressing issues. This weekend many in the Democratic presidential field, including Inslee, will descend upon Iowa to campaign – those events will include calls to highlight the perils of climate change and the importance of action.
A recent poll conducted by Harvard Institute of Politics of young people, ages 18 to 29, found a substantial 14-point increase from the same poll they conducted in 2015 in those who said they believed ""government should do more to curb climate change, even at the expense of economic growth.""

Inslee, supported by a number of other 2020 presidential contenders, pushed for the Democratic National Committee to dedicate one of its presidential primary debates to the issue of climate change completely and he even wrote a letter to the DNC Chairman Tom Perez urging the party to ""ensure that the climate crisis is on the agenda."" However Wednesday, Inslee said that the DNC informed him it will not hold a separate debate on the issue. He said his campaign was told that the DNC will bar him from future debate should he participate in any other organization's climate change debate.

""...While climate change is at the top of our list, the DNC will not be holding entire debates on a single issue area because we want to make sure voters have the ability to hear from candidates on dozens of issues of importance to American voters,"" DNC Communications Director Xochitl Hinojosa said in a statement.

This decision comes as a flashpoint amongst the Democratic field and amid a furious push from progressives and environmentalists, as well as strong support across the Democratic spectrum, for climate change to be front and center in the minds of voters and on the debate stage.
Inslee squarely targeted President Trump for his ""cowardly path of ignorance,"" and ""foreign policy based on isolationism and xenophobia,"" and challenging America to lead by example on the vanguard of climate science.
“This is the defining challenge of our time. If anyone thinks of us 100 years from now - we will be judged on this issue,” Inslee told the small crowd on Wednesday.

Inslee’s latest rollout came on the heels of former Vice President Joe Biden’s first climate policy rollout on Tuesday during which he called for a ""clean energy revolution and environmental justice"" in his new proposal to address ""the climate disaster facing the nation and our world.""

The most progressive wings of the Democratic party when it comes to climate change – chief among them, Inslee – have voiced criticism for what they view as Biden’s middle of the road stance.

“I have to express disappointment that the Vice President's proposals really lack teeth, they lack the ambition that is necessary to defeat the climate crisis,” Inslee said reacting to Biden’s rollout, contrasting Biden’s plan with his own.

“My plan puts up stop signs, and I’m afraid the vice president's plan does not. He has some wishes for thirty years from now, but we can't wait thirty years.”

It's not the first time Inslee has called out Biden for what he sees as a middle-of-the-road stance on climate: when Inslee unveiled the second leg of his climate plan in mid-May, he named Biden directly, saying that he needed to ""step up his game.""
The latest portion of Inslee's plan rests on five tenets, meant to flow from the domestic examples that the U.S. would set under his administration, detailed in his first two portions of his proposal. This latest phase focuses on rejoining and expanding several commitments the U.S. has previously made in the international arena, including the Paris Accord - additionally, phasing out coal, and advancing international efforts to slash super pollutants like methane and black carbon.

It rejects the notion of “freedom gas” as put forth by the Trump Administration - promoting U.S. fossil fuels abroad - as well as forging more collaboration with sustainable land use, ocean conservation and clean air - addressing the fluidity of what knows no border lines: water, and the air we breathe.

Inslee also emphasizes studying the impact and treating the cause of climate migration including pledging to increase the number of refugees resettled by the U.S.; including enforceable climate and labor standards for new trade agreements; doubling the investment the U.S. will make in the Global Climate fund previously pledged by the Obama Administration, which President Trump's pulled out of; cutting fossil fuel subsidies as well as considering targeting climate deniers overseas with anti-corruption laws.

Other candidates’ plans also echo the need for America to reassume responsibility on the world stage – rejoining the Paris Accord – as well as investing in clean energy infrastructures. Former Vice President Biden’s also aims to make the U.S. a 100% clean energy economy, reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. Former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke’s asks similar with a goal of being halfway there by 2030. His four-pillar, $5 trillion plan would use executive and legislative action to “transform” the nation’s infrastructure and “empower our people and communities to lead the climate fight,” according to the campaign.

Biden also addresses “environmental justice,” holding polluters, like fossil fuel companies, to account for environmental damage. He has vowed to reject fossil fuel money – though has yet to sign the No Fossil Fuel Money pledge.

As climate weighs more heavily as an issue in the 2020 campaign, it likewise becomes more fraught – an ideological tug-o-war putting pressure on politicians to ante up a cohesive policy; more ‘progressive’ notions from candidates and organizations like Greenpeace alike now seem to move the needle forward.

Experts agree that plans from Inslee and O’Rourke are significant motivators for more middling candidates who don’t want to get left standing out as the lone conservative.

“I think we’re seeing a lot of one-upmanship across the span of candidates with climate,” Dana R. Fisher, a professor whose work centers on understanding the relationship between environmentalism and democracy - most recently, studying activism and American climate politics.

“This is the first time that climate is legitimately going to be an issue on the campaign - and, candidates are now starting to realize that it may, in fact, be a voting issue. I think we’re about to see a tipping point - people like Gov. Inslee are on the vanguard - he’s pushing the conversation to the left, he’s making others look mainstream - and his position is being reinforced by polling data.”

Climate change may seem like a problem for modern times, but a new museum exhibit argues we can learn a lot about the climate today by studying ancient history.

The Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History is set to open it's newly updated Hall of Fossils this weekend for the first time in five years. The new exhibit is the first of it's kind, in a way, because it focuses on how to connect what scientists know about the past climate from paleontology to the challenges of climate change today.

The Hall of Fossils has specimens ranging from a towering mastodon at the entrance to a frond from a palm tree found in Alaska that has been dated back about 50 million years.
Scott Wing, the curator of plant fossils at the museum, said that it's relatively new for paleontologists to focus on how their research can contribute to the current debate on Earth's climate and the possible consequences of human influence on the environment.

""The take-home message is that the past can give us a sense of how the planet works and how the planet may change under our influence,"" he said on Tuesday. ""And We’re quite open about the fact that humans are now changing this planet faster then it’s almost ever been changed in our history.""
The Smithsonian Institution is partially a government entity and partially a private institution, but Kirk Johnson, director for the Museum of Natural History, said the Smithsonian tries to stay ""fanatically apolitical"" and that political leadership of the U.S. government doesn't influence the content of any exhibits.
Johnson also said that David H. Koch, who donated $35 million for the new exhibit, had no role on the details or the subject matter.

""It's really the scientists working with exhibit teams that build the content of the hall and and it became very clear even before we started this exhibit that the climate is a very important through line in the history of life on Earth and that, not only is that the case but that climate actually from deep time climate gives us some perspectives that are deeply relevant to today's climate crisis,"" he said Tuesday.

The Hall of Fossils at the Museum of Natural History opens this Saturday, June 8.
