"All this week, the mainstream media have been trying to scare you with heartrending tales of burning Amazonia — a conflagration the like of which we have never seen before. Supposedly…

A Washington Post story headlined ‘Bolsonaro, Trump, and the nationalists ignoring climate disaster’ quotes Vitor Gomes, an environmental scientist at the Federal University of Para:

“I cannot remember any other big fire episode like this one.”

According to the BBC:

Brazil’s Amazon rainforest has seen a record number of fires this year, new space agency data suggests. The National Institute for Space Research (Inpe) said its satellite data showed an 84% increase on the same period in 2018.

According to NPR:

Half the fires in Brazil so far this year, nearly 36,000 of them, have ignited in just the past month. That’s nearly as many as in all of 2018.https://t.co/bphNHVcqcX — NPR (@NPR) August 22, 2019

According to this recidivist enviro-loon activist:

From a scientist who specializes in prehistorical fire in the Amazon: The current fires are without precedent in the past 20,000 years. These fires are not natural, they are being driven by greed, colonialism, and are a crime against humanity. We are in a climate emergency. https://t.co/ooGHlqb9Ua — Eric Holthaus (@EricHolthaus) August 22, 2019

The fires have spawned a hashtag — #PrayforAmazonia — and attracted the inevitable display of competitive virtue-signalling from the wankerati, with Jennifer Lopez, Madonna, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Kris Jenner among those eagerly expressing their concern on social media.

Politicians have jumped on the bandwagon too:

Our house is burning. Literally. The Amazon rain forest – the lungs which produces 20% of our planet’s oxygen – is on fire. It is an international crisis. Members of the G7 Summit, let’s discuss this emergency first order in two days! #ActForTheAmazon pic.twitter.com/dogOJj9big — Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron) August 22, 2019

But almost everything you have read or heard about the Amazon fires in the mainstream media is #FakeNews.

Like so many of the environmental scare stories which grip the world’s media periodically, it is a panic which has been deliberately and cynically stoked by left-leaning eco-activist groups for a number of purposes:

To generate public hysteria in order to precipitate expensive and unnecessary government action which no sober cost benefit analysis could ever justify To raise ‘awareness’ — and, by extension, money — for the green cause To discredit conservatives, especially those who are properly sceptical of the green agenda, such as President Trump and his Brazilian counterpart Jair Bolsonaro To reinforce in the popular imagination the notion that economic growth and expressions of national sovereignty — in this case the interests of Brazilian farmers — are intrinsically bad for the environment To promulgate the common received idea that the Amazon is the ‘lungs of the planet’ and therefore sacrosanct and inviolable in much the same manner as polar bears, glaciers, Pacific islands, the Great Barrier Reef, etc. To lend false credibility to the global left’s claim that the planet is experiencing a #ClimateEmergency To invoke the spectre of the Green New Deal and, by extension, to rain on the parade of Trump 2020 To exploit the mainstream media’s insatiable demand for environmental scare stories, especially in the August “silly season” when there’s a shortage of real news

Here is the truth about the Amazon fires:

The fires are mainly on agricultural land – not virgin rain forest…

Turns out the Amazon Rain Forest fires aren’t exactly as advertised. Read for yourself: fires are mainly in agricultural areas as farmers prepare their land for planting. The land was cleared in the past. https://t.co/j8MXX8XWIH pic.twitter.com/hxhuxDZbeP — Ryan Maue (@RyanMaue) August 24, 2019

There is nothing abnormal about this fire season

To everyone concerned about the future of the Amazon: sensationalizing the current fire season in the Amazon will not help keep it from burning.

So, it appears: * Fire close to average from 2003-2018. (Period of MODIS operation.)

* Fire highest since 2012. Graphs and discussion in that article I linked leave out fires from 2003-2011. Presumably, there were big fires sometimes between 2003-2011. — lucia liljegren (@lucialiljegren) August 24, 2019

The Amazon rainforest does NOT produce 20 per cent of the world’s oxygen (h/t Dennis Ambler)

From a 2014 New York Times article by Nadine Unger, Assistant Professor of Atmospheric Chemistry at Yale:

Moreover, it is a myth that photosynthesis controls the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere. Even if all photosynthesis on the planet were shut down, the atmosphere’s oxygen content would change by less than 1 percent. The Amazon rain forest is often perceived as the lungs of the planet.



In fact, almost all the oxygen the Amazon produces during the day remains there and is reabsorbed by the forest at night. In other words, the Amazon rain forest is a closed system that uses all its own oxygen and carbon dioxide.

It wasn’t always rainforest… (h/t Dennis Ambler)

From a 2008 article ‘Brazil: Ancient Amazon Actually Highly Urbanised’

Using satellite imagery, scientists have discovered the remains of once densely populated towns in west Brazil, an area that was thought to be virgin forest. The report in Friday’s edition of the journal Science describes clusters of towns and smaller villages that were connected by complex road networks and were arranged around large central plazas. Researches also discovered signs of farming, wetland management and fish farms in the ancient settlements that are now almost completely covered by rainforest. As Professor Philip Stott, Emeritus Professor BioGeography at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, wrote in 2003: At the end of the last ice age – some 12,000 to 18,000 years ago – the tropics were covered by seasonal savannah grassland, cooler and much drier than now. There were no rain forests in the Malay Peninsula and much of Amazonia, and, despite the increasing human development of forest space, there are still more rain forests persisting than existed then. Whatever the world’s greenies say, there is no adamantine rule that Brazil — or its neighbours — must stay rain forested in perpetuity.",1
"False Alarm: Amazon Burning Is Mostly Farms, Not Forests

Problematic deforestation continues, but the “lungs of the earth” are still breathing.

“A picture is worth a thousand words” is one of the dumbest aphorisms ever coined. Speaking as a former television producer, I’d say a picture takes a thousand words to explain. Take this much-circulated NASA satellite photo showing vast smoke plumes over the Amazon region:

Combined with a report from the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research that says the agency had detected 39,194 fires in the region, a 77 percent jump up from the same period in 2018, that picture has launched alarmed headlines around the world.

“Amazon rainforest is burning at an unprecedented rate,” declares CNN. The Daily Beast gives us “Record Number of Wildfires Burning in Amazon Rainforest.” Here’s NBC News: “Amazon wildfires could be ‘game over’ for climate change fight.”

Interestingly, when NASA released the satellite image on August 21, it noted that “it is not unusual to see fires in Brazil at this time of year due to high temperatures and low humidity. Time will tell if this year is a record breaking or just within normal limits.”

So why are there so many fires? “Natural fires in the Amazon are rare, and the majority of these fires were set by farmers preparing Amazon-adjacent farmland for next year’s crops and pasture,” soberly explains The New York Times. “Much of the land that is burning was not old-growth rain forest, but land that had already been cleared of trees and set for agricultural use.”

It is routine for farmers and ranchers in tropical areas burn their fields to control pests and weeds and to encourage new growth in pastures.

What about deforestation trends? Since the right-wing nationalist Jair Bolsonaro became Brazil’s president, rainforest deforestation rates have increased a bit, but they are still way below their earlier highs:

NYT

Various researchers have noted a U-shaped relation between environmental degradation and economic growth. As development takes off, levels of pollution and land degradation rise, but they begin to improve once certain thresholds of per capita incomes are attained. A 2012 study found, after parsing data from 52 developing countries between 1972 and 2003, that deforestation increases until average income levels reach about $3,100 per capita. As it happens, Brazilian per capita incomes reached $3,600 per capita in 2004,which is when deforestation rates began trending decisively downward.

While problematic deforestation is still taking place in the Amazon region, a 2018 study in Nature reported that the global tree canopy cover had increased by 865,000 square miles from 1982 to 2016. As Brazilians become wealthier, the deforestation trend in the Amazon will likely turn around toward afforestation, as it already has done many other countries.",1
"Things are bad for him - the fires are affecting air quality in states that are his political base, and they're concentrated not in the actual rainforest, but in areas of developed farmland , something Bolsonaro's encouraged to bring some kind of prosperity to Brazil's flyover.

The left is doing its level best to blame Brazil's bush fires on Brazil's conservative, Trump-like president, Jair Bolsonaro, and get him thrown out of office.

It's drawn tremendous negative press on him, and set European Union's eurochickens clucking, vowing at the G-7 to cut off trade with Brazil to pin those fires on Bolsonaro instead of the weather. Brazil doesn't deserve that, but these people are shameless.

Democrats, back in the states, are doing it, too. Here's one who wants to suspend all funding to Brazil until the fires (which Brazil is fighting) are under control.

Kamala Harris is onboard, as well, tweeting this anti-Bolsonaro screed:

As the Amazon burns, Brazil’s Trump-like President who let loggers and miners destroy the land isn’t acting. Trump must not seek a trade deal with Brazil until Bolsonaro reverses his catastrophic policies and addresses the fires. We need American leadership to save our planet. — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) August 24, 2019

Never mind that the fires are within the range of fires that normally occur in dry areas during droughts. Brazil's fires, while they need attention, are in fact little different from the wildfires seen in Harris's own California, or for that matter, Spain or Australia. They're a function of the place's natural climate. Yet the euro-left has dancing visions about Brazil being the rainforest lungs of the world under great global catastrophe unless they can turn Brazil into a nature reserve to their liking, and of course to bring Bolsonaro to heel.

Look at this nonsense reported to a largely European readership from The Guardian:

In Rio de Janeiro, a couple of thousand people crowded the steps of the town hall. Many said the fires were a result of Bolsonaro’s plans to develop the Amazon forest and permit mining and commercial agriculture on protected indigenous reserves. The fires happen each dry Amazon winter but soared this year as farmers and loggers, emboldened by Bolsonaro’s anti-environment rhetoric, torched felled trees and cleared land for pasture. “We need to show how much we disagree with his policy,” said Mariane Rocha, a trainee teacher. Others were angry Bolsonaro blamed NGOs for the fires without providing evidence. “His whole political game is based on false accusations and mistakes,” said Beatriz Ferreira.

Well, guess what? The bid to blame Bolsonaro or his conservative policies on the fires in the Amazon falls apart now that news comes out that socialist Bolivia has exactly the same fire problem, and no, they aren't promoting development of land the way Bolsonaro is. According to ScienceAlert in a piece beginning with the following headline and lede:

It's Not Just Brazil's Amazon - Bolivia's Vital Forests Are Burning Out of Control, Too Up to 800,000 hectares of the unique Chiquitano forest were burned to the ground in Bolivia between August 18 and August 23. That's more forest than is usually destroyed across the country in two years.

Here's a Bolivian news account tweet:

#ANF Vea la dimensión de los incendios en #Roboré, Santa Cruz. Un sobrevuelo en la zona permitió verificar que el fuego arrasa extensiones de superficie de área boscosa. pic.twitter.com/d2BCI66CwN — Agencia Fides (ANF) (@noticiasfides) August 23, 2019

If anything, the dynamic there is far more man-made than anything going on in Brazil. Socialist President Evo Morales has openly encouraged what's known, at least in Venezuela, as ""conuco"" agriculture, telling subsistance farmers it's fine to set of fires to gather charcoal to sell for fuel or clear the land of brush for planting, and now he's refusing international firefighting help. When I visited Venezuela in 2005, I saw a lot of this going on over the jungle-edged savannahs and llanos and it was destructive. Apparently it goes on in Bolivia, too. The timing for that was not good now that the region is experiencing a drought.

Here's another claim that looks worthy of investigation as a result of that:

The left says that Bolsonaro's develop-the-rainforest policies are what's causing the fires, but this is highly questionable, given that in California, exactly the opposite is what triggers its huge and consuming wildfires - overforestation and greenie regulations. What's going on is bigger than any of this -- the issue is the weather and the correct management of conditions. Overforesting, as goes on in California, is as bad as conuco farming in Bolivia. In Brazil, there may be need for some policy adjustments, too, but it's no cause for panic or sanctions.

That's exactly what Europe and the U.S. Democrats are doing though, solely targeting Brazil which is in a difficult situation that requires support, not condemnation. Why is this happening> Well, because they hate Bolsonaro who to them is an extension of Trump. It's also because they still romantice the rainforest.

Now Bolivia is robbing them of their rimshot argument. No more Sting and the rainforest man for their ""narrative"" now. What appears to be a far more desperate and mismanaged situation is going on Bolivia, and we don't see any eurochicken clucking about the ""lungs of the world"" or sanctioning the socialist hellhole. The European Union and much of the G-7 are focused exclusively on Brazil and putting the screws to Bolsonaro blaming him for a broader temporary weather phenomenon. It's starting to look political and it would be a welcome thing if President Trump sticks up for the man among the clucker. Bolivia makes their hypocrisy show.

"Bolivia’s Wildfires Ignored By The BBC

By Paul Homewood

h/t Mr GrimNasty

I doubt whether you’ll see this on the BBC:

Up to 800,000 hectares of the unique Chiquitano forest were burned to the ground in Bolivia between August 18 and August 23. That’s more forest than is usually destroyed across the country in two years.

Experts say that it will take at least two centuries to repair the ecological damage done by the fires, while at least 500 species are said to be at risk from the flames.

The Chiquitano dry forest in Bolivia was the largest healthy tropical dry forest in the world. It’s now unclear whether it will retain that status. The forest is home to Indigenous peoples as well as iconic wildlife such as jaguars, giant armadillos, and tapirs. Some species in the Chiquitano are found nowhere else on Earth.

Distressing photographs and videos from the area show many animals have burned to death in the recent fires.

While the media has focused on Brazil, Bolivians are asking the world to notice their unfolding tragedy – and to send help in combating the flames.

It’s thought that the fires were started deliberately to clear the land for farming, but quickly got out of control. The perpetrators aren’t known, but Bolivian President Evo Morales has justified people starting fires, saying: ""If small families don’t set fires, what are they going to live on?""

The disaster comes just a month after Morales announced a new ""supreme decree"" aimed at increasing beef production for export

https://www.sciencealert.com/it-s-not-just-brazil-s-amazon-bolivia-s-vital-forests-are-on-fire-too

Of course, Evo Morales is a socialist, unlike Brazil’s Bolsonaro. But I am sure that had nothing to do with the BBC’s lack of interest in this story!",1
"The Amazon has made headlines this month as fires rip across the region. While this is the dry season for the area, during which fires are common, fires have nonetheless reached unprecedented highs this season — up 80 percent compared to last year. As the Amazon burns, the world has lit up with despair and outrage, with hashtags such as #PrayForTheAmazon going viral.

As the fires and emotional uproar continue, one naturally wonders ""who is to blame?"" Of course, the obvious cause is ""human ignition,"" as these fires are mostly due to farmers and ranchers using flames to clear forests and shrublands (a common practice in tropical regions). However, the underlying reason for farming-related fires is also important to pursue.

Some news reports point to climate change, as hotter and drier temperatures have contributed to the increased flammability of landscapes not only in Brazil, but all over the world. Others point to Brazil's new far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, who champions the exploitation of the Amazon for economic gain and who’s government has scaled back efforts to fight illegal logging, ranching and mining — thus emboldening more farmers, ranchers, and land-grabbers to clear forestlands.

ADVERTISEMENT

While these are important contributing factors, the evident international concern for the Amazon that has surfaced this month is not without irony. As we look to blame ranchers, politicians, and climate for these fires, we overlook a glaring paradox. That is, underlying the long-term destruction of the Amazon rain forest for decades has been global demand for meat products.

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Brazil remains the world's number one beef exporter, accounting for nearly 20 percent of global exports, and still growing. As of 2018, Brazilian beef exports reached a record 1.6 million tonnes. Some reports suggest as much as 80 percent of Amazon forest destruction is related to cattle ranching.

Thus, as ranchers capitalize on drier-than-average weather this month to burn and clear forests, we must recognize the connection between fires in the Amazon and consumer demand. According to CNN, Finland has taken notice of this as the nation’s finance minister on Friday called for the European Union to ""urgently review the possibility of banning Brazilian beef imports"" in light of the Amazon fires.

Although the majority of Brazilian beef exports go to China and Hong Kong, the Unites States, European Union, and other nations nonetheless have roles to play, as we all fit into the picture of global demand.

The destruction of the Amazon means more than just the loss of beautiful forests. It’s also a blow to biodiversity. At a time when extinction rates are already 1,000 times higher than natural background rates, we should be doing everything we can to preserve the biodiversity that remains on our planet, rather than expediting its disappearance.

What’s more, the Amazon rainforest plays a crucial role in oxygen production, carbon sequestration, and the saga surrounding climate change. Often called the lungs of the earth, the Amazon absorbs much of the carbon dioxide we emit to the atmosphere through human activity. When the forest burns, we not only remove this important carbon sink, but we also directly release carbon back to the atmosphere as fires convert solid biomass to carbon dioxide, a potent greenhouse gas.

Besides the impact that burning the Amazon has on greenhouse gas emissions, the livestock industry itself is notorious for its massive contribution to climate change and the buildup of greenhouse gases. Beef production is particularly problematic since cows produce a potent greenhouse gas called methane, which is even 30 times more heat-trapping than carbon dioxide.

Additionally, cattle require extensive food supplies, which increases the destruction of native habitats for farming while in the process placing increased demand on fossils fuels used to produce fertilizers, pesticides, and energy. All told, beef accounts for about 40 percent of livestock-related greenhouse gas emissions, and livestock accounts for 15 percent of total global emissions.

Once cleared, forests are not easily restored to their original condition, even with dedicated restoration efforts. This in part because soils deteriorate with the loss of plant cover, as the sun’s rays bake the ground and as rains wash away important topsoil.

Coming full circle, it is imperative to realize that we all have a role to play in the preservation of the Amazon. If images of this month’s forest fires have stirred public emotion, then it’s incumbent upon us to reflect on our personal behavior and understand how consumer choice at the grocery store fits into the story of either the preservation or ultimate destruction of the Amazon rainforest. It is often said that we cast a vote each time we use our dollar to make a purchase. This couldn’t ring truer than in the present context.

As the disappearing Amazon causes us to reflect on our personal consumer choices, we need not fall into the black and white tradition of thinking that one must be vegan or vegetarian to make a difference. Ecological impacts are not so dichotomous. A heavy meat eater who decides to reduce his or her meat consumption will make a difference, just as a light meat eater who decides to eliminate meat completely will do the same. These are all worthwhile pursuits as we realize our place in the important story of protecting the Amazon.

"If you’ve been reading the MSM over the past few days, you’ve been treated to a barrage of coverage over the fires in the Amazon and how what’s going on is a “massive increase over last year”:

The Amazon is often referred to as ""the lungs of the planet."" It's home to 10% of the world's species and creates 20% of our oxygen.

And as we told you, politicians and celebs are really, really concerned. But not so concerned with the truth. . .

As we told you last night, the photo is from 2003:

There’s just one problem with this narrative. NASA, which kind of started all of this when they posted this photo of the fires from space, said this year’s fires are at or below average “if we look back 15 years”:

But according to NASA, if we look back 15 years this year’s fire rates are at or below average. This really means in past years rates were very bad, not that this year’s rates are good, but it's important context… we were on right track until recentlyhttps://t.co/Qpnjz6TT1C — Joe Hanson (@DrJoeHanson) August 21, 2019

Weird! It’s a totally normal year for fires but everyone is freaking out? What could it be?

Brazil is even using the NASA report to dunk on the alarmists:

"Short summary: we have had wild fires for many years now in the Amazon, even in the tropical rainforest - mainly started by humans for forest clearing and ranching. It is not enough to impact significantly on the Paris agreement pledges yet, though it is important in the long term if this continues for decades. It does of course have major and immediate impacts on forest residents, nature services and the biodiversity in Brazil.

This image is being shared widely, for instance in National Geographic's ""The Amazon is burning at record rates - and deforestation is to blame"". Similarly, the BBC is reporting it as 'Record number of fires' in Brazilian rainforest

Yet, NASA's own description for this photo says that it is burning at close to the average for the last 15 years. So, what is going on here?

It turns out that the earlier 13th August article gives the number of fires since 1st January but they use 1st May as the start date for the August 19 update.

There's been a rapid increase of fires in the second half of August still continuing as of 24th August. it was at average levels or below average through to early August but had a huge uptick and is now close to the 2016 levels from 1st January and if it continues likely crosses them soon. But if you count from 1st May it is already way above recent previous years and close to rates last seen over a decade ago.

The new fires are more intense, near roads and show all the signs of being deliberate fires for deforestation. In addition local farmers in Para district organized a ""day of fire"" on August 10th to show to Bolsonaro that they are ready to work and that they need to use fire to do so. So there is a clear link here. Bolsonaro however, in response to pressure internationally and also locally within Brazil has responded instead by sending in the army to stop the fires and he says that it is his duty to protect the Amazon. He also said clearly that these fires are illegal. There is also an investigation underway into the ""day of fire"".

If they can stop the illegal fires this could make a big difference to deforestation figures for this year and indeed future years. There are more sustainable ways to increase the productivity of Brazil using existing land without impacting on the forest. See section RANCHING COULD BE MUCH MORE PRODUCTIVE WITH JUST THE EXISTING LAND (below)

(skip to NASA'S STATEMENT ABOUT EARLIER FIRES THROUGH TO MID AUGUST )

APOLOGIES - UPDATE FROM NASA FROM 19TH AUGUST - THEY NOW CONFIRM INPE INSTEAD OF SAYING IT IS BELOW AVERAGE

Previous version of this article was mistaken. I have made a copy on my website here (the comments on this article are based on that earlier version):

NASA Say Amazon Rainforest Burning At Close To Average Rates - Yet Many News Stories Say Record Rates - Which Is It?

It accurately summarized the article it linked to from NASA (Fires in Brazil) and that page showed as updated on 22nd August which lead me to believe it was up to date. But apparently it isn't, that's just the date for a minor update of the page. I found the reason for the discrepancy.

This one dated 19th August is the more recent one. This shows the fires for August 15 - 22, 2019:

With the fire season in the Amazon approaching its midpoint, scientists using NASA satellites to track fire activity have confirmed an increase in the number and intensity of fires in the Brazilian Amazon in 2019, making it the most active fire year in that region since 2010. Fire activity in the Amazon varies considerably from year-to-year and month-to-month, driven by changes in economic conditions and climate. August 2019 stands out because it has brought a noticeable increase in large, intense, and persistent fires burning along major roads in the central Brazilian Amazon, explained Douglas Morton, chief of the Biospheric Sciences Laboratory at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. While drought has played a large role in exacerbating fires in the past, the timing and location of fire detections early in the 2019 dry season are more consistent with land clearing than with regional drought. Uptick in Amazon Fire Activity in 2019

You can show a map of current fires here: Global forest watch - fires The latest figures are here, where you can see the big increase in the numbers of fires, and the fire intensity too, in the second half of August - while up to then, as for the previous NASA report it was running at average or below average levels. Note, these are the cumulative fire counts from May rather than the entire year. . Fire Forecast So that's the explanation, the fires were at average levels through to mid August, and then there was a huge uptick. Why was that? Seems that it started when the farmers in the state of Para declared a ""'dia do fogo,'"" or ""day of fire"" on August 10th. They said they did this in order to show to Bolsonaro that they want to work and that the only way to clear pastures for them to work was with fire (report in Portuguese here), This was spectacularly ""successful"" and there was an immediate increase in fires which continued through the following weeks. As Aljazeerah reports it: According to the Brazilian newspaper Folha do Progresso, the fires started on August 10 when an association of farmers in the state of Para announced a so-called ""day of fire"". The idea, according to the publication, was to coordinate a number of simultaneous fires to show Bolsonaro ""they are ready to work"". On that day, 124 new fires were registered by INPE and the next day 203 more were flagged. The Public Prosecutor in the State of Para has opened an investigation into the incident Brazil's Amazon is burning: 'Some families lost everything' The good news here is that Brazilians are noticing and responding. Bolsonaro is getting massive protests and marches within Brazil as well as international pressure. The black smoke that turned Sao Paolo, turning daytime almost to night at 2 pm really brought it home to Brazilians. (click to watch on Youtube) Sao Paolo has over 12 million residents, about 6% of the total population of Brazil (200 million or so).. The increased deforestation and fires and the black smoke means that those millions of people are all aware of what is happening in a way that hasn't happened before. The local and worldwide protests about the fires are having an effect similarly to the green wave in Europe for Greta Thunburg. Sao Paolo has over 12 million residents, about 6% of the total population of Brazil (200 million or so)..

The local and worldwide protests about the fires are having an effect similarly to the green wave in Europe for Greta Thunburg. (click to watch on Youtube) Bolsonaro is responding to this pressure too. He has got the military in, which shows he realizes something has to be done. It's not like he responded ""who cares about the forest"". Instead he said ""The protection of the forest is our duty. We are aware of it and we are acting to combat the illegal deforestation as well as other criminal activities that put our Amazon at risk"" Instead he said This is Fox News, Trump's favourite TV network in the US, reporting on it: (click to watch on Youtube) Trump also agrees that action is needed urgently to stop this, offering the help from the US to help put out the fires if that is needed. Even though both Bolsonaro and Trump do not think that human induced climate change is happening, this is a point of agreement with the rest of the world. Trump is able to agree with the rest of the world on the value of the Amazon rainforest and importance of protecting it. France is sending its military to region to help. G7 countries have released $22 million, mainly for planes to drop water on the fires Bolsonaro accepted an offer of support from Israel. And the EU are saying that it's hard to imagine the big trade deal involving south American countries with tge EU to go ahead while Brazil fails to stop the fires. They are also going to be meeting in September to discuss plans to reforest the Amazon. Amazon fires: G7 to release funds for fire-fighting planes This is another article I'm writing to support people we help in the Facebook Doomsday Debunked group, that find us because they get scared, sometimes to the point of feeling suicidal about it, by such stories.

NASA'S STATEMENT ABOUT EARLIER FIRES THROUGH TO MID AUGUST skip to LOOKING FORWARD The image they share shows smoke from fires in the Amazon region on 13th August 2019. These are not necessarily all forest fires. Some of these will be fires in natural savannah - or in pasture to stimulate new growth for the cattle. Here it is again with the original NASA caption:

NASA's caption: ""As of August 16, 2019, an analysis of NASA satellite data indicated that total fire activity across the Amazon basin this year has been close to the average in comparison to the past 15 years. (The Amazon spreads across Brazil, Peru, Colombia, and parts of other countries.) Though activity appears to be above average in the states of Amazonas and Rondônia, it has so far appeared below average in Mato Grosso and Pará, according to estimates from the Global Fire Emissions Database, a research project that compiles and analyzes NASA data.

There are regions with more fires than usual, especially the Amazonas region. However others have fewer than usual and over the whole region it is about average.

If you go to their cite the Global Fire Emissions Database. this is what you see in the “Totals” section, but this is the cumulative count from January instead of May:

The green line for 2019 there is a bit hard to make out, so here is a zoom in,

as you can see it is way below the top line which is for 2005, with only a few data points, and is also below the 2016 figure. BTW though it says ""last updated April 2019"" it has data points on it through to late August.

However if we now highlight the 2019 figures in green and the 2016 figure in blue and leave the rest faint you can see the big change in August

Global Fire Emissions Database. t

The green line is rapidly rising, far faster than the fires have ever risen in August in recent years (though there were faster increases a decade ago)..

So, the cumulative fire count from 1st January is still less than for 2016 but if you start the count at 1st May you see a huge uptick in August making it a record. So - it is already a record for the burning season but not for the whole year yet.

LOOKING FORWARD

skip to SOME COMMON MISUNDERSTANDINGS AND URBAN MYTHS ABOUT THE AMAZON RAINFOREST

With Bolsonaro acting to stop the fires I think there is a reasonable chance it stops this rapid increase and if so the end of year stats could well be less than for 2016. If he keeps that up in future years too it can prevent another future ""fire day"".

It is heartening for me to see ordinary Brazilians protesting and to see him actually acting in response, similar to the green wave here in the UK / Europe

What would be really good would be new emphasis on sustainable use of the land already cleared.

It's quite simple things.Not new technology, we already know how to do it and it is already being done in Brazil in pilot projects that have increased productivity just by replanting the grassland. The right hand field here has been replanted, left hand side not, and this is only one month after planting

The payback time is 5-7 years. This has the potential to free all the land needed for extra agriculture through to 2040 just by increasing the productivity of the existing ranchland from a third of optimum to half of optimum, if somehow it can become easier for farmers to do this rather than to cut down forest. .

See the section RANCHING COULD BE MUCH MORE PRODUCTIVE WITH JUST THE EXISTING LAND (below)

SOME COMMON MISUNDERSTANDINGS AND URBAN MYTHS ABOUT THE AMAZON RAINFOREST

skip to : WILDFIRES PART OF NATURE WORLDWIDE or to SO WHAT HAPPENED - DO WE BELIEVE NASA OR INPE

Before I go into more details, I'd like to briefly touch on a few common misunderstandings and urban myths / outdated science that many believe about the Amazon rainforest. I'll go into in more detail later on.

Many of the fires you see in the photos are not forest fires, and not all forest fires are illegal deforestation

The ranchers use fire for forest clearing, ""slash and burn agriculture"" as it is called. That is because it is much easier to convert forest into grassland by burning it than to do it by felling the trees. Once it is cut, the way they manage the pastures is to reburn them every few years to clear out the brush and to get the grass to resprout.

So not all the fires you see are burning in virgin tropical rainforest. Many are controlled grassland fires, to get the grass to resprout. We do something similar in the UK where they do controlled burning of heather (muir burn) for grouse, sheep and deer.

It is illegal to start those fires in Brazil during the driest season because though it is the easiest time to burn the grassland the fires can get out of control too easily. But they are not always started with the intention to burn down the tropical forest. It's often just a mistake. The same happens for heather fires in the UK some of our forest fires are due to out of control heather fires.

You can read about how they manage the pastures in Brazil through burning here: Cattle Ranching in the Amazon Region

In Boreal South America, half are forest fires, rest mainly fires which they do every few years to refresh grassland. Nowadays 75% of Amazon forest fires are grassland fires that got out of hand (used to be correlated with deforestation). For details see Changes in Climate and Land Use Over the Amazon Region: Current and Future Variability and Trends.

The Amazon rainforest will not disappear rapidly once you get below 59% forest cover

This is based on widely misreported research about the fractal process of fragmentation of forests at 59% forest cover. Also there was some research suggested that the rainforest has a ""tipping point"" where it would rapidly transition to savannah almost everywhere. However these were simplified models with a maximum of two plant functional types and not accounting for ranges of tree sizes and ages, nutrient cycles and other details.

They understand what is going on very well at the leaf level but at the forest level it is hard to model what will happen in response to climate change and deforestation. The climate is already changing because of the deforestation. There were three mega-droughts in 2005, 2010 and 2016, which at the time were classified as a “one-in-100 year event”. Then there were mega floods in 2009, 2012, and 2014.

The deforestation fragmentation can reduce biodiversity by 13–75%, and impair key ecosystem functions by decreasing biomass and altering nutrient cycles.

There are plenty of reasons to stop deforestation and reverse it. But it's no longer clear that there is any particular tipping point where it will all go in a single dieback with several studies finding more resilience than was thought before. More research is needed on what can happen and how to mitigate it. (Again see Changes in Climate and Land Use Over the Amazon Region: Current and Future Variability and Trends.) - I go into this in more detail below.

We will not all suffocate if the Amazon rainforest is cut down

Many of the news reports talk about the Amazon rainforest being a major source of oxygen. Actually most of it comes from the sea, phytoplankton. But we are not going to suffocate if we burn down forests. This is an urban myth, and science fiction trope, in dustpan futures - but it is not true at all.

We have plenty of oxygen in the atmosphere for thousands of years even if somehow magically all photosynthesis stopped producing oxygen and all the animals continued to use it. See my Debunked: If we cut down all the forests we will run out of oxygen to breathe - they are not the “lungs of the planet” in any literal sense

WILDFIRES PART OF NATURE WORLDWIDE

skip to : SO WHAT HAPPENED - DO WE BELIEVE NASA OR INPE

Nearly all forests have wildfires, naturally, but they are much rarer in tropical rainforests because they are wet year round. The natural fires mainly happen where the forests meet drier pastureland / savannah and in the Amazon region they are driest in July onwards to mid September.

This shows fires from space - if you could take such a video ten million years ago it would still show many fires, though the fires would be started naturally rather than manmade.

This is a short summary from NASA about why we get forest fires in various parts of the world.

For Brazil, most of the fires we get at present are manmade and are started deliberately as the easiest way to remove tropical rainforest in order to convert it to grassland for cattle ranching.

You can see some of the ranching from space in this video at the end.

Sometimes they spread further than intended. This has gone on for many years now and we always have the stories at this time of year about the fires in the Amazon seen from space.

The burnt areas do not become desert and with global warming the Amazon will not turn into a desert region

It turns, rather, to grassland as the end process over multiple fires. However, if there is a forest fire and it is not immediately followed up by ranching activity to convert it to pasture, the trees regrow quickly, though to a lower biomass forest with only 75% of the carbon. Eventually after repeated burning it becomes savannah - but not desert.

I'll summarize: Amazon fires explained: what are they, why are they so damaging, and how can we stop them?

First, if there is a fire in virgin tropical rainforest then it is just an understory fire and travels slowly. Only 200 to 300 meters a day. Animals and people can get out of the way easily.

Frefighters can stop such a fire just by raking out a simple fire break.

However even a low intensity fire like that can kill half the trees, small ones and then larger ones later on, losing more than half the carbon captured in the forest. Eventually they regrow but the resulting forest has 25% less than the previous virgin forst even after three decades. It loses a fair bit of its biodiversity.

After that though the forest is drier and can burn more easily. After it burns a second time the forest is much less diverse and drier and prone to burn over and over every few years. These fires burn the trees right to the treetops killing almost all the trees left. The rainforest birds are gone, replaced by different species that prefer low biomass forests. See Avifaunal Responses to Single and Recurrent Wildfires in Amazonian Forests

Given enough time over many decades and perhaps centuries, these drier forests can restore to tropical rainforest again.

In a warmer world some of them will turn to savannah with scattered trees, similar to the habitat known as the Cerrado, though it won't be as biodiverse forming this way.

We do not risk losing the Amazon as a whole in any of the climate scenarios through to 2100

That is something they used to think a few years back, that at some future tipping point the entire forest would go, turning to drier savannah. However that was based on simplifying assumptions that turned out to be misleading.

The research has moved on. A large part of the Amazon rainforest will remain through to 2100 even with high emissions, especially the Western Amazon forest. This region survived the previous glacial minimum when it was warmer and will survive any anthropogenic warming through to 2100.

The Amazon as a whole is vast. Even through to 2100 even at high levels of warming the Western Amazon will be largely intact. I cover this later under: SURVIVAL OF LARGE AREAS OF WESTERN AMAZON EVEN AT HIGH LEVELS OF WARMING THROUGH TO 2100

SO WHAT HAPPENED - DO WE BELIEVE NASA OR INPE

skip to : HOW THE NASA FIRE COUNT WORKS

Here INPE is the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research. They run a program called DETER that does rapid assessments of wildfires by satellite. It needs to be validated using PRODES which is yearly and far more accurate. The DETER website says the data should not be relied on.

Ousted Head of Science Agency Criticizes Brazil’s Denial of Deforestation Data

Unicef reports that the data from satellite images show that Brazil lost 2,254 square kilometers (870 square miles) of forest in July, between three and five times the amount lost in the same month for each of the previous four years.

Bolsonaro questions those figures

During a recent public appearance, Bolsonaro joked that if the “absurd” deforestation numbers were true, “then I am Captain Chainsaw!” Latest deforestation data in Brazil show significant surge - UNICEF.

So what happened? Outside of Brazil everyone is siding with the INPE. But - it turns out on this particular matter, it may be Bolsonaro who is right!

The media reports should never have been leaked to the public without explaining that the science is not validated.

DETER can't see through cloud. It actually has a note on its own page saying it can't be relied on if used in this way. it is for a rapid response, detecting fires early. For that purpose, they do not mind if they detect the same fire multiple times. It is designed as a rapid alert system not a fire count system. When it detects deforestation it has no way of knowing when it happened and may record it for one month when it actually happened years before but the area was covered by cloud and couldn't be spotted earlier.

More details here (in Portuguese).

They differ from the NASA results because they use different satellites and different analysis methods. I'll describe how they work in a bit more detail in the next two sections.

HOW THE NASA FIRE COUNT WORKS

skip to : HOW THE INPE FIRECOUNTS AND DEFORESTATION ESTIMATES WORKS - DETER, QUEIMADAS AND PRODES

This data is based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer , a key instrument on the EOS-AM-1 satellite now known as Terra and the EOS PM-1 satellite now known as Aqua

They are in polar orbits and Terra passes north south over the equator in the morning, and Aqua in the afternoon. Between them they view the entire surface of Earth every 1 to 2 days and acquire data in 36 spectral bands. You can browse their active fire maps here, which detects fires in 1 km pixels that are burning during relatively cloud free conditions.

The project to count the fires is based on a series of papers by Louis Giglio.et al, funded by NASA, and two other organizations. The methods used are explained in the introduction to their article

Here, we present the Global Fire Atlas of individual fires based on a new methodology for identifying the location and timing of fire ignitions and estimating fire size and duration, and daily expansion, fire line length, speed, and direction of spread. The Global Fire Atlas is derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6 (Col. 6) burned-area dataset (Giglio et al., 2018), which includes an estimated day-of-burn data layer at a 500 m resolution. Individual fire data were generated starting in 2003, when combined data from the Terra and Aqua satellites began to provide greater burn date certainty. The algorithm for the Global Fire Atlas tracks the daily progression of individual fires at a 500 m resolution to produce a set of metrics on individual fire behavior in standard raster and vector data formats. Together, these Global Fire Atlas data layers provide an unprecedented look at global fire behavior and changes in fire dynamics during 2003–2016. The Global Fire Atlas of individual fire size, duration, speed and direction

From that paper, they use combined visual and infrared observations. It works best with clear skies, with an uncertainty of one day either way, and as the cloud cover increases there is more and more uncertainty about when the fire started, 5 days either way if clouds cover 75% of the daily scenes and an uncertainty of 20 days or more if only 15% of scenes are cloud free, and no mapping possible at all with higher cloud cover.

HOW THE INPE FIRECOUNTS AND DEFORESTATION ESTIMATES WORKS - DETER, QUEIMADAS AND PRODES

skip to : WORST FIRES IN THE AMAZONAS REGION

The Inpe used to use the Terra and Aqua satellites to estimate the fire count similarly to NASA, see NASA Satellite Data Used by INPE Provides Rapid Analysis of Amazon

However, starting from 2015 they now use much higher resolution satellites, Sino-Brazilian Land Resources Satellite (CBERS-4) part of a mutual scientific cooperation with China, the China–Brazil Earth Resources Satellite program and the Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS). These have a resolution of 64 and 56 meters respectively. The data is aggregated to a minimum size of 6.25 hectares for the general public

This is only meant as an alert system so that the authorities can respond quickly to fires in the region. It is not meant to be used in this way to estimate deforestation or fire counts. It's just not intended for that.

First, DETER is used to estimate the deforestation:

DETER is a quick survey of evidence of changes in forest cover in the Amazon made by INPE. DETER was developed as an alert system to support the supervision and control of deforestation and forest degradation carried out by the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) and other agencies related to this theme. For this purpose we use images from the WFI [Wide field] sensors, from the Sino-Brazilian Land Resources Satellite (CBERS-4) and AWiFS [Advanced wide field sensors], from the Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS), with 64 and 56 meters of spatial resolution respectively. Data are sent daily to the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) without restriction of the minimum mapped area, however, for the general public the polygons are available with a minimum size of 6.25 ha, thus allowing the establishment of a comparison criterion with the data generated by the PRODES project . ... INPE emphasizes that DETER is an expedient Alert system developed methodologically to support enforcement. Information on areas is for prioritization by enforcement agencies and should not be construed as a monthly deforestation rate. The official INPE number to measure the annual rate of clearcut deforestation in the Brazilian Legal Amazon has been provided since 1988 by the PRODES project. DETER (using Google auto translate).

The PRODES project is reliable, based on LANDSAT and other satellites comparing before and after images, and shows deforestation for 2018 of 7,536 square kilometers, similar to previous years. However it won't produce the figures for 2019 until next year.

The INPE fire count is on this page, where as of writing it shows 76,729 fires in Brazil so far this year.

As well as the problems with cloudiness, as for DETER, the QUEIMADAS fire count counts focal points. A focal point is just a pixel with fire in it. The pixels can vary from 1 km x 1 km to 5 km x 4 km. A single pixel can have multiple fires in it. Also a large fire can easily overlap into neighbouring pixels and depending where the pixel boundaries are be counted multiple times. Finally, different satellites have the pixel boundaries in different places which can lead to the same fire be counted multiple times as several fires once the data is combined.

It also misses fires that are only on the ground and don't affect the treetops, and fires with a firefront of less than 30 meters, and clouds covering the region (though it can see through clouds of smoke).

It can also miss a fire on a mountain slope if the satellite only saw the other side of it.

Here is their response in the FAQ, which I just paraphrased, I am reading this using Google Translate:

Focus x burn ratio is not straightforward in satellite imagery. A spotlight indicates the existence of fire in an image resolution element (pixel) ranging from 1 km x 1 km to 5 km x 4 km. In this pixel there may be one or several distinct burns that will indicate a single focus. And if a burn is too large, it will be detected on some neighboring pixels, ie multiple outbreaks will be associated with a single large burn. Still, it is common for the same burn to be detected by several satellites. Therefore, maps and tables showing all foci of all satellites will always have some repetitions. Additionally, in many cases, due to the natural variation in pixel size between the various satellites, the same burn can be indicated at locations within a few kilometers depending on the satellite that detected it. This INPE Burning system detects the occurrence of fire, given by itself extremely important and valid, and necessary for thousands of users of this INPE system. Accurate details of what is burning and how much it burned are information impossible to obtain with current sensors. Finally, considering the regular mode of detection and using a single satellite as a reference one can observe spatial and temporal trends in fire occurrences. For details see their FAQ.

See also the Netherlands factchecker site:

It is possible that this INPE data is correct and the NASA data is mistaken.

However, given that DETER is not designed to do this job, it seems unlikely. It seems best to wait until the PRODES update for 2019 and then see if the deforested area for 2019 is indeed larger than for 2018.

This is for both the fire count and deforestation figures. There could well be more deforestation going on this year than last year, but it is too soon to know.

The main thing here is that the designers of the DETER and QUEIMADAS tools did not take any precautions to prevent over estimating. Their priority is to get people on the ground quickly to deal with the fire not to estimate deforestation rates.

So when you read stories like this based on DETER

Take that with a big pinch of salt (grain of salt).

It is far too soon to know, we just don't have the scientific data to assess this yet. We will do by the end of the year.

INPE does have reliable deforestation data but it is only up to date to 2018. This is through PRODES which is used to evaluate the level of deforestation at the end of the year using Landsat photographs taken at times when there are few clouds so that the forest can be seen.

Observação da Terra

Longer term it’s clear deforestation is way down since the 1990s but it is too soon to see if this year will be similar to last year or a return to the levels of the 1990s,.

from Changes in Climate and Land Use Over the Amazon Region: Current and Future Variability and Trends

So - we may see an increase in deforestation in 2019 but we won't know for sure until the next row is added to this table.

WORST FIRES IN THE AMAZONAS REGION

skip to : 40% OF AMAZON IS OUTSIDE BRAZIL

As the NASA page says, the Amazonas region has seen more fires than the average and indeed, it was briefly a record:

And as the NASA page says, although above average also for Rondônia, it has been below average in Mato Grosso and Pará.

The skies over Sao Paulo suddenly became dark in the middle of the day. This is in the largest city in South America

Just a little alert to the world: the sky randomly turned dark today in São Paulo, and meteorologists believe it’s smoke from the fires burning *thousands* of kilometers away, in Rondônia or Paraguay. Imagine how much has to be burning to create that much smoke(!). SOS pic.twitter.com/P1DrCzQO6x — Shannon Sims (@shannongsims) 20 August 2019

So, it would be equally incorrect to say that nothing is happening in the Amazon at the moment. Especially in the Amazonas region.

The 42 areas of Amazonas officially protected are okay, no deforestation.

For details see Brazil: State of Amazonas declares state of emergency over rising number of forest fires

The state government is also raising farmers' awareness and increasing their presence in at-risk areas in an attempt to curb illegal agricultural fires and discourage deforestation.

40% OF AMAZON IS OUTSIDE BRAZIL

skip to : RANCHING COULD BE MUCH MORE PRODUCTIVE WITH JUST THE EXISTING LAND

Many people probably don't realize that 40% of the Amazonian rainforest is outside of Brazil. Other parts of the forest are much better protected.

An example of a country that has Amazonian rainforest with high protection standards is Suriname, smallest country in South America, and one of the few CARBON NEGATIVE countries absorbing 8.8 million tons of CO 2 every year. That's 16 tons of CO 2 per year per person.

The world average is to emit 5 tons per person per year. So it offsets the CO2 for 1.7 million additional people every year.

RANCHING COULD BE MUCH MORE PRODUCTIVE WITH JUST THE EXISTING LAND

skip to : EFFECTS OF BOLSONARO’S POLICIES

The sad thing is that no forest would need to be burnt for deforestation, if Brazil’s cattle ranching was just a bit more efficient.

I’ll summarize Results from on-the-ground efforts to promote sustainable cattle ranching in the Brazilian Amazon

In the next decade, beef is forecast to grow by 24%, soy by 39% and bioethanol by 27%.

Brazilian beef productivity is currently only a third of its sustainable potential. So much of the land is taken up for ranching that in theory Brazil could meet its entire demand for Beef, crops and timber through to 2040 by increasing its beef productivity from a third to a half of its sustainable potential.

The right side of this photo shows the effect of replanting the grassland to increase productivity, left side is unplanted, and this is only one month after planting

In this pilot study then farms were able to increase productivity by 30–490%

This required an initial investment of US$410–2180/hectare with a payback time of 2.5 to 8.5 years.

But - that's not necessarily easy for a poor farmer in Brazil to do. Loans are expensive and they can default on them.

Changing the structure of financial incentives is key. At present, worldwide, they are in the wrong direction, perverse financial incentives that are encouraging non sustainable practices.

Also top down doesn't work. It needs much more co-ordination between local and government levels as well as between governments than we have today. The ordinary folk and consumers are also part of the transformative change.

It was such a good report in my view far better than the IPCC ones because of the sociological element with expert sociologist which I think is key to really solving this.

Let’s save a million species, and make biodiversity great again - UN report says we know how do it

EFFECTS OF BOLSONARO’S POLICIES

skip to : HOW THE FOREST CHANGES WITH GLOBAL WARMING

Bolsonaro is only in office for four years initially, maximum of two terms at a time, or 8 years (after which he can run again but only after a gap for someone else in office).

Brazilians elected him for his anti-corruption campaign not for his views on the rainforest. Most of the Brazilians actually care about the environment but though most can read and write, few have attained the level of literacy you reach when you leave high school.

Under international pressure he has stayed within the Paris Agreement, and his is a minority government, so he can’t actually reverse the legislation to protect forests, but he is reducing support for enforcing it.

The increased emissions only add a few percent to the CO2 emissions for the year. If all countries had the same emissions as Brazil as it is now, we would not be able to stay within 2°C but so long as others step up their pledges, then it’s mainly important for Brazil to step up its pledges at a later stage and as far as climate change is concerned it's not an immediate disaster.

It does matter for the forest dwellers whose forests are being destroyed right now. But the Amazon forest as a whole is vast and most will not be affected by 8 years of increased deforestation.

HOW THE FOREST CHANGES WITH GLOBAL WARMING

skip to : SURVIVAL OF LARGE AREAS OF WESTERN AMAZON EVEN AT HIGH LEVELS OF WARMING THROUGH TO 2100

Parts of the Amazon rainforest will be lost at 3°C. But these are not lost to a desert. Rather, they transform into a savanna; grassland with scattered bushes. Like the Cerrado:

Large areas of Brazil are already Cerrado which has its own rich wildlife.

Also the Amazonian rainforest will not convert to savanna all at once. It is biodiverse and varied and different patches have different species in them. In a warming world at 3°C, some will be more resilient than others and will remain, with a change in the balance of species, while others turn to drier savanna like the Cerrado.

If it was a monoculture the climate would just need to go over some threshold in temperature, or humidity, and the whole thing would go. Because of the mix of species then it is more of a gradual thing. And then because of the patchiness, it would change to grassland only in patches which protects it further.

SURVIVAL OF LARGE AREAS OF WESTERN AMAZON EVEN AT HIGH LEVELS OF WARMING THROUGH TO 2100

skip to : EFFECTS OF WILDFIRES IN THE AMAZON

Parts of the Amazon rainforest seem to be much more resilient, especially the western regions, and this is how it survived previous warm periods. It's now thought most of it would survive this time too.

The upper map here shows the extent of the tropical rainforest and of the lower tree cover areas at the end of the last glacial minimum. This is how the tropical rainforest survives through the warmer periods in the past. The lower figure shows the extent we can expect by 2100.

See this paper in Nature for some of the recent research from 2018:

I am not sure what temperature change the lower one corresponds to. If anyone here is expert and able to say please do. It might be “business as usual?”.

So in short, the composition of parts of it would change. Some might change to a more open drier grassland. However most of it would remain and there would be a lot of tropical rainforest still at 3 °C or even at the higher temperatures of “business as usual”.

Earlier studies didn't take account of the effect of the mix of species some of which are more resistant to heat changes than others. See this paper in Nature from 2016

As the climate warms we do expect more wildfires in the Amazon. But there are fires there every year. They are started deliberately sometimes, for deforestation to open new areas for farming. They also start accidentally due to the trees being drier as a result of draining, they encroach on the forest from nearby open areas. This is an example from 2010:

The line of white trees here are the result of a surface fire encroaching on the Amazon rainforest from an open area during the September 2010 drought. NASA finds Amazon drought leaves long legacy of damage – Climate Change: Vital Signs of the Planet

EFFECTS OF WILDFIRES IN THE AMAZON

skip to : CRITICAL POINT FOR FOREST FRAGMENTATION

The wildfires in the amazon are mainly started deliberately by humans, as the easiest way to remove tropical rainforest to turn it to grassland for cattle ranching. Sometimes they get out of control and encroach into larger areas of the rainforest. Now however, many fires are also starting in pastureland and then spreading to the forest.

Climate change will lead to the Amazon region getting drier, and wildfires can accelerate that process. First, the forests do recover from wildfire, but full recovery takes a long time.

The initial growth is fast but 31 years later they still recover to only about three quarters of the original biomass. They continue to recover however and long term full recovery is possible. Some trees are centuries to millennia old in mature forests so it’s a long time to replace those.

There are other effects too. For instance burnt forests have a more open canopy, let in more sunlight, and so dry out more. Combine that with more drought conditions and that limits the regrowth. The fires also destroy some of the seedbank needed to reconstitute the rainforest.

Details here:

The other way around, then if unintended wildfires can be stopped, this can help to build in more resilience to climate change.

Increases of fires, e.g. from El Nino’s climate change, logging or road construction can trigger these positive feedbacks leading to a fire dominated lower mass forest.

Some things one could do is to use intensification of cattle ranching in Brazil, and improved soil management in the croplands, so they get the same increases of yields without needing to use fires and clear new forests.

For more on this:

CRITICAL POINT FOR FOREST FRAGMENTATION

skip to : TIPPING POINT AND DIEBACK SCENARIO

This was shared in 2018 with headlines such as

Tropical rainforests may be near a tipping point beyond our control

However it is not accurate to call this a ""tipping point"" as if the forest would suddenly all disappear and be gone.

What they did is to discover an intriguing fractal distribution of forest fragments. A few large areas, then more medium sized fragments, more smaller ones and so on. This pattern is the same in all forests worldwide despite the many different reasons for felling them and methods of doing it.

This is a timelapse video of deforestation in Rondônia in western Brazil

At exactly 59% forest cover you get patches of forest of all sizes. Above it you get a few large patches, many small patches and not much in between. Below it you get lots of small patches and the largest patches are gone. This is not a die back. It is just the normal patterns of random deforestation breaking it up so that there are no more continuous huge forests. This happened in Europe thousands of years ago. Very few really large forests and nothing remotely the size of the Amazon here. But we still have many forests of intermediate size.

They looked into the causes of it and found that if deforestation exceeds reafforestation it becomes more fragmented. If the other way around it becomes less fragmented. So, you can make a forest less fragmented by slowing down the process of deforestation or increasing reafforestation or both.

They analysed it using percolation theory and found that forest fragmentation is close to the percolation critical point of 59% of forest cover. At a forest cover of 59% then the large scale behaviour has a simple mathematical description. Above or below that it is more complex.

Here you see how it works with their model of the process. To start with there are a few large fragments, many small ones, and none of intermediate size.

At the critical point there are fragments of all sizes following a simple mathematical relationship where the smaller fragments are more common. Below that the largest fragments are gone completely, all broken up into smaller fragments.

To take an example, not from their paper, the UK is clearly in phase 3, much less than 59% is forest. We lost our largest forests thousands of years ago, back when the ancient Britons first introduced agriculture, and are left with much smaller ones. They are still large, just not as vast as the original forests that use to cover our land almost entirely after the last ice age.

Europe, North American and parts of Asia have had more reafforestation than deforestation in the last few centuries, but forest loss exceeds forest gain in most tropical countries.

This is how they see it unfolding along a timeline. Tropical America could reach a maximum of two billion fragments when about three quarters of the forest cover is gone.

This process is under our control. At any time we can change policies to favour reafforestation and then the forests will start to heal and form larger areas again. We can also use such methods as forest corridors to connect together the fragments if it gets to the point where there are no really large areas any more.

They conclude:

Our models predict that additional forest loss will result in a large increase in the total number of forest fragments—at maximum by a factor of 33 over 50 years—as well as a decrease in their size, and that these consequences could be partly mitigated by reforestation and forest protection.

Note - this is a very large scale overview of the situation at a continent level.

For instance, if Brazil was to reach this point where the forest starts to break up into smaller fragments with none of the largest areas left - this would have no effect on Suriname.

TIPPING POINT AND DIEBACK SCENARIO

skip to : FERTILIZATION EFFECTS OF WILDFIRES

This is how it is summarized in the Royal Society review of research from 2017

Amazon rainforest: The processes acting on tropical rainforests are very complex and a recent review still emphasised the possibility of a climate threshold … Recent work using a detailed ecosystem model (Levine et al., 2016) supports the possibility of a significant but heterogeneous transition in biomass type dependent on the length of the dry season, but in a continuous rather than “tipping point” manner. Resilience may be underestimated if plant trait diversity is not included in models

There is a very detailed academic review from 2018 in the section called: The Tipping Point and Die Back Scenario in the Amazon Region, Projections and Uncertainties in the 2018 review article by Marengo et al in ""Frontiers in Earth Science"" in this article:

So I will summarize that.

Early research suggested a risk that at a certain ""Tipping point"" most of the rainforest transitions to savannah. This could be due to

A critical warming threshold OR

Deforestation exceeding a certain percentage (varies from 25% to 40% depending on the author) - today we have reached 20% deforestation.

Once it transforms to savannah the soil continues to dry and lose carbon.

These dieback projections were based an oversimplified representation of the forest biodiversity with a maximum of two plant functional types and not accounting for ranges of tree sizes and ages, nutrient cycles and other details

Some of the effects of climate change are

Reductions in evapotranspiration because the stomata close at higher CO2 levels and water is used more efficiently

Increasing runoff and the ground taking up more direct heat leading to increased warming locally, reduced humidity and reduced fraction of low cloud

Increases in leaf area

Increase in photosynthetic rate as a result of the stomatal closure and increased water efficiency

There are still large uncertainties because of limitations in our knowledge vegetation responses to increases in CO2 concentration in the atmosphere and changes of climate. These processes are well understood at the leaf scale but not at the scale of the forest as a whole.

Also it's not known whether the increased photosynthetic rates will increase the biomass. Some species may be better adapted to future environments which is likely to affect the future vegetation composition.

Although recent studies suggest the early models were oversimplified and that dieback scenario is not as much of a risk as originally thought, there are still many uncertainties. Acting now to prevent a dieback is 100 times cheaper than risking a mass forest die off.

The authors conclude their paper

While science can still advance further in this area, we have also assembled enough knowledge to underline the global and regional importance of an intact Amazon region, in order to support policymaking and to keep this sensitive ecosystem functioning. This major challenge requires substantial resources and strategic cross-national planning, and a unique blend of expertise and capacities established in Amazon countries and from international collaboration.

skip to : WHY DID BRAZIL ELECT BOLSONARO?

At least as things are going now, it is not likely to go as far as that. We have already knocked a degree off the projection for 2100 from 2015. Though there are the notable exceptions of Brazil, the US, and Canada (and perhaps Australia), more countries than not are keeping to their pledges and expected to increase on them.

It is very promising that we increase on our pledges in 2020, several countries like the UK already have, California is committed to carbon zero by 2045, and China has said it will increase its pledges and map out a way to carbon zero later in this century. Not only that, also it will support the green climate fund, which makes a big difference. It is hugely underfunded, only a fraction of the $100 billion a year that is needed and many of the less developed countries like India will be able to do much more ambitious pledges with funding to support them.

Many forget that the Paris agreement pledges were never expected to lead to a commitment to 1.5 or 2 C in one go. The idea is to increase the pledges. Also CO2 emissions, even yearly emissions are expected to be level or increase through to the early 2020s on all scenarios. The aim is to reach 1.5 C by increasing pledges in 2020 based on the experiences of what worked in the last 5 years (along with improvements in technology and new industries). Then based on experiences from 2020 to 2025, to increase pledges again in 2025 and so on.

See my

For some recent positive news:

And all the Democrats running as candidates for 2020 have a strong green agenda. Even if Trump is re-elected, he may well be influenced eventually by public pressure especially if the green vote clearly has impacted on the Republican poll results in crucial states (example, if they lost Florida due to a green vote). The US needs to come on board by the next pledge in 2025 or at least, by 2030 for best chance of success, but the US emissions are level or falling as the long term trend anyway (with an up tick last year because of more winter heating) so they are not a priority right now in the world as a whole.

WHY DID BRAZIL ELECT BOLSONARO?

skip to : SEE ALSO

Bolsonaro’s government is only in power for four years and it depends a lot on what happens after that. He is a minority government and he can’t remove the legislation to protect the forests, just remove funding and support for those who do protect it. He is also under a lot of international pressure.

More Brazilians care about the environment than not, and he wasn't elected particularly for his environmental views. This author from Brazil says that the public can put pressure on him and also says there is an issue of environmental illiteracy in Brazil

Do Brazilians Really Care about the Environment?

He was elected to fight corruption and also as a result of viral campaigns on social media, not because of his views on the rainforest.

Various speculations here about why he was elected, I can't really comment on them.

[CORRECTION - HAD A SECTION HERE ABOUT BOLSONARO GETING ELECTED DUE TO LOW LEVELS OF LITERACY BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE, THOSE IN HIGHER EDUCATION VOTED MOST FOR HIM AND THOSE WITH LOWEST LEVELS, LEAST - SEE LINKED PAGE FOR DETAILS]

Why did Brazil elect Jair Bolsonaro?

New president of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro wants to remove protections from the tropical rainforest - how much can he do?

According to climate tracker if all countries followed Brazil’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C. But of course most countries are not following his approach.

Brazil | Climate Action Tracker

""If deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon were to return to the 2004 peak, a likely scenario under Bolsonaro’s rule, it could boost annual emissions to almost 3 billion metric tons over his term, at the top end of that range. That’s nearly half the United States’ total annual greenhouse-gas emissions"" Brazil’s presidential election could mean billions of tons of additional greenhouse gases

That would make it so Brazil contributes up to 7% of total CO2 emissions by the table here

List of countries by carbon dioxide emissions - Wikipedia

Another study looked at the absolute worse case where he left the Paris agreement, as he originally planned to do.

""A study by scientists at Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research found that additional emissions could be even higher. They estimated that Amazon deforestation rates could triple, reaching 25,600 square kilometers a year, if Brazil exited the Paris climate deal, authorized mining on indigenous lands, and enacted other policies Bolsonaro has floated."" Brazil’s presidential election could mean billions of tons of additional greenhouse gases

would take it to 21% of total world CO2 emissions approx.

- but that's not happening, he hasn't exited the Paris agreement and as a minority government it's not going to be easy for him to enact controversial policies. Can turn a blind eye, can't change the regulation.

It's major especially when there's a priority to cut back rapidly to stay within 1.5 C.

However Brazil is very dependent on exports and other countries can put pressure on it to adopt more green policies. That is probably one of the main factors that has kept them within the Paris agreement.

If we get increasing awareness of green issues in the Brazilian population - it is possible they can influence him if they find a voice and if there is more awareness of such issues there.

A new book by Oppenheimer, Oreskes et al. entitled ‘Discerning Experts: The Practices of Scientific Assessment for Environmental Policy‘ makes a case against consensus seeking in climate science assessments.

I have long railed against the consensus-seeking process used by the IPCC (see my previous blog posts on this topic). And particularly, my paper:

Oppenheimer has long voiced concerns about consensus (e.g. his 2007 paper). However, Oreskes has been consensus enforcer in chief, originating the 97% thingy.

I haven’t read their new book, but authors Oreskes, Oppenheimer and Jamison have written an essay on their book in Scientific American, entitled Scientists have been underestimating the rate of climate change.

You can see where this is going from the title of this article; most of this is an attempt to justify alarmism. But they make some interesting points. Excerpts:

<begin quote>

“In our new book, Discerning Experts, we explored the workings of scientific assessments for policy, with particular attention to their internal dynamics, as we attempted to illuminate how the scientists working in assessments make the judgments they do. Among other things, we wanted to know how scientists respond to the pressures—sometimes subtle, sometimes overt—that arise when they know that their conclusions will be disseminated beyond the research community—in short, when they know that the world is watching. The view that scientific evidence should guide public policy presumes that the evidence is of high quality, and that scientists’ interpretations of it are broadly correct. But, until now, those assumptions have rarely been closely examined.”

“Among the factors that appear to contribute to underestimation is the perceived need for consensus, or what we label univocality: the felt need to speak in a single voice. Many scientists worry that if disagreement is publicly aired, government officials will conflate differences of opinion with ignorance and use this as justification for inaction. Others worry that even if policy makers want to act, they will find it difficult to do so if scientists fail to send an unambiguous message. Therefore, they will actively seek to find their common ground and focus on areas of agreement; in some cases, they will only put forward conclusions on which they can all agree.”

“The push toward agreement may also be driven by a mental model that sees facts as matters about which all reasonable people should be able to agree versus differences of opinion or judgment that are potentially irresolvable. If the conclusions of an assessment report are not univocal, then (it may be thought that) they will be viewed as opinions rather than facts and dismissed not only by hostile critics but even by friendly forces. The drive toward consensus may therefore be an attempt to present the findings of the assessment as matters of fact rather than judgment.”

“The combination of these three factors—the push for univocality, the belief that conservatism is socially and politically protective, and the reluctance to make estimates at all when the available data are contradictory—can lead to “least common denominator” results—minimalist conclusions that are weak or incomplete.”

“Moreover, if consensus is viewed as a requirement, scientists may avoid discussing tricky issues that engender controversy (but might still be important), or exclude certain experts whose opinions are known to be “controversial” (but may nevertheless have pertinent expertise). They may also consciously or unconsciously pull back from reporting on extreme outcomes. (Elsewhere we have labeled this tendency “erring on the side of least drama.”) In short, the push for agreement and caution may undermine other important goals, including inclusivity, accuracy and comprehension.”

“In our book, we make some concrete recommendations. While scientists in assessments generally aim for consensus, we suggest that they should not view consensus as a goal of the assessment. Depending on the state of scientific knowledge, consensus may or may not emerge from an assessment, but it should not be viewed as something that needs to be achieved and certainly not as something to be enforced. Where there are substantive differences of opinion, they should be acknowledged and the reasons for them explained (to the extent that they can be explained).Scientific communities should also be open to experimenting with alternative models for making and expressing group judgments, and to learning more about how policy makers actually interpret the findings that result.”

<end quote>

JC reflections

In seeking to defend “it’s worse than we thought” about climate change, Oppenheimer, Oreskes et al. have opened up a welcome can of worms. Consensus seeking and consensus enforcement have trivialized and politicized climate science for decades.

It has been clear for some time that the conclusions of the IPCC Assessment Reports are too tame for the activist/alarmists. In fact, quoting the IPCC is a favored strategy of the so-called ‘contrarians’ (including myself). It remains to be seen if Oreskes can drop the 97% consensus rhetoric (I doubt it).

In twitter discussion on this article, Gavin hits the nail on the head:

Whenever Michael Mann interacts with me, he comes loaded with this statement “uncertainty is not your friend,” “uncertainty is a two-edged sword.” In the same vein, there are two tails to these distributions. The problem is not only extreme events on the high end, but all the neglected natural processes that have been marginalized (e.g. in attribution analyses) or neglected (e.g. in future projections); these natural processes can contribute to tails on both ends of the distribution.

My solution to the problem identified by Gavin is addressed in my new paper, which will be posted tomorrow. Stay tuned.

Lets stop manufacturing consensus about climate change. Lets open up the scientific debate on climate change and celebrate disagreement and use it to push the knowledge frontier of climate science. The whole consensus thing has done little to reduce global CO2 emissions, which was the point of the whole exercise. It’s time for new approaches to both science and policy.",1

Today’s silly story comes from the BBC (where else?)

More ancient monuments and historic ruins will be uncovered as extreme weather caused by climate change gets more frequent, an expert has said.

The remains of a shipwreck off the Abergele coast dating back 150 years was revealed by July’s thunderstorms.

A prehistoric forest and 200 archaeological siteswere also unearthed following extreme weather.

Archaeologist Dr Paul Belford said “you’ll see more and more of this” as the world warms up.

Experts have “tentatively identified” the recently-uncovered Abergele wreck as the 35-tonne wooden sloop Endeavour that sunk without trace in gales in October 1854.

The remains of the 45ft long vessel was found at Pensarn beach in Conwy county by a member of the public.

“The stormy weather created giant waves which moved the sand banks and exposed the boat,” said Dr Belford, chief executive of the Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust.

“You’ll see more and more wrecks and ancient monuments uncovered as extreme weather events become more frequent due to the impact of climate change.

“Like the recent shipwreck find, these discoveries can help us answer the questions of our history.

“Hopefully research will also help us learn lessons from the past and aid the fight against climate change.”

The north Wales shipwreck lies in the area known as Abergele Roads, a large area of shoals, near a tidal pond, which is only visible after storms and during low tides.

It comes after a forest buried under water and sand for more than 4,500 years was uncovered between Ynyslas and Borth in Ceredigion by Storm Hannah in May.

The remains of the trees, preserved in the local peat, were exposed by low tides and high winds.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-49413435

They obviously don’t appreciate the irony of discovering a ship that sank in “extreme weather” in 1854!

And as sea levels are supposedly rising so fast, such wrecks should be unlikely to be found in future.

But what about extreme weather becoming more frequent? The claim comes from an archaeologist, who we can safely assume knows bugger all about the climate.

Proper meteorologists would have told him that the opposite is true. As the world warms, the differential between polar cold and tropical heat should reduce (as the poles warm faster), thus reducing the intensity of storms in the Temperate Zone.

Maybe our archaeologist friend should have read HH Lamb!

1) Great Barrier Reef Is In Much Better Shape Than Climate Alarmists Claim, Australian Environment Minister Confirms

Graham Lloyd, The Australian, 14 August 2019

The Great Barrier Reef is not dead, is not dying and is not even on life support, federal Environment Minister Sussan Ley has declared after her first official visit to the World Heritage-listed site.



Minister of the Environment Sussan Ley snorkelling over the Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Cairns.

Returning from a snorkelling trip to Moore and Flynn reefs offshore from Cairns, Ms Ley was happy yesterday to broadcast the message that tourism operators desperately want heard around the world.

“Today we saw coral that was struggling but we also saw coral that was coming back, that was growing, that was vibrant,” Ms Ley said.

“We saw amazing wildlife, fish, turtles, clams. We saw a reef teeming with life.

“It gives me heart and hope that the future of this magnificent part of the world is a good one.”

Ms Ley said not everything was perfect and there had been areas that were struggling from the ­impact of cyclones.

However, she told The Aus­tralian conditions were better than she had expected.



How scientists mislead the world about the Great Barrier Reef

“I was expecting to see dead areas with a few patches of life,” Ms Ley said.

“I saw the exact ­opposite to that.”

Ms Ley has spent three days touring the coastal area around Cairns speaking to farmers, tourism bodies and reef scientists.

She has backed the concerns of all sides and attempted to avoid some of the more bitter areas of dispute.

These include new water quality regulations for Queensland farmers, calls for better quality ­assurance for reef science and the outsourcing of reef program delivery to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation by the Turnbull ­government.

The Queensland government has introduced new water quality laws to parliament that will more closely monitor and supervise ­fertiliser use and nutrient run-off in Great Barrier Reef catchments.

Marine scientist Peter Ridd has begun a speaking tour in Queensland calling for a new body to check the quality of reef research.

Accompanying Ms Ley on the visit this week has been Great Barrier Reef Foundation managing director Anna Marsden.

The GBR Foundation has been given $444 million by the federal government and is expected to raise matching funds from private donors.

The federal opposition had said it would have withdrawn the funding if it won the federal election.

2) False Alarm II: Monsoon Rebound Prepares Ground For Record Harvest In India

The Economic Times of India, 17 August 2019

NEW DELHI: The rebound in monsoon rainfall has created ideal conditions for agriculture for the rest of the year with accelerated planting and much more water in reservoirs, which officials said would lead to record food production this year.



The habitual climate scare based on short-term weather changes ….

… and the reality of ever-changing weather that expose the habitual failure of climate alarmism

Rainfall in August has been 35% above normal so far, which has further improved crop planting and filled up major reservoirs with 25% more water than the 10-year average.



… and the reality of ever-changing weather that exposes the habitual failure of climate alarmism

This completes the turnaround of the farm situation that looked grim in June when authorities were planning drought-relief measures as rainfall was one-third less than normal and reservoirs were depleting at a time they normally fill up to meet post-monsoon requirement of drinking, irrigation and power generation.

Now the conditions are ripe for a good harvest of the kharif, or summer-sown, crop and higher farm incomes, which in turn should boost festive season demand and to some extent revive sales of vehicles, gold and consumer goods in an economy where companies have been nervous about weak demand.

"Summary: Our elites believe they can shape our minds through propaganda. This is most obvious in the barrage of exaggerations and misrepresentations of climate science, designed to panic us into approving the Green New Deal. Here is an example of how this happens, the news equivalent of turning gold into straw.

Large-scale propaganda works, unless fought. It can mold the opinions of a people – irrespective of its truth. The 20th Century provided enough evidence to put that up with F=MA on the list of proven theories. The current climate alarmist propaganda barrage is on a scale seldom seen in US history. Since there is no longer effective opposition, they can make even the wildest claims. Their preferred method is to take climate science papers, exaggerate their claims (in either scope or certainty). Then journalists use these to manufacture clickbait stories (the 21st C version of “if it bleeds, it leads”).

For example, see this from alarmist Eric Holthaus (a writer at Grist). It has 8k retweets and 16 likes, and was featured in Naked Capitalism’s daily links. Holthaus re-tweets climate scientist Stefan Rahmstorf’s exaggeration of the study’s results, and further exaggerates them into fiction. The new study says none of the things Holthaus describes. Fifty years to melt Antarctica?

A new study confirms that global warming has triggered an irreversible collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, which will alone raise global sea levels by 10 feet. It’s still up to us to decide if that ice takes 500 years to melt, or 50. We are in a climate emergency. https://t.co/gKxVL2E9O6 — Eric Holthaus (@EricHolthaus) August 15, 2019

Unlike Holthaus, the mainstream media published stories that merely exaggerated the paper’s findings from science into revelation. “West Antarctica is melting and it’s our fault” by Alejandra Borunda at the once-great National Geographic – “The fingerprints of human-caused climate change have made it to Antarctica, a new study shows.” “New study definitively links western Antarctic ice melt to human-caused climate change” by Theresa Braine in the NY Daily News. “Human-induced global warming responsible for West Antarctic’s melting ice” by Brooks Hays at UPI.

Some publications produce clickbait headlines over more accurate stories, such as “The Reason Antarctica Is Melting: Shifting Winds, Driven by Global Warming” by Annie Sneed at Scientific America – “A new study helps solve the puzzle of why the continent’s western glaciers are melting so fast” (bold emphasis added).

How did this happen? The origin of propaganda.

The paper is a model of careful science, with careful mention of the many assumptions and uncertainties in their analysis.

“West Antarctic ice loss influenced by internal climate variability and anthropogenic forcing”

By Paul R. Holland, Thomas J. Bracegirdle, Pierre Dutrieux, Adrian Jenkins & Eric J. Steig – in Nature Geoscience, in press.

Gated. Open access copy here.

“Recent ice loss from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet has been caused by ocean melting of ice shelves in the Amundsen Sea. Eastward wind anomalies at the shelf break enhance the import of warm Circumpolar Deep Water onto the Amundsen Sea continental shelf, which creates transient melting anomalies with an approximately decadal period. No anthropogenic influence on this process has been established. “Here, we combine observations and climate model simulations to suggest that increased greenhouse gas forcing caused shelf-break winds to transition from mean easterlies in the 1920s to the near-zero mean zonal winds of the present day. Strong internal climate variability, primarily linked to the tropical Pacific, is superimposed on this forced trend. We infer that the Amundsen Sea experienced decadal ocean variability throughout the twentieth century, with warm anomalies gradually becoming more prevalent, offering a credible explanation for the ongoing ice loss. “Existing climate model projections show that strong future greenhouse gas forcing creates persistent mean westerly shelf-break winds by 2100, suggesting a further enhancement of warm ocean anomalies. These wind changes are weaker under a scenario in which greenhouse gas concentrations are stabilized.”

The authors are to be commended for forthrightly stating in the paper their many assumptions – and the large uncertainties in their modeling. Co-author Eric Steig says this in the title of his RealScience article about this paper, and in the section at the end: “The Antarctic ice sheet is melting and, yeah, it’s probably our fault.”

University press releases are often sensationalist, but not this by the University of Washington: “First evidence of human-caused climate change melting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.” In the usual contradictory style (the best we can hope for today), it boldly states the conclusions of the paper along with cautionary statements that this is a subject still under investigation.

“A new study reveals the first evidence of a direct link between human-induced global warming and melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. …’The impact of human induced climate change on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is not simple,’ said lead author Paul Holland at the British Antarctic Survey. ‘This is the first evidence for a direct link between human activities and the loss of ice from West Antarctica. Our results imply that a combination of human activity and natural climate variations have caused ice loss in this region, accounting for around 4.5 centimeters [1.8 inches] of sea level rise per century.’”

About the future

The extreme scenario discussed in the paper is (quite rightly) RCP8.5, the worst-case scenario in the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report. Properly, they also show that the RCP4.5 scenario produces minimal impact.

“Of course, twenty-first century radiative forcing is not decided. Under RCP4.5, CMIP5 simulations project PITT wind trends that are not significantly different from zero …because ozone recovery fully compensates the weaker greenhouse gas forcing …”

In his RealClimate article, Steig describes RCP8.5 as “business as usual.” Which it is not, since RCP8.5 assumes large changes in long-standing trends of rapid (by historical standards) technological process and falling fertility. There is no evidence for the former, especially since a new industrial revolution appears to have begun – including, among other things, radical changes in energy tech (perhaps even fusion). There is no evidence that global fertility is stabilizing, nor have I seen any plausible case for that happening in the next decade or so.

Conclusion

I’m told by scientists I trust that this is a well-constructed but speculative paper (I agree, FWIW as an amateur). It “shows” and “given evidence” about anthropogenic causes of West Antartic melting. It does not prove anything, and other papers disagree (as Steig explains). It is science, and eventually a consensus will develop – to be reported by the IPCC and major climate agencies. But all this has become a sideshow in the public policy debate about climate change.

The belief that RCP8.5 is a “business as usual” scenario was for a decade the critical link between conventional climate science and activists’ doomsters’ screeds. Now alarmists have abandoned even that as too conservative, saying that “business as usual” means either collapse of civilization or even extinction of humanity.

Now we receive a daily propaganda barrage by climate activists combining the occasional extreme doomsterism (The Extinction Rebellion’s hysteria vs. climate science) with a steady flow of exaggerations and misrepresentations of science. Climate scientists as a group are enablers for this propaganda, even complicit in it, by their silence. For more about this, see About the corruption of climate science. and the “noble cause” corruption of climate science.

We are a a nation lit only by propaganda. How dumb do they think we are? The obvious answer: very. The next few years will prove if they are correct. I do not know how this will play out in the next decade. My guess is “badly.” For US politics, for the US economy, and for the environment.

"Make fun of Al Gore? YouTube will slap a 'Fact Check' on you without your permission.

Michael Loftus admits he’ll grab any excuse to share his Al Gore impression.

Why not? It’s rock solid. Only this time the Big Tech Overlords were listening, too. And, apparently, they weren’t pleased that Loftus poked fun at the “Inconvenient Sequel” star.

The most recent Loftus Party video mocks both the former Vice President as well as President Barack Obama. The latter brought it on himself, to be fair.

The Obamas just bought a $15 million property on Martha’s Vineyard, AKA land kissing the Atlantic Ocean. The move drew plenty of criticism from conservatives, but not for any one-percent complaints.

Why would someone who believes global warming is causing the oceans to rise gobble up coastal property?

It’s a legitimate question, one most journalists refuse to ask. Not Loftus. The conservative comic joined the fray, using comedy to pile on the former President.

RELATED: 9 Films Obsessed with Climate Change

Enter YouTube.

The increasingly liberal channel stepped in, adding its own editorial slant to the video. The comedy clip now features a horizontal addendum below the frame. The text, credited to Wikipedia, describes Global Warming in a clinical fashion.

Is this a new feature at YouTube? Does the platform fact check liberal comedians, too? What about hard news clips exploring the now-debunked Russia collusion hoax? Do they get a horizontal explainer ribbon as well?

Loftus shared the YouTube situation on his latest podcast episode.

“At first, I was’t outraged by it … because they haven’t demonetized the video,” Loftus said. His anger grew the more he drilled into the matter.

“They are playing hardball … I can’t get rid of it,” he says of the info strip.

“They’re trying to do a little Kung Fu on me. ‘You wanna joke about Global Warming? We’re gonna embed a link onto your video with a banner talking about. It’s real, its non disputable, and here’s the link to Wikipedia.’ ”

“Wikipedia?”

RELATED: Damon’s ‘Downsizing’ Fears Climate Change

While Wikipedia feeds answers to voice-activated services like Siri and Alexa, journalists rarely rely on it a reputable news source.

This Loftus kerfuffle isn’t an isolated incident. Conservative pundit and Fox News contributor Dan Bongino says his YouTube videos are routinely demonetized shortly after being posted, but YouTube reverses that call the following day.

That matters since the first day a video tied to a news-related show launches is often its most trafficked window.

PragerU is squaring off against YouTube to court, again, for its consistent attacks on its wildly popular channel. The service lost the first round of the legal fight earlier this year.

Conservative comic Steven Crowder also tangled with the video service, getting demonetized in the process for his squabble with a gay journalist.

It’s part of a larger issue where Big Tech clamps down on conservatives while giving many liberals a pass. Far-left actor Ron Perlman recently found himself briefly suspended by Twitter for wishing death on the surviving Koch brother, Charles, hours after David Koch passed.

Yesterday Twitter slapped me with a 12-hour ban for a tweet referencing the Koch brothers.

Though activity has been above average in Amazonas and to a lesser extent in Rondônia, it has been below average in Mato Grosso and Pará, according to the Global Fire Emissions Database”

NYT tamps down hysteria: ‘Much of the land that is burning was not old-growth rain forest, but land that had already been cleared of trees and set for agricultural use’

Amazon rainforest fires at record high levels? ‘This is a blatant lie’ – Fires ‘nowhere close to a record so far in 2019’ “2019 fires are way up, over 2018. That is correct. What they don’t say, is that about 1/2 the years BEFORE 2019 are higher, and about 1/2 are lower. Cherry picking of the first order.”

The article goes on to reveal why the Washington Post and other mainstream media outlets are so willing to distort science and bash Brazil.

WaPo excerpt: “Brazil’s climate change denial is isolating the country,” said Mauricio Santoro, a professor of international relations at Rio de Janeiro’s state university. “It is a theme of the global agenda, and Brazil plays a central role, whether it wants to or not, because of the Amazon, because of its biodiversity.” And because of what’s happening now.

"One day after reporting, “These fires were not caused by climate change,” The New York Times blamed the ongoing Amazon rain forest fires on....climate change.

In Sunday’s Times, Johannesburg bureau chief Norimitsu Onishi falsely conflated the Amazon rain forest fires in Brazil with global warming in “Europe Tries to Fill Void On Climate Left by U.S.,” a two-for-one story that blamed both President Trump and Brazil's ""far right"" president Jair Bolsonaro for failing to act on ""climate change."" A photo showing burning forest had a caption that underlined the purported connection: “Europe ‘has to be a green superpower,’ a member of Parliament said, as the Amazon burned.”

Onishi either fell victim to a lazy leftist assumption that the wildfires in the Amazonian rain forest were somehow connected to global warming, or else did his best to force the connection himself (click ""expand""):

As the Amazon burned and the world faced an ecological disaster, President Emmanuel Macron of France bluntly criticized Brazil’s leader this week and threatened to kill a major trade deal between Europe and Brazil. President Trump, on the other hand, posted a tweet only Friday evening, saying that the United States was ready to help contain the fires, but adding that “future trade prospects” between the United States and Brazil “are very exciting.” The contrast highlighted the gap in leadership on issues affecting the global climate. As the Trump administration denies established climate science and has abandoned an international accord intended to fight global warming, European leaders have energetically stepped in to take up the mantle of leadership.

Onishi made sure to get some hostile labeling in:

By week’s end, the global condemnation led by Mr. Macron appeared to have chastened President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, a far-right populist and climate change skeptic. (....) But given Mr. Trump’s position on climate, and the absence of China as well as Russia, the talks are not likely to lead to significant change, said Jean Jouzel, a leading French climate expert.

Theirs is only one problem with talking about the rain forest blazes and climate policy: These fires were not caused by climate change. We know that from an unimpeachable source, the New York Times, in an explainer story on Saturday by Alexandria Symonds, which helpfully states:

These fires were not caused by climate change. They were, by and large, set by humans. However, climate change can make fires worse. Fires can burn hotter and spread more quickly under warmer and drier conditions.

Still, Onishi barged forward, using the manmade (!) fires in Brazil to blame Trump and Brazil’s leader Bolsonaro for ignoring global warming:

“The international scene now lacks dynamism in the fight against global warming,” said Mr. Jouzel, who was vice chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2007 when it won the Nobel Prize. “To effectively combat global warming, all countries must look in the same direction.”

This isn’t the first time Onishi has wrongly placed blame. In 2006, he wrote that ""Reaganesque policies of deregulation, privatization, spending cuts and tax breaks for the rich” were blame for inequality....in Japan.",1
"Greta Thunberg doesn’t go to school, because adults around her have convinced her the climate situation is simply too bad. Instead she is traveling on an expensive yacht to the US, preaching imminent doom as a “magnet for hope.” She has been told that children had a much brighter future when CO2 levels were lower, like a century ago. Greta believes greenhouse gases cause catastrophic heatwaves, natural disasters and disease, which will ruin her future..

It is easy enough to test that idea out, by looking at how children lived a century ago – at lower CO2 levels. On this date in 1916, children were out of school for different reasons. New York Public Schools were shut down due to a polio epidemic.

The polio epidemic spread all over the country. This 1916 photo was taken in Billings, Montana. (At least the children didn’t have to face an extra 0.0001 mole fraction CO2 in the atmosphere.)

And what about the weather? On this date in 1916, there were 100 degree temperatures from Oregon to upstate New York. Adrian, Michigan was the hottest place in the country at 106 degrees.

https://news.sky.com/story/rising-temperatures-will-make-hajj-pilgrimages-to-mecca-dangerous-says-study-11791357?utm_source=po.st&utm_medium=referral

British Muslims are being urged to take the lead on fighting climate change as a study suggests rising temperatures will make pilgrimages to Mecca dangerous.

The Hajj, one of the five pillars of Muslim faith, takes place in and around the city situated in a desert valley in western Saudi Arabia.

All Muslims are expected to take part at least once in their lifetime, if their health and finances allow.

Image: The pilgrimage lasts for five or six days

The timings of the annual religious event shift each year because it is based on the lunar calendar, and it involves spending around 20 to 30 hours outdoors over a period of around five or six days.

The Saudis want to increase the number of pilgrims to 10 million by 2030.

Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in California say rising global temperatures could push up heat and humidity in the region in the hottest summer months to the extent that people face “extreme danger” to their health.

The Hajj is done – but challenges lie ahead for its future A vast army of workers have begun the task of clearing the detritus left on the roads ready for next year.

Elfatih Eltahir, the civil and environmental engineer who led the research, said: “When the Hajj happens in summer, you can imagine, with climate change and increasing heat-stress levels, conditions could be unfavourable for outdoor activity.",1
"BERLIN (Project Syndicate) — According to the latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world’s main scientific authority on global warming, keeping global temperatures from rising more than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels is a feasible goal. The IPCC's stance represents a move in the direction of the kind of “radical realism” that many civil-society actors have long advocated.

The IPCC does not bet on geo-engineering proposals — for example, deep-ocean sequestration of massive amounts of atmospheric carbon dioxide, or “dimming the sun” by spraying the atmosphere with aerosols — to combat global warming. These largely theoretical solutions could have untold consequences for people and ecosystems, worsening not only the climate crisis, but also the other social and ecological crises we face.

Instead, the IPCC focuses on how we can avoid crossing the 1.5°C threshold in the first place. We must, it asserts, decarbonize the global economy immediately to ensure that global CO2 emissions decline by about 45% by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050.

Limiting global temperatures to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels is the only way to achieve social justice while protecting our environment from devastating climate change. And, contrary to prevailing wisdom, it’s not an impossible goal.

Achieving this will require not just transforming economic activity, but also confronting destructive power dynamics and social inequalities. “Radical Realism for Climate Justice,” a new anthology published by the Heinrich Böll Foundation, sets out strategies developed by international civil-society and social movements to bring about such change.

In line with the IPCC's core message, we urgently need a politically managed decline in fossil-fuel production. This means putting a brake on oil, coal, and gas production and exploration. As the group Oil Change International notes, it does not mean abrupt or panicked action that could lead to a “sudden and dramatic shut-down of fossil fuel production, stranding assets, damaging economies, and harming workers and communities reliant on the energy sector.”

In building up the renewable-energy sector, we should avoid replicating systems that have driven inequality and entrenched damaging power dynamics in the fossil-fuel sector and other industries. This means replacing the market-based, investor-focused approach to energy production with one that treats energy as a public good, while engineering a shift toward social ownership and management of energy supplies.

Rooted in energy sovereignty and self-determination, this approach would spur faster decarbonization, including by weakening vested interests’ power to resist change. It would also facilitate the restructuring of energy systems to serve social and ecological needs.

Another system-level transformation that would facilitate major emissions reductions would be the creation of a zero-waste circular economy, whereby everything we produce and consume returns safely to nature or is recycled and reused.

Consider textiles production, which in 2015 generated greenhouse-gas emissions totaling 1.2 billion tons of CO2-equivalents. These massive emissions — more than the combined total for all international flights and maritime shipping — reflect a “fast fashion” culture that produces garments as cheaply as possible, with the expectation of constant turnover in people’s wardrobes. If each garment were replaced half as often, the industry’s total greenhouse-gas emissions would plummet by 44%.

A zero-waste circular economy for textiles would include not just more use of the clothes that are produced, but also improved recycling and repurposing of materials, to avoid emissions-producing waste-disposal processes like incineration. The biggest gains would come from the introduction of less wasteful production processes.

Important steps should also be taken regarding land use (encompassing agriculture and zoning changes). As the international peasant’s movement La Via Campesina shows, the industrial food system’s emissions — including those from production, fertilizers, transport, processing, packaging, cooling, and food waste, and from deforestation associated with the expansion of industrial agriculture — account for 44% to 57% of the global total.

A peasant agro-ecological production system based on food sovereignty, small-scale farming, and agro-ecology could, La Via Campesina argues, halve carbon emissions from agriculture within a few decades. This approach is proven to work: small-scale farmers, peasants, fishers, indigenous communities, rural workers, women, and youth already feed 70% of the world’s population, while using only 25% of its agricultural resources.

There is also a need to restore natural ecosystems that have been destroyed.

Forests and peatlands, in particular, can sequester several hundred gigatons of CO2 from the atmosphere. Their restoration would protect not just biodiversity, but also local people, including the indigenous communities whose land-tenure rights have been systematically violated. In fact, retaining and expanding the land area under management by indigenous peoples and local communities could protect over 1,000 GtCO2 worth of carbon stocks.

According to a report by the Climate, Land, Ambition, and Rights Alliance, ecosystem-based approaches in the land sector and agro-ecological changes to food production and consumption systems — including more local ownership — could deliver 13 GtCO2eq per year in avoided emissions, and almost 10 GtCO2eq annually in sequestered carbon by 2050. The result would be 448 GtCO2 in cumulative removals by 2100 — around 10 times current global annual emissions.

Limiting global temperatures to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels is our best hope of containing the effects of a climate crisis born of historical injustices and deep-rooted inequities.

The only way to succeed will be to undertake a shift to a new socioeconomic system. This means abandoning the single-minded obsession with gross domestic product growth — which has facilitated the proliferation of wasteful production and consumption patterns and fueled economic and social inequality and injustice — in favor of a public-goods approach that serves genuinely to make people’s lives better.

Demanding such a transformation is not “naive” or “politically unfeasible.” It is radically realistic. In fact, it is the only way we can achieve social justice while protecting our environment from devastating climate change.

"The MSM and other liberals are going nuts about the Amazon wildfires, but instead of being honest, they are rainforest fear-mongering.

The fires are bad but not as bad as we are being told, many of the pictures being used to show the fire are from older Amazon wildfires or are showing wildfires that arent from the Amazon, but totally different parts of the world.

French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted out that he wanted to put the Amazon fires on the agenda for the G-7.

The picture Macron tweeted was not of the 2019 wildfires, they can’t be because the photographer who took the picture, passed away in 2003.

Macron followed that tweet by raising a white flag (France wasn’t attacked, but surrendering is a French tradition).

Truth be told, the reports by the MSM and leftist politicians and celebrities can be explained by the famous Rahm Emanuel line, “never let a crisis go to waste.”

The New York Post reported:

Fires are common in Brazil in the annual dry season, but they are more widespread this year. Brazilian experts reported nearly 77,000 wildfires across the country so far this year, up 85% over the same period in 2018. It is unclear how much of what is burning was already deforested for agriculture.

The NY Times answers:

Much of the land that is burning was not old-growth rain forest, but land that had already been cleared of trees and set for agricultural use.

Gee, I guess that means it’s not the end of the world. This time of year, farmers and ranchers in tropical areas burn their fields to control pests and weeds and to encourage new growth in pastures.

How bad is the fire activity?

According to data from NASA, available on Global Forest Watch, Brazil had 39% more fires between January and August 2019 than in the same period in 2018. However, the years with the most fires recorded were primarily in the early 2000s, probably linked to a high rate of agriculture-related deforestation in the Amazon at that time. This year’s fires are well below that level for the period January through August (though note that 2019 figures only include data through August 22). So far, 2019 is on track to be the third-highest year for fires since 2010.

Before 2010 the fire activity was much worse:

If the Amazon didn’t burn away in 2005, 2007, or 2010, the 2019 levels aren’t going to wipe out the rainforest either.

But there’s more, per the MSM, it’s not just that the Amazon Rainforest is going to burn up and disappear, but we are going to run out of oxygen and suffocate.

The Amazon is often referred to as ""the lungs of the planet."" It's home to 10% of the world's species and creates 20% of our oxygen.

Liberal celebs also tried to convince everyone that the world was ending:

Dr. Jonanathan Foley, Global environmental scientist and Executive Director of Project Drawdown, which focuses on climate solutions, destroys the 20% myth.

Also, the forests are being replaced by pastures and croplands, which also do photosynthesis and produce similar amounts of oxygen. — Dr. Jonathan Foley (@GlobalEcoGuy) August 23, 2019

It’s biologically and physically impossible for the Amazon to produce 20% of the world’s oxygen. Plus, those rainforests will be replaces with soybean fields and pastures that also do photosynthesis and produce oxygen at similar, or higher, rates. This is not an issue. — Dr. Jonathan Foley (@GlobalEcoGuy) August 23, 2019

And, this doesn’t even address oxygen *consumption* by living things — like animals and microbes. It turns out that the Amazon ecosystem consumes, on average, about as much oxygen as it produces. That’s true for most ecosystems. — Dr. Jonathan Foley (@GlobalEcoGuy) August 23, 2019

And for those planning to blame the wildfires on the climate change hypothesis, I invite them to refer to professional meteorologist, weather forecaster, and a twitter feed you should regularly read— Joe Bastardi:

Does @LeoDiCaprio et al and all the rainforest burning hypers know much of the area has had above normal rainfall this year, or the oceans around S America are cooling, and much of S America normal to below temps?

Here’s the bottom line folks. No one wants to see the fires in the Amazon Rainforest continue. But the media and other liberals are not being honest with you. They are displaying pictures that are much worse than the real Amazon wildfires. This is not the worst case of wildfires in the Amazon, they were much worse a decade ago. And the Amazon does not supply 20% of the world’s oxygen levels, the real number is less than a third of that number. Even if the Amazon were totally destroyed (which won’t happen) it would be thousands of years before we have an oxygen problem.

"Climate Hysteria Threatens To Break West Apart At G7 Summit

BIARRITZ, France (Reuters) – U.S. President Donald Trump arrived in France on Saturday for what promises to be a fraught meeting of major industrialized nations, with friction over trade, climate change and Iran likely to snarl the talks.

The three-day Group of Seven meeting in the Atlantic seaside resort of Biarritz takes place amid sharp differences over a clutch of global issues that risk further dividing a group of countries already struggling to speak with one voice.

Summit host French President Emmanuel Macron wants the heads of Britain, Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States to focus on the defense of democracy, gender equality, education and the environment and has invited Asian, African and Latin American leaders to join them for a global push on these issues.

However, in a bleak assessment of relations between once-united Western allies, European Council President Donald Tusk acknowledged it would be hard to find common ground, denouncing “senseless disputes” between G7 capitals.

“This is another G7 summit which will be a difficult test of unity and solidarity of the free world and its leaders,” he told reporters ahead of the Biarritz gathering.

“It is increasingly difficult, for all of us, to find common language and the world needs more of our cooperation, not less,” he said, adding: “This may be the last moment to restore our political community.”

G7 may end without communique due to gaps on trade, climate-NHK

Aug 20 (Reuters) – The Group of Seven (G7) leaders summit to be held this weekend in France may end without a joint communique due to wide gaps between member nations on trade and climate issues, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported on Tuesday.

It would be the first time a G7 summit ends without a communique since meetings began in 1975, NHK said.

Finding common ground between allies has become increasingly tough at the annual summit with the United States an outlier in its approach to handling disputes over trade and the environment.

U.S. President Donald Trump has expressed his preference for bilateral trade pacts over multilateral agreements and is locked in a lengthy trade war with China.

Trump also pulled the United States out of the landmark Paris agreement to limit the effects of climate change against European opposition.",1
"Climate Hysteria May Destroy Western Airlines, Quantas Boss Warns

Qantas CEO Alan Joyce has warned that global warming panic could bring the aviation industry to a halt, saying additional airline taxes could take the world back to the 1920s.

While green activists campaign against flying in most Western nations, China is planning to build over 200 new airports by the year 2035, almost doubling its current number.

Speaking at the Centre for Aviation summit in Sydney this week, Mr Joyce hit back at climate change hysteria and ‘flight shaming’.

Mr Joyce referenced an increase in the amount of global warming rallies being held globally and a rise in activists criticising travellers who fly, The Australian reported.

‘We don’t want to go back to the 1920s and not have air ­travel. We need to make sure that we keep the baby, because it is important for the world economy to have connections,’ he said.

He pointed out that the airline industry had made a difference to the world in terms of economic trade and job creation.

‘We know there’s an environmental impact, but the things we’re doing as an industry are fantastic. We have targets by 2050 to reduce our CO2 emissions to half the levels of 2005,’ he said.

Just last month, the French government announced an ‘eco-tax’ on all flights out of airports in France, which would rack up $300 million per year.

Passengers in The Netherlands have are now being slugged a levy of $11.60, amid calls for the European Union to enforce taxes across the whole continent.

Mr Joyce said the aim of the new tariffs is to limit commercial flights by slugging customers and airlines more.",1
"News Brief by Kip Hansen

The news channels, newspapers, news sites and the Twit-o-verse are full of “the Amazon is burning!” some of this was covered in here as “ Amazon Fire History Since 2003 ” by Les Johnson on August 23.

Years ago, I asked the question “What Are They Really Counting?”. Always an important question when figures are being thrown about and talk is of scary numbers or records set or the numbers being scandalous. Nice numbers . . . but what are they really counting?

Here’s the number of fires:

This year, 2019, as of 21 August, is running a hair below 2016. There are two years since 2003 higher.

But for current Amazon fires, we want to know: not just the number of fires (for which the NY Times has quite a different number than Global Fire Data, which is shown above). . . .but instead:

What is burning?

It is natural to think that because the news is all full of stories stating that “The Amazon Rain Forest is burning” — well, one might think that the Amazon Rain Forest is burning.

However, that is not true, according to a brave journalist — Alexandria Symonds — at the NY Times (kudos kudos & kudos to her…) . She reports:

“Natural fires in the Amazon are rare, and the majority of these fires were set by farmers preparing Amazon-adjacent farmland for next year’s crops and pasture. Much of the land that is burning was not old-growth rain forest, but land that had already been cleared of trees and set for agricultural use.” Our brave journalists skates close to the dangerous edge of violating Editorial Mandates by telling readers: “Did climate change cause these fires, and how will they affect climate change? These fires were not caused by climate change. They were, by and large, set by humans. However, climate change can make fires worse. Fires can burn hotter and spread more quickly under warmer and drier conditions.” [Note: there is no mention of actual conditions of temperature or rainfall concurrent with these fires in the article, as usual for when climate is being blamed — just the implication that “climate change will makes things worse” without any data. — kh]

Bottom Line:

What is Burning? Mostly land previously cleared for agriculture. Some of these fires have gotten out of control along the edges of still-forested land.

How many fires? About as many at this time of year in 2016.

Deforestation? Deforestation of the Amazon has been ongoing, but it has been down trending since 1985, according to the graph above from the Times.

Authors Comment Policy:

I am glad to be able to commend a NY Times journalist — a rare opportunity. Unfortunately, her “by…” page is currently down but I know that “Alexandria Symonds is a senior staff editor at The Times.” I guess she has some slack from Editorial Narratives.

I just thought that readers should know the basic facts about the Amazon fires.

Note that the NY Times is also calling out “fake news” photos of the Amazon Fires.

Start comments with “Kip…” if speaking to me.

"Breaking News: Dr Tim Ball Defeats Michael Mann’s Climate Lawsuit!

Written by John O'Sullivan

Supreme Court of British Columbia dismisses Dr Michael Mann’s defamation lawsuit versus Canadian skeptic climatologist, Dr Tim Ball. Full legal costs are awarded to Dr Ball, the defendant in the case.

The Canadian court issued it’s final ruling in favor of the Dismissal motion that was filed in May 2019 by Dr Tim Ball’s libel lawyers.

The plaintiff Mann’s “hockey stick” graph, first published in 1998, was featured prominently in the U.N. 2001 climate report. The graph showed an “unprecedented” spike in global average temperature in the 20th Century after about 500 years of stability.

Skeptics have long claimed Mann’s graph was fraudulent.

On Friday morning (August 23, 2019) Dr Ball sent an email to WUWT revealing:

“Michael Mann’s Case Against Me Was Dismissed This Morning By The BC Supreme Court And They Awarded Me [Court] Costs.”

A more detailed public statement from the world-renowned skeptical climatologist is expected in due course.

Professor Mann is a climate professor at Penn State University. Mann filed his action on March 25, 2011 for Ball’s allegedly libelous statement that Mann “belongs in the state pen, not Penn State.” The final court ruling, in effect, vindicates Ball’s criticisms.

Previously, on Feb, 03, 2010, a self-serving and superficial academic ‘investigation‘ by Pennsylvania State University had cleared Mann of misconduct. Mann also falsely claimed the NAS found nothing untoward with his work.

But the burden of proof in a court of law is objectively higher.

Not only did the B.C. Supreme Court grant Ball’s application for dismissal of the 8-year, multi-million dollar lawsuit, it also took the additional step of awarding full legal costs to Ball.

This extraordinary outcome will likely trigger severe legal repercussions for Dr Mann in the U.S. and may prove fatal to alarmist climate science claims that modern temperatures are “unprecedented.”

According to the leftist The Guardian newspaper (Feb, 09, 2010), the wider importance of Mann’s graph over the last 20 years is massive:

“Although it was intended as an icon of global warming, the hockey stick has become something else – a symbol of the conflict between mainstream climate scientists and their critics.”

Under court rules, Mann’s legal team have up to 30 days to file an appeal. For readers interested in accessing the court website directly, use this link.

‘Hockey Stick’ Discredited by Statisticians in 2003

In 2003 a Canadian study showed the “hockey stick” curve “is primarily an artefact of poor data handling, obsolete data and incorrect calculation of principal components.” When the data was corrected it showed a warm period in the 15th Century that exceeded the warmth of the 20th Century.

So, the graph was junk science. You could put baseball scores into Mann’s Climate Model and it would create the Hockey Stick.

But the big question then became: did Mann intentionally falsify his graph from motivation to make profit and/or cause harm (i.e. commit the five elements of criminal fraud)?

No one could answer that question unless Mann surrendered his numbers. He was never going to do that voluntarily – or face severe consequences for not doing so – that is, until Dr Ball came into the picture!

Evidence in Legal Discovery and the Truth Defense

Dr Ball’s legal team adroitly pursued the ‘truth defense’ such that the case boiled down to whether Ball’s words (“belongs in the state pen, not Penn State”) after examining the key evidence (Mann’s R2 regression numbers) fairly and accurately portrayed Mann.

The aim was to compel the plaintiff (Dr. Mann) to show his math ‘working out’ to check if he knowingly and criminally misrepresented his claims by resorting to statistical fakery (see: ‘Mike’s trick‘ below).

In the pre-trial Discovery Process the parties are required to surrender the cited key evidence in reasonable fashion, that they believe proves or disproves the Claim.

Despite Ball’s best efforts over 8 years, Mann would not agree to surrender to an open court his math ‘working out’ – those arcane R2 regression numbers for his graph (see Mann’s latest obfuscating Tweet in the ‘update’ at foot of this article).

But throughout 2017 and 2018 any reasonable observer could see through such endless delays from the plaintiff – all just attritional tactics.

The Penn State professor had persistently refused to honor the binding “concessions” agreement he made to Ball which ultimately gave his legal team the coup de grace to win the case for the defendant due to Mann’s ‘Bad Faith’ (see: legal definition here).

Dr. Ball always argued that those numbers, if examined in open court, would have conclusively proved Mann was motivated to commit a criminal fraud. It was at this point legal minds could discern Ball was closing in on victory – a triumph for ‘David over Goliath.’

And Mann certainly is a science ‘Goliath.’ Ever since featuring so famously in the UN IPCC 2001 Third Assessment Report (TAR) Mann’s graph has been an iconic image cited relentlessly by environmentalists clamoring for urgent action on man-made global warming.

For the past two decades the biased mainstream media has acclaimed Mann as “a world-leading climate scientist” and last year he was heralded as their champion to help dethrone “climate denier” President Trump.

Indeed, not just a fawning MSM, but many hundreds of subsequent climate studies have relied on Mann’s findings. Mann’s reputation was such, that most climate researchers merely accepted his graph, a typical example of groupthink.

Dr Ball has long warned that if the world was permitted to see behind the secrecy they would be shocked at just how corrupt and self-serving are those ‘scientists’ at the forefront of man-made global warming propaganda.

As anyone can tell by contrasting and comparing the graphs below (Mann’s version top, Ball’s below) it is obvious there exists a massive discrepancy in the respective findings.

Above: contrast and compare Dr Mann’s dodgy graph with Dr Ball’s more reliable version (based on that of the renowned H. H. Lamb) and see how Mann fraudulently altered the proxy climate date with a ‘hockey stick’ shape to falsely show the dramatic uptick with modern temperatures rising ‘catastrophically’ to fit the fake UN IPCC doomsaying narrative.

Have Skeptics Ever Proven that Mann’s Graph was Deliberately Faked?

Answer: No. This is because Mann has always refused to release his R2 regression numbers for independent examination.

He claimed his secrecy was justified because he held “proprietary rights” over them (i.e. personally valuable intellectual work product, you see). So “valuable” to Mann was the secrecy of his metadata that losing a multi-million dollar lawsuit and his reputation was the ultimate price he was prepared to pay.

While steep, I guess, that’s preferable to serving a long federal prison stretch, right?

Before Ball’s glorious court victory, little more could be conclusively proven other than the hockey stick graph uptick stupidly (and unscientifically) relies on the proxy evidence from the tree rings of a single Yamal larch!

Mann could thus sleep safe in the knowledge that as long as statistical experts remain deprived of any conclusive proof of his intent to defraud, they could only find him guilty of incompetence.

Putting Mann’s Fraudulent Graph Under the Microscope

For an easy-viewing summary by Tim Ball please watch the video:

Mann’s goal was to make the Little Ice Age (LIA) disappear, as we explained in our previous article on this issue. The LIA was an especially cold era that ended around 1840 and since then global temperatures have gradually risen. But government ‘experts’ like Mann have sought to use statistical trickery to make such natural variation appear as ‘man-made’ warming.

Apart from playing with statistics Mann made his proxy fit the thermometer data by adding thermometer values to the proxy values known as “Mike’s trick” in the climate gate email scandal.

From the emails released during the Climategate scandal Professor Phil Jones, Britain’s top climate scientist at the University of East Anglia was shown to have written the following to his alarmist colleagues (some analysis here).

The email, sent by Prof Phil Jones of the CRU in 1999, states:

Dear Ray, Mike and Malcolm,

Once Tim’s got a diagram here we’ll send that either later today or

first thing tomorrow.

I’ve just completed Mike’s Nature tric k of adding in the real temps

to each series for the last 20 years (ie from 1981 onwards) amd from

1961 for Keith’s to hide the decline. Mike’s series got the annual

land and marine values while the other two got April-Sept for NH land

N of 20N. The latter two are real for 1999, while the estimate for 1999

for NH combined is +0.44C wrt 61-90. The Global estimate for 1999 with

data through Oct is +0.35C cf. 0.57 for 1998.

Thanks for the comments, Ray. Cheers

Phil

This has the Hockey Stick Graph showing the same cooling from 1942 to 1975 as the HadCRUT3 data as posted in the IPCC 2001 AR3

In 1942 there was just 4.0Gt of emissions increasing to 17.1Gt by 1975 but since this 425% increase in CO 2 emissions didn’t cause any global warming during this 33 year period; the conjecture of CO 2 emissions induced (catastrophic) global warming was proven false.

Readers interested in gaining a deeper understanding of what is likely to eventually be exposed as a criminal conspiracy between Mann and other ‘elite’ researchers should see “The Hockey Stick Illusion” by Andrew Montford.

The Guardian newspaper (above) expressing doubts over ‘(Michael) Mann-made’ global warming.

Victory that Comes at Great Personal Cost

Behind the scenes, gathering the resources, mental, scientific and financial, there is an untold burden of defending these cynical SLAPP suits.

Lest readers forget, it is mostly in the service of misguided public policy, with massive funding and connivance from political operators in play, that fake scientists like Michael Mann and Andrew Weaver acquired such esteemed public positions.

They are not only despicable human beings they are a disgrace to all decent scientists.

Readers will be aware that this author has been a staunch friend and ally to Tim throughout the hardships of this protracted 8-year legal battle.

Our reputations were routinely trashed by our enemies, so it is sweet justice that the court has now given legal credence to Tim’s famous words that Michael Mann “belongs in the state pen, not Penn State,” a comical reference to the fraudulent ‘hockey stick’ graph that knowledgeable scientists knew to be fakery.

[Author Note: Being very much a party to these legal proceedings (having provided Dr Ball with the financial security of a legally-binding indemnity in the event Tim lost) it is a monumental vindication of my faith in Tim’s cause. In effect, I ‘bet the farm’ on Tim winning, as graciously reported by Jo Nova (below)]

Knowingly Fraudulent and Corrupt

During 2018, while Tim Ball’s hard work was winning “concessions” from Mann’s legal team in Canada, south of the border, (on April 20) a shameless Mann wrote in Scientific American this utter nonsense:

“Yet, in the 20 years since the original hockey stick publication, independent studies, again and again, have overwhelmingly reaffirmed our findings, including the key conclusion: recent warming is unprecedented over at least the past millennium.”

Gullible and brainwashed greens and the many self-serving politicians swallowed up this garbage.

Dr Ball Expresses Gratitude to Principia Scientific International

Speaking in this 2018 video on the gravity of what some scientists have called “The science trial of the Century,” Dr Ball revealed his gratitude to his colleagues at Principia Scientific:

Dr Tim Ball:

I know John O’Sullivan who set up the Principia site and I know I wrote a foreword and a chapter in one of the books they produced called Slaying the Sky Dragon. John O’Sullivan comes from his anti-government [stance], very legitimately and unfortunately, it’s not until you’ve actually directly personally experienced that; challenging the government – that you realize how nasty they can get. So John knows very well how nasty these things can get – that anyone that dares to challenge the authorities. And so, Principia was set up for that reason, and John was the one that helped me set up the PayPal so people could help me financially so, that’s my disclaimer with that.”

As Jo Nova reported on the joannenova.com.au blog:

“John O’Sullivan is putting in above and beyond what any single skeptical soul ought to. He’s already been a key figure helping Tim Ball in the legal fight with the UVA establishment, which has spent over a million dollars helping Michael Mann to hide emails. The case was launched by Michael Mann, but could turn out to do a huge favor to skeptics — the discovery process is a powerful tool, and we all know who has been hiding their methods, their data, and their work-related correspondence. Tim Ball and John O’Sullivan are helping all the free citizens of the West. The burden should not be theirs alone. There are many claims for help at the moment, but that is a sign that the grand scam is coming to a head. Jo”

Two out of Two Major Court Wins By Ball Versus Junk IPCC Scientists

Dr Ball, now affirmed as a courageous champion of honest science, has assured his place in the annals of real climate science. His gift to the world was sacrificing eight of his senior years, when he could have been enjoying his retirement, to exposing key players in the biggest science fraud of all time.

People too easily forget Dr Ball has defeated in expensive legal battles not just one top UN IPCC climate scientists, but two!

This latest victory is the second this champion of climate skepticism has enjoyed in the last 18 months in this same jurisdiction – both for “defamation,” both multi-million dollar climate science claims.

We reported (February 15, 2018) on Dr Ball’s first crucial courtroom win against Dr Andrew Weaver (photo, above), another elite junk scientist (a UN IPCC Lead Author in climate modeling) and British Columbia Green Party Leader.

Pointedly, at the time, Dr Ball wanted to emphasize an extremely salient fact:

“While I savor the victory, people need to know that it was the second of three lawsuits all from the same lawyer,Roger McConchie, (photo, left) in Vancouver on behalf of members of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).”

In effect, there is more than mere coincidence that Dr Ball, a world-leading skeptical climatologist, was systematically targeted for legal retribution time and again by political groups such as the unscrupulous Climate Science Legal Defense Fund .

As a retired scientist in his 80’s, Tim was a ‘soft target’ and the stress of these lawsuits put an enormous toll on his health.

Not to be outdone, Tim has used his time wisely to write a damning book of the 30-year back story of the great climate fraud titled ‘The Deliberate Corruption of Climate Science’ and I heartily recommend that interested readers buy it.

It is also not often reported that the funding in Canada for these extravagant SLAPP lawsuits is believed to be from the David Suzuki Foundation, a hot house for extreme environmental advocacy and Big Green policy promotion.

What is a ‘Strategic lawsuit against public participation’ (SLAPP Suit)?

Wikipedia offers a fair definition:

“A strategic lawsuit against public participation (SLAPP) is a lawsuit that is intended to censor, intimidate, and silence critics by burdening them with the cost of a legal defense until they abandon their criticism or opposition.[1] Such lawsuits have been made illegal in many jurisdictions on the grounds that they impede freedom of speech. In the typical SLAPP, the plaintiff does not normally expect to win the lawsuit. The plaintiff’s goals are accomplished if the defendant succumbs to fear, intimidation, mounting legal costs, or simple exhaustion and abandons the criticism. In some cases, repeated frivolous litigation against a defendant may raise the cost of directors and officers liability insurance for that party, interfering with an organization’s ability to operate.[2] A SLAPP may also intimidate others from participating in the debate.”

Update (August 24, 2019):

Dr Mann Has Posted On Twitter In Reply To This Article:

Mann’s statement is here: https://twitter.com/MichaelEMann/status/1164910044414189568

In short, Mann’s ugly responsive legal statement is (a) stark admission he lost fair and square, and (b) a disingenuous argument that the Dismissal was granted merely on the basis of Mann’s “delay” in not submitting his R2 numbers in timely fashion.

Well, Mikey, you are the plaintiff and Tim gave you over 8 YEARS to get your case together!

On that point, this is where readers may wish to refer to the article ‘Fatal Courtroom Act Ruins Michael ‘Hockey Stick’ Mann‘ (July 4, 2017). In it we offered analysis as to Mann’s fatal legal error. As Dr Ball explained at that time:

“Michael Mann moved for an adjournment of the trial scheduled for February 20, 2017. We had little choice because Canadian courts always grant adjournments before a trial in their belief that an out of court settlement is preferable. We agreed to an adjournment with conditions. The major one was that he [Mann] produce all documents including computer codes by February 20th, 2017. He failed to meet the deadline.”

As I explained in the article, Mann (and his crooked lawyer) had shown bad faith, thereby rendering his case liable for dismissal. I urged Tim to pursue that winning tactic and thankfully he did.

AN APPEAL

Assisting Dr Ball has been a huge honor for me and probably one of the greatest achievements of my life. But Tim only won this famous courtroom battle thanks to massive worldwide grassroots support.

We can only continue to fight these protracted lawsuits with your kind support. Please give generously to ensure we can take on more crucial cases, such as this.

Since Greta is a young girl with autism, any real criticism of the misinformation she repeats to the United Nations and to the world is beyond the pale.

"Original title before update: Breaking: Dr. Tim Ball wins @MichaelEMann lawsuit – Mann has to pay

See the update below.

Readers surely recall that the easily offended Dr. Michael Mann launched a court case for defamation against climate skeptic Dr. Tim Ball of Canada.

In Feburary 2018 there was a complete dismissal in the lawsuit brought against Dr. Ball by Andrew Weaver of Canada, also for “defamation”.

The Weaver defamation case involved an article Ball wrote saying that the IPCC had diverted almost all climate research funding and scientific investigation to anthropogenic global warming (AGW). This meant that there was virtually no advance in the wider understanding of climate and climate change. Ball referenced an interview with Weaver and attempts by a student to arrange a debate. Ball made some comments that were not fully substantiated, so they became the base of the defamation lawsuit.

That case was completely dismissed, you can read more here.

Now in the Mann case, which goes back to 2011, there’s also a complete dismissal. Ball wrote to me less than an hour ago, asking me to announce it here.

He writes:

Hi Anthony Michael Mann’s case against me was dismissed this morning by the BC Supreme Court and they awarded me [court] costs. Tim Ball

This is a developing story, I’ll add more as we know more.

UPDATE:

Dr. Mann Has Posted On Twitter In Reply To This Article

Mann’s statement is here: https://twitter.com/MichaelEMann/status/1164910044414189568

For those who are blocked by Dr. Mann: (including me)

And if you’re blocked on Facebook by Dr. Mann, here is that statement:

John O’Sullivan of PSI wrote to one of our moderators with this intro and statement given by Dr. Ball that I was not aware of. Mann of course does not tell his readers this other very important fact, sort of like what he did in “hide the decline” by not reporting negative results that compromised his argument. Mann was doing most of the foot dragging that caused such long delays as the case has been active since 2011.

As Mark Steyn once pointed out; “the process is the punishment “.

O’Sullivan writes:

In short, Mann’s responsive statement is:

Stark admission he lost fair and square

A disingenuous argument that the Dismissal was granted merely on the basis of Mann’s “delay” in not submitting his R2 numbers in a timely fashion.

The case has gone on an entire nine years.

On that point, this is where readers may wish to refer to the article ‘Fatal Courtroom Act Ruins Michael ‘Hockey Stick’ Mann‘ (July 4, 2017). In it they offered analysis as to Mann’s fatal legal error. As Dr Ball explained at that time:

“Michael Mann moved for an adjournment of the trial scheduled for February 20, 2017. We had little choice because Canadian courts always grant adjournments before a trial in their belief that an out of court settlement is preferable. We agreed to an adjournment with conditions. The major one was that he [Mann] produce all documents including computer codes by February 20th, 2017. He failed to meet the deadline.”

As I explained in the article, Mann (and his crooked lawyer) had shown bad faith, thereby rendering his case liable for dismissal. I urged Tim to pursue that winning tactic and thankfully he did.

Assisting Dr Ball has been a huge honor for me and probably one of the greatest achievements of my life. But Tim only won this famous courtroom battle thanks to massive worldwide grassroots support.

Anthony: So, as usual, in my opinion Dr. Mann’s ego interprets the facts only in ways that suit his viewpoint, which is the whole reason he got into trouble with the hockey-stick in the first place.

And it isn’t just me who thinks Mann’s arguments are merit-less, in the other defamation case he is pursuing, he has no friends:

Mann’s media buddies leave him high and dry – oppose his lawsuit

Twenty-four media organizations, including The Washington Post, NBC Universal, and Fox News, have sided with the conservative National Review and free market-leaning Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) over a defamation lawsuit brought by a leading climate scientist. The organizations, which also included the Society of Professional Journalists and the American Civil Liberties Union of the District of Columbia, were signatories to a Feb. 13, letter filed with the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, in which both the National Review and the Competitive Enterprise Institute requested a rehearing of their case before the full appeals court. In December 2018, a three-judge panel amended a previous ruling against them. But according to the Reporters Committee for the Freedom of the Press, which represents the two-dozen media groups, a full rehearing of the case is now “warranted.”

“The panel’s decision on the merits of plaintiff’s defamation claim … may have unintended and undesirable consequences in future cases implicating the exercise of amici’s right to freedom of speech and of the press,” attorneys for the Reporters Committee stated.

Read it here: https://wattsupwiththat.com/2019/02/22/manns-media-buddies-leave-him-high-and-dry-oppose-his-lawsuit/

These two quotes seem relevant to Dr. Mann’s travails, and I think the first one speaks loudly to his “save the planet from global warming” machinations:

When any man is more stupidly vain and outrageously egotistic than his fellows, he will hide his hideousness in humanitarianism. –George Moore Egotism is the anesthetic which nature gives us to deaden the pain of being a fool. Dr. Herbert Shofield

"We are told that Amazon fires are at record levels right now. This is a blatant lie. The only “record” is that Amazonian fires have DECREASED over the “record”.

This is what we are being told.

Fig 1: Screen Shot of Google Search (search term: Amazon Fires at Record)

This (is) what the data actually looks like, to August 22. Yes, its updated daily.

Fig 2: Amazon Fire Totals via MODIS (2019 is highlighted)

This comes from a wonderful site, https://www.globalfiredata.org/forecast.html#elbeni

It uses NASA MODIS data, from the Terra and Aqua satellites, and is updated daily. By going to the website, you can look at individual regions in the Amazon, or as I have done, look at the totals for the Amazon. This site also has global data, but I am only looking at the Amazon region here.

The Interactive Graphs are very informative. Hovering the cursor over the graph will show the data at that point.

You can highlight individual years, by clicking on a year in the legend at the bottom of the graph. That year remains bright, while the rest are dimmed. Using Eyeball Mark 1 Trend Indicator (EBM1TI), 2019 is slightly high, but not at record levels. Not even close.

One thing I saw by looking at each year, was a rough pattern – one or two bad years, one or two years at much lower levels, then a bad year. This pattern is there until 2010. 2010 was the last “bad year”. Levels since 2010 have been 1/2 or less of the “bad years”. The old pattern has been broken.

Not only does this site calculate number of fires, it also calculates carbon emissions (in Tg) from the fires. Note that the site issues a caveat about estimated later data, hence its grayed out.

This emissions chart from the website shows what I was talking about, in alternating bad/good years. But as I said, only until 2010. It is obvious there is a reducing trend in emissions, again using EBM1TI.

Again, by hovering the cursor over the bar chart, you can look at data points. Clicking on a legend at the bottom will highlight that series.

Is it significant? Dunno. I need to download and trend the data. I can say definitively, that there is no increasing trend, and 2019 is a LOONNGG way from record territory.

Fig 3: Annual Estimated Amazonian Emissions

Note that the Annual Emissions would have to incorporate fire area, to get the total emissions. Just in case anyone would object that fire numbers are not fire area.

Conclusion: Amazonian fires, using very current NASA data, show a decline over the record, and are nowhere close to a record so far in 2019.

Postscript 1: As Willis often says, if you disagree with something I said, quote exactly what I said, and why it is wrong.

Postscript 2: This might be a good Reference Page. Have a “Fires” page, with the MODIS charts embedded. Charles, Anthony?

Postscript 3: The NY Times claims 2019 fires are way up, over 2018. That is correct. What they don’t say, is that about 1/2 the years BEFORE 2019 are higher, and about 1/2 are lower. Cherry picking of the first order.

Postscript 4: Nick Stokes points out that one province is at record levels of fires. True, its just under record levels today. But that means that the rest of the entire region must be UNDER average (2003-present). Looking at each region in the Amazon Basin, that is indeed true. Santa Cruz and Amazonas are above average, the rest are at or well below average. Result? The entire region is very nearly at the MODIS average for this time of year.

"LAST Wednesday, in a blaze of unremittingly fawning publicity and uncritical adulation of which even Moses descending from Mount Sinai with the tablets bearing the Ten Commandments would have been envious, the good ship Mazilia – or, as I prefer to call it in view of its almost quasi-religious mission, ‘Greta’s Ark’ – set sail from Plymouth bound for New York, carrying no less a personage, if you believe the Green hype, than putative Saviour of the World, diminutive, pigtailed ‘climate activist’ Greta Thunberg, aged 16.

There’s much about this stunt and its main protagonist to mock. But just for the purposes of this article, ignore for a moment both the grotesque cynicism of egregiously exploiting a clearly troubled and vulnerable child to advance an eco-totalitarian political agenda, and the incongruity that few of us can whistle up a $4million, 18-metre (60ft) yacht from Prince Albert of Monaco to cross the Atlantic to assuage our enviro-guilt, and consider just one question.

Precisely how green is the Blessed Greta’s planet-saving maritime odyssey?

Initially, let’s hopefully forestall any potential criticism for mixing up the terminology. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is an invisible, colourless, odourless 0.04 per cent trace gas essential to all plant life on Earth – though that, apparently, has not stopped Greta’s mother, a well-known Left-‘Liberal’ activist called Marlena Ernman, from saying her daughter can see it. Truly do the righteous have bestowed upon them gifts denied to the rest of us.

Carbon (C) on the other hand, is the predominant element in coal. Which is why the Green movement always uses the language of ‘carbon’-footprint or ‘carbon’-free, when they actually mean CO2. Because in the public mind, carbon is nasty black stuff, isn’t it, while wanting, on spurious scientific grounds, to reduce the Earth’s capacity for plant and crop growth perhaps isn’t a good look.

First, how did Greta get to Plymouth? On foot? By bike? On a magic carpet borne aloft by unicorns? Or perhaps, more prosaically, not by ‘carbon’-free means at all, but by using the same fossil-fuel powered transport that we’re enjoined to eschew on pain of eternal eco-damnation?

Next, Greta’s Ark required the assistance of other vessels to undock her and tow her out of Plymouth. Oddly, this was not accomplished by several longboats manned by brawny matelots lustily belting out a traditional sea-shanty, but by a couple of RIBs. They may have electric engines, but ‘carbon’-free their production ain’t.

Let’s look at the supposedly ‘zero-emissions’, ‘carbon’-free yacht itself. It’s built of carbon fibre. (Remember, we sceptics aren’t the ones who started the misuse of scientific terminology for political effect.) Now, the production process for building a carbon-fibre yacht is estimated to be around 14 times as energy-intensive, and thus in ‘carbon’, i.e. CO2, emissions, as that for building one of equivalent length in steel. Not only that. The epoxy resins used in the construction of Greta’s Ark are different and are all organic materials made from petroleum and significant amounts of natural gas.

Some intriguing revelations about the crewing arrangements emerged soon after departure. It turns out that the three westbound crossing crew will be flying back from New York to Europe, while the replacement crew of five will be flying from Europe to New York for the return passage.

Hilarious

Greta's boat trip to the US might emit 6x a flight, because the 5 people taking the boat back will fly over to NYC https://t.co/6tiHcEz7It — Bjorn Lomborg (@BjornLomborg) August 16, 2019

So that’s three transatlantic flights for Greta’s Ark westbound crew to return from New York, plus five more for its replacement eastbound crew to get to New York. I’m guessing those flights won’t be in Economy, either. What’s their ‘carbon’-footprint? Why can’t she just fly to New York with her father? Or even address the United Nations via Skype?

Even though this eco-boondoggle has its own website on which the yacht’s progress can be tracked, some of us prefer to access more independent sources of information. So it was some surprise to see that, last Friday, on the Marine Traffic website, it appeared that the yacht’s position had stopped being reported at 0132 BST on Thursday morning, a mere 9½ hours after leaving Plymouth, and still identifiably in the English Channel Western Approaches.

Which at the time struck me as slightly odd; as did the fact that, as far as I know – and I’ll happily stand corrected if wrong – there were no news broadcasts from the air filming the yacht at sea. Given the obsequious near-24/7 coverage pre-departure, I mused, wouldn’t one have expected at least Sky News and the BBC to have arranged that, when the yacht was still only about 1½ to 2 hours flying time at most from either Cornwall or Brittany?

Fast forward to Saturday, and a possible answer, with a picture transmitted from Greta’s Ark itself. Look closely at the right-hand image.

So yesterday Greta Thunberg shared her boat's position (first pic) and tweeted a photo (second pic). Given the position, what is that in the background? There have been unproven rumours of a powered chase boat. Any thoughts? Seems rather close. pic.twitter.com/sd2cGMy48W — Tony Roberts (@T_Roberts2019) August 17, 2019

What’s that in the top right-hand corner? Why, yes, it looks for all the world like a chase boat. Is this the way she’s being ‘accompanied by her father Svante Thunberg and filmmaker Nathan Grossman’? If so, that looks distinctly fossil-fuel powered.

Add all these up – the construction, the crew flights, the possibility, though denied, of a chase boat – and suddenly this venture doesn’t look anything like as green as it’s made out to be. But in this inversion of the fable of The Emperor’s New Clothes, we aren’t allowed to say so.

This entire eco-stunt, the sacerdotal reverence with which it’s being treated, and the invective heaped on those who dare challenge it, is in many ways an ideal metaphor for how deep-Green ideology has now acquired all the characteristics of a religious cult.

Like other pre-Enlightenment belief systems, it posits a prelapsarian state of grace, a pristine, innocent, nature-harmonious Rousseau-ean past which has been corrupted by modernity, industrialisation and capitalism, notwithstanding their having wrought in just 250 years an improvement in the human condition unprecedented in previous millennia.

It holds that the restoration of environmental equilibrium, the reversal of Man’s Fall from the Garden of Eden, requires above all sacrifice and submission to an elite, who will dispense indulgences – aka ‘carbon’-credits – while intolerantly silencing and excommunicating the heretics.

If the contradictions behind the Odyssey of the Greta’s Ark help more people to see that more clearly, then it may yet prove beneficial. Though mercifully not in the way it intends.

Rush Transcript:

Right now we are down 93. A few minutes ago we were down 140.

>> The g7 meeting starts tomorrow and France’s president macron wants world leaders to put the fires in the amazon rain forest at the top of the agenda. We have seen a lot of coverage of this recently. Those fires are ongoing. Joining us, climate depot founder. The fires are getting political. I see a clash coming at the g7 between especially the europeans who are dead set against climate change and President Trump. There’s Politics coming up here.

>> There is. The first thing you got to understand, they are punishing Brazil’s leadership for threatening to pull out of the u.n. Paris agreement, for not accepting the scientific consensus, and they have actually distorted the fires here. NASA just came out and said historically, the fires in the amazon are not unprecedented, they are only up a huge amount from last year but they are historically low and only the biggest since 2013. Brazil is being punished because of these fires because of their stance on climate change. President Trump, the same way they punished President Trump. He’s going to this meeting and he’s been vilified for years for the same exact issue. Of course, trump doesn’t help himself by, you know, his demeanor with some of the world leaders. But in the case, you know, in the case of Brazil and trump, they will sort of be on the outs at this g7 summit by all the other leaders, particularly macron. Stuart: guaranteed. Now, I’m sure you saw it. Bernie Sanders submits his green plan, his climate change plan. $16 trillion worth of cost right there. Then we heard that the democrat national committee is not going to have a single issue debate. They were going to have a single debate on climate change. Now they’re not going to do it. Seems to me that the party, the democrats, don’t want an intense discussion of climate change because the country’s not behind it. What say you?

>> Absolutely, yeah. The climate candidate, governor inslee, just dropped out. He was at .2% at the latest Iowa poll. The day after he drops out, the dnc not only do they not have a debate, but biden’s campaign is quoted as saying a climate debate specifically focused on that is quote, dangerous territory for the democrats. This goes on the heels of even MSNBC saying that climate is a ratings killer, whenever they cover the issue. So the democrats are terrified of being seen as the climate-only party and bernie is just stepping up to the plate and trying to out aoc, aoc on the green New Deal, coming up with an even more expensive and ambitious plan. Stuart: is it $16 trillion? That was for bernie’s plan.

>> $16.3 trillion or something. Yes. Stuart: over a ten-year period, I think.

>> Yes. He also has magical thinking. 3% of our energy comes from solar and wind. By 2030 he wants it to be 100% of our electricity. This is fantasy thinking. He also wants to punish fossil fuel companies, start prosecuting them for the damage they have caused allegedly. He also is going to give $200 billion to the u.n. Green climate fund. This is a wish list of all the climate activists and political left and it’s really designed just to pressure the Democratic Party and particularly Joe Biden to kow-tow to the Democratic Party climate interests. Stuart: I think it’s a bad political strategy. Even the activists in the party who run the primaries, I don’t see them going for a $16 trillion climate plan and $31 trillion Medicare for all plan. I just don’t see that. I think they have gone so far out of line with the rest of the party that I don’t think they are going to win on this one.

>> No. And I think it’s pretty transparent. There’s a whole bunch of non-climate stuff in bernie’s plan, as there was aoc. This has nothing to do with the climate. This is using the climate scare to get this radical agenda across. I think it’s even scaring the quote from the biden campaign, not only was it dangerous territory but it’s dangerous territory for middle America, for expanding the Democratic Party base, and the mainstream democrats, the establishment, they are terrified of bernie. They are terrified of this issue and the way the hardcore activists want to exploit this into a wholesale change of the american economy which by the way, would have no impact on the climate even if they are right on the science which they’re not, using the epa’s own model. There would be no impact on temperatures 100 years from now

A panel of the Democratic National Committee on Thursday rejected a proposal to host a single-issue debate on the climate crisis. – Excerpt: Inslee had no impact on front runner Biden: Symone Sanders, a senior adviser of presidential candidate Joe Biden, was among those who urged the DNC on Thursday to vote down a climate debate, saying it would be “dangerous territory in the middle of a Democratic primary process.” That contrasts with what Biden had earlier said during a campaign stop in Iowa this summer. The former vice president had endorsed having a climate debate, telling Greenpeace, “I’m all in.”

GREEN REVOLUTION? SOLAR & WIND PRODUCED JUST 3% OF GLOBAL ENERGY – Wind and solar energy generation is growing, but it’s still an incredibly small part of the global energy mix, according to statistics compiled by the oil giant BP. Meanwhile, fossil fuels — coal, natural gas and oil — accounted for 85% of global energy consumption in 2018, BP reported Tuesday as part of its annual energy report. In fact, BP reported the U.S. led the world in oil and natural gas production growth. U.S. petroleum output saw the biggest annual growth ever recorded in any country, BP said. In other words, shale is booming. The U.S. surpassed Saudi Arabia and Russia in 2018 to become the world’s largest oil-producing nation. “Oil remains the most used fuel in the energy mix,” BP reported in its annual energy review. “Coal is the second largest fuel but lost share in 2018 to account for 27%, its lowest level in 15 years. The share of natural gas increased to 24%, such that the gap between coal and gas has narrowed to three percentage points.”

EIA data 2018: Wind & solar met 3% of U.S. energy after $50 billion in subsidies – Fossil Fuels 81%– The EIA (U.S. Energy Info Admin) AEO 2019 report shows that in year 2018 wind and solar energy resources provide about 3% of U.S. total energy consumption while fossil fuel energy resources provide about 81% of total energy use.PTC (Production Tax Credit) subsidies for renewable solar and wind projects in the U.S. have now reached about $50 billion dollars in cumulative payments through year 2018 with these resources providing about 3% of our countries total energy consumption in that year…Additionally these annual wind and solar subsidiies now total more than $8 billion dollars per year.",1

Sen. Sanders: Climate change is not a hoax because very serious reality for the planet…Climate change is real and it is causes deficit stating problems in our country and all over the world…We need bold and aggressive action to combat climate change.

Steve Doocy: There you’ve got Bernie Sanders yesterday unveiling his plan for a Green New Deal. The newest green New Deal. Promising to combat climate change to the tune of over $16 trillion. Here to break down the details Marc Morano, Publisher of Climate Depot and author of the Politically Incorrect Guide to Climate Change. Good morning to you.

Marc Morano: >> Good morning, Steve. Happy to be here.

Steve Doocy: if all this stuff that Bernie wants, went into effect, how would it affect the climate?

Marc Morano: “If you go out fifth to 100 years, using the EPA’s climate models and assuming they are correct on the science. If you assume Al Gore is correct you would not be able to measure a temperature difference in 100 years based on the UN climate deal, the Paris agreement. It’s pure climate symbolism. Their own science supports that this is not about the science or climate change.

Steve Doocy: okay. So, let’s talk a little bit about what’s in it. He wants 100 percent renewable energy. Cut domestic emissions by 71%. Create 526 billion-dollar electric grid. On the big screen right now, if we could go back one, let’s look at how they would pay for it. 6.4 trillion from the sale of clean energy. 1.2 trillion from military cuts. 3.1 trillion in fossil fuel litigation. So they are going to sue the oil companies and 2.3 trillion raised from taxes on new Jobs. What do you think of that?

Marc Morano: It’s a massive restructuring. Interesting thing is suing the fossil fuel companies. First of all, fossil fuels provide more than 80% of the U.S. Energy, global energy. Solar and wind that he wants to by 2030 have 100 percent essentially renewables powering our economy — are 3% according to the U.S. Information Agency. He is going to turn 3% (solar and wind), somehow to into 100 percent magically at the same time go after fossil fuels which means prices are going to go up for everyone, hey, guess what? Energy price goes up. Bernie has the solution. He will have the government subsidize people who can’t pay so he is going to control it on one hand an subsidize it. It’s the perfect central planner’s dream. Perfect control over the energy economy with this plan.

Steve Doocy: He already endorsed AOC’s green New Deal. What’s the difference?

Marc Morano: The difference is this is even more ambitious. Bernie doesn’t want to be outdone by an upstart like AOC. He is coming out with his more aggressive, more expensive, more sweeping plan. So now the burden is back on AOC is she going to come back and compete with Bernie here” I don’t know, Bernie is now the king of the Green New Deals.

Marc Morano Appears on FNC’s ‘Tucker Carlson Tonight’ To Discuss Climate Change

RUSH TRANSCRIPT:

Tucker Carlson: [Laughs] I mean, they be climate change is an existential threat. I’m certainly open-minded. But if it is, then why do none of the democratic responses seem very serious? None of them include, for example, ceasing to fly on private aircraft, which every single one of those people does all the time. Instead, their proposals entail making that more powerful shutting down any proposals that make people’s lives worse? First was a ban on plastic straws plastic bags.

This week, the Federal Energy Star program recommended that American Center thermostats to 82 degrees at night in the summer for the sake of stopping global warming. Okay, you first Marc Morano is the publisher of climate depot and the author of the politically incorrect guide to climate change. He joins us today, Mark, thanks a lot for coming on. Tonight. So there is this weird disconnect between the nature of the threat which is terrifying, it’s it’s Godzilla basically going to destroy all of us. And their proposals which are petty and small bore and disconnected from science.”

Marc Morano: “Yes, they are. In fact, the best quote, was a University of Pennsylvania scientist, a geologist who said even if we faced the climate catastrophe that they claim, none of the proposals offered by the EPA, the United Nations or the green new deal would have any impact on the climate, if in fact Carbon Dioxide was the control knob of the climate. It’s pure symbolism when it comes to the climate. And that’s what’s so shocking. The green new deal is nothing more than the same solutions. They were peddling in the 1960s and 70s. For the overpopulation scare for the resource scare with limited resources.

Tucker Carlson: Peak Oil.

Marc Morano: Yeah, all of that is the same exact solution. They’re using is global warming as the latest environmental scare to have the same solutions of wealth redistribution, sovereignty, limiting treaties, and massive intervention is central planning.

Tucker Carlson: That’s so actual scientists have noted, obviously, that if you’re worried about carbon, you probably should plant more trees that that might be practical. There’s zero interest that I can see it for any of these people in doing that.

Marc Morano: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Governor California climate champion, big champion of the Green New Deal-style proposals. He proposed to California when he was governor in a video address to the state that they should air dry their clothes on hang on a hanger for six months on the clothesline — for six months in order to reduce their carbon footprint. At the same time, he was flying a daily jet to the governor’s mansion to his house. But for Arnold Schwarzenegger, the governor’s mansion was a step-down with the quality of his life. So he daily commuted from his home, but told Californians that they should have air dry their clothes on lines outside.

Marc Morano: By the way, in California mentioning energy store and these regulations. The state proposed emergency control over people’s thermostats in 2008, in order to get to control the energy flow of California and this was even the New York Times balked at this and said this is the outer limits remember the outer limits something’s gonna be taking over your CV to government wanted to take over. But mandatory There was such outrage, they stopped that. And that’s the problem. Now we’re facing with these ENERGY STAR regulations. It’s a creeping thing. It’s what’s voluntary now maybe going to be mandatory under the Green New Deal.

Tucker Carlson: So, why wouldn’t Republicans, and I doubt they’re clever enough to think of this on their own. But why when it some sponsor legislation that bans the use of private air travel for people who are concerned about, or how about all private air travel? To see who votes for it?

Marc Morano: That would be a fantastic idea that the Republican Party most of their time, they don’t want to deal with this climate issue at all. Even Trump administration cabinet members are silent. Trump himself is the only one who really wants to speak and push back on this agenda.

Tucker Carlson: So that’s part of the problem is just want to lower capital gains tax,

Marc Morano: They want to talk about the regulatory impact, but they don’t want to go at the heart of it. Banning private jets is a fantastic idea because it would expose them all. Bernie Sanders himself — Even Hillary staffers talks about how much he demanded that in order to campaign for had to be on private jets. He spent millions on private jets back and forth During his 2016 campaign

Tucker Carlson: They are lecturing the rest of us who dare criticize Al Gore for having the largest house in the state of Tennessee and flying back and forth on a private plane. We were the bad ones were noting that.

Marc Morano: It’s nauseating, but it’s not going anywhere anytime soon. 16-year old climate activist Greta Thunberg is taking a yacht across the Atlantic because she doesn’t want to fly. First of all, the yacht is made out of carbon fiber. But they are going to have to fly the crew back to you Europe. There are going to be all sorts of flights associated with her voyage, but the symbolism of her on a yacht is all that matters. It’s all they care about.

Tucker Carlson: Marc, Thank you. Thank you.

"Democratic 2020 presidential candidate Bernie Sanders responded to a student who asked him a question about practicing what he preaches on fossil fuel use during a Thursday town hall in Chico, California, saying he would not stop using fossil fuels.

WATCH:

“So, I’m a senior at CSU Chico, [inaudible] major,” said the student. “So, my question is, you seem adamant about climate change.”

“Of course,” the student continued after Sanders assented. “So what ways would you take to practice what you preach if you were to become president? I know it’s stressful, and you have to travel a lot, and you have to use fossil fuels …”

“No, I’m not going to walk to California,” Sanders said to laughter from the audience. “Look, you know, I understand that. We do the best we can as an example, but I’m not going to sit here and tell you that we’re not going to use fossil fuels …”

During a Thursday speech, Sanders also said that the U.S. “must transition away from fossil fuels, period. End of discussion. There ain’t no middle ground.” (RELATED: ‘He Is The Enemy Of Every Entrepreneur’ — Home Depot Founders Blast Socialism, Issue Dire Warning For Bernie Supporters)

The Vermont senator called climate change the “biggest crisis of all” in January, yet refused to respond to a Daily Caller News Foundation question about whether he would endorse a ban on private jets.",1
"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) released his plans for a Green New Deal, accompanied by a monstrous $16 trillion price tag.

Sanders calls climate change the “single greatest challenge facing our country,” citing “extreme” weather phenomena like floods, droughts, wildfires, and hurricanes, despite the fact that those occurrences have existed since the beginning of time. Sanders even suggests that climate change has a racial element to it, arguing the effects of climate change affect “communities of color,” particularly.

He warns “immediate” action is necessary, likening the “crisis” to the challenges former President Franklin D. Roosevelt faced in the 1940s, leading to the creation of the New Deal.

Sanders’ plan promises to effectively reverse the “crisis” while simultaneously creating 20 million jobs and reaching “100 percent renewable energy for electricity and transportation by no later than 2030 and complete decarbonization by at least 2050,” per the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s guidelines.

A $16.3 trillion public investment is necessary to make those goals a reality, which falls in line with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), who said any viable climate change plan needed to come with a $10 trillion price tag – at least– in order to “have a shot.”

Sanders says we must “directly invest a historic $16.3 trillion public investment toward these efforts, in line with the mobilization of resources made during the New Deal and WWII, but with an explicit choice to include black, indigenous and other minority communities who were systematically excluded in the past.”

However, he claims the investment will effectively “pay for itself” over 15 years and that the price of inaction will cost far more, citing experts who say that doing nothing will cost the U.S. “$34.5 trillion in economic activity” by 2100. He plans to pay for the $16.3 trillion plan with additional taxes on the fossil fuel industry, and he plans to “prosecute and sue” them for the damage ravaged on the planet.

Sanders’ exhaustive plan covers virtually every angle of the climate change “crisis,” from promising to “fully electrify and decarbonize” the transportation sector, to investing $1.12 billion in “tribal land access and extension programs,” to providing “oral translation assistance to USDA, FDA, and DOJ offices for non-English speaking farmers,” to pouring $200 billion in the Green Climate Fund:

Despite the major shortcomings of the Paris Climate Agreement, one primary reason why the globe was able to come together to sign the Paris Climate Agreement was that major developed nations like the United States finally recognized that they had an outsized role in the creation of the climate crisis, and an outsized obligation to less industrialized nations to help them achieve the same kind of carbon pollution emissions reductions while improving the quality of life in those countries. In order to help countries of the global south with climate adaptation efforts, the U .S . will invest $ 200 billion in the Green Climate Fund for the equitable transfer of renewable technologies, climate adaptation, and assistance in adopting sustainable energies. U.S. leadership can ensure that the developing world secures reliable electricity, reduces poverty and pollution-related fatalities, creates greater net employment, and improves living standards all while reducing greenhouse- gas emissions.

Sanders also uses his plan as a pitch to drastically expand existing entitlement programs, like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Low -Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP).

The plan states in part:

Energy assistance. While we do not expect energy prices to spike because the federal government is going to weatherize homes, electrify heating, and keep electricity prices stable, we still want to ensure that families are protected during the transition. We will expand the Low -Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) by $ 25 billion to help low-income families pay their heating and cooling bills. Additionally, the program will be expanded to provide 10 percent of program costs for maintenance of new efficient heating and cooling systems and technical assistance for the installation and use of new furnaces, heat pumps, boilers, and other upgrades for the duration of the 10-year transition. Ensure a hunger- free transition. Because the cost of energy and food are so intertwined, we will provide $ 215 . 8 billion for free, universal school meals, including breakfast, lunch and snacks. We will expand the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) by $311billion to increase the benefits from the ” thrifty plan which provides inadequate benefits to the more generous low-cost food plan, include those with incomes up to 200 percent of the federal poverty line, remove punitive work requirements, remove barriers for college students to access SNAP , and ensure are not denied benefits due to past interaction with the criminal justice system . We will also expand the SNAP program and benefits to the people of Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa so they are on par with the benefits in the continental United States.

“We need a president who has the courage, the vision, and the record to face down the greed of fossil fuel executives and the billionaire class who stand in the way of climate action,” his plan states.

“We need a president who welcomes their hatred. Bernie will lead our country to enact the Green New Deal and bring the world together to defeat the existential threat of climate change,” it continues.

The release of Sanders’ plan comes on the heels of Gov. Jay Inslee’s (D) departure from the presidential race. Inslee was the only candidate to build his entire campaign on the sole issue of climate change.

“I have seven grandchildren, and I’m going to be damned if I’m going to leave them a planet that is unhealthy and uninhabitable,” Sanders told the New York Times.",1
"Scientists are gathering in Iceland Sunday to memorialize Okjökull — the country’s first glacier to be destroyed by global warming.

Okjökull, nicknamed Ok, lost its status as a glacier 2014. The monument being unveiled at the “funeral” is inscribed with an ominous warning, titled “A letter to the future.”

“Ok is the first Icelandic glacier to lose its status as a glacier,” it states in English and Icelandic. “In the next 200 years, all our glaciers are expected to follow the same path. This monument is to acknowledge that we know what is happening and know what needs to be done. Only you know if we did it.”

Only future generations will “know if we did it” — if we melted all of the glaciers, raised sea level tens of feet, destroyed all of our coastal cities, and ruined our livable climate.

But the truth is that human-caused global warming is disintegrating Arctic glaciers and the great ice sheets at such a rapid and accelerating pace that we will all know within a decade whether humanity has acted fast enough to avert catastrophe.",1
"Federal energy program suggests keeping thermostat set at 78 degrees — 82 while you sleep

LOS ANGELES – To keep your home cool with central air conditioning while also optimizing energy efficiency (and therefore cost), keep the temperature at 78 degrees Fahrenheit or higher.

The suggestion comes from Energy Star, a federal program managed jointly by the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency that provides information to consumers about energy efficiency practices that not only save consumers money, but also improve air quality and protect the environment.

With record-breaking heat waves becoming the norm, finding ways to beat the heat without busting your budget might seem mystifying, which is why Energy Star provided consumers with a set of energy-saving recommendations on how to best manage central air conditioning in warmer spring and summer months.

RELATED: Scientists confirm July was the hottest month ever recorded, setting new global heat record

According to Energy Star, keeping your central air thermostat set to 78 degrees is optimal for both cooling and energy efficiency, but this recommendation only applies to the times when you are home.

While you are away from the house during the day, you should keep the thermostat set to 85 degrees or higher.

While you sleep, Energy Star recommends keeping the temperature set at 82 degrees or higher.

For those who hate to sweat in summer months, keeping your home temperature set at a minimum of 78 degrees during the day and 82 degrees through the night might sound awful, but the benefits are significant.

For every degree you raise the set temperature of your central air, you’ll save about three percent on your utility bill, according to the Department of Energy.

On top of running air conditioning, Energy Star also recommends opening windows to fill the house with cool air at night and then shutting all windows and blinds in the morning to trap the cool air inside. Additionally, air sealing your home and installing window treatments can help prevent heat gain via your doors and windows during the day.

The Department of Energy also stresses keeping the heat coming from within your house to a minimum as well to keep efficiency high and costs low.

"Two mass murders a world apart share a common theme: 'ecofascism'

Before the slaughter of dozens of people in Christchurch, New Zealand and El Paso, Texas this year, the accused gunmen took pains to explain their fury, including their hatred of immigrants. The statements that authorities think the men posted online share another obsession: overpopulation and environmental degradation.

The alleged Christchurch shooter, who is charged with targeting Muslims and killing 51 people in March, declared himself an ""eco-fascist"" and railed about immigrants' birthrates. The statement linked to the El Paso shooter, who is charged with killing 22 people in a shopping area earlier this month, bemoans water pollution, plastic waste and an American consumer culture that is ""creating a massive burden for future generations.""

The two mass shootings appear to be extreme examples of ecofascism - what Hampshire College professor emeriti Betsy Hartmann calls ""the greening of hate.""

Many white supremacists have latched onto environmental themes, drawing connections between the protection of nature and racial exclusion. These ideas have shown themselves to be particularly dangerous when adopted by unstable individuals prone to violence and convinced they must take drastic actions to stave off catastrophe.

The alleged El Paso shooter's document is full of existential despair: ""My whole life I have been preparing for a future that currently doesn't exist.""

In recent years, the mainstream environmental movement has moved strongly in the direction of social justice - the very opposite of what hate groups seek. Now the leaders of those organizations fear white nationalists are using green messages to lure young people to embrace racist and nativist agendas.

""Hate is always looking for an opportunity to grab hold of something,"" said Mustafa Santiago Ali, a vice president of the National Wildlife Federation and an expert on environmental justice. ""That's why they use this ecological language that's been around for a while, and they try to reframe it.""

Michelle Chan, vice president of programs for Friends of the Earth, said, ""The key thing to understand here is that ecofascism is more an expression of white supremacy than it is an expression of environmentalism.""

This is all happening in a rhetorically and ideologically overheated era in which public discourse is becoming toxic, not only in the dark corners of the Internet but among those occupying the highest elective offices. Environmental activists want to create a sense of urgency about climate change, the loss of biodiversity and other insults to the natural world, but they don't want their messages to drive people into deranged ideologies.

There is a danger of ""apocalypticism,"" said Jon Christensen, an adjunct assistant professor at the University of California at Los Angeles who has written extensively on the use and misuse of dystopian environmental scenarios.

It's important, he said, to provide people with potential solutions and reasons to be hopeful: ""There's definitely a danger of people taking dire measures when they feel there's no way out of it.""

Hartmann, who has tracked ecofascism for more than two decades, echoes that warning, saying environmentalists ""need to steer away from this apocalyptic discourse because it too easily plays into the hands of apocalyptic white nationalism.""

The leaders of several major environmental organizations said this week that white supremacy is antithetical to their movement.

""What we saw in the El Paso manifesto is a myopic, hateful, deadly ideology that has no place in the environmental movement,"" said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club.

Echoing that was Andrew Rosenberg, director of the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists: ""We need to speak out so that our members know that under no circumstances are we buying into this kind of philosophy.""

The alleged gunmen in El Paso and Christchurch did not emerge from the green movement. The documents attributed to them are primarily focused on race, cultural identity, immigration and the fear of a ""great replacement"" of whites by people of other races. The ""eco"" part of the equation is arguably an add-on.

But these accused killers did not come up with their hateful ideologies in a vacuum. They have tapped into ideas about nature that are in broad circulation among white nationalists. Before the ""Unite the Right"" rally in Charlottesville in 2017, for example, white nationalist leader Richard Spencer published a manifesto that had a plank on protecting nature.

Ecofascism has deep roots. There is a strong element of it in the Nazi emphasis on ""blood and soil,"" and the fatherland, and the need for a living space purified of alien and undesirable elements.

Meanwhile, leaders of mainstream environmental groups are quick to acknowledge their movement has an imperfect history when it comes to race, immigrationand inclusiveness. Some early conservationists embraced the eugenics movement that saw ""social Darwinism"" as a way of improving the human race by limiting the birthrates of people considered inferior.

""There's this idea coming out of the eugenics movement that nature, purity, conservation, were linked to purity of the race,"" said Hartmann, the author of ""The America Syndrome: Apocalypse, War and our Call to Greatness.""

Conservationists have a long history of wrestling with questions about immigration and population growth. Some of those on the environmental left have seen the explosion in the human population - which is nearing 8 billion and has more than doubled in the past half-century - as a primary driver of the environmental crisis. That argument has then been adopted by racists.

The alleged Christchurch shooter began his online screed by writing, ""It's the birthrates. It's the birthrates. It's the birthrates,"" and then warned of the ""invasion"" by immigrants who will ""replace the White people who have failed to reproduce.""

The document believed posted by the alleged El Paso shooter cites birthrates among the ""invaders"" trying to enter the U.S., and asserts, ""If we can get rid of enough people, then our way of life can become more sustainable.""

This line of thought is dismaying to Paul Ehrlich, 87, a professor emeritus at Stanford whose 1968 bestseller ""The Population Bomb"" proved hugely influential.

""They often cite me, even though I've spent my life trying to fight racism,"" Ehrlich said.

John Holdren, a Harvard professor who co-authored articles with Ehrlich and later served eight years as President Obama's science adviser, said the environmental movement grappled decades ago with the perceived racist undertones of the emphasis on population growth.

""A lot of people felt they were getting burned by talking about population growth and its adverse impact,"" Holdren said. As a result, he said, the movement's leaders began focusing on the education and empowerment of women, which has led to falling birthrates around the world as women take control of their reproductive lives.

A refrain among environmentalists is that if anti-immigrant groups are genuinely concerned about degradation of the natural world, they're targeting the wrong people. Climate change hasn't been driven by poor people struggling to get by. The activities of wealthy nations have been the main historical source of greenhouse gas emissions, the depletion of natural resources and the destruction of habitats.

Ali, the environmental justice expert, said he often hears people say population growth is the big problem today, and he shoots that down.

""My response to them is, 'Who are the people we need to limit? Who are the people making decisions about that?' . . . Until we have true equity and equality and a balance of power, then we know vulnerable communities are going to end up on the negative side of the ledger, whatever the tough choices are,"" Ali said.

h/t Dr. Willie Soon – Climate crusader Greta Thunberg’s “principled” trip across the Atlantic in a carbon fibre and non recyclable plastic boat is going to require at least four crew members to fly across the Atlantic.

Greta Thunberg’s trans-Atlantic voyage on a ‘zero-carbon yacht’ has been rocked by revelations that crew will fly to New York in a gas-guzzling plane to bring the boat back to Europe.

It is claimed that this would generate more emissions than the yacht saves and threatens to leave the 16-year-old’s plans to chart an environmentally friendly route to the United States in tatters.

On Wednesday, the Swedish eco-campaigner left Plymouth on the Malizia II for a two-week journey to the United Nations headquarters where she will address a climate change meeting.

But last night, it was confirmed that two crew will have to fly to the US east coast city to man the 60ft yacht on its return.
