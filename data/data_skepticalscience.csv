"“Pollution” they say ….. when carbon dioxide is the elixir of life, and the base of most of the food chains on our planet.",1
"If (and it’s a very big if) implementing the new tax actually does result in a cut of 5% in Australian emissions, which is the government’s target, then the theoretical amount of global warming averted would be much less than one-thousandth of a degree; even cutting Australia’s emissions altogether would avert warming of only 0.02 deg. C (two one-hundredths of a degree).",1
"Would more warming, if it occurs, be beneficial or harmful? Both, depending upon geography, but overall the net benefits may well exceed the harm. For it is no accident that text-books call a warmer period that occurred about 8,000 years ago the “Holocene climatic OPTIMUM”.",1
"Currently the planet is cooling, and we have a quiet sun – which indicates that more cooling is likely.",1
"In reality, the great majority of independent scientists are agnostic rather than sceptical about the hypothesis of human-caused warming – it is the likely magnitude of human-caused warming, not the existence of a warming tendency in the first place, that is under debate.",1
"The late 20th century warming of half a degree, and the current pause or cooling, fall well within the bounds of previous natural temperature change; they are therefore not necessarily alarming, nor necessarily of human causation.",1
"A gentle warming of up to about 0.5 deg. C occurred between 1979 and 1998; but since 1998 global temperature has now been static or cooling gently for ten years, despite continuing increases in CO2 emissions.",1
"Closing down the whole Australian industrial economy might result in the prevention of about 0.02 degrees of warming. Reducing emissions by 5 per cent by 2020 (the government's target) will avert an even smaller warming of about 0.002 degrees. Ergo, cutting Australian emissions will make no measurable difference to global climate.",1
"Between 2001 and 2010 global average temperature decreased by 0.05 degrees, over the same time that atmospheric carbon dioxide levels increased by 5 per cent. Ergo, carbon dioxide emissions are not driving dangerous warming.",1
"A mild warming of about 0.5 degrees Celsius (well within previous natural temperature variations) occurred between 1979 and 1998, and has been followed by slight global cooling over the past 10 years. Ergo, dangerous global warming is not occurring.",1
there is no demonstrated problem of “dangerous” global warming,1
eliminating even all of Australia’s emissions might prevent planetary warming of only about 0.01 degree by 2100,1
"At its mooted introductory level of $20 to $30 per tonne, a carbon dioxide tax is unlikely to effect any reduction in emissions. As the price is ratcheted up, as is intended, to the point at which energy-intensive industry is forced offshore, Australian emissions will decline, as will Australia’s standard of living, but world emissions will remain the same. Such a policy is senseless",1
"Taxing the emissions of [large emitters] will cause them to move offshore, or destroy them....To levy an unnecessary tax on [coal] is economic vandalism that will destroy jobs and reduce living standards for all Australians",1
"no evidence exists that Australian climatic phenomena—including droughts, floods, storms, heat waves and snowstorms—differ now in intensity or frequency from their natural historical and geological patterns of strong annual and multi-decadal variability",1
global sea-level rise has not accelerated (although the climate models predict that it should),1
ocean heat is declining,1
Earth’s temperature is currently cooling slightly,1
"Increasing carbon dioxide makes many plants grow faster and better, and helps to green the planet.",1
Carbon dioxide is not a pollutant,1
"One thing is known for certain about these computer models, and it is that they are wrong as tested against the last twenty years of elapsed global temperature.",1
that we can’t identify and measure [an anthropogenic warming signal] indicates that the signal is so small that it is lost in the noise of natural climate variation....Global average temperature at the end of the twentieth century fell well within the bounds of natural climate variation,1
"Since [the 1980s], with the formation of the IPCC, and a parallel huge expansion of research and consultancy money into climate studies, energy studies and climate policy, an intensive effort has been made to identify and measure the human signature in the global temperature record at a cost that probably exceeds $100 billion. And, as Kevin Rudd might put it, “You know what? No such signature has been able to be isolated and measured.”",1
"...there was indeed a warming – a mild, gentle warming, nothing alarming at all -  in the late 20th Century for about 20 years and that warming reached a peak in the El Nino year in 1998. Since then, it's been very gently cooling.",1
There's no evidence at all that any of these changes had anything to do with human activity or influence. These are natural climatic changes.,1
"Carbon dioxide is not a pollutant but a naturally occurring, beneficial trace gas in the atmosphere. ",1
We are finding that the climate is not very sensitive to CO2 and those kind of gases,1
"The small rate of warming that the planet is going through and the fact that energy production and CO2 might be related to a part of that, there is not much you can do to reverse whatever the climate is going to do whether is man caused or or not.",1
you look for a large global number in the heat storage of the atmosphere and ocean and that is rising slowly but it is not rising catastrophically or dramatically and certainly does not point to a high sensitivity of the climate to things like GHGs,1
"In looking at the best climate data through the past, these events are not outside the range that of what has already occurred",1
"we do not find trends in these things, not even in heat waves, we do not see heat waves getting worse in the United States, the worst period by far was in the 1930s and the 1920s...snowfall is still falling in the west.",1
Catastrophic warming doesn’t look like it’s in the future at all.,1
The climate always warms and cools.,1
"People who make those kind of claims [urging immediate action] I think are arithmetically challenged, that they don’t sit down and take out the back of an envelope and calculate that when you reduce emissions by X amount what that possibly might mean to the climate, and they will see that these reductions are just not useful. […] To think that you might change the climate, that’s just not on the cards.",1
We’re talking about less than a hundredth of a degree [if California cuts emissions by 26% by 2016]. It’s just so minesule; I mean the global temperature changes by more than that from day to day. So this is what we call in Alabama “spitting in the ocean”.,1
Additional emissions in the atmosphere are only going to add on to what is already there. And so the net effect of trying to change that growth of emission rates is gonna be pretty small.,1
"On the climate front, [Australia cutting its emissions by 5% by 2020] will be imperceptible or minuscule compared to what the rest of the world is doing.",1
I would think a couple of things will happen [if Australia cuts its emissions by 5% by 2020]. One is that your energy prices will rise and your economy then will begin to turn downward. And you will provide opportunities for other nations to take up the slack that Australia used to provide the world.,1
What we’ve found is that the rate of warming due to carbon dioxide must be pretty small because the Earth is not warming very rapidly. […] I would guess on the order of 1 degree per century. […] I don’t think it’s something to be alarmed at.,1
"Look at the observations and you will find these weather disasters have always occurred. You will find them in the history at various places at various times. It’s just that we have the ability to record them on camera videophones and put them on YouTube and that’s what makes them so dramatic today, because everyone can see around the world these events that are happening in very localized places.",1
If it’s just between you and me I’ll just say I prefer [the temperature] going up than going down. […] When it goes down we have ice ages that occur and nobody wins in an ice age.,1
"Has the temperature of the planet warmed in the past 100 years? And that’s true, it has; it’s warmed a little bit. But remember the climate, or the average temperature of the Earth is never ever static. It is always either going up or going down.",1
"Inside a city it’s a lot hotter than out in the countryside, so these thermometers do have problems in that regard.",1
"We look at the temperature of the bulk of the atmosphere, so it’s not confused by what might happen in cities and the countryside and so on at the surface. And by looking at the bulk of the atmosphere where the greenhouse effect is supposed [to] have its greatest effect, we just don’t see much happening at all.",1
"We like to look at the hardcore data, the observations, and the facts of the climate system, and they just don’t add up to make that case.",1
I’m sure there are people who have something to gain by giving you that message [that if we don’t act now we are doomed].,1
"You know, by looking at the evidence - we have satellites and so on - we do not see any dramatic or catastrophic changes at all.",1
"[the hockey stick] was the icon of the TAR, the Third Assessment Report, and what the tree ring record did, in showing it did not agree with temperatures, indicated that the icon itself, which was based primarily on tree rings prior to the 16th century, was therefore not very good at explaining what the temperature was.",1
I think I might like it warmer actually,1
the natural unforced variability...the complexity of the system itself can create these variations [like today's warming] on its own,1
"When you look at the possibility of natural unforced variability, you see that can cause excursions that we've seen recently",1
I think there's been too much jumping to conclusions about seeing something happening in the climate and saying 'well the only way that can happen is human effects',1
I think the consistency [between now and 1970s cooling predictions]...there's a large amount of ignorance about the climate system.,1
I can say that there certainly hasn't been a warming of temperatures since [1998].,1
"I think most of all, [current temperatures] are part of the normal ups and downs of climate.",1
"If you go back through the entire history of the world, most of the periods have not been cooler than today, they've been warmer.",1
Greenland ice borehole temperatures...indicated a clear 500 year period of temperatures warmer than the present centered around 900 AD commonly referred to as the Medieval Warm Period.,1
you're looking at most at a tenth of a degree [reduction in global temperature] after 100 years [if USA imposes CO2 limits],1
"In this sense yes [1970s cooling predictions were similar to current warming predictions], our ignorance about the climate system is just enormous",1
climate model output does not match up to the real world,1
"this issue has policy implications that may potentially raise the price of energy a lot, and thus essentially the price of everything else.",1
"the EPA overstated the agreement between models and observations, when in fact there was significant disagreement.",1
Evidence was presented by Dr. Ross McKitrick and others indicated the popular surface temperature data sets were affected by warming not likely to be caused by greenhouse gases.,1
"The hockey stick's author was the same IPCC lead author who in my opinion worked with a small group of cohorts...allowing amputation of a disagreeable result, and the splicing of unrelated data to 'hide the decline'.",1
"The hockey stick's author was the same IPCC lead author who in my opinion worked with a small group of cohorts and misrepresented the temperature record of the past 1,000 years by promoting his own result",1
"IPCC-selected lead authors are given significant control over the text, including the authority to judge their own work against the work of their critics...this process has led to the propagation of incorrect and misleading information in the assessments, and thus should lead you to question the IPCC's general support for a catastrophic view of climate change.",1
"sea level is rising and will continue to rise because we're in an interglacial.  There is still more land ice to melt.  So as I always tell our folks down on the coast, be prepared for the fact that sea level is rising about an inch per decade, and I don't see anything stopping it until the next ice age comes.",1
what we found from real satellite observations...is that it takes a lot of energy to make the temperature go up because of all the things in the climate system that work against a warming effect.,1
in real data from satellites we found [a negative cloud feedback] to be the case,1
water vapor and clouds do force the climate.  They can be the cause of things that ultimately happen.  They're not just responders to things that happen,1
This is the 1988 predictions by James Hansen...here's what really happened in the world [shows UAH and RSS lower troposphere temperature data].  And you see that even the actual temperatures fell far below even the scenario that didn't happen (Hansen Scenario C).,1
"Climate models overstate the warming...every single modeler knew the answer ahead of time, so it should not surprise you at all that a model can reproduce what's happened in the past.",1
the popular surface data sets...overstate what warming is occurring.,1
"There's been a lot of articles recently and scrutiny about climate work because of some released emails from East Anglia University in England...scientists can be devious and they can act pretty much like anybody...science is supposed to be open, transparent and so on.  That hasn't really been the case in some of the cases here recently.",1
CO2 is not a pollutant.,1
"The truth is, our climate system is so complex that we cannot predict its state even into next month.",1
"I suspect that the higher level of belief among ocean sciences and particularly geophysics represents second order belief (i.e. support for a perceived consensus) rather than personal research on AGW detection/attribution or a careful survey of the literature. How to square this with the oft reported 97% consensus? Well, ‘climate scientists’ in these surveys typically includes economists, ecologists etc., nearly all probably representing second order belief.",1
"the narrative of the 'spiral of death' for the sea ice has been broken ... It remains unclear as to what extent the decline in sea ice over the past decades is caused by natural variability versus greenhouse warming. Whether the increase in 2013 is a one year blip in a longer declining trend, or whether it portends a break in this trend remains to be seen.",1
what the heck does the ‘climate change consensus’ even mean any more? The definition of climate change consensus is now so fuzzy that leading climate change skeptics are categorizing themselves within the 97%.,1
"This is “hide the decline” stuff. Our data show the pause, just as the other sets of data do. Muller is hiding the decline",1
"I just finished listening to Murry Salby’s podcast on Climate Change and Carbon. Wow. [...] If Salby’s analysis holds up, this could revolutionize AGW science.",1
"There is no question that the diagrams and accompanying text in the IPCC TAR, AR4 and WMO 1999 are misleading.  I was misled.  Upon considering the material presented in these reports, it did not occur to me that recent paleo data was not consistent with the historical record....It is obvious that there has been deletion of adverse data in figures shown IPCC AR3 and AR4, and the 1999 WMO document.  Not only is this misleading, but it is dishonest",1
The contemporary 'climate crusade' has much in common with the medieval crusades.,1
The frequency of extreme events has either not changed or has decreased in the 150 years that CO2 levels have increased from 270 to 390 ppm.,1
Carbon is the stuff of life. Our bodies are made of carbon. A normal human exhales around 1 kg of CO2 (the simplest chemically stable molecule of carbon in the earth’s atmosphere) per day.,1
"As far as green plants are concerned, CO2 is not a pollutant, but part of their daily bread—like water, sunlight, nitrogen, and other essential elements.",1
"About fifty million years ago, a brief moment in the long history of life on earth, geological evidence indicates, CO2 levels were several thousand ppm, much higher than now. And life flourished abundantly.",1
"""We’ve already seen almost the equivalent of a doubling of CO2 (in radiative forcing) and that has produced very little warming""",1
"If I’m wrong, we’ll know it in 50 years and can do something.",1
Only with positive feedbacks from water vapor and clouds does one get the large warmings that are associated with alarm. What the satellite data seems to show is that these positive feedbacks are model artifacts.,1
...one can see no warming since 1997.,1
"As Phil Jones acknowledged, there has been no statistically significant warming in 15 years.",1
"You have to remember, this is an issue where what most scientists agree on has nothing to do with the alarm. I think the real problem is so many scientists have gone along with it without pointing out that what has been established reasonably well has nothing to do with the urgency that’s being promoted, which is largely a political matter.",1
"In the North Pole, you don’t have a [ice] cap, you have sea ice; it’s very variable. And as far as Greenland and Antarctica go, there’s no evidence of any significant change. I mean, you know, again your measurements aren’t that great, but any reports you hear are again focusing on tiny changes that would have no implication.",1
"The crucial thing is sensitivity: you know, what do you expect a doubling of CO2 to do? If it's only a degree, then you could go through at least two doublings and probably exhaust much of your fossil fuel before you would do anything that would bother anyone.",1
"[Emissions cuts] would be a moral disaster, because it would mean that much of the world would preclude development and so they'd be more vulnerable to the disasters that occur regardless of man [...] Your vulnerability increases as your wealth decreases.",1
The evidence is pretty good that even if everyone [cut emissions] in the whole world it wouldn't make a lot of difference.,1
"It's a heavy cost for no benefit, and it's no benefit for you, no benefit for your children, no benefit for your grandchildren, no benefit for your great-great-great-great-grandchildren. I mean, what's the point of that?",1
"For Australia to act now is, you know, a bit bizarre, and certainly cannot be justified by any impact it would have on Australia or anyone.",1
"I think even Flannery acknowledged that Australia doing this [a carbon tax] would have no discernible impact for virtually a millennium, even if Australia's output during that millennium was increasing exponentially.",1
"If we doubled CO2, it's well accepted that you should get about 1 degree warming if nothing else happened. [...] But 1 degree is reckoned as not very significant. The question then is: is what we've seen so far suggesting that you have more than that, and the answer is no.",1
"If we doubled CO2, it's well accepted that you should get about 1 degree warming if nothing else happened.",1
"The models do say you should have seen 2-5 times more than you've already seen, you know, you have to then accept, if you believe the models, that you actually should have gotten far more warming than you've seen, but some mysterious process has cancelled part of it.",1
"If nothing else changed, adding the amount of CO2 that we've added thus far should account for maybe a quarter of what we've seen.",1
There's not too much disagreement that there has been a very small increase in temperature [...] This is pretty tiny; it's a fraction of a degree.,1
"If it's greenhouse warming, you get more warming in the middle of the troposphere, the first 10, 12 kilometres of the atmosphere than you do at the surface. There are good theoretical reasons for that, having to do with how the greenhouse works.",1
"CO2 for different people has different attractions. After all, what is it? – it’s not a pollutant, it’s a product of every living creature’s breathing, it’s the product of all plant respiration, it is essential for plant life and photosynthesis, it’s a product of all industrial burning, it’s a product of driving...",1
the main greenhouse gas is water vapor which is both natural in origin and highly variable in its distribution. In the absence of good records of water vapor we aren't even in a position to say how much total greenhouse gases have increased.,1
"On the planet the most wonderful constituent is water with its remarkable thermodynamic properties.  It's the obvious candidate for the thermostat of our system, and yet in most of these models, all water-related feedbacks are positive.  I don't think we would have existed if that were true",1
"In the current models, for reasons that puzzle almost everyone, the cloud feedbacks are positive rather than negative",1
"Water vapor is far and away the most important greenhouse gas, except for one form which isn't a greenhouse gas: clouds.  Clouds themselves as liquid water are as important to the infrared budget as water vapor.  Both swamp by orders of magnitude all the others.  With CO2 one is talking about three watts per square meter at most, compared to a hundred or more watts per square meter for water",1
"in 1983 a panel of the National Academy of Sciences recommended a technique to validate climate models known as ""fingerprinting""--efforts to find at least regional effects in modeling that are correct.  This has turned out to be a disaster in methodology, because all the models differ even in their signs [directions] of predicted change, and they don't even agree on these features for the present climate",1
"It is interesting that before this last appearance of 'greenhouse warming' (1970 to present), there were actually quite a log of books on the coming ice age.  Now a new set of books on the coming warming are hitting the stands",1
the models showing that warming will occur with increasing CO2 predict after-the-fact (post-predict) that since the 19th century we should have seen between about one and two degrees of warming,1
"What we have is data that says that maybe [warming] occurs, but it's within the noise....The point we have to keep in mind is that without any of this at all our climate would wander--at least within limits",1
"The trouble is that the earlier data  suggest that one is starting at what probably was an anomalous minimum near 1880.  The entire record would more likely be saying that the  rise is 0.1 degree plus or minus 0.3 degree...I would say, and I don't think I'm going out on a very big limb, that the data as we have it does not support a warming",1
"Urbanization also creates  problems in interpreting the temperature record.  There is  the problem of making corrections for the greater inherent warming  over cities--in moving weather stations from a city to an outlying airport, for example",1
I personally feel that the likelihood over the next century of  greenhouse warming reaching magnitudes comparable to natural variability seems small,1
The UN was forecasting that global temperatures would be rising around twice the mean rate actually observed in surface temperatures. ,1
Doing “nothing” about climate change in the next 50 years has little effect on climate mitigation compared to initiating taxation now,1
Global warming forecasts confidently made by the UN in 1990 were clearly exaggerations,1
There has been no net warming for “well over ten years”,1
...here in the U.S. there are some 30 different statewide “renewable portfolio standards” (RPSs) that also mandate pricey power,1
...Schmittner et al. (2011)...reported rather lowish estimates of the climate sensitivity,1
"...I elected to focus on a comparison between the observed temperatures and those projected to have occurred under Hansen’s (in his words) “business-as-usual” (BAU) scenario. Remember, this was in 1998. There was no worldwide treaty reducing carbon dioxide emissions (indeed, there isn’t one now). The only change to BAU that took place in the 1988 to 1998 time period was the Montreal Protocol limiting the emissions of CFCs. Reductions in production began only in 1994 and the radiative effect of the Protocol by 1998 was infinitesimal. To me, BAU means BAU. One of the main points that I was making in my 1998 testimony was that observations indicated that the global temperature were rising much less than Hansen had forecast under BAU, which is what happened. ",1
How much it will warm in the future is a function of how sensitive the atmosphere is to doubling atmospheric carbon dioxide.  There are a number of independent arguments now coming together showing that this value may have been overestimated.,1
"There were two periods of warming, the first from about 1910 through 1945, and the second from the mid-1970s to the late-1990s.  They were both roughly the same magnitude...the first one was long before we put the majority of fossil carbon into the atmosphere",1
"There were two periods of warming, the first from about 1910 through 1945, and the second from the mid-1970s to the late-1990s.  They were both roughly the same magnitude.",1
"This section then ends with “it’s not getting warmer [expletive]“.  That depends on your time frame.  If you choose to look at the last 15 years, it’s not B.S.",1
"there’s a research thread emerging that cosmic ray fluxes, which are modified by solar activity, can influence cloudiness and therefore climate. ",1
"Judith Lean and David Rind, two scientists of Gore’s preference, recently calculated the contribution of a standard sunspot cycle to climate...Nicola Scafetta from Duke thinks the solar contribution may be three times larger.",1
we have overestimated the gross sensitivity of temperature to carbon dioxide in our computer models.,1
Why hasn't the Earth warmed in nearly 15 years?,1
"Friis-Christensen and Lassen from 1991, shows that Northern Hemisphere land air temperature has been closely correlated with the 11-year sunspot cycle in the last 130 years.",1
ocean cycles...have been driving the Earth's climate for 4.7 billion years and are still doing so.,1
The observed nighttime temperatures have experienced a higher warming trend than the daytime temperatures. But the greenhouse model predicts exactly the opposite. ,1
"the observed dependence of the warming trend on the latitude and altitude is totally different than one predicted by the greenhouse-dominated models (which predict the hot spot in the middle, among other wrong features).",1
"Even when we assume that the whole change of the global mean temperature in the HadCRUT3 record from 1850 is due to the rising CO2, and many papers above - and hundreds of others - argue that it's not the case and other effects have positively contributed to the temperature - regression implies that the climate sensitivity equals 1.66 °C.",1
There's no scientific evidence whatsoever that the climate sensitivity exceeds 2 °C ,1
"The outgoing heat was measured e.g. by the ERBE experiment and the relationship of this heat flux with the temperature increase was studied by Lindzen and Choi (2009). The resulting sensitivity coming from this paper was 0.5 °C, and even when various conceivable mutations of the methods have been tried later, the sensitivity remained well below 2 °C.",1
cosmic rays...have been driving the Earth's climate for 4.7 billion years and are still doing so.,1
solar activity...have been driving the Earth's climate for 4.7 billion years and are still doing so.,1
"The existence of the remaining 4+ billion skeptics in the world, including tens of thousands of science PhDs, is being denied.",1
I believe we do not understand why the variation in sunspots affects the climate as much as it does.  That is not understood.,1
"I think that Climategate is a very unfortunate thing that happened, that the scientists who were involved in that, from what I've read, didn't trust the public, didn't even trust the scientific public. They were not showing the discordant data. That's something that - as a scientist I was trained you always have to show the negative data, the data that disagrees with you, and then make the case that your case is stronger. And they were hiding the data, and a whole discussion of suppressing publications, I thought, was really unfortunate.",1
Temperature has been rising over the last 100 years. That's pretty clear. How much is due to varying solar activity and how much due to humans is a scientific issue that we're trying to address.,1
"The issues that there is strong agreement on is that we have seen global warming over the past 100 years. An issue, though, that isn't really settled yet is how much of that is due to humans? And that's a subject that really can use more investigation.",1
"Luis Alvarez taught me the fundamental scientific rule, which is you've got to show everybody your dirty laundry...My problem with the way the hockey stick was derived was that there was none of this...if you hide something...the person you are most likely to fool is yourself.",1
claims that global warming has harmed the Earth so far are not scientific,1
"A quote came out of the emails, these leaked emails, that said ""let's use Mike's trick to hide the decline"". That's the words, ""let's use Mike's trick to hide the decline"". Mike is Michael Mann, said ""hey, trick just means mathematical trick. That's all."" My response is I'm not worried about the word trick. I'm worried about the decline.",1
Not a single polar bear has died because of receding ice.,1
What we know is when it gets warmer carbon dioxide leaves the oceans. When it gets cooler it goes back in. It dissolves better. So carbon dioxide is a result of climate change not a driver of climate change in that period.  You can even see this in the delay because when it warms up it takes 800 years before the carbon dioxide comes back out. There's a slight delay that Al Gore never talks about. That old linkage is simply junk science.,1
80 percent or 90 percent of what's in Inconvenient Truth is wrong or exaggerated or cherry picked.,1
It should be understood by anyone professing an interest in climatology that the object of study has been around longer than man and the climate here has varied radically in the last 40 million years.,1
In the Eocene carbon dioxide levels were several times higher than they are currently.,1
"not all glaciers and ice caps are melting. While the Arctic ice, for example, has been decreasing in areal extent...Antarctic sea ice coverage has not",1
...the global average temperature anomalies are cooling! ,1
"There has not been warming significantly, if at all,  since 2003, as most everyone on all sides of the climate issue agree. ",1
"...I have reproduced below the current plots of lower tropospheric temperature anomalies. The trend of temperatures using that climate metric is NOT accelerating, and, indeed, has not even been positive for over 12 years!",1
"upper ocean heat, in terms of its annual average, did not accumulate during the period ~2004 through 2009",1
"upper ocean heat, in terms of its annual average, did not accumulate during the period ~2004 through 2009. This means that global warming halted on this time period. There is no other way to spin this data",1
Their has been no statistically significant warming of the upper ocean since 2003.,1
Sea level has actually flattened since 2006.,1
There is no problem with global warming. It stopped in 1998. The last two years of global cooling have erased nearly 30 years of temperature increase.,1
"I’m a natural scientist. I’m out there every day, buried up to my neck in sh**, collecting raw data. And that’s why I’m so sceptical of these models, which have nothing to do with science or empiricism but are about torturing the data till it finally confesses.",1
"The hypothesis that human activity can create global warming is extraordinary because it is contrary to validated knowledge from solar physics, astronomy, history, archaeology and geology.",1
"To argue that human additions to atmospheric CO2, a trace gas in the atmosphere, changes climate requires an abandonment of all we know about history, archaeology, geology, solar physics, chemistry and astronomy.",1
"If natural forces drove warmings in Roman and medieval times, how do we know that the same natural forces did not drive the late 20th-century warming?",1
"If CO2 drives temperature, why were there past ice ages when the atmospheric CO2 content was many times greater than at present?",1
"CO2 is plant food, it is not a pollutant and it is misleading non-scientific spin to talk of carbon pollution.",1
"In the past, climate change has never been driven by CO2. Why should it be now driven by CO2 when the atmospheric CO2 content is low?",1
"CO2 after the turn of the century continued to increase. In fact, if anything slightly faster. Global temperature didn't. If anything, it decreased in the first decade of the 21st century.",1
Anyone who thinks the science of this complex system is settled is in fantasia.,1
"Future atmospheric CO2 is only marginably predicable and in significant part, not controllable. That means the changes in human emissions will not be tracked by changes in atmospheric CO2. They never have been.",1
"The popularised view has been that CO2 is driving the bus and climate is along for the ride. The observed behaviour reveals just the reverse. Climate is at the wheel and to a significant degree, CO2 is at the back of the bus.",1
there is NO observed HotSpot.  The sat data are correct and [Ben] Santer is wrong ... The [global mean surface temperature] trend (1979-1997) must be ~zero. — A STARTLING RESULT,1

"...supporting data don't show any ocean warming, either.",1
It is very likely that the reported warming during 1978-97 is simply an artifact -- the result of the measurement scheme rather than an actual warming.,1
And did you know that climate models run on high-speed computers all insist that the atmosphere must warm faster than the surface -- and so does atmospheric theory?,1
"But the main reason I have remained a skeptic is that the atmosphere, unlike the land surface, has shown no warming during the crucial period (1978-1997), either over land or over ocean, according to satellites and independent data from weather balloons.",1
The fact that the BEST results agree with previously published analyses of warming trends from land stations may indicate only that there is something very wrong with all of these.,1
"The absence of warming is in accord with the theory that climate is heavily impacted by solar variability, and agrees with the solar data presented in a 2007 paper by Danish physicist Henrik Svensmark in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society A.",1
"Contrary to both global-warming theory and climate models, data from weather satellites show no atmospheric temperature increase over this period [1978 to 1997], and neither do the entirely independent radiosondes carried in weather balloons. ",1
"I suspect that the temperature records still are affected by the urban heat-island effect—a term given to any local warming, whatever its cause—despite efforts to correct for this. The urban heat-island effect could include heat produced not only in urban areas, but also due to changes in land use or poor station siting. ",1
"The Berkeley results in no way confirm the scientifically discredited Hockeystick graph, which had been so eagerly adopted by climate alarmists.",1

Carbon dioxide is not a pollutant.,1
"evaporation from the ocean with subsequent deposition on the ice caps, principally in the Antarctic, is more important in determining sea-level changes than the melting of glaciers and thermal expansion of ocean water. It also suggests that any future moderate warming, from whatever cause, will slow down the ongoing sea-level rise, rather than speed it up.",1

"When properly interpreted, our satellite observations actually reveal that the system is quite IN-sensitive. And an insensitive climate system means that nature does not really care whether you travel by jet, or how many hamburgers or steaks you eat.",1
"what they have ignored is the potential for the climate system to cause its own climate change. Climate change is simply what the system does, owing to its complex, dynamic, chaotic internal behavior.",1
warming in recent decades is mostly due to a natural cycle in the climate system — not to an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide from fossil fuel burning.,1
The supposed explanation that global warming is due to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide from our burning of fossil fuels turns out to be based upon little more than circumstantial evidence.,1
"Are we really sure that ALL of the atmospheric increase in CO2 is from humanity’s emissions? After all, the natural sources and sinks of CO2 are about 20 times the anthropogenic source, so all it would take is a small imbalance in the natural flows to rival the anthropogenic source. ",1
"climate modelers...mistakenly conclude that cloud feedbacks in the climate system are positive when in fact the evidence, when more critically examined, suggests they are negative.",1

Whether carbon dioxide is quite the environmental villain that some people make it out to be is not yet proven.,1
"Climate change is a relatively new political issue, but it’s been happening since the earth’s beginning. The extinction of the dinosaurs is thought to have been associated with climate change. [unverified]",1
"The climate has changed over the eons and we know from history, at the time of Julius Caesar and Jesus of Nazareth the climate was considerably warmer than it is now. [...] Climate change happens all the time and it is not man that drives those climate changes back in history. It is an open question how much the climate changes today and what role man plays.",1
"It was the so-called settled science of climate change, that I thought was to be described in language that I wouldn't use on a family program.",1
I want to reduce emissions [...] but I think we've also got to accept that carbon dioxide is an essential trace gas as well.,1
"These so-called nasty big polluters are the people that keep the lights on. I mean, let's not forget how essential these people are to the business of daily life.",1
"If man-made CO2 was quite the villain that many of these people say it is, why hasn't there just been a steady increase starting in 1750, and moving in a linear way up the graph?",1
"I am not setting myself up as the great expert here, but the Hadley Institute in Britain, which is apparently one of the most reputable of these measuring centres, according to press reports, has found that after heating up very significantly in the previous 25 years, there seems to have been a slight cooling, but at a high plateau I'll accept that.",1
"The fact that we have had if anything cooling global temperatures over the last decade, not withstanding continued dramatic increases of carbon dioxide emissions, suggests the role of CO2 is not nearly as clear as the climate catastrophists suggest.",1
I think the climate change science is far from settled.,1
"The issue is not whether climate change happens (after all, grapes grew in Britain in Roman times; crops grew in Greenland in the middle ages; and the River Thames froze in winter during the 1600s) but how much of it is man-made and what can realistically be done to tackle it.",1
"The thesis that carbon dioxide is uniquely responsible for global warming has run up against a serious problem, and that is the fact that the climate has if anything been cooling slightly over the last decade, while there have been continued massive increases in carbon dioxide emissions.",1
"I am, as you know, hugely unconvinced by the so-called settled science on climate change. [...] I mean, I just think that the science is highly contentious, to say the least.",1
Another big problem with any Australian emissions reduction scheme is that it would not make a material difference to atmospheric carbon concentrations unless the big international polluters had similar schemes.,1
The climate change argument is absolute crap...,1
"Even if global warming is as bad as the doomsayers claim, it’s better to respond correctly than to respond tomorrow. Man-made CO2 emission have been happening for centuries and I daresay the planet could cope if we respond intelligently in 2012 rather than foolishly in 2010.",1
"Even if they are adding to climatic extremes, humanity may be able to cope with only modest adjustments.",1
We can’t conclusively say whether man-made carbon dioxide emissions are contributing to climate change.,1
"As the ABC’s Chris Uhlmann has instructively remarked, if we can’t predict the weather a week in advance and can’t accurately forecast next year’s budget deficit, how can we be so sure about climate and its economic consequences in 100 years time?",1
"While many scientists, perhaps even a strong numerical majority, think that carbon dioxide is the principal factor in variations in global climate, others question the significance of the role of a naturally occurring trace gas and attribute climate change mainly to variations in solar activity.",1
There may even have been a slight decrease in global temperatures (the measurement data differs on this point) over the past decade despite continued large increases in emissions associated with the rapid economic growth of China and India.,1
"The scientists associated with the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have concluded that man-made carbon dioxide emissions are probably responsible for climate change which, they think, is likely to result in up to one metre rises in sea levels over the next century, up to six degrees increases in temperatures and more extreme weather. A difficulty for this thesis is that man-made carbon dioxide emissions have been increasing substantially for at least a hundred years but significant global warming only seems to have occurred in the last quarter of the last century.",1
"the science indicates that human activity is not the cause of all this global warming. And that in fact, nature is the cause, with solar flares, etc.",1
"Carbon dioxide is natural. It occurs in Earth. It is a part of the regular lifecycle of Earth. In fact, life on planet Earth can’t even exist without carbon dioxide. So necessary is it to human life, to animal life, to plant life, to the oceans, to the vegetation that’s on the Earth, to the, to the fowl that — that flies in the air, we need to have carbon dioxide as part of the fundamental lifecycle of Earth.",1
"Carbon dioxide is portrayed as harmful, but there isn’t even one study that can be produced that shows that carbon dioxide is a harmful gas… It is a harmless gas",1
The tax cap and trade system for limiting emissions is just another tax on businesses.,1
"this 97% [of climate scientists accepting human-caused global warming], that doesn't mean anything.  I named literally thousands of scientists on the floor...and these were top people.",1

"In short, some parts of the IPCC process resembled a Soviet-style trial, in which the facts are predetermined, and ideological purity trumps technical and scientific rigor. ",1
"The now-infamous ""hockey stick"" graph was enthusiastically embraced by the IPCC, which used it as a basis of the Third Assessment. Dr. Michael Mann of the University of Virginia was its principal author. The study, which Mann and others conducted, examines climate trends over the past 1,000 years. As many scientists have pointed out since its publication, it contains many flaws. ",1
"For the last several minutes I have been talking about natural climate variability over the past 1,000 years. But we can go back even further in history to see dramatic changes in climate that had nothing to do with SUVs or power plants. ",1
"Energy suppression, as official government and non-partisan private analyses have amply confirmed, means higher prices for food, medical care, and electricity, as well as massive job losses and drastic reductions in gross domestic product, all the while providing virtually no environmental benefit. In other words: a raw deal for the American people and a crisis for the poor. ",1
"It's also important to question whether global warming is even a problem for human existence. Thus far no one has seriously demonstrated any scientific proof that increased global temperatures would lead to the catastrophes predicted by alarmists. In fact, it appears that just the opposite is true: that increases in global temperatures may have a beneficial effect on how we live our lives. ",1
"I would like to submit at the end of my remarks a July 8 editorial by former Carter Administration Energy Secretary James Schlesinger on the science of climate change. In that editorial, Dr. Schlesinger takes issue with alarmists who assert there is a scientific consensus supporting their views.",1

"Kyoto, and Kyoto-like policies developed here in this body, would cause the greatest harm to the poorest among us. ",1
Climate alarmists see an opportunity here to tax the American people,1
The claim that global warming is caused by man-made emissions is simply untrue and not based on sound science.,1
C02 does not cause catastrophic disasters-actually it would be benefitical to our environment and our economy.,1
"Only argument for AGW is models, (a)nd they have not predicted stasis in last decade. So models falsified",1
"Similarly, we have all heard the dire predictions on sea level rise, but once again the sea level rise has been observed to be decelerating, not accelerating as predicted by the models. ",1
...since the very accurate Argo Buoy network was launched in 2003 there has been no heating of the globes oceans.,1
"Problematically, the predictions made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change using these much venerated models have not matched what has been observed. In terms of global average temperature, the models predicted an increase in the last decade, even for the case where carbon dioxide concentration is held constant. Observations using the IPCC's own Hadley Climate Research Unit dataset show no increase in global temperatures this century.",1
"The whole premise of mankind and, in particular, carbon dioxide emissions being responsible for climate change is not the result of fundamental physics but of computer model outputs. Computer models must be judged in terms of their predictive capacity, and it is here that these models have proved to be lacking. It has been said of computer models it is garbage in, garbage out, except in the case of climate change computer models, where it is garbage in, gospel out. ",1
"In the case of electricity, apart from nuclear we have nowhere to go. We are already paying massive costs associated with a small penetration from renewables.",1
Why then is the government introducing job-killing legislation?,1
"Even if we [Australia] reach the five per cent reduction—and government figures show an increase from 580 million tonnes to 620 million tonnes by 2020, an increase not a decrease—then global average temperatures will only be a few thousandths of a degree cooler than business as usual. If we reach 50 per cent less CO",1
"'On the decadal rates of sea level change during the 20th century', by Holgate, found no acceleration of sea levels. Similarly, the paper on the dynamic response of reef islands showed that many of the islands in the Pacific have actually been increasing in area. 'Sea-level acceleration based on US tide gauges and extensions of previous global-gauge analyses' shows there has been no acceleration—in fact, a deceleration in sea-level rise.",1
"Since the launch of the Argo network, what do we have? 'Tracing the upper ocean's missing heat' acknowledges there has been no increase but in fact a decrease in ocean temperature since 2003—they cannot explain it. ",1
"'On the observational determination of climate sensitivity and its implications' by pre-eminent scientist, Richard Lindzen, found that the feedbacks have been overstated.",1

"have a look at the data for Darwin. If you look at the raw data from the last 110 years, it shows that temperatures have gone down by 0.7 degrees per century. Funnily enough, after 'homogenisation' by the CSIRO and Bureau of Meteorology, the data magically shows an increase of 1.2 degrees per century. You wonder why I call for a royal commission!",1
"So what we have is a more and more desperate anthropogenic global warming theory supporters club who, when the data indicates that the planet has not been heating for the last 10 years and the oceans have not heated for at least the last five, tell us that global warming is happening even more quickly than the theory predicts.

[we should not] persuade the world to impoverish itself by moving from relatively cheap carbon-based energy to much more expensive non-carbon energy.,1

so far this century both the UK Met Office and the World Meteorological Office confirm that there has been no further global warming at all.,1

"Although its now famous “hockey stick” chart of temperatures over the last millennium, which inter alia featured prominently in the UK Government’s 2003 Energy White Paper, is almost certainly a myth, the IPCC refuses to entertain any challenge to it",1
"While CO2 is indeed a greenhouse gas, increasing concentrations of which may be expected to have (other things being equal) a warming effect, scientists disagree about how large that effect may be (this is particularly affected by ignorance of the effect of clouds). And, of course, other things may not be equal: there is much in climate science that remains unknown. ",1
"On the science, I think that you are clearly right that the science is far from certain, it is very uncertain, and the more you look at it the clearer that is the case, it is certainly the case that carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere have been increasing rapidly that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. Not the most important one but it is a greenhouse gas, and that prima facia you would expect it to have some warming effect.",1
"Whether it [C02] is a major or minor contribution to [global] warming is extremely uncertain, the scientists don’t really know.",1
"All true scientists in this field say there is enormous doubt, enormous uncertainty, it is very very slight warming in last quarter of the 20thCentury but no further warming in this century from official Met Office figures. The acid test is temperature, that is what all of the scientists agree. The only reason this becomes an issue is because of the slight rise in temperature in the last half of the Twentieth Century.",1
"Certainly, it is curious that, whereas their models predicted an acceleration in global warming this century as the growth in emissions accelerated, so far this century there has been no further warming at all.",1
"Environmental Protection Agency bureaucrats plan to regulate carbon emissions themselves, doing an end run around the American people. ",1
"But while we recognize the occurrence of these natural, cyclical environmental trends, we can't say with assurance that man's activities cause weather changes.",1

"The weight of the evidence is that most of it, maybe all of it, is because of natural causes.",1
The climate's always changing. So there's no doubt that climate changes. The real question is why is it changing and how much of it if any is attributable to human behaviour.,1

Mr. Hansen said the temperatures would rise by a third of a degree just a little over a decade ago.  And the answer is that the predictions have turned out to be dramatically wrong.  Temperatures during that decade rose only one-third of what was predicted by Hansen.,1
"1850 marked the bottom of a 500 year decline in the earth's temperature.  Yes, it was a cycle trending down, and then it started trending up.",1
The cap-and-trade legislation now being considered in Washington would cost American industry 600 billion dollars.  This of course will simply be passed onto consumers in the price of the goods we purchase.,1
"It is not only NOT getting warmer, hurricanes are at a 30-year low.",1
"there is no consensus.  Yet we are bombarded by radical environmentalists, and the media hype, with the common refrain ""Case Closed: Global warming is real.""",1
"the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicince, the OISM, released the names of some 31,478 scientists who signed a petition rejecting the claims of human-cased global warming.",1
"it has not been getting warmer for 8 years now, and it is hard for everybody to ignore that fact, especially as more and more scientists are pointing this out.",1
"The government can’t change the weather. I said that in the speech. We can pass a bunch of laws that will destroy our economy, but it isn’t going to change the weather. Because, for example, there are other countries that are polluting in the atmosphere much greater than we are at this point, China, India, all these countries that are still growing. They’re not going to stop doing what they’re doing. America is a country, it’s not a planet. So we can pass a bunch of laws or executive orders that will do nothing to change the climate or the weather but will devastate our economy.",1
"First of all, the climate is always changing. That's not the fundamental question, the fundamental question is whether man-made activity is what's contributing most to it. I understand that people say there is a significant scientific consensus on that issue, but I've actually seen reasonable debate on that principle.",1
"One hundred and fifty million years ago the carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere was almost ten times what its pre-industrial level was, and more than ten times the 180 ppm that carbon dioxide got down to during the ice ages of the last one million years.",1
"The Earth has been in a warming trend since the depth of the Little Ice Age around 1680. Human emissions of carbon dioxide were negligible before 1850 and have nearly all come after the Second World War, so human carbon dioxide cannot possibly have caused the trend.",1
"The climate models all predict that as the planet warms, a hot spot of moist air will develop over the tropics about 10 kilometres up, as the layer of moist air expands upwards into the cool dry air above. During the warming of the late 1970s, ’80s and ’90s, the weather balloons found no hot spot. None at all. Not even a small one. This evidence proves that the climate models are fundamentally flawed, that they greatly overestimate the temperature increases due to carbon dioxide.",1
"The official thermometers are often located in the warm exhaust of air conditioning outlets, over hot tarmac at airports where they get blasts of hot air from jet engines, at waste-water plants where they get warmth from decomposing sewage, or in hot cities choked with cars and buildings.",1
THE notion that human activity has an alarming influence on climate is based on Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports and spurious claims about a scientific consensus,1
the rate of increase in sea level has not changed since satellites first began measuring it reliably in 1993,1
"A new record high for snow cover was set in the winter of 2008/2009, and there is some chance that a further record high will be set this year.",1
"The global sea-ice record shows virtually no change throughout the past 30 years, because the quite rapid loss of Arctic sea ice since the satellites were watching has been matched by a near-equally rapid gain of Antarctic sea ice.",1
The IPCC’s current thinking is that up to 2° of warming compared with the present would be harmless and even beneficial.,1
"In particular, the models predict that if and only if Man is the cause of warming, the tropical upper air, six miles above the ground, should warm up to thrice as fast as the surface, but this tropical upper-troposphere “hot-spot” has not been observed in 50 years of measurement by balloon-mounted radiosondes, sondes dropped from high-flying aircraft, or satellites.",1
"There was a remarkable spike in global temperatures in 1998, caused not by manmade “global warming” but by a Great El Niño event – an alteration in the pattern of ocean currents that begins in the equatorial eastern Pacific and spreads around the globe, lasting a few months. In the first nine months of 2010 there was another substantial El Niño, but even at its peak it did not match the Great El Niño of 1998.",1
Since late 2001 there has been virtually no “global warming” at all.,1
"A recent paper by Professors David Douglass and Robert Knox of Rochester University, New York, has established that – contrary to various climate-extremist assertions – there has been no net accumulation of “missing energy” in the form of heat in the oceans worldwide in the six years since ocean heat content was first reliably measured by the 3000 automated ARGO bathythermographs in 2003.",1
"even if all of the climate science was accepted as good science, we still need to worry about the bad economics and bad policy analysis that had been used to leap from conclusions - to leap to conclusions about what should be done from that basis.",1
it's a wholesale change in the entire world's energy system that you commit yourself to when you say we're going to go for preventing global warming,1
the costs of [CO2 limits] by itself would have far outweighed any benefit we could have gotten from those changes,1
We would not notice a difference to the US to anything that was happening to us because of climate [if we introduce CO2 limits],1
clearly climate change regulations will diminish [economic productivity],1
"No, [the danger posed to the economy by not acting to reduce climate change] does not [outweigh the economic costs to the country of CO2 limits]",1
"the Waxman-Markey [climate] bill with costs in the range of $1,000-2,000 per household, a loss of 1-2% of GDP of what it would be otherwise, and perhaps close to a doubling of electricity prices",1
[wind energy] is a more expensive way of producing energy than the alternative,1
US emission reductions are likely to have costs far greater than their benefits,1
efforts to reduce our own emissions would make almost no difference to global temperature,1
"The science is now all-but-settled on global warming, convincing new evidence demonstrates, but Al Gore, the IPCC and other global warming doomsayers won’t be celebrating. The new findings point to cosmic rays and the sun — not human activities — as the dominant controller of climate on Earth.",1
I want to know why the Chinese studies come up with no hockey stick,1
the entire globe has cooled quite a bit,1
"CO2 cannot cause global warming. I'll tell you why. It doesn't mix well with the atmosphere, for one. For two, its specific gravity is 1 1/2 times that of the rest of the atmosphere. It heats and cools much quicker. Its radiative processes are much different. So it cannot -- it literally cannot cause global warming.",1
"NASA satellites suggest that the heat the models say is trapped, is really escaping to space, that the ‘sensitivity’ of the atmosphere to CO2 is low and the model assumed positive feedbacks of water vapor and clouds are really negative.",1
"Do you realize how small that is for a trace gas necessary for life on the planet? it is almost incomprehensible that this has taken off the way it has, the whole argument, it contradicts what we call the first law of thermodynamics: energy can neither be created or destroyed. So to look for input of energy into the atmosphere, you have to come from a foreign source and it is already out there.",1
"When you look at carbon dioxide, it increases 1.5 parts per million each year. We contribute 3 percent of that, which means means that the human contribution is one part per 20 billion.",1
"In light of the recent global temperature record it is appropriate to ask the government – as indeed, Senator Fielding has - why 1998 remains the warmest year in the record and why global average temperatures have persisted at about the same value (0.4oC above the 1961-1990 average) since 1997.",1
Carbon dioxide levels have continued to rise but global temperatures have flat-lined since 1997.,1
"There is rising recognition that introduction of a carbon tax under the guise of ""cap and trade"" will be personally costly, economically disruptive to society and tend to shift classes of jobs offshore.",1
"...despite rising carbon dioxide concentrations, global warming seems to have taken a holiday.",1
"It's like when I see that the warmest period ever was in the '30s during -- and there were much lower CO2 levels. And then, as the glaciers retreat, there are big forests that we realize in the Middle Ages it was warmer than it was now.",1
"Like all the other errors in the IPCC report, including the infamous suggestion that all Himalayan glaciers would be gone by 2035 rather than 2350, this mistake exaggerates the potential warming. It is beyond coincidence that all these errors should be in the same direction. ",1
"And ocean heat content has decelerated, if not flattened, in the past decade.",1
Remember Jim Hansen of NASA told us in 1988 to expect 2-4 degrees in 25 years. We are experiencing about one-tenth of that.,1
"Since 1960 we have had roughly one-third of a doubling, so we must have had almost half of the greenhouse warming expected from a doubling – that’s elementary arithmetic, given that the curve is agreed to be logarithmic. Yet if you believe the surface thermometers* (the red and green lines), we have had about 0.6C of warming in that time, at the rate of less than 0.13C per decade – somewhat less if you believe the satellite thermometers (the blue and purple lines). So we are on track for 1.2C*.  We are on the blue line, not the red line*.",1
"Tropical storm* intensity and frequency have gone down, not up, in the last 20 years. Your probability* of dying as a result of a drought, a flood or a storm is 98% lower globally than it was in the 1920s.",1
"Greenland is losing ice at the rate of about 150 gigatonnes a year, which is 0.6% per century.",1
Sea level* is rising at the unthreatening rate about a foot per century and decelerating.,1
It was warmer in the Middle ages* and medieval climate change in Greenland was much faster.,1
Ocean acidification looks suspiciously like a back-up plan by the environmental groups in case the climate fails to warm: another try at condemning fossil fuels.,1
"The world stopped getting warmer almost 16 years ago, according to new data released last week",1
"Based on readings from more than 30,000 measuring stations, the data was issued last week without fanfare by the Met Office and the University of East Anglia Climatic Research Unit. It confirms that the rising trend in world temperatures ended in 1997.",1
Other research is beginning to show that cyclical changes in water vapour - a much more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide - may account for much of the 20th Century warming.,1
"for the past 15 years, global warming has stopped.",1
