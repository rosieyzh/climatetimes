"The other greenhouse gases, CO2, methane and nitrous oxide have a negligible effect on our climate. The only potential risk of a major CO2 event in Europe is an erupting volcano. ",1
This ludicrous myth of man-made global warming is going to impact on agriculture. Farmers apparently are going to have to improve the world weather by emitting fewer greenhouse gases. There are two of them that we emit where we find ourselves in total contradiction to EU dogma. ,1
We have to have carbon dioxide. This is madness. Absolute madness what you are suggesting. Our agriculture industry is going to suffer heavily if we attempt to bury carbon dioxide. It is absolutely mad. ,1
I just wonder when the bubble is going to burst on this whole ludicrous [man-made global warming] saga. ,1
"I assume that, whilst current contracts will be honoured by future governments for the 25 year period, it is more than likely that this ‘renewables scam’ will have run its course by then […]. I am determined to live to 90 years old, just to see what happens! ",1
During a summit in Chile King Juan Carlos of Spain told the president of Venezuela Hugo Chavez to shut up: 'Por qué no te callas' (Why do you not shut up?). Someone must tell Al Gore the same or invite him to visit this corner of the world. It is a never ending winter here in South America. ,1
To establish the ongoing catastrophe in Brazil as a global warming product is a false claim in the view of the MetSul Meteorology staff. ,1
"The IPCC has actually become a closed circuit; it doesn’t listen to others. It doesn’t have open minds… I am really amazed that the Nobel Peace Prize has been given on scientifically incorrect conclusions by people who are not geologists. [4], ",1
"… climate change during the last few hundred years may be interpreted mainly in terms of a combination of the recovery effect and the multi-decadal oscillation. These are natural changes. Thus, there is a possibility that only a small fraction of the warming between 1900 and 2000 may be attributable to the greenhouse effect. In this view, the predicted temperature change in 2100 is about 0.5°C ± 0.2°C. ",1
"Although I am not a climatologist, it has been interesting to observe climatology from the point of view of an arctic scientist. In order for the field of climatology and IPCC to be healthy, I want to provide a few criticisms, which I hope are constructive. ",1
"… climate change, or temperature, has been rising. Somehow the IPCC decided that the increase in the last 100 years is due to the greenhouse effect; however, a significant part of that would be just due to natural change. So, even if we spend lots of money on suppressing CO2 release, it wouldn't do any good, because it's a natural change. ",1
"Global warming may be real, but there's hardly a shred of good scientific evidence that it has very much to do with the amount of CO2 we're producing, or even that temperatures have risen as much as warmists say. ",1
"Climate-change skeptics might be regarded as modern-day witches because they think that global warming comes from natural forces. However, it’s superstitious alarmists, who believe that extreme weather originates in our CO2 emissions and who have a dread of impending disaster, who are really the witches. ",1
I am offended that science is being perverted in the name of global warming — today’s environmental cause celebre. ,1
"In just a few weeks, more than 300 eminent scientists and other qualified individuals from around the world have signed the petition below, Lindzen wrote in the letter. ",1
There is no scientifically believable evidence to support the alarmist claims regarding the existence of climate change. ,1
"We do not deny climate change, but we consider that global warming is not the essential phenomenon. If the temperature increases by 1 or 2° C per century and the sea level rises 25 centimeters, this does not seem catastrophic. We think, for our part, that the essential phenomenon is the increased frequency of extreme events: heat waves or Russian winter, heavy rains with flooding and drought with lack of clean water, and frequent violent tornadoes. All with seemingly random geographic distributions. ",1
"Following the month of August experienced by the northern half of France, the prophets of doom of global warming will have a lot on their plate in order to make our fellow countrymen swallow their certitudes. ",1
"Recently, a writer from USA Today wanted to know if the National Black Chamber of Commerce receives money from fossil fuel companies (coal, oil, natural gas, petrochemicals, etc.).  That is a 'no brainer'.  Of course we do and it is only natural. The legacy of Blacks in this nation has been tied to the miraculous history of fossil fuel and the economic growth in communities because of the successful harvest of fossil fuels.  Consistent with the emergence of the Industrial Revolution and the availability of the Homestead Act for freed slaves, fossil fuels have been our economic friend. ",1
"Certainly the climate changes as time goes on - sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse.  So far, there is no pattern that seems to be very detrimental to our earth.  There is an ebb and flow and it takes time to see any significant detrimental trend.  It is like Stevie Wonder wrote, 'When you believe in things you don't understand; you suffer.  Superstition ain't the way'. – Harry Alford, co-founder, President/CEO of the National Black Chamber of Commerce. ",1
"These are very exciting times for the fuel industry in America.  We are at the point of being totally oil independent.  We are finding new reserves in various parts of our great nation.  Natural gas is now abundant thanks to a new process known as Fracturing or Fracking.  In fact, we were once importers of natural gas but now, thanks to Fracking, we are exporting it for attractive profits.  No longer do we have to rely on nations that don’t particularly like us for our energy needs.  God blesses the child who has his own and we are certainly blessed. ",1
"Clearly, there can be no America without the utilization of coal.",1
Coal is a vital component to our infrastructure and will remain a vital resource.  God put it here for us to use and for hundreds of years in the future we will continue to produce with improvements and environmentally safe methods. ,1
"Believe me, I have personally experienced these nuts, and the National Black Chamber of Commerce has been slandered for its energy positions. It appears that we are right and they are wrong. Let the whole world know about it. ",1
[T]he continuous stream of unreasonable and overreaching regulations that have come out of the federal government over the last few years has led to the denial of countless opportunities for minorities. ,1
"You are about the dumbest ass I've ever met in my life, Alford said. You've come to Columbus to harass me. ",1
"The National Rifle Association was started, founded by religious leaders who wanted to protect free slaves from the Ku Klux Klan. They would raise money, buy arms, show the free slaves how to use those arms and protect their families. God bless you. Many of us probably wouldn’t be here today if it wasn’t for the NRA. ",1

"The American Energy Alliance has organized a coalition to proclaim in one unified voice that there should be no expansion of the misguided electric vehicle tax credit, Thomas Pyle wrote in a statement, quoted at The Daily Caller. There is no question that the electric vehicle tax credit distorts the auto market to no gain. ",1
"As an observer with a rooting interest in providing students with an education that enables jobs that change lives (or from an employer perspective, if that fits the writer), it makes much more sense to allow the private-sector institutions to do their good work, making corrections where necessary and building on the innovation and nimbleness that is characteristic of the sector. ",1
"[The NOAA and NASA ]have reported that there has been no global warming detected for the last 18 years. That is over 216 months in a row that there has been no detected global warming. At the same time, sea ice in Antarctica is building up at record levels, Alford writes.  ",1
"As world markets shuttered amidst instability in China, the President reminded us that the American economy is resilient and the backbone of the global market. Unfortunately, the EPA's proposed ozone rule threatens that resiliency, found in our urban centers like Pittsburgh, by bringing the economic recovery to a halt, Harry C. Alford said. Today's forum was an opportunity for local business owners and elected officials to discuss the effects of this regulation and how to continue our fight to keep EPA's assault at bay. ",1
"Many states, such as New York and Delaware, have already taken action to reduce the largest emitter of carbon pollution - power plant emissions, Carper said. As we will hear today, the economies of these states continue to grow at a faster rate than the states that have yet to put climate regulations in place. However, we need all states to do their fair share to protect the air we breathe and stem the tide of climate change. The EPA's Clean Power Plan attempts to do just that.  ",1
"Like Americans for Prosperity, the Beacon Hill Institute, and the State Policy Network before it, the National Black Chamber of Commerce (NBCC) is the latest oil industry front group to run a deceptive op-ed campaign against the EPA's climate change plan, with NBCC president Harry C. Alford alleging in newspapers across the country that the Clean Power Plan will impose 'economic hardship' on blacks and Hispanics, Denise Robbins and Andrew Seifter write at Media Matters.  ",1
"Now is the time to dust ourselves off and get back to work, Alford's testimony reads. We must learn from this incident and not be afraid to move forward with domestic energy production. ",1
"The bottom line is this: any climate legislation that fails to meaningfully reduce the human impact on the climate or does so in an economically unsustainable manner, can’t be effective, Alford said. Under the House bill, American consumers and businesses would take on a heavy burden. This burden would fall at exactly the wrong time. ",1
"All the resources that have been taken from other parts of the economy and put into the creation of these jobs or the subsidy of renewable energy, if you look at how many jobs this amount of money created in the rest of the economy, you see that for every job that you have been creating, or subsidizing, you would have created 2.2 jobs in the rest of the economy. ",1
"These studies and additional exploratory wells can then draw conclusions whether the gas is economically recoverable. This could be started in 2017. […]  Especially in Central Germany, we see the possibility that the natural cracks of the flow of gas can be sufficient. ",1
Angerer assures that fracking will not contaminate drinking water: We go one to three kilometers deep. The highly mineralized groundwater there will never be used as drinking water. ,1
"CO2 is the ultimate green gas. It is a grade school fact that every green tree, every blade of grass, indeed all life is ultimately CO2 + H2O combined by sunlight plus a bit of ash and it is proven in both laboratory and practice that plants thrive on more than twice our current 3 or 4 molecules per 10,000. Life could not have started on earth without a (20%) CO2 rather than O2 atmosphere. Only photosynthesis converted it to an oxygen atmosphere bouncing along the minimal CO2 necessary to keep the plants alive. So any downside to the few percent of the natural CO2 budget we are restoring to our atmosphere from carbon sequestered in previous incredibly lush epochs must be weighed against this indisputable greening of the planet. ",1
"Climate is changing and it is part of the normal cycle – not human-induced. You are actually correct that I support capitalism and freedom and am against authoritarianism and totalitarian systems. What you fail to understand is that climate change is an agenda to eliminate your freedom. The entire argument is to support a move toward an authoritarian state. You better wake up. This is not truly about the climate change, it is all about controlling society, eliminating democracy, and changing the entire economic model that changes society. There is far more at stake here than most people realize. ",1
"There is now growing concern among scientists that we may indeed be heading into global cooling rather than warming. The concerns center on the apparent weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. This seems to be triggering a growing amount of speculation about abrupt cooling, Armstrong declared at his blog, ArmstrongEconomics.  ",1

"Instead of wasting all this effort to try to support government raising taxes on people to prevent 'Global Warming' or 'Climate Change', it might be better spent informing people we are going back into a cooling period and there will be wild swings back and forth for the next 25 years. It snowed here on Friday and the back 60 degrees for Saturday, Armstrong wrote in an ArmstrongEconomics article titled The Ice Age Cometh.",1
"An investigation of the raw data recording temperature, has revealed that once again these academics are manipulating the data to keep billions of dollars flowing into their hands. No matter how many times they are caught, government will not change course because they want to believe in global warming to justify higher taxes, Armstrong wrote at ArmstrongEconomics. ",1
Anyone who thinks that Global Warming is really caused by man is naive to say the least. This is a political agenda to raise taxes by politicians and to reduce population growth among academics. ,1
"Global Warming is all about money and raising taxes for politicians to pay for their pensions and support all their illegitimate children, Armstrong wrote at ArmstrongEconomics. ",1
[P]eople ASSUME that we even have the power with nuclear bombs to destroy then planet. That is probably not even likely. They also assume that if we set one-off all life will be dead forever. They make a lot of assumptions based upon a guess that is NOT even EDUCATED.  ,1
"We can impact a local area, but we CANNOT alter the course of the entire planet. On that score, we are but a pimple on a fly’s ass. So until I see HARD evidence beyond assumptions for a few decades, I will keep it real.

"We published a peer-reviewed paper showing that the forecasting procedures used by the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change violated 72 of 89 relevant principles (e.g., 'provide full disclosure of methods'). The IPCC has been unable to explain why it violated such principles. In response, we developed a model that follows the principles. Because the climate is complex and poorly understood, our model predicts that global average temperatures will not change. ",1

"Number one was educate the public about the use of natural resources. Immediately develop petroleum resources in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Cut down remaining old-growth forests on public lands and replace with new trees. Cut down 30,000 acres of the Tongass National Forest each year to promote economic forestry practices. Open all public lands, including national parks, to mining and oil drilling. Construct roads into all wilderness areas for motorized wheel chair use. Stop protecting endangered species, such as the California condor, that were in decline before man arrived. Force anyone who loses litigation against a development to pay for the increase in costs for completing the project, plus damages. But the idea of wise use has become embedded. It's no longer a list like that.  ",1

"Water vapour was responsible for 95 per cent of the greenhouse effect, an effect which was vital to keep the world warm. If we didn't have the greenhouse effect the planet would be at minus 18 deg C but because we do have the greenhouse effect it is plus 15 deg C, all the time. It would be like trying to increase the temperature of bath tub full of water - using one drop from an eye dropper. ",1
"Why did most of our moderate modern warming take place before 1940 (with 1934 being the warmest year) and why haven't we had any warming over the last nine years? Could it possibly be the moderate natural 1,500-year cycle revealed in the ice cores and seabed sediments? ",1
"We now have nitrogen fertilizer that's feeding 6 billion people and the greens refuse to use it. They want organic food, they want food not grown with nitrogen, not grown with pesticides, and they want energy not produced with either fossil fuels or nuclear, and I submit it is time for even the greens to recognize the difference between necessity and preference. We need nitrogen fertilizer. We've got to feed eight and a half billion people in 2060 before the human numbers begin to drop off. We need the pesticides to protect that food while it’s growing and while it's in storage, and we need energy – if not from fossil fuels then from the only other source we know that works and produces no CO2. You can produce the nuclear from uranium or thorium, but you'd better produce it. ",1

"So if we don't want to perpetuate poverty in the name of preventing climate change, geoengineering may be our way out. Why? Because geoengineering would provide more time for the world's economy to grow while inventors and entrepreneurs develop and deploy new carbon neutral energy sources to replace fossil fuels … It seems unlikely that fast-growing poor countries like India and China will agree cut back on their use of fossil fuels any time soon. If that's the case, then emissions reductions in rich countries would have almost no effect on future temperature trends. Geoengineering could give humanity more time to resolve this collective action problem, too. ",1
"I believe climate change is not a hoax and that man has an influence, Balash said, as reported in Alaska Public Media. ",1

"Fear often dominates discussion about the earth's climate. Many people have been led to believe that drastic measures are necessary to prevent the risk of negative future outcomes, such as global warming. As such, we now face a situation where politicians are misallocating resources because they are responding to manufactured problems, which are based on public anxiety rather than sound scientific evidence. Ineffective measures like the Kyoto Protocol, built on fear rather than science, will not reduce the future burden of greenhouse gases and will cause many more problems than they solve. ",1

"All this would be humorous if it did not have such serious ramifications. In the vain hope of stopping trivial changes in climate, activists and compliant politicians are working hard to force us to switch from coal and other fossil fuels, America's least expensive and most abundant power sources, to unreliable and expensive alternatives such as wind and solar power.

"These are completely false statements, Ball said, quoted in the Pensacola News Journal (and several other news outlets) by fellow climate change denier Tom Harris. The only evidence in support of CO2 as the primary cause of global warming are the outputs of the computer models used by the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change which have been wrong in every forecast or scenario they produced since 1990. If your forecast is wrong then your science is wrong. ",1

"The 'green' activists' focus on CO2 was premeditated and designed to demonize it as the toxic byproduct of fossil-fuel driven industries that was causing runaway global warming, Ball writes.In fact, C02 is a gas essential to plant life, and thereby all life, because plants produce oxygen. ",1

One of his [Bannon's] pet peeves is the great climate-change con. It's partly why he recruited a notorious skeptic like myself.  ,1

"A lot of the scientists who are studying global change and studying the effects of greenhouse gases, many of them feel that the Earth's atmosphere in 100 years is what Biosphere 2's atmosphere is today, Bannon explained. We have extraordinarily high CO2, we have very high nitrous oxide, we have high methane. And we have lower oxygen content. So the power of this place is allowing those scientists who are really involved in the study of global change, and which, in the outside world or Biosphere 1, really have to work with just computer simulation, this actually allows them to study and monitor the impact of enhanced CO2 and other greenhouse gases on humans, plants, and animals.

"I recently attended a debate over tobacco advertising in which Matthew Meyers, head of the Coalition for Tobacco-Free Kids and a leading anti-tobacco activist, said adult smokers must be denied access to comparative health claims in order to avoid attracting children to tobacco products. Whether advertising targets teenagers or has much influence over their decisions is much disputed. (I addressed that subject back in 1996 in an essay titled 'Joe Camel is Innocent!' which you can still find on Heartland's Web site.) But more to the point, Meyers has no right to deprive smokers of information about the choices they are making. ",1

"How could two teams of scientists come to such obviously contradictory conclusions on seemingly every point that matters in the debate over global warming? There are many reasons why scientists disagree, the subject, by the way, of an excellent book a couple years ago titled Wrong by David H. Freedman. A big reason is IPCC is producing what academics call post-normal science while NIPCC is producing old-fashioned real science. ",1
"The scientists Heartland works with demanded we host a ninth conference this year to foster a much-needed frank, honest, and open discussion of the current state of climate science and we just couldn’t refuse.

"With his nomination of Kathleen Hartnett White, President Trump continues to make excellent choices for his nominations in the areas of environmental protection and energy. White is an outstanding candidate for this important position. Her past service as a chairman and commissioner of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality gives her the proper experience, and her work before and after that with private-sector groups engaged in environment and energy policy shows a deep familiarity with the issues and trade-offs involved. Best of all, White’s writing and public speaking make it clear she is committed to reversing the intense politicization of science and policy that occurred under President Obama and that started even before then, Bast said, adding, We finally will have a head of CEQ who genuinely understands the science and economics of energy policy, and who will resist efforts to debase and ‘weaponize’ it in support of a political agenda.  ",1
"Though CEQ oversees the NEPA process, it remains unclear how seriously Hartnett-White will take the NEPA review process, for decades seen as a bedrock of U.S. environmental regulation since NEPA became law in 1970, DeSmog's Steve Horn reported. ",1

As a threshold matter, this Court finds that Mr. Bast is not a credible witness and that he did not offer reliable opinions in this matter. While Mr. Bast described himself as an economist, he holds neither undergraduate nor graduate degrees in economics, and the highest level of education he completed was high school. Mr. Bast testified that he is 100% committed to the long-term goal of getting government out of the business of educating its own voting citizens. Further, his use of inflammatory and irresponsible language regarding global warming, and his admission that the long term goal of his advocacy of vouchers is to dismantle the 'socialist' public education system further undermine his credibility with this Court.

"We will get our answer in the next 20 to 30 years. And we don't have to panic. We don't have to rush around because if I'm right, the earth's temperature is going to cool a degree to a degree and a half Fahrenheit the next 20 to 30 years.

"I think it’s just yet another piece to cause confusion and I think that the ‘so-called scientific debate’ is very silly now–It’s like a bunch of theologians arguing over how many angels you can stick on the head of a needle. When you’ve got a side that changes from global warming, global warming, global warming to climate change, which is intuitive—the climate has always been changing since the beginning of time—and then just begins to claim every answer is the correct answer, you often stand back, and I don’t care who you are, you have to question as to what the real motive is in this. ",1
"CO2 cannot cause global warming. I'll tell you why. It doesn't mix well with the atmosphere, for one. For two, its specific gravity is 1 1/2 times that of the rest of the atmosphere. It heats and cools much quicker. Its radiative processes are much different. So it cannot – it literally cannot cause global warming. ",1
"How do these people have any credibility? How do they get away with this?  It's mind boggling that its gotten to a point where the EPA is dictating policy based on what is an obvious fraud, or if you want to be gentle about it, creates enough doubt to back off. ",1
"According to Bastardi,  human-induced climate change contradicts what we call the 1st law of thermodynamics. Energy can be neither created nor destroyed. So to look for input of energy into the atmosphere, you have to come from a foreign source. ",1
"The coming cooling of the planet overall will return it to where it was in the ’60s, ’70s, and '80s. ",1
"Common sense dictates that a trace gas needed for life on the planet would not be the cause for destroying life on the planet. Common sense dictates that what has happened before without man can happen again with man. Common sense would dictate that you not believe me, or any one else, but go look for YOURSELF. ",1
"I don’t believe CO2 is a major player in determining global temperatures, Bastardi writes. I believe the sun, ocean cycles and stochastic events play a much more significant role. Furthermore, we all know that Bill is not a forecaster. And since I am, I have a bet for the science guy. I believe 2017 will be colder than 2016. The bet is this: For 2017, every increment of .05 degrees Celsius (plus or minus compared to 2016) will be worth $10,000. If 2017 is 0.1 degrees Celsius warmer than 2016, I will pay you $20,000. If 2017 is 0.1 degrees Celsius colder, you owe me $20,000. ",1

"The utter absence of climate change from President Trump’s State of the Union Address stands in stark contrast to its prominence in all of former President Obama’s speeches. Whether climate alarmists here and abroad like it or not, their pet topic has fallen off the agenda for the highest official in the world’s most powerful nation and its biggest economy. Just as the Department of Defense no longer includes climate change as a national security risk, Trump no longer includes it as a risk to America or the world. His boosting coal is a clear sign that the federal government’s love affair with diffuse, expensive, unreliable renewable energy sources like wind and solar is over. That’s good news for Americans, yes. But it’s especially good news for the poor in developing countries. Western environmentalist elites, dominating the United Nation’s Environment Program and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, have bullied them for years against using coal to lift their people out of poverty. Trump’s policies give them cover to buck that bullying and put their people’s needs first. ",1

Then, on the day he’s inaugurated, he should submit the treaty to the Senate, where it will die the ignominious death it deserves. ",1
"In short, rising population and expanding industry and agriculture were greater causes of Syrian conflict than climate change—not to mention centuries-old religio-political conflicts, which dwarf them as causes of Syria’s civil war, the rise of ISIS, and the refugee crisis.

"Environmentalism, as a movement, is an alternative world view and a substitute for Christianity. My principal concern about environmentalism is a religious, logical, ethical concern.

"0:56-1:27 God has said that all of the various cycles on which life depends are going to be sustained by his providential care from now until God ends heaven and Earth themselves in the last judgment.

"I am convinced that policies meant to reduce alleged carbon dioxide-induced global warming will be destructive. [15], ",1
"If CO2 reductions, intended to fight future global warming, end up increasing heating costs now, should Christians be for or against them? And if these same CO2 reductions increase food costs, how will that impact the world’s poorest? Why don’t we hear environmentalists talking about the negative impact of their climate change plans? Is that because there aren’t any? And how does biblical stewardship differ from environmentalism in the way each views Man? Does having a Reformed perspective on the environment really matter? You bet it does! ",1

"On long time periods, CO2 follows temperatures by about 200 to 800 years. But on fairly short time periods of a century or less, CO2 changes about nine to twelve-and-a-half months after temperature changes.

"Reasonable people recognize that green activists’ proposed 'solutions' have truly 'jumped the shark' this year, Beisner concluded. They have no basis in reality.

So I do think there’s much exaggeration (of the man-made warming threat), of the negative aspects, for political reasons. So that’s why I’m here (at this Conference). I do think the skeptical scientists are more honest and more truthful than those funded by governments to support the IPCC. ",1

"I know that there is a debate about [humans causing the warming of the planet] - that's all I am prepared to say. I'm not a scientist but when someone tells me that all the scientists agree, I say no they don't. They all agree that there's a tendency for human emissions to heat the planet, but whether that's responsible for all the heating is an open question. But I must say that once it was confidently predicted that there was run away warming and now we have had a pause for 16 years. Now please explain that. ",1

"Professor Ridd has on numerous occasions and in numerous ways seriously and repeatedly breached the Code of Conduct – his employment has been terminated on this basis. To suggest otherwise is simply wrong, the statement reads. ",1
"However, the University has objected to the manner in which he has done this. He has sensationalised his comments to attract attention, has criticised and denigrated published work, and has demonstrated a lack of respect for his colleagues and institutions in doing so. Academic rebuttal of his scientific views on the reef has been separately published. ",1
"Given his influence, a consideration of how Australian media covers climate science needs to include an analysis of the strategies used by Bolt to persuade his readers they should reject the findings of the vast majority of climate scientists. These strategies include personal abuse, cherry picking specific findings to refute the entire body of findings of climate scientists, portrayal of advocates of climate action as ideologically motivated with totalitarian tendencies and criticism of journalists who report on climate science. He presents himself as someone who is fighting a battle to reveal ‘truth’ and ‘secrets’ which ‘warmists’ want hidden to protect their vested interests. Once the ‘facts’ are established a triumphal, mocking tone is adopted. ",1
"The Met Office description should have been mentioned in Mr Bolt’s print article and blog of 1 February, even if he then rebutted it as unconvincing. It was not sufficient in these circumstances to assert ignorance of the response or to rely on the reader’s previous posting to inform other readers about it. ",1
"We aim to invest in the same companies stranded by COP21 outcomes and fossil fuel divestment.

The overall affect on climate [of the Paris Agreement] by any reputable scientific analysis is zero […] this is really a global governance issue. ,1
"Even if you buy the President’s beliefs about man-made causing of global warming, the outcome of this Paris Agreement will be insignificant. ",1
I am perfectly prepared to accept that Earth’s temperature is warming and perfectly prepared to accept that part of the increase in temperature is because of human activity. ,1
It’s an excellent decision. The Paris Accord is a self-licking ice cream cone. In the short-term its existence would have next to no effect. The danger was in the longer term. ,1
"I think that, in terms of choice of government, what we should look for is a government that enhances the possibility of individual freedom and individual activity and reduces the potential for collective government action. ",1
The European Union has never been about business and economics. It has from its inception been a political project to form a united Europe as an alternative pole to the United States and that project is now on the road to failure. ,1
So Paris does indeed mark a historic turning point. It is the moment when the political panic over climate change finally begins to collide with inescapable realities. ,1
"[A]lthough CO2 levels in the atmosphere have continued rising, it has become clearer than ever that global temperatures are no longer following suit… . evidence for a human link to such warming as has occurred in recent decades was not just being seriously exaggerated but even deliberately manipulated, to produce findings which the data simply did not justify. ",1
"In reality, the Paris agreement was no more than a vainglorious act of collective wishful thinking, orchestrated to fool the world into thinking that anything of significance had actually been achieved, Booke writes. The one huge consolation from all this is that nothing said or done in Paris last December will have the slightest effect on the world’s climate. ",1
"When future generations look back on the global-warming scare of the past 30 years, nothing will shock them more than the extent to which the official temperature records – on which the entire panic ultimately rested – were systematically adjusted to show the Earth as having warmed much more than the actual data justified. ",1
"When I first began examining the global-warming scare, I found nothing more puzzling than the way officially approved scientists kept on being shown to have finagled their data, as in that ludicrous hockey stick graph, pretending to prove that the world had suddenly become much hotter than at any time in 1,000 years. Any theory needing to rely so consistently on fudging the evidence, I concluded, must be looked on not as science at all, but as simply a rather alarming case study in the aberrations of group psychology.

"Curiously, the report notes how 'countless billions of dollars' have been spent testing the theory of climate change, including $2.8 billion appropriated for federal research by George H. W. Bush over four years. Billions of dollars of research sure sounds like an appraisal of evidence, but that’s just the first of many self-contradictions Booker makes throughout the report that undercut his contention that climate science is groupthink, DailyKOS reported. ",1
"All we can safely say, therefore, is that those official computer models didn't predict anything of what has been actually happening, Booker wrote. ",1
"I have lately been analysing in a paper for the Global Warming Policy Foundation, to show how the belief in man-made climate change has in every respect been a perfect case study in the rules of groupthink first identified 45 years ago by Irving Janis, a professor of psychology at Yale. ",1

Specifically, I’ll bet that the average annual number of Americans killed by these violent weather events from 2011 through 2030 will be lower than it was from 1991 through 2010. ",1
This is poor methodology and a dangerous precedent to use to protect public health in that it directs resources to potential threats and outliers in data as opposed to current environmental threats that are having a significant detrimental effect upon human health. There is no direct evidence that increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere have had a significant impact in respiratory diseases or cardiovascular diseases. ,1

"The divestment of fossil-fuel stocks is both ineffectual against its corporate targets and hurtful to ordinary people, Bradley said, describing divestment as a futile crusade. ",1
"Voluntary actions by corporations should not go beyond innovative win–win 'no regrets' initiatives. Greenhouse gas control practices that are uneconomic penalize either consumers or stockholders while politicizing the issue of corporate responsibility. Few will be satisfied, and the ineffectual measures will eventually have to be abandoned. ",1
"Expect a Green New Deal aiming to outlaw fossil-fuel usage to be a police state too, with self-interested actions towards cheaper, more reliable energies thwarting the central planners from Washington, D.C. ",1
[…] the proposed Green New Deal would be a giant leap on the road to serfdom. It would create the distortions and conflicts that would engender more of the same. Its slow-motion attack on wealth creation to subsidize the inefficient and a growing class of cronies would spiral the United States toward a present-day Venezuela. ,1
"[…] Rather than attempt to shave fractions of an inch off of future sea level rise in the distant future, policymakers should keep fossil fuels affordable, plentiful, and reliable to deal with climate and weather events of all kinds.

"There are many peer-reviewed scientific studies indicating that we should blame the 1980-98 warming blip on natural cycles, clouds, oceanic cooling, cosmic rays, sunspots and other solar influences.

The official temperature record is wrong. The instrumental raw data correctly show that New Zealand average temperatures have remained remarkably steady at 12.6°C +/- 0.5°C for a century and a half. NIWA’s doctoring of that data is indefensible. ,1
"We face a culture war right now in this country. […] I mean a war over the culture of freedom. Free enterprise is the bedrock notion of American culture.

"In The Battle: How the Fight between Free Enterprise and Big Government Will Shape America's Future (Basic Books, June 2010), Arthur C.

In the other, America moves toward a European-style social democracy characterized by increasing bureaucracies, income redistribution, and government control of corporations. ",1
"PRI’s president Sally Pipes, AEI’s past president Chris DeMuth, and new president Arthur Brooks, provide unflagging support for this project every year.

Koch Charitable Foundation, for whom we cannot adequately express our appreciation. —Steven F. Hayward ",1
"The data show that 2008 was the coolest year since 2000, and there has been no discernible warming for the last decade, after two decades of steady warming between 1979 and 1998, Hayward claimed. ",1
"The science is not settled, not by a long shot. […] If serious scientists can question Einstein’s theory of relativity, then there must be room for debate about the workings and complexities of the Earth’s atmosphere. Furthermore, even if we accept that carbon dioxide is bad, it’s not clear exactly what we should do about it. ",1
[W]e should be cheering the news that coal use is rising. For it means that more people are escaping the darkness and joining the modern world. ,1

"Liberal Democratic politicians in New York love to talk about climate change and what it will do to minority communities, but these climate politics will be felt by ratepayers. ",1
"In other words, regardless of lawmakers’ good intentions, there’s still no such thing as a free lunch — in the energy sector or anywhere else, Bryce concluded. ",1
"…there is one unassailable fact about the Green New Deal: It is not green. Indeed, the entire notion of an all-renewable-energy system is the antithesis of environmental protection and scenic conservation. ",1
"Despite the endless hype about electric cars, vehicles that plug into the grid remain a niche product that is sold almost exclusively to the affluent, Bryce wrote in the report, concluding that  Lower-income taxpayers should not be subsidizing wealthy motorists who buy EVs. ",1
"To avoid the kinds of results seen in Europe, U.S. policymakers at the federal and state levels should be required to do rigorous cost-benefit analyses before imposing renewable-energy mandates, Robert Bryce said. U.S. policymakers must also consider the impact higher energy costs will have on overall employment and industrial competitiveness. ",1
"But if developing countries are going to prepare for possible changes in the climate, they will have to get richer so they can afford to deal with any calamities that may occur. And how will they get richer? The answer is obvious: by consuming more energy. And for countries throughout the developing world, the lowest-cost energy is still coal, Bryce writes. ",1
The question at hand is obvious: why are policymakers implementing an energy policy that is a known killer of wildlife in exchange for what are infinitesimally small reductions in carbon dioxide emissions? ,1
You can go outside and spit and have the same effect as doubling carbon dioxide. ,1
"There are a number of causes of climatic change, and until all causes other than carbon dioxide increase are ruled out, we cannot attribute the change to carbon dioxide alone. ",1
"Proponents of policies to control human-induced global warming cite science as the basis for their claims and proposals. There is only one problem – as much as they claim otherwise, there is no scientific consensus for their theories. ",1
"In other words, we do not know if the earth will get warmer or cooler in the future, and if temperatures do change, by how much or when, or if public policies can affect future temperature change. ",1
The current warming trend began as Earth came out of the little ice age—an important fact that is all too often overlooked in the global warming debate. ,1
"[…] Even if it weren’t unconstitutional, it’s still terrible policy, because it imposes huge costs on individuals and businesses and makes the nation’s electric power supply less reliable—all while doing nothing to prevent climate change or to protect human health or the environment. Good riddance to a bad regulation. ",1
"[T]here is no predicted human health effect from increased CO2 emissions at any foreseeable level. […] nothing the EPA could do would reduce the speculative effects of global warming on sea levels, human health, or weather patterns — since EPA regulations can't affect these things, it ought not to regulate emissions as if it could.

"What scientific and economic evidence is there that the plan is putting the nation on the right path for economic growth, environmental protection, or both?  ",1
Governments are trying to achieve unanimity by stifling any scientist who disagrees [with man-made global warming theory]. Einstein could not have got funding under the present system. ,1
"It's likely that CO2 has some warming effect, but real proof of that hypothesis is tricky. You have to confirm by observation exactly how the CO2 changes the situation at different altitudes in the atmosphere and in different regions of the world. For example, CO2 is supposed to warm the upper air faster than the surface, but the measurements don't show that happening. When the CO2 effect is eventually pinned down, it will probably turn out to be weaker and much less worrisome than predicted by the global warming theorists. ",1
"Few things annoy me more than to hear people talking about carbon dioxide being a pollutant. You're made of carbon dioxide, I'm made of carbon dioxide, carbon dioxide is how living things grow ",1
"The Obama Administration has made many efforts to support its climate religion (climatism). Since this viewpoint has no basis in the scientific method, it is not science and would seem best characterized as religion. ",1
"Science is never settled, but the current state of 'climate change' science is quite clear: There is essentially zero evidence that carbon dioxide from human activities is causing catastrophic climate change. — Tom Harris and Bob Carter, New York Post. ",1
"There IS a problem with global warming. […] it stopped in 1998. […] That industrial carbon dioxide is not the primary cause of earth's recent decadal-scale temperature changes doesn't seem at all odd to many thousands of independent scientists. They have long appreciated - ever since the early 1990s, when the global warming bandwagon first started to roll behind the gravy train of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - that such short-term climate fluctuations are chiefly of natural origin.

"[…] If one wanted to sum up Willie Soon in a single sentence, it would be that he radiates scientific expertise, obeisance to empirical data, enthusiasm, commitment to communication, concern for both scientific and personal integrity and good humour in roughly equal measure.​ ",1
No one should trust the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report issued today. The IPCC has a history of malfeasance that even includes rewording recommendations of expert science advisers to fit the alarmist agenda of participating governments. ,1
"[…] the empirical data stressed by climate rationalists will ultimately prevail over the predictions of the unvalidated computer models. Perhaps then we will be able to attend to the real climate policy problem, which is to prepare response plans for extreme weather events, and for climate warmings as well as coolings, in the same way we prepare to cope with all other natural hazards.

The first thing to be clear about is that carbon dioxide is not a pollutant. ,1
"contrary to strong public belief, the effects of increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are generally beneficial. Enhanced plant growth has many obvious benefits, amongst them increased natural vegetation growth in general, and increased agricultural production in particular. And to maintain or slightly increase planetary temperature is also very much a global good if – as Ruddiman and other scientists assert – the human production of greenhouse gases is helping to hold our planetary environment in its historic, benignly warm, interglacial mode.

"We are putting together what I think is the most comprehensive, unique, entertaining and humorous climate documentary that has ever been done or attempted, Morano had said before the film was released. ",1
I am not interviewing a lot of the main climate sceptical scientists because I feel like they have been interviewed by many other people and their stories have been told. I am trying to find another layer of scientist whose stories have not been out there yet. You will see a lot of new names in this. ,1
"There is a consensus among climate scientists that human activity is contributing to climate change. However, claims that rising temperatures pose an existential threat to the human race or modern civilization are not well supported by climate science or economics; to the contrary, they are every bit as far from the mainstream as claims that climate change is not occurring or that it will be beneficial. Analyses consistently show that the costs of climate change are real but manageable. For instance, the prosperity that the world might achieve in 2100 without climate change may instead be delayed until 2102, Cass wrote in a Manhattan Institute Issue Brief titled Climate Costs in Context. ",1
"I am convinced by the scientific consensus on climate change, but I would still slam the door in the face of anyone who came to me with that offer. If an insurance salesman promises his policy is not-too-expensive but tells you nothing concrete about the benefits, walk away quickly. ",1
"Accepting the science does not, however, require one to accept the liberal policy prescriptions.  Science is only an input to any policy discussion, and nowhere is this truer than in the case of climate change, where the scientific consensus resolves remarkably little. More carbon in the atmosphere leads to warming, but how much warming? Scientists speak in terms of 'climate sensitivity — how sensitive is the climate to some increase in carbon dioxide? Here there is very little agreement. ",1
"Perhaps if the nation were struggling with unprecedented pollution and seeking to implement new laws in response, an EPA Administrator who specialized in pollution control technology would be more appropriate. But that is not the case. As the EPA proclaims proudly, air pollution has declined 70 percent in the past 45 years. What the nation struggles with today is costly and unlawful overreach by its federal environmental agency. Pruitt can help to fix that.  ",1
"Even if President Trump reverses President Obama’s efforts, the marginal effect on future climate change will be minimal because Obama’s efforts were so inconsequential, Cass wrote at the National Review. ",1
"If the topic of conversation is climate policy, conservatives should be winning. They will need to show endless patience in the face of ever more bizarre hyperbole — a Reaganesque 'There you go again' is probably about right. And they will need to confidently describe an affirmative policy agenda, preferably emphasizing research and development that might identify new technologies so cheap and clean that developing countries will want to use them along with tools for adapting to whatever climate change does bring, Cass wrote at the National Review. ",1
"If you actually care about global warming, you should be rooting against an agreement, Cass said of the Paris Climate Agreement in an article at Politico. ",1
"[…] Precisely because America has made so much environmental progress, a marginal investment in further economic growth now offers a far greater societal return than a marginal investment in further environmental quality. ",1

"In at least two cases, the appointments may have already led to violations of the administration’s own ethics rules, the Times articles reads. One such case involves Michael Catanzaro, who serves as the top White House energy adviser. Until late last year, he was working as a lobbyist for major industry clients such as Devon Energy of Oklahoma, an oil and gas company, and Talen Energy of Pennsylvania, a coal-burning electric utility, as they fought Obama-era environmental regulations, including the landmark Clean Power Plan. Now, he is handling some of the same matters on behalf of the federal government. ",1

"The Clinton Administration has launched an all-out propaganda campaign to facilitate passage of a United Nations-sponsored global-warming treaty that, if ratified, could wreck havoc on middle-class American families while allowing major polluters such as Communist China and India to escape the treaty's restrictions on so-called 'greenhouse' gas emissions, He wrote. Worse, there is no scientific consensus that global warming is indeed taking place — the reason Clinton has mounted a massive propaganda campaign, he added. ",1
"Because 98 percent of Oregon is open space, largely covered with vegetation, it's at least plausible that Oregon is actually a net sink for CO2 rather than a net source.

Kulongoski to impose additional regulations on Oregonians, such as the costly California automotive emissions standards he is advocating. ",1

"The Siren Song of a coal-free grid is ultimately destructive. We suggest that the Senate Committee steer around it. If that means that the advocates move forward with their threatened ballot measures, so be it. Voters are quite capable of deciding for themselves if they want a power grid that works, or one that randomly fails, Charles concludes.  ",1
Scientists see no temperature increase (on average) in the oceans or on the surface of the Earth over the last decade. That hasn't stopped an activist group from infiltrating high schools with the panicky message that we are on the verge of a planetary emergency due to global warming. ,1
"Even if we eliminated that 1.2 per cent. [of global emissions], would it make any difference to the world? I do not think that it would—indeed, the burdens on our economy would be even more enormous than they are already likely to be, Chope declared in a House of Commons debate. ",1
"The issue that we are discussing needs to be put into context. A paper that PricewaterhouseCoopers produced, entitled ‘The world in 2050,’ projects that the United Kingdom will produce only 1.2 per cent. of global emissions in 2050—without the increased targets in the Bill and without including emissions from shipping and aviation. We must take that into consideration. Even if we eliminated that 1.2 per cent., would it make any difference to the world?

"[W]e are not morally bad people for taking carbon and turning it into the energy that offers life to humanity in a world that would otherwise be brutal (think of life before modernity). On the contrary, we are good people for doing so, Christy said. ",1
"The American Meteorological Society did their survey and they specifically asked the question, Is man the dominate controller of climate over the last 50 years? Only 52 percent said yes. That is not a consensus at all in science … Roy and I have both made the statement that we are in the 97 percent because we believe in some (man-made) effect. ",1
"That makes both of them authors of the less than 3% of peer-reviewed climate science papers rejecting the consensus on human-caused global warming. This is an indisputable fact – the 97% consensus figure is based on our team’s categorization of the scientific literature, and we put their research outside the 97% consensus. ",1
"NASA, NOAA, EPA, DOE, those are agencies. Agency leaders are appointed by the government, by the current administration. They do not represent objective independent scientific organizations, Christy said. They can’t. They are appointed by the head. They try. People who come out with different views in their organizations are found to be squashed. There is an agenda in those agencies … There are skeptics in NASA and NOAA, a good number. But they are quiet. They know in this administration, they don’t speak out.  ",1
Carbon dioxide makes things grow. The world used to have five times as much carbon dioxide as it does now. Plants love this stuff. It creates more food. CO2 is not the problem … There is absolutely no question that carbon energy provides with longer and better lives. There is no question about that.  ,1
"I showed some evidence that humans are causing warming in the surface measurements that we have, but it is not the greenhouse relation, Christy said. Are we going to return the Central Valley to a desert? Are we going to tell all the people in Africa they cannot burn wood anymore? Well, we could if we gave them coal-fired electricity, I suppose, which would be better for the environment because their forests are being destroyed. The habitat for the wild animals is going away because these people are chopping down the forests to survive. ",1
A common view on the current climate change (global warming) is that it is a result of fossil fuel burning and the following increase in atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide. In reality there are several factors that produce the current climate change. Some of the most important are: ,1
"Thus, two of the three pillars of the global warming and carbon dioxide paradigm are open to reinvestigation.The damage has been done. The public trust in climate science has been eroded. At least a part of the IPCC 2007 report has been put in question. We cannot blame it on a few irresponsible individuals. The entire esteemed climate research community has to take responsibility. Yes, there always will be a few deniers and obstructionists. ",1
"According to the an excerpt from the abstract provided by Petr Chylek, et al. (.docx), According to the regression model the current warming slowdown should last till about 2045, after that a faster warming is expected to resume. ",1
"Solar activity of the last hundred years, over the last several hundred years correlates very nicely on a decadal basis, with sea ice and Arctic temperatures. ",1
"The pollution and emissions from the oil sands have been greatly exaggerated. Killing the oil sands would be to the great detriment of all Canadians, from aboriginal groups to engineers and other workers alike. It is greener energy than many other sources. ",1
"The oil sands contribute very, very little to global CO2. If one believes in global warming, then one must accept that the oil sands contribute very, very little to warming. Shutting down those operations would do nothing to reducing CO2 emissions. … CO2, however, has had no apparent impact on the warming periods. ",1
Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is the technological pathway to both meeting climate change goals and unlocking the full economic value of our greatest energy resource- coal. ,1
"I have written, spoken and testified quite a bit on coal's importance to the quality of life around the world, especially in developing nations. I have worked with the Coal Industry Advisory Board, International Energy Agency, World Coal Association, the American Coal Council and the NCC, as well as a number of private coal based companies and regional groups. ",1
"There is no substitute for coal. To replace the world's coal power plants would require about 5,000 Hoover Dams or constructing a new nuclear power plant every four days for the next 25 years or adding more than 5 million wind turbines — enough to stretch 1 million miles to the moon and back twice. ",1
"[…] On the other side of the globe, since 1990, China has used coal-based energy to lift 650 million people out of poverty, reduce female illiteracy by almost 80 percent and decrease infant mortality by 70 percent. Clean coal technologies, including the construction of highly efficient supercritical power plants, provide the opportunity for the rest of the developing world to utilize coal to eradicate the specter of energy poverty that haunts billions. ",1
"Coal is now powering the remarkable 21st century socio-economic miracle unfolding in China, where 80% of the global population taken out of poverty in the last 20 years is Chinese. Importantly, this increasing dependence on coal continues apace as India and other developing countries are emerging from the wings to seek a better life for their citizens through coal. ",1
"In none of these cases is the sponsor identified. All my work is published as an independent scholar, Clemente said.  ",1
"I was not on the Penn State payroll during the publication of either of the two documents that were mentioned in the Greenpeace blog. Thus, the University is not responsible for my work in any way, he told ABC News via email.  ",1
"When Dr Clemente expresses his views on issues publicly, they are his own and do not reflect the views of the university, she said. ",1
The purpose of this paper is to highlight for policy makers the value of coal to world economic and social development and so encourage development of a policy environment that will allow the coal and electricity industries to make the necessary investments in production capacity and CO2 emissions reduction technologies. ,1
"China is providing a template of how coal can be used to pull people out of poverty and propel an entire society toward higher living standards. India and many other countries around the world are learning from China’s example, Clemente writes. ",1

"We should specifically discuss the potential for EPA Watch as a part of media and other efforts. I have previously discussed with Tom Borelli several ideas for expanding the impact of EPA Watch and the reputation of Bonner Cohen as an expert on EPA matters. At a minimum, a series of radio actualities with Bonner commenting on EPA matters could reach an extremely wide audience, and we can tailor geographically for maximum appeal. We think it also possible to establish a standard format that could give Bonner presence as an expert commentator, butt that requires further investigation. As a part of the D-Day operation, Bonner's name was provided to several Colorado journalists as an outside resource on EPA transgressions. ",1

[W]e’re in the midst of an enormous battle. A battle between the entrenched interest of the environmental community and government regulatory agencies in Washington and […] ordinary citizens. ,1
"[T]he vision that the environmentalists are trying to impose on the rest of us is contrary to how nature works and, if you predicate your actions, regulations, laws, assorted schemes from rails to trails to heritage areas and what have you, ultimately on the notion that you are protecting nature by preserving the balance, by protecting the ecosystem, you are actually working contrary to how nature functions, and the results of this can be absolutely catastrophic, not just for the rural people caught up in all of this whose livelihoods are regularly destroyed by the environmentalists, but also to nature itself. ",1
"[T]he banning of DDT and the similar regulations were something which were not based on available scientific evidence, so too is the environmental vision being imposed on rural America itself, contrary to how nature really works.  ",1
"Indeed, public discussion of environmental issues is replete with references to 'toxic' chemicals or 'toxic pollutants.' In reality, these are regulatory terms with no basis in science. ",1
"At an Environmental Protection Agency hearing last Thursday on carbon-dioxide 'pollution' standards for new power plants, environmental policy analyst Bonner Cohen pointed out that the total U.S. contribution of atmospheric carbon dioxide is a tiny 0.01 percent: 'The contribution of coal-fired power plants to the U.S., much less global, CO2 emissions is so minuscule that it cannot be measured with any degree of accuracy.'

He has been interviewed on Fox News, CNN, Fox Business Channel, BBC, BBC Worldwide Television, NBC, NPR, N 24 (German language news channel), Voice of Russia, and scores of radio stations in the U.S. ",1
"At this point there is little doubt that the IPCC position is seriously flawed in its central position that humanity is responsible for most of the observed warming of the last third of the 20th century, and in its projections for effects in the 21st century. ",1
"Regardless of what’s happening to the temperature, the fact that there’s more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has provided a major increase in plant life on the surface of the planet, Cohen said. Which benefits us all. ",1
"So what do we really know? We Know that climate is far too complex and too insensitive to greenhouse gases to pretend that we can 'stabilize' it by marginal changes in CO2 emissions, whether it is California's AB32, or the many incarnations of national legislation or global proposals. We know that government policies offer great economic pain and no environmental gain. We also know that the global warming issue has produced intellectual deception and the subversion of the scientific process, widespread corporate rent seeking, and the gross waste of resources that could have gone to improve our environment. But we still have it within our grasp to restore integrity to the science process and to avert unnecessary economic hardship, especially for the world's poorest who might otherwise aspire to make great strides this century.

"When all the scare talk is pushed aside, it is the science that should be the basis for the debate. And the hard cold truth is that the basic theory has failed. Many notable scientists reject man-made global warming fears. And several of them, including a Nobel Prize winner, are in the new Climate Hustle movie.

"Now the really good news: The increase in our atmospheric carbon dioxide during the 20th and early 21st  centuries has produced no deleterious effects upon Earth’s weather and climate. There is absolutely no correlation between the increase in CO2 and average worldwide or US temperatures. And, predictions of harmful climatic effects due to future increases in hydrocarbon use and resulting increases in minor greenhouse gases such as CO2 do not conform to current experimental knowledge or have any scientific basis. On the other hand, increased carbon dioxide has markedly increased plant growth. Forest growth and farm crop output per acre have grown proportionally with increased atmospheric CO2 that is a key to photosynthesis in plants. ",1

The EPA was driven by political concerns and used questionable scientific reports to reach an outcome driven by politics. The EPA findings of endangerment of health and welfare are hypocritical as they failed to consider and properly weigh the offsetting harms to the health and welfare that will flow from their economically destructive regulation. The EPA needs to stop playing politics with its regulations. The EPA’s Endangerment finding will harm the Commonwealth of Virginia.  ",1

"[…] global warming alarmists invariably try to make their case by resorting to rhetoric, dogma, opinion, and emotion. The closest thing to scientific data in their articles is the occasional chart claiming a poorly understood correlation between atmospheric CO2 and the Earth's temperature. ",1
"[…] The reality is that atmospheric CO2 has a minimal impact on greenhouse gases and world temperature. Water vapor is responsible for 95 percent of the greenhouse effect. CO2 contributes just 3.6 percent, with human activity responsible for only 3.2 percent of that. That is why some studies claim CO2 levels are largely irrelevant to global warming. ",1
"The climate on our planet has been changing for billions of years. And life on our planet has evolved by adapting to those changes. Today, global warming alarmists want us to believe that climate change is a threat to our civilization when it really is a program for governmental control of our energy consumption and our standard of living. One of the greatest scientific hoaxes in history, Cunningham said in his speech. ",1
"I'm here to encourage everyone to look at the data themselves, not just buy what they’re told. I find that my standards for science are more important to me than anything else, and I hate to see them being depreciated by the alarmists’ claims today. Politics and the media and what have you have allowed us now to be facing one of the biggest scientific hoaxes in history. That’s what’s being pushed on us. ",1
"[I]n terms of climate hoaxes, perhaps it is NOT Donald Trump’s whose pants are on fire. ",1
"She said temperatures have been on the rise for more than 200 years. And that's not human, she said, suggesting that something other than industrial greenhouse gases is causing them to climb. ",1
"The hottest topic in climate research is the observation that global average surface temperature, as well as satellite observations of temperatures in the atmosphere, has shown little or no warming during the 21st century. ",1
Does it make more sense to provide air conditioning or to limit CO2 emissions.  I vote for more air conditioning in these susceptible regions. ,1
"Even on the timescale of decade or two, we could end up be very surprised on how the climate plays out and it might not be getting warmer like the UN IPCC says. We don’t know what's going to happen. All other things being equal – yes – more carbon dioxide means warmer, but all other things are never equal. We just don’t know. I think we are fooling ourselves to think that CO2 control knob really influences climate on these decadal or even century time scales. ",1
"I am broadly concerned about the slow death of free speech, but particularly in universities and also with regards to the climate change debate. ",1
"If all other things remain equal, it is clear that adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere will warm the planet. However the real difficulty is that nothing remains equal, and reliable prediction of the impact of carbon dioxide on the climate requires that we understand natural climate variability properly. Until we understand natural climate variability better, we cannot reliably infer sensitivity to greenhouse gas forcing or understand its role in influencing extreme weather events. […] While 20th century climate change is most often explained in terms of external forcing, with natural internal variability providing high frequency ‘noise,’ the role of large multidecadal oscillations is receiving increasing attention. ",1
"The manufactured consensus of the IPCC has had the unintended consequences of distorting the science, elevating the voices of scientists that dispute the consensus, and motivating actions by the consensus scientists and their supporters that have diminished the public’s trust in the IPCC. ",1
"Sea level has been overall rising since the last ice age, with some ups and downs. Sea level has been rising for the past 200 years […] Humans are not going to stop sea level rise on the time scale of a few centuries by ceasing emissions of CO2, Curry wrote. ",1
"Rather than attempt to shave fractions of an inch off of future sea level rise in the distant future, policymakers should keep fossil fuels affordable, plentiful, and reliable to deal with climate and weather events of all kinds. Free-market adaptation, not a futile crusade to ‘stabilize’ climate, is the obvious choice for a free, prosperous world. ",1
"I'm mostly concerned about the behavior of other scientists, Curry claimed early in her testimony. Scientists who demonize their opponents are behaving in a way that’s antithetical to the scientific process. These are the tactics of enforcing a premature theory for political purpose, she said. ",1
" There is enormous pressure for climate scientists to conform to the so-called consensus, Curry said in her testimony. Owing to these pressures, and the gutter tactics of the academic debate on climate change, I recently resigned my tenured faculty position at Georgia Tech.  ",1
"Now, we hear so much about uncertainty, as if uncertainty is a reason for inaction. But, in this case, the uncertainties are breaking against us. Because we are actually seeing more rapid loss of ice from those ice sheets than the climate models that many here criticize had predicted in the past. ",1
"[T]hese are not useful studies, she said. What we need is more fundamental climate dynamics research to understand how the climate system works on decadal to century time scales and use this understanding to develop new structural forms for our climate models. ",1
"Which means that she is clearly going against what the U.S. National Academy of Sciences has said—what every academic, scientific organization in the U.S. that has weighed in on the matter has said—and I find that distressing, Mann said. ",1
"I am not out there in the fringes. My main point is that I think there are a lot of uncertainties and that the climate models and the data, etc., are not fit for the purpose for drawing highly confident conclusions about what has been causing the recent warming.  ",1
"I just want to say that’s what I’m talking about. I didn’t call Judith Curry a climate change denier here, today. There is a statement in the written statement that she is a climate science denier. And this is precisely what I’m talking about. She has argued we might be responsible for less than 50% of the warming that we have seen. The IPCC has assessed that, actually assessed the likelihood that that could be true. It’s one in ten thousand. One in ten thousand is the likelihood of something that she claims to be true. ",1
"In my opinion, this is correct and is a healthy position for both the science and policy debates, Curry added.  ",1
"There's all sorts of different kinds of uncertainty, Curry said. There's measurement uncertainty, there's data processing uncertainty, most more significantly there's uncertainties about things we don't even know about. […] My concern about the IPCC is they really take shortcuts in terms of doing the work try to understand and sometimes quantify the uncertainty, and they just use expert judgement. ",1
"It's a very complex social contract, Curry replies. Between the IPCC scientists and the policymakers. The policymakers are concerned about dangerous climate change, and the IPCC is supposed to quantify the evidence for dangerous climate change. Well, that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy if, in the process of all that, you're neglecting to understand natural climate change. So, the way the whole thing has been framed introduces a bias. […] ",1
" Yes, temperatures have been increasing overall for the past several hundred years. And that carbon dioxide does act to warm the planet. But there's no agreement as to whether warming is dangerous or not, Curry said.  ",1
"Instead, by their dogmatic statements about climate change and their policy advocacy, they have become just another group of lobbyists, having ceded the privilege traditionally afforded to dispassionate scientific reasoning to political activists in the scientific professional societies. ",1
"The reason that this is a unique film, Morano has said, is that we are going for a pop culture-friendly… sarcastic approach and we actually give both sides in this movie.  ",1
"[The IPCC's] models treat the oceans as distilled water when in reality they are an infinite buffer for atmospheric CO2. Burning all the earth’s fossil fuels would amount to no more than a 20 percent increase. It could never double(2). In any event, ice cores tell us carbon dioxide lags, not leads, the temperatures by as much as 800 years. ",1
"Even if climate science is as robust as the president asserts, in the absence of a global agreement on carbon emissions, mandates and subsidies to produce renewable energy will have negligible impact on global temperatures and on the weather. A 1998 study on the effect of the Kyoto Protocol estimated that, if fully implemented, it would delay the rise in global temperatures by four to 14 years over the course of the current century and have a minimal effect on the rise of sea levels. However, the cost of the attempt would be at the expense of the competitiveness of American business and American taxpayers and consumers. ",1
"If climate scientists are really as confident in their understanding of the climate as the IPCC's 95% confidence headline figure is meant to suggest, they would put a firm date by when the pause must end and temperatures bounce back to what the IPCC claims is the long-term upward trend. All too predictably, the IPCC avoids such a hard-edged test […] The body's flagrant disregard for the InterAcademy Council's findings and its reluctance to address the 15-year warming pause are symptomatic of a failure of leadership. The conclusion is unavoidable: The IPCC is unreformable and the Fifth Assessment Report should be the IPCC's last. ",1
"Acting alone, the sacrifice of blue-collar jobs is entirely about political symbolism and appeasing wealthy green activists. ",1
"Upholders of the consensus argue that increased carbon dioxide is the only way to explain rising global temperatures. Now there is a competing explanation, with a chronology that better fits the evidence. ",1
"They [renewables] are unreliable. Battery storage is inadequate. Wind and solar output depends on the weather. The cost of decarbonization using today’s technology is ‘beyond astronomical,’ Mr. Gates concluded. [15], ",1
The time has come for a closer and more intimate relationship between industry and academia. ,1
"I have never ever denied that the climate changes. In fact, on every single occasion that I have spoken on this subject, I have made the point straightaway that of course the climate changes, but that it has been changing for a lot longer than 250 years. ",1
"…the BBC have accepted hook, line and sinker the so-called scientific consensus on climate change and not allowed anyone onto the airwaves who wants to question it. ",1
"If anyone from the BBC is listening, I will debate this with the best scientists they can find in the country or across the world. Bring them on. ",1
…it is not proven that the carbon dioxide that has gone into the atmosphere is responsible for the relatively small amount of warming that has taken place since industrialisation. ,1
"Over the last 250 years there has been an average increase in temperatures of less than one degree blamed on man made emissions of CO2, although even the alarmists at the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) accept that some is natural. ",1
"There was a cooling from the 1940s onwards. That is why, when I was growing up in the 1970s, people were worried that the next ice age was coming. ",1
"Groups such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth are simply described as that and their spokespeople are given licence to say whatever they want, whereas that is not the case for an organisation that may question some of the so-called consensus about climate change. The Global Warming Policy Foundation, for example, will always be described as an organisation set up by Nigel Lawson that questions the scientific consensus around climate change. ",1
"We have had few debates about global warming and climate change. Climate change has been with us for millions of years, ever since the Earth was created. I urge the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change to ask a few hard questions of those who are frankly displaying some hysteria about climate change. In the past 2,000 years, there have been periods of warming and cooling. It was warmer during the Roman period; it got cooler in the dark ages; it was probably warmer during the medieval period than it is now, and it got cooler again until about 1680, during the so-called little ice age.

"Scrapping the Clean Power Plan is another step toward abandoning the myth of anthropogenic global warming, and it follows President Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris climate accord.

"The major obstacle to achieving energy independence and the reindustrialization of America is politics – specifically, overzealous environmental groups such as Greenpeace. ",1
"Clearly, we do not yet have the necessary proven technologies or technologies having sufficient scale to dramatically cut CO2 emissions. Forging ahead without the needed technologies will cause severe economic harm by cutting our supply of electricity and reducing America's standard of living. ",1

"He was not saying this as a politician says it. (‘And if we use spoons not shovels we can create even more jobs…’ That sort of playground thinking is very common among politicians.) And whatever anybody thinks about Donald Trump you can be confident of this. At 21, at Le Cirque, somewhere at some point, somebody who is making a killing off the rents of the global warming industry laughed it up a little too loudly or once too many times around Donald Trump. Because what he said to the Washington Post was 'You’re robbing Peter to pay Paul. Goldmans is making a killing out of this.' That’s what I heard him say. Politicians normally fall for this. But not Donald. Instead – what I heard him say 'They’re making a lot of money out of this' – he said: 'You’re propping up, sometimes even standing up industries, to transfer taxpayer money to them. And he didn’t go into Energy Poverty or the Economic Drag or the inefficiency or the opportunity cost or the 2.2 jobs. He just said: 'You’re robbing Peter to pay Paul. A lot of people are making a lot of money off this.' And to me he was saying 'This is something of a scam.' You can take his Chinese hoax comments, you can take hoax in any context but the fact is the way they’re playing out the global warming industry there are many scams involved and I think he was aware of this. I do think at one point somebody laughed a little too loudly… ",1

Energy production in America should be based on the free market, not artificially propped up in ways that mask the real cost to the consumer and the taxpayer. ",1
"There are significant legal, technical, and policy deficiencies to the so-called Clean Power Plan and this legislation provides important safeguards for Missouri, said Domenech. Missouri will be significantly impacted by the CPP’s carbon emission rule since 83 percent of Missouri’s electricity is produced by low cost coal and the EPA is demanding the state reduce emissions by 37 percent. It is high time for states to coordinate a response to this EPA overreach and this is exactly what the Interstate Power Compact does. ",1
"The elite can afford higher energy costs. But people on fixed incomes, and lower- and middle-income families (including many African Americans and Latinos/Hispanics), and businesses that provide jobs to working class people—they need energy that’s affordable. For many of them, the choice is between the CPP […] and keeping the lights on, Domenech concludes in the report. ",1
The policies of the United States should not doom third world countries to a lifetime of poverty. Allowing everyone to unleash the potential prosperity and health generated by fossil fuels is how we transform society. Everyone deserves to have the same benefits we enjoy. ,1
"The administration’s big climate program is the Clean Power Plan and has been finalized by the EPA and published in the federal register about two months ago and what you saw was immediately 27 states filed suits in the courts, Domenech said. It’s going to boil down to the state level. ",1
"According to Domenech, The Pope is being really ill-advised by folks that are really more global leftists concerned about ending capitalism more than helping the environment. ",1
"The Heritage Foundation put out a great study that talks about how expensive it's going to be. They estimate that everybody's bill, including the poorest people in our society, are going to end up paying 12 to 17 percent more for their electricity. Heritage estimates a loss of 2.5 trillion in GDP across the country, and more than a million job losses. When you close these plants, especially coal plants, across the country, people are going to lose their jobs. ",1
"The plan they put out really is illegal, and it far exceeds the authority of the EPA's ability in the Clean Air Act to even impose something like this, Domenech adds.  ",1
"The final rule is still illegal and will be changed in court as soon as the ink is dry later this summer, Domenech says. The cost of the rule is in the billions. The final rule still imposes higher energy prices on families, businesses, and the poor, he adds. ",1
[T]he final rule threatens the electric power grid. ,1
"Congress should continue its efforts to restrict funding for the plan, passing legislation protecting ratepayers, and allowing governors to have the flexibility to reject the plan if it raises electricity rates. ",1
" This latest rule does nothing for the environment, costs billions to implement, and hurts people and businesses by increasing the cost of electricity for everyone, said Domenech. It is critical that states not comply with this unconstitutional rule. Economic vitality is at stake, jobs are at stake, and low income Americans will disproportionately suffer its consequences. ",1
"The EPA's so-called Clean Power Plan is an illegal takeover of the electric power production sector and amounts to a national energy tax on all Americans, he wrote. The administration's goal is to force states to replace their current mix of low cost, reliable energy fuels with a higher cost mix of renewables that are largely dependent on the weather.  ",1
The EPA is an overreaching federal agency unbounded by public opinion or congressional oversight that acts recklessly on secret science. It is high time to withdraw the Clean Power Plan rule. ,1
"Oklahoma recognizes the EPA’s Clean Power Plan edict for what it is: a power grab, Domenech wrote. The overreach by this federal agency is an attempt to take control over power generation in the states in such a way that would dramatically increase costs on individuals and businesses alike while harming jobs and states’ economies. I applaud Governor Fallin for taking such a strong stand against this seriously flawed and unconstitutional EPA regulation. State – all states – should count the cost of complying in terms of higher electricity rates on all families – rich and poor – and all businesses – large and small. ",1
"The observed pattern of warming, comparing surface and atmospheric temperature trends, does not show the characteristic fingerprint associated with greenhouse warming. The inescapable conclusion is that the human contribution is not significant and that observed increases in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases make only a negligible contribution to climate warming.

"Have the models been successful in predicting anything? They, of course, predict substantial global warming. This is not surprising given the expressed belief of some of the model builders in the global warming Hypothesis and the many parameters in the model that need to be introduced. However, the models also predict unambiguously that the atmosphere is warming faster than the surface of the earth; but all the available observational data unambiguously shows the opposite! ",1

Anything that will negatively impact supply or the cost of energy will impact consumers, so it’s a false assumption that only industry will have to bear the burden of complying with a stringent, unrealistic climate change mandate. Both our employees and our customers will be adversely affected should such legislation be signed into law. ",1
"Electric Vehicle and Solar Panel subsidies are a massive transfer of wealth from the poor and middle class to the rich, Drevna said, quoted at The Washington Free Beacon. We should not force those least able to afford it to pay for programs that will not benefit them and only continue line the pockets of the crony capitalists. ",1
"The Renewable Fuel Standard was based on incorrect assumptions about oil production and consumption, as well as the ability of Congress and the administration to mandate and create incentives for innovation and vast technological and economic leaps in biofuel production Drevna says in his written testimony. The results of the RFS are a failure for America. […] is time to end the RFS and let American fuel producers focus on delivering the best products to American motorists. ",1
"More importantly, statements often appearing in the media like 'the majority of scientists' believe in Global Warming, are meaningless. First of all, no legitimate survey has ever been done, and secondly, science is not about the number of people who advocate a position. ",1
"When I first heard about wind energy I was a supporter. Quite frankly, I never liked the looks of turbines but felt that we would have to live with the unsightliness as a trade-off for the good I initially assumed they were doing.

"As a result of the burning of coal and oil, the driving of cars, and other human activities, the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is increasing at a rate of about half a percent per year […] the physical effects of carbon dioxide are seen in changes of rainfall, cloudiness, wind strength, and temperature, which are customarily lumped together in the misleading phrase 'global warming.'

"We are entering a solar cycle of much reduced sunspots, very similar to that which accompanied the change from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age, which virtually all scientists agree was caused by solar variation. Thus, we seem to be headed for cooler temperatures as a result of reduced solar irradiance. ",1
"[…] CO2 levels for the past 500 million years were consistently greater than 3,000 ppm. 400ppm is abnormally low. ",1
I am continuing to predict global cooling for the next couple of decades at least. ,1
In God we trust. All others bring data. ,1
"If the cycles continue as in the past, the current warm cycle should end soon and global temperatures should cool slightly until about 2035, then warm about 0.5°C from ~2035 to ~2065, and cool slightly until 2100. The total increase in global warming for the century should be ~0.3 °C, rather than the catastrophic warming of 3-6°C (4-11°F) predicted by the IPCC. ",1
"What about all the claims then that temperatures are warmer now than they have ever been? Easterbrook asks. These are patently not true. Those claims come from manipulation of data. […] The hottest year of record number one […] is 1936. Everybody has acknowledged 1936 was the warmest year of this century. Until NOAA and NASA begin to manipulate the old data and made it cooler, and elevated the recent temperatures and made them warmer. ",1
"Evidence-Based Climate Science: Data opposing CO2 emissions as the primary source of global warming objectively gathers and analyzes scientific data concerning patterns of past climate changes, influences of changes in ocean temperatures, the effect of solar variation on global climate, and the effect of CO2 on global climate to clearly and objectively present counter-global-warming evidence not embraced by proponents of CO2. ",1
[T]he Earth's climate is not changing in an unusual or anomalous fashion. The EPA relied on instrumental data that were adjusted to exaggerate the increase in global temperatures.  ,1
"He simply assumes that correlation equals causation and future climate change will be similar to past patterns. However, given that human greenhouse gas emissions are dominating current and future climate changes, ignoring this elephant in the room is the primary cause for Easterbrook's projection inaccuracy, Skeptical Science concludes.

"… the consensus of the scientific community has shifted from skepticism to near-unanimous acceptance of the evidence of an artificial greenhouse effect. Second, while artificial climate change may have some beneficial effects, the odds are we’re not going to like it.

"Though environmental orthodoxy holds that Third World deforestation is caused by rapacious clear-cutters and ruthless cattle barons, penniless peasants seeking fuel wood may be the greatest threat to our forests. ",1
"If our goal in legislating against carbon releases is not simply punishing the West and its power companies but truly trying to reduce the accumulation of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere, the main event will be in the developing world. We must use the smartest possible economics, and that means investing in China and India. ",1
Ebell's views appear to square with Trump’s when it comes to EPA’s agenda. Trump has called global warming 'bullshit' and he has said he would 'cancel' the Paris global warming accord and roll back President Obama’s executive actions on climate change. ,1
"Believing that man-made climate change exists, as I do, does not necessarily mean that you think that it is rapid or a serious problem or that the policies to address it will actually do anything or that you are willing to pay the costs of those policies. ",1
"There has been a little bit of warming … but it’s been very modest and well within the range for natural variability, and whether it’s caused by human beings or not, it’s nothing to worry about. ",1
"So modest climatic improvement would be to have fewer and less severe big winter storms. Amazingly, that’s exactly what we should get if global warming theory turns out to be true. The models say that much of the warming will occur in the upper latitudes and in the winter. At the risk of further ridicule in kooky blogs in England, where global warming alarmism is now a religion, that sounds pretty good to me. Fewer people will die from the cold. ",1
"True, the climate is always changing. The fact is, however, that a very moderate amount of warming that we've seen in the last century is not a very sound basis to believe that we're going to have a new ice age. ",1
"I don’t think it’s the result of a strategy – I think it’s a result of bumbling around. There are a lot of people in the party, and in the administration, that aren’t as comfortable being climate skeptics as the president is, Ebell was quoted by McClatchy. ",1
President Obama’s action in joining the [Paris climate] treaty without ratification by the Senate is clearly an unconstitutional usurpation of the Senate's authority. ,1
"So what does the other side do? Ebell said. Well, the first thing they try to do is try to change reality. They try to change the facts.

By the time it ended, I believe somewhere between 18 million and 55 million died of starvation. ",1
"The other danger of the Green New Deal […] is the fact that by expanding the political spectrum of what’s in the debate, it’s moving the debate left, and it’s creating a very large space for a certain class of people, many of them in the Republican party, to start talking about how we need to have moderate solutions or reasonable solutions. ",1
Myron Ebell: The predictions made at the beginning of the era of global warming alarm have so far proven to be wildly inaccurate and they’ve all been much higher than predicted. And the impacts have been much milder than predicted. So I think we’ve seen a tiny bit of warming in the last 20 years but if you believe the alarmists we should have seen a lot. So I think there’s something basically wrong with the theory. ,1
"Professor Haigh: Well the climate process is carrying on and all the countries apart from the US have signed up to the Paris Agreement and the meeting this week is now thinking about how they’re going to implement and better the commitments made at that stage. Can I just correct one thing, at least one thing, that Mr Ebell said in terms of the predictions of global warming. If you look at the predictions that have been made by computer models they are bang on actually. There’s a spread of course. There’s a range of uncertainty but they are completely on the picture and they are predicting warming more and more. ",1
"He [Trump] made the decision. We helped create the circumstances, Ebell told The Washington Post. When you are persistent, good things can happen. ",1

"Let's see what happens if we get rid of the war on coal, and then let's see if the coal industry has a future, Ebell said. I don't know but it's really up to them. ",1
"I think that the impacts of warming have been either exaggerated or made up, Ebell said at the BNEF summit. I think most of the impacts are fairly mild and are likely to remain mild. ",1
"Remember, President Trump said during the campaign more than once that he hoped to abolish the agency, he'd like to abolish it. Well, 31% is a good start isn't it, first year […] it's going to be a huge fight in congress to get programs eliminated. We can debate the details, but I think what we shouldn't debate is we need a huge cut at the EPA. […] The reason the EPA is on a regulatory rampage is because they have a lot of regulators, let's reduce the number of regulators. ",1
"The think the rules that are being repealed show the dangers of building your policies on sand, which is what the Obama administration did, Ebell said. These are not laws that he's repealing, it's regulations that go far beyond the laws in most cases. ",1
"There are still some local problems, but the EPA's mission has been basically been accomplished. The fact is, you say that you say that oil, coal, and gas are polluting, but no. All of those pollutants have been cleaned up, Ebell added. ",1
"Well, look, we can have that debate but ever time we've had it the Congress has said no, we do not want to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. That's my position, and I'm glad that the Congress agrees with me, Ebell responded. And if people disagree with that, then let them fight the votes and change the Congress, and get a new Congress that believes in raising energy prices for absolutely no environmental result. ",1
"I think President Trump is absolutely right. We've got way too many regulations in this country. It's not only killing the economy, it's limiting human freedom in the country, and it's unaccountable. ",1
"In this case, the policies being advocated will destroy millions of jobs and cost trillions of dollars, but many of the professionals represented by these associations will probably do very well from more government funding, Ebell said. ",1
"As organizations that support free markets as a fundamental pathway to American prosperity, we oppose government policies – such as a carbon tax – that punish some and reward others in accordance with the government’s prevailing viewpoint on market ideals. Such marketplace manipulation represents a recipe for unintended consequences and self-inflicted economic damage. Too often, poor and middle class families bear the burden, the letter reads. ",1
"I don’t want to say it’s a disaster, but I think it is potentially a disaster for humankind and not necessarily any good for the planet, Ebell said. With regards to Obama and John Kerry's comments that Global Warming is our largest security threat, Ebell said  This is an attempt to change the subject. It’s to get off real dealing with problems that have very serious dangers and consequences and moving to this kind of feel-good issue of global warming. ",1
"Now, these tactics are not going to work because reality is intervening and thank God for the work that the Heartland Institute, CFACT, and some of the other groups represented in this room today, are bringing truth to power. ",1
"Global warming is a moral issue, but a proper moral evaluation must include comparing the impacts of global warming, which may be bad, with the impacts of global warming policies, which will almost certainly be catastrophic.  The Pope’s encyclical misses that significant matter, Ebell Writes. ",1

It’s a story of the aspiration to produce the best energy in the world—particularly the best portable energy to power the mobile machines that allow us to grow enough food to feed seven billion people, to whisk us away on amazing vacations, to have cars that allow us to work and play where we choose. Not to mention, the energy that improves our environment: by things like building water purification systems, sewer systems, and climate resistant buildings. Your story is a story of the challenge of figuring out how to produce this caliber of energy, which nature doesn’t automatically give us. ",1
"The most important thing to having a healthy environment to live in is development. Which, ironically, is considered bad for the environment. This is exactly why undeveloped countries have the worst environments. It’s not some coincidence; it’s exactly because they are undeveloped. They breathe smoky air from wood fires because they lack centralized power plants—built by oil. They drink naturally contaminated water because they lack irrigation and water purification plants. They live with filth because they lack industrial scale sanitation. They are vulnerable to climate because they lack sturdy climate controlled homes. And they don’t get to enjoy nature very much for that matter, which is supposedly what you get when you take away industry because they lack modern transportation—no one’s going to the Grand Canyon with a five mile travel radius. ",1
"The difference between a healthy environment and an unhealthy environment can be summed up in one word, and it's not 'CO2' or 'climate' or 'temperature.' It's 'development.' […] Whether you're drinking clean drinking water, listening to a thunderstorm with pleasure instead of fear, or going to the Grand Canyon, you should be thanking Big Coal, Big Oil, and Big Gas. ",1
"…so much of what has gone right in American industrial history is that this country used to have a philosophy that embraced the transformation of nature through energy and industry—that is, embraced industrial progress.

"This kind of anti-human Earth-centered thinking, where bias and sloppiness are OK as long as you’re ‘for the Earth,’ this thinking is not relegated to some dumb people or even a few smart people.

"There’s no justification for ignoring the benefits, and the unique benefits of fossil fuels, Epstein told the audience. ",1
"You know, in the history of the planet there’s been way more CO2 and way higher temperatures. That’s just another indicator that doesn’t seem like catastrophe is looming, Epstein said, later adding that The idea that it's becoming unbearably hot is not empirically true. — See SkepticalScience Myths #1.

"We can anticipate many of the threats they will pose going forward—and be prepared to meet them with the most effective messaging, the description notes.  ",1
"[W]e have to reject the false alternative of 'climate change believer' or 'climate change denier' and become 'climate thinkers' — people who think carefully about the magnitude of man-made warming and compare it with the unique benefits of fossil fuels, Epstein adds. Candidates who are climate thinkers will conclude that man-made warming is mild and manageable, not runaway and catastrophic. And thus they will conclude that fossil fuels should be liberated, not restricted. ",1
"This letter is not balanced, saying absolutely nothing about the unique ability of fossil fuels to provide affordable, reliable energy on a scale of billions, said Epstein. And it is not careful, failing to distinguish between the trivial fact that CO2 causes some warming with the unfounded speculation that CO2 causes catastrophic warming. ",1
"The president's anti-fossil-fuel policies would ruin billions of lives economically and environmentally, Epstein said, depriving people of energy and therefore making them more vulnerable to nature's ever-present climate danger. ",1
"Because while fossil fuel use has only a mild warming impact it has an enormous protecting impact. Nature doesn’t give us a stable, safe climate that we make dangerous. It gives us an ever-changing, dangerous climate that we need to make safe. And the driver behind sturdy buildings, affordable heating and air-conditioning, drought relief, and everything else that keeps us safe from climate is cheap, plentiful, reliable energy, overwhelmingly from fossil fuels. ",1
"And I wish Senator Whitehouse were here, Epstein added, because what he is doing to the free speech of those companies and anyone associated with them is unconstitutional, and I think he should apologize and resign. ",1
"If we reframe the debate, making our ideals explicit, we can both win supporters and champions of the right policies, and expose the evil and anti-humanism of the wrong policies, Epstein writes. ",1
"If Nye’s followers and their networks are made aware of a live event or recording in which Nye’s position is shown to be unscientific (and immoral) and are exposed to a pro-human, big picture way of thinking about fossil fuels, it could create a measurable shift in how the youth view fossil fuels, Epstein wrote in the email, shared by Robert Bradley Jr. at MasterResource. ",1
"Energy abundance is essential to climate livability—since the natural climate is inherently variable, volatile, and vicious. And oil and other fossil fuels do infinitely more to make it safer than make it more dangerous. This has been proven and documented—there has been a 98% decline in the rate of climate-related deaths since significant global CO2 emissions began. For 40 years doomsayers have hidden our ever-safer climate by conflating mild, manageable global warming, which is real, with catastrophic global warming, which is not, Epstein writes. ",1
"I don’t know the science behind climate change. I can’t say one way or another what is the direct impact, whether it’s man-made or not. I’ve heard arguments from both sides. I do believe in protecting our environment but without the job killing regulations that are coming out of the EPA. ",1

"On the issue of carbon dioxide and global warming, the question at issue really is, 'Does carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion cause global warming?' There does appear to be a common consensus view; but, the available data not only does not support this common consensus view, but supports the contrary position. That is that it is the naturally rising temperature that is driving up the carbon dioxide. This finding not only absolves man as the cause of global warming, but also raises major questions about the economic impact of attempting to control carbon dioxide emissions, particularly if this is a waste of time and resources.

And you, intelligent and learned all, are ignorant of those enormous holes. ",1
"If there’s any chance at a rational policy on climate, two things must happen. First, intelligent laymen must take back the debate, by pushing currently out-of-bounds science back onto center stage.

"Global temperatures will come off the current plateau into a sustained and significant cooling, beginning 2017 or maybe as late as 2021. The cooling will be about 0.3 °C in the 2020s, taking the planet back to the global temperature that prevailed in the 1980s. This was signaled (though not caused) by a fall in underlying solar radiation starting in 2004, one of the three largest falls since 1610 when records started. There is a delay of one sunspot cycle, currently 13 years (2004+13 = 2017). ",1
The model architecture was wrong. Carbon dioxide causes only minor warming. The climate is largely driven by factors outside our control. ,1
"I understand the evidence, I was once an alarmist, but now am a skeptic. […] The idea that carbon dioxide is the main cause of the recent global warming is based on a guess that was proved false by empirical evidence during the 1990s. […] Yes carbon dioxide is a cause of global warming, but it’s so minor it’s not worth doing much about. ",1
There is no empirical evidence that rising levels of carbon dioxide will raise the temperature of the Earth’s surface as fast as the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts. The predictions are entirely based on calculations with models. ,1
"The climate models all predict that as the planet warms, a hot spot of moist air will develop over the tropics about 10 kilometres up, as the layer of moist air expands upwards into the cool dry air above. During the warming of the late 1970s, ’80s and ’90s, the weather balloons found no hot spot. None at all. Not even a small one. This evidence proves that the climate models are fundamentally flawed, that they greatly overestimate the temperature increases due to carbon dioxide. ",1
"The theory that we caused the global warming with our emissions of carbon dioxide is based on two assumptions (guesses), made in the early 1980s when there was insufficient data. One assumption has since been disproved, and the second is looking dubious. ",1
If there is no hot spot then an increased greenhouse effect is not the cause of global warming. So we know for sure that carbon emissions are not a significant cause of the global warming. […] ,1

"If Dr Evans is correct, then he has proven the theory on carbon dioxide wrong and blown a hole in climate alarmism, she writes. He will have explained why the doomsday predictions of climate scientists aren’t reflected in the actual temperatures. ",1
David Evans has a superb track record of dodgy claims and bizarre climate change theories. He has zero credibility in the field and it’s staggering that any credible journalist could fall for this rubbish. ,1
"I’ve been working in climate science for 25 years now, and every few months someone (often they are engineers) comes up with a supposed bombshell refutation of human-caused global warming - none of this has ever stood up to scientific scrutiny. Dr Evans rolls out a number of well-worn false assertions often heard from those outside science who try to discredit climate science. Global warming is not pausing: it’s a measured fact that the globally hottest years on record are 2014, 2010 and 2005. 2015 is already so much warmer than 2014 that it is almost certain to be yet another record year. Models reproduce (and have in fact predicted) the warming of the past forty years well. I am surprised that some journalists are still gullible enough to present such a non-story, based merely on wild claims in a blog. ",1
"Like its predecessor reports, this volume provides the scientific balance that is missing from the overly alarmist reports of the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which are highly selective in their review of climate science and controversial with regard to their projections of future climate change. Although the IPCC claims to be unbiased and to have based its assessment on the best available science, we have found this to not be the case. In many instances conclusions have been seriously exaggerated, relevant facts have been distorted, and key scientific studies have been ignored. ",1
"The global warming scam has been, arguably, the most extraordinary example of scientific fraud in the post-War period. So many people, and institutions, have been caught up in the web of deceit, master-minded by environmental activists working through NGOs and their manipulation of the IPCC processes, that the integrity of Western science is seriously at risk.

"The facts are: Ever since the Little Ice Age, we have been warming up again. We don’t have global climate change; what we have are normal temperature fluctuations. We have had parallel cooling and warming episodes. No CO2 influence can be detected. Since 2000, we have been cooling off again. And, data have been manipulated in order to fake a warming trend: Climategate. The IPCC’s scenarios are failures. And in conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, this analysis can be verified—any one of you can do it! ",1
Contrary to computer based scenarios – and hence contrary to what is generally believed — anthropogenic CO2 is meaningless because its influence is not recognizable. Of course this result complies with the basic laws of physics and is not really surprising. ,1

"When it came to the subject of climate change, on which he had seldom remarked before TCS was launched, Glassman became equally prolific, attacking Kyoto or the science of climate change in 40 columns for the site, many of them syndicated elsewhere. Meanwhile, he also took to the op-ed pages of The Wall Street Journal, the St. Louis Dispatch, and The Washington Times to trash Kyoto; in none of them did he disclose TCS’s connection to ExxonMobil, Confessore wrote.

"The surface temperature of the globe has indeed been increasing – by about one degree over the past century. But no one yet knows whether the fault is human intervention or simply the natural cycle of warming and cooling that has affected the earth for millions of years, Glassman wrote in a Tech Central Station article criticizing the Kyoto Protocol. ",1
"While the surface temperature of the Earth has increased by one degree Fahrenheit over the past century, it remains unclear whether that rise will continue, whether it is caused by human intervention and whether humans can do anything to mitigate higher temperatures, Glassman declared in one of many articles at Tech Central Station where he criticized the Kyoto Protocol. Catastrophic global warming is implied by computer models of the climate, but those models are badly flawed, he added. ",1
"The fact about global climate change is that while there’s a consensus among scientists that the world has warmed in the last quarter century, there is tremendous scientific uncertainty about how much climate is likely to change in the future and what precisely humans role in that change is, Glassman wrote at Tech Central Station. ",1
"it is not clear, the President does not believe it is clear, that human intervention causes increased emissions which cause the climate to heat up, Glassman said on the program. We know the climate has heated up. It's gone up about one-degree Fahrenheit in the last one-hundred years. The question is, why is that? Is it because of humans, or is it because of simply a solar cycle. You know, the planet's been warmer than it has been today long before there was such a thing as an SUV or anything like that. ",1
"Because there is considerable uncertainty in current understanding of how the climate system varies naturally and reacts to emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols, current estimates of the magnitude of future warming should be regarded as tentative and subject to future adjustments (either upward or downward).

"The Arctic did not experience the meltdowns forecast by NSIDC and the Norwegian Polar Year Secretariat. It didn't even come close.

"When I was a kid, you know, growing up in school, we all leaned that carbon dioxide was a good thing, Heller said in the introduction. That it was essential for life. Photosynthesis required chlorophyl, carbon dioxide, water, and sunshine in order to create life. So it’s kind of odd to see this transition over the past few decades where carbon dioxide got demonized. It started out as a good thing, essential for life. […] Now we’re told that tiny amounts of carbon dioxide can destroy all life. ",1
"Right now, conservatives get blamed for every bad weather event and for climate change, right. It's our fault, Heller said. But hundreds of years ago, it was witches who were blamed for it. ",1
"I see that global warming has become a distraction which has derailed the environmental movement, Heller said during his presentation. ",1
"[…] Future generations should, moreover, have greater access to human capital and technology to address whatever problems they might face, including climate change. Hence the argument that we should shift resources from dealing with the real and urgent problems confronting present generations to solving potential problems of tomorrow's wealthier and better positioned generations is unpersuasive at best and verging on immoral at worst. ",1
"Considering that future generations will be far better off than current generations even after accounting for climate change, it would be more equitable for today’s industrialized world to help solve the real problems facing today’s poorer developing world than to mitigate climate change now to help reduce the burden on future populations that would not only be wealthier but also technologically superior.

"The 'globe' is simply not 'warming', for all of eight years. This year it will probably cool. Since all of the IPCC's models 'project' the 'likelihood' of a steady warming over this period, all of them must be wrong, and we can expect similar failures for all the other 'projections'. ",1

"I am very disappointed at the downward path the AMS has been following for the last 10-15 years in its advocacy of the Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) hypothesis. The society has officially taken a position many of us AMS members do not agree with. We believe that humans are having little or no significant influence on the global climate and that the many Global Circulation Climate Model (GCMs) results and the four IPCC reports do not realistically give accurate future projections. To take this position which so many of its members do not necessarily agree with shows that the AMS is following more of a political than a scientific agenda, Gray wrote. ",1
"I don't question that, Gray said. And humans might have caused a very slight amount of this warming. Very slight. But this warming trend is not going to keep on going.

No one, including the National Academy of Sciences, has been able to find the distinct human fingerprint except those who falsely claim such a warming is uniquely human-caused. ",1

We’re doing our best to try and counter this myth that CO2 is a dangerous pollutant. It’s not a pollutant at all. ,1
Burning all the economically available fossil fuel is unlikely to increase the current atmospheric CO2 levels by even a factor of 2. This is much less than the levels that the Earth has already tested. And a doubled level of CO2 would get us away from the near-famine levels for plants that have prevailed for the past tens of millions of years. ,1

Over the past ten years there has been no global warming, and in fact a slight cooling.  This is not at all what was predicted by the IPCC models. ",1
"I am not a climatologist, but I don’t think any of the other witnesses are either. I do work in the related field of atomic, molecular and optical physics.

There is no evidence that coral bleaching is intensifying now or will in the future. Coral reefs have bleached and usually recovered throughout their evolutionary history. ,1

"Happer argues that the current concern over human-caused greenhouse gases is overblown. Although he clearly understands basic climate science, his presentation includes claims that are exaggerated, misleading, or incorrect regarding human-caused climate change. His presentation is entertaining, but he argues in many places against claims that climate scientists do not make. He acknowledges that CO2 has an influence on climate, but emphasizes that the influence is small. Yet he gives no physical reason to conclude that the current scientific understanding on the response of climate system to CO2 (the climate sensitivity) is wrong, other than to say that he does not trust climate models. His claims that climate models do not work are exaggerated and misleading. He also claims that increased CO2 will be beneficial by increasing plant growth – it is true that plant growth will increase by the CO2 increase alone, but he does not show that it will be beneficial, especially when climate is changing at the same time as CO2. His presentation ignores the large number of studies available that show that through climate change, CO2 will be detrimental to agricultural productivity as well as to human well-being generally.

"It is undeniably true that global temperature increases have been far, far less than doomsday computer models predicted – about three times smaller, and there are good reasons to suspect the increases from further human CO2 emissions would be smaller still, without imposing draconian regulations. Not only has this warming been small, but there is no real reason to think it’s harmful, John Hayward writes at Breitbart. ",1
"CO2 will be beneficial and crop yields will increase, Happer said.  More CO2 will be a very significant benefit to agriculture.  ",1
"The risks of poverty and misguided energy policies that would prolong it far outweigh the risks of climate change. Adequate wealth enables human persons to thrive in a wide array of climates, hot or cold, wet or dry. Poverty undermines human thriving even in the very best of climates.

"[S]urface temperature, averaged over the land and ocean, increased only about 1.5 degrees between 1880 to 2012 despite a reputed 36 percent rise in atmospheric CO² content. And it is well known that the impact of CO² rise diminishes as the concentration increases.

"You know, it's interesting because I've had many of my articles opposed so strongly by environmentalists through phone calls and letters to the editor that they just simply dry up; they just won't publish us again. So this does have feedback, I mean, these are people that run these newspapers and they're scared, and impressed, and encouraged, depending on the feedback they get.We have to have grassroots organizations doing exactly that kind of thing – coordinated local activism. And finally, as I said, we need unbiased polling and good press coverage. ",1

"[S]urface temperature, averaged over the land and ocean, increased only about 1.5 degrees between 1880 to 2012 despite a reputed 36 percent rise in atmospheric CO² content. And it is well known that the impact of CO² rise diminishes as the concentration increases. Harris said.  Given also that there has been no general increase in extreme weather or the rate of sea level rise, the primary rationale for actions to restrict CO2 emissions boils down to the possibility of dangerous climate change in the future.

"Most adults consider security, potable water, education, etc., much more important than climate change, said Harris. And when you consider about 5 million Africans die every year because they do not have fresh, drinkable water, you realize the kids are being totally propagandized. ",1
"The number-one factor in the rising cost of electricity is the phasing out of coal, said Harris. People will have to pay more for electricity, and this will disproportionately harm the poor, who will have to pay a greater portion of their budgets for heat and to cool their homes. ",1

As a scientist, he's just appalled that better knowledge about the role of the Sun would not be a part of the science. ",1
"No matter how many times, [sic] the President, EPA, and press rant about ‘dirty carbon pollution,’ there is no pollution about carbon itself! As a dictionary will tell you, carbon is the chemical basis of all life. Our flesh, blood, and bones are built of carbon. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the gas of life on this planet, an essential nutrient for plant growth on which human life depends. How craftily our government has masked these fundamental realities and the environmental benefits of fossil fuels! White wrote. ",1

"At least Butch and Sundance had to put some effort into robbing banks and trains, Ken Cook, EWG's president, said in a press statement.

"I’m very hopeful because of organizations like the CO2 Coalition, Hartnett White said. The board composed of just the top of the heap of science on this issue. Brilliant. Not a B team at all, but an A-plus team. So, I think in a way, the long debate that we were told was settled — was unequivocally settled, incontrovertible settled […] Look, I think that debate, that crazy debate, deluded denial of that debate, I would say it’s over. But there’s a crack in the door.  ",1
"I like to say that CO2 or fossil fuels, they originated—certainly fossil fuels—originate in life, and they’re really the compressed and heated concentration of life, and they come back to amplify human life, she said.  ",1

"It’s hard to imagine how all this could shift, given the extent to which, not only in regulation, but just diffused throughout culture, assumptions that carbon dioxide is inherently harmful. Just hard to imagine how that can happen. I so hope—and this is the only opportunity I’ve seen in 20 years—a real redirection. […] There’s become this gap where the planet itself has some value higher than human life on this. And that means, really, some pretty simple things about policies at issue here and policies championed very consistently by President Trump and his campaign.

"According to Hartnett White, Germany is five to 10 years ahead of the United States (when it comes to renewables), Hartnett White said. It is the most aggressive country on renewables, and their energy bill is three times the rate in the U.S. – not 30 percent, three times. ",1
"An invisible, harmless trace gas in the Earth's atmosphere, CO2 is a plant food Hartnett White said. In the long geological/ climatological history of the Earth, there were long periods when atmospheric levels of CO2 were hundreds of times higher than the current level of around 400 parts per mission. For context, consider that man-made emissions of CO2 now account for 0.02 percent of all atmospheric gases. Slightly higher levels of human induced CO2 have increased plant productivity especially in arid regions as shown by satellite imagery. Greenhouses inject CO2 to reach levels over 1000 ppm to increase plant growth. ",1
"Even without an aggressive climate plan, the U.S. is reducing CO2 more than any other country. ",1
"A basic recommendation I would make to anyone running for president is we need to review this avalanche of rules that has been promulgated over the last eight years and possibly rescind […] and replace [them] with new rules.

No. Just to maintain the achievements reached…is a very important function for an administrative agency [like the EPA], she said. ",1
"Policies of that magnitude to me must be a decision of the U.S. Congress or we don't really function like a democracy anymore, if we have agencies that through very strained interpretation of existing law can impose such bold measures, she said. ",1
"The manner in which energy is developed and unitized, in just endless different ways in our economy, can provide an extraordinary stimulus to economic growth, said Hartnett White. The surest path to job creation in my judgment is through taking advantage of the energy. ",1
"The truth is that our bodies, blood and bones are built of carbon! Carbon dioxide is a necessary nutrient for plant life, acting as the catalyst for the most essential energy conversion process on planet earth: photosynthesis, she writes. […] How do our national leaders square their public vilification of carbon dioxide with fundamental scientific and economic realities? Such political propaganda has now educated at least two generations of Americans who think carbon is a killer instead of the stuff of life on the earth. ",1
"The core of the science of the IPCC is based on a set of assumptions about how the natural climate system responds to what is really, in terms of a percentage of atmospheric gas, tiny. […] There is a growing gap between observed (measured) temperature, and the predictions of the IPCC.  ",1
"A significant part of [Hillary's] party is at a predominately extreme position on energy, Hartnett White says.  ",1
"Fossil fuel energy is the lifeblood of the modern world. Before the Industrial Revolution, humanity depended on burning wood and candle wax. But with the ability to harness the energy in oil and other fossil fuels, quality of life and capacity for progress increased exponentially. Thanks to incredible innovations in the energy industry, fossil fuels are as promising, safe, and clean an energy resource as has ever existed in history. Yet, highly politicized climate policies are pushing a grand-scale shift to unreliable, impractical, incredibly expensive, and far less efficient energy sources. Today, 'fossil fuel' has become such a dirty word that even fossil fuel companies feel compelled to apologize for their products. In Fueling Freedom, energy experts Stephen Moore and Kathleen Hartnett White make an unapologetic case for fossil fuels, turning around progressives' protestations to prove that if fossil fuel energy is supplanted by  'green' alternatives for political reasons, humanity will take a giant step backwards and the planet will be less safe, less clean, and less free.

And extreme weather events have not been more frequent or more intense than in the 20th century. ",1
"The EPA's proposed Clean Power Plan regulations are the most expansive and economically disruptive rules in four decades from an agency that is notorious for its reckless disregard for the financial consequences of regulation under the Clean Air Act,  Moore and Hartnett White write. As an act of total desperation, the EPA is now playing the race card. The agency is adopting the theme that shutting down coal plants and other fossil fuel development is necessary to secure 'climate justice for communities of color.' Ms. McCarthy pitched this gibberish in August: 'Carbon pollution standards are an issue of justice. If we want to protect communities of color, we need to protect them from climate change.' This is just short of derangement. ",1
[…] the greatest beneficiaries of this energy revolution known as the Industrial Revolution were average workers and the most impoverished. Increasing emission of man-made CO2 is tightly correlated with this monumental achievement.  ,1

"She [Hartnett White] has been an apologist for polluters, consistently siding with business interests instead of protecting public health. Ms. White worked to set a low bar as she lobbied for lax ozone standards and pushed through an inadequate anti-pollution plan. She also voted to approve TXU's pollution-intensive Oak Grove coal units, ignoring evidence that emissions from the lignite plant could thwart North Texas' efforts to meet air quality standards, the editorial reads.

"The sun is now cooling and the past 60 years have shown the highest solar activity in the last 1400 years. So, yes the sun is now cooling, it has been warmer, and we can expect some cooling. But there's also some change in the ocean currents that's periodic so there is expected to be some cooling within the next decade or so. And temperature history also shows that since January, 2001, the temperature of the Earth has basically held almost flat. ",1
"While climate activists like [Tom] Steyer and [Bill' McKibben recite the (inaccurate) slogan about how '97 percent of scientists believe in climate change,'they shift the subject when it is pointed out that 100 percent of public and private long-term energy forecasts […] find that fossil fuels will be the dominant source of energy for the planet for decades to come, and no amount of solar and wind power worship is going to change that. Who are the real 'deniers,' then? With environmentalists becoming increasingly shrill and extreme, as do all coercive utopians detached from reality, Faison's approach—encouraging innovation around current energy sources like nuclear, coal, and hydropower while seeking new breakthrough energy technologies—may well turn out to be the most farsighted if serious climate disruption comes to pass.

"As with Three Mile Island, the hysteria of the media and the political class over the Deepwater spill is likely to lead to increased risk and adverse environmental tradeoffs. ",1
"Even if the costs of the spill exceed $15 billion (to be borne by BP) as now seems likely, the benefits of continued offshore oil production still exceed the costs by a wide margin. Economist Peter Passell estimates a net economic benefit of nearly a trillion dollars from continued offshore production. This will not be a popular position to hold so long as live streaming video of the oil spill continues and the media continue to cover the spill in a state of near hysteria. But it is at precisely such times that rational analysis needs to be heard. ",1

But the problem we have, and if you look at our energy costs, and all of the things that we’re doing to solve a problem that I don’t think in any major fashion exists. I mean, Obama thinks it’s the number one problem of the world today. And I think it’s very low on the list. So I am not a believer, and I will, unless somebody can prove something to me, I believe there’s weather. I believe there’s change, and I believe it goes up and it goes down, and it goes up again.

Moreover, Mr. Holmstead received other privileged information concerning the issues about which he now seeks to testify on behalf of Ameren, and participated in power-plants enforcement cases related to this one while at EPA. Before he left EPA, he even personally provided a declaration for EPA that is at issue in this and other related power-plants enforcement cases asserting privilege claims on behalf of EPA over documents that are relevant to the opinions he now seeks to offer. Yet he now seeks to change sides and testify against EPA. Moreover, he was assisted in the preparation of his report by another former EPA attorney who was involved in the early stages of the investigation that ultimately led to the filing of this case. For the reasons discussed in the accompanying Memorandum, Mr. Holmstead should not be allowed to testify in this matter due to his multiple conflicts of interest. ",1
(1) EPA’s proposal goes well beyond its legal authority under the Clean Air Act by trying to force states to regulate anything that produces or uses electricity; and (2) EPA has been so distracted by the notion that it can fundamentally change the electricity system in all 50 states that it has not done the technical work needed to develop legally sound regulations to reduce carbon emissions from existing fossil fuel power plants. ,1
"Holmstead: That's not true. We propose a lot of solutions, they're just solutions that you don't like. ",1
"With this rule, the Administration is trying to use the Clean Air Act to do something it was never intended to do. They're basically trying to pound a large square peg into a small round hole, and their efforts will have serious legal and economic consequences. The decision to require permits for greenhouse gases means that thousands of construction projects around the country will be blocked or delayed by several years. If the tailoring rule is upheld in court, then the Administration's temporary construction ban will only stop about 1,600 hundred of the largest projects planned for next year. But if the rule is overturned – and many lawyers believe it will be – then EPA itself estimates that the new rules will block or delay construction on more than 80,000 projects that would otherwise be creating jobs all over the country. ",1
"I was involved, he said, adding that Robert J. Martella also helped advise Murkowski's aides on the matter. The line out of the White House and the administration was that the amendment would block the car and truck rule setting the first-ever greenhouse gas limits on emissions from vehicles. ",1
"Now that a federal appeals court has upheld EPA's national clean air standards for smog and soot, it's time for EPA officials like Holmstead to enforce the law rather than spend their time trying to weaken or repeal it. ",1

"A very important component of our future energy development direction and production will come not necessarily from the truth but what is perceived to be the truth. Make no mistake, what today’s young people are being taught in school about energy and its relationship to global warming will determine what direction we go in developing the critical energy resources we need.

"He was not saying this as a politician says it.  (‘And if we use spoons not shovels we can create even more jobs…’ That sort of playground thinking is very common among politicians.) And whatever anybody thinks about Donald Trump you can be confident of this. At 21, at Le Cirque, somewhere at some point, somebody who is making a killing off the rents of the global warming industry laughed it up a little too loudly or once too many times around Donald Trump. Because what he said to the Washington Post was 'You’re robbing Peter to pay Paul. Goldmans is making a killing out of this.' That’s what I heard him say. Politicians normally fall for this. But not Donald. Instead – what I heard him say 'They’re making a lot of money out of this'  – he said: 'You’re propping up, sometimes even standing up industries, to transfer taxpayer money to them. And he didn’t go into Energy Poverty or the Economic Drag or the inefficiency or the opportunity cost or the 2.2 jobs. He just said: 'You’re robbing Peter to pay Paul. A lot of people are making a lot of money off this.' And to me he was saying 'This is something of a scam.' You can take his Chinese hoax comments, you can take hoax in any context but the fact is the way they’re playing out the global warming industry there are many scams involved and I think he was aware of this. I do think at one point somebody laughed a little too loudly… ",1
"State is largely populated by those whose worldview embraces such gestures advancing an agenda in the name of global salvationism, he said. President Trump should view State’s input here with great suspicion, taking note of its record on this matter. ",1
There are several problems with the theoretical underpinnings of the standard IPCC theory of global warming due to anthropogenic greenhouse gases (AGHG)… . the upper limit on warming due to a doubling of carbon dioxide is 0.7 C and it is probably much less. The high numbers used by the IPCC are not supported by measurements. ,1

"The war on fossil fuels is nearing an end. This is a wise, science-based decision by Administrator Scott Pruitt and President Donald Trump.

"We have no doubt that PEER, with the assistance of the judge, is trying to box you in and embarrass you, Huelskamp wrote. Fortunately, you do not have to look far to find 'documents that support the conclusion that human activity is not the largest factor driving global climate change.' ",1
"[…] American energy dominance ensures world energy freedom, and world energy freedom ensures peace and prosperity. This what the Trump administration is accomplishing. This is what energy freedom looks like. ",1
"In just a few short months, President Trump and his team have rolled back years — years — of Obama-era regulations attacking fossil fuels, Huelskamp, said.Trump and his team have pushed back on decades of anti-energy propaganda masquerading as sound science. ",1

"CO2 is an odorless, invisible, and non-flammable gas. It is also safe for humans in the maximum concentrations recommended for plant growth. The average level of CO2 in the atmosphere is about 390 PPM (parts per million). If the level decreases down below 200 PPM in an enclosed growing area, ps, plant growth rates and flowering will increase 20-100%. CO2 can be used from seedling right through harvest. It may take a hundred years for CO2 to get up to 1500 PPM. During that time, plant growth will flourish. ",1
"The reality is that any efforts to restrict CO2 emissions will not only raise food prices, but jeopardize the future food security of the planet. ",1
"Today’s action by Pruitt is a wake-up call for those who continue to falsely claim carbon dioxide is a pollutant. It isn’t, so get over it! Carbon dioxide is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas that is essential for life on Earth. It will never cause the dangerous global warming that climate alarmists and their failed models predict. Future legal challenges to reverse Pruitt’s action are welcomed, as they will only fail in the end. ",1
"For years, the U.S. government has held the position that atmospheric CO2 is a dangerous air pollutant that must be regulated to avoid the perils of global warming and climate change. I hope and trust that you also know that the scientific evidence supporting that position is tenuous at best and upheld primarily by inadequate and unvalidated computer model projections as opposed to real-world observations. This I know from having studied thousands of scientific papers on the topic. ",1
"Forecasts of future pH come from unproven, theoretical postulations by models based on absorption of CO2 by the oceans. Regardless, there really is no such thing as a representative pH for the whole ocean. It varies vastly near the coast and in upwelling regions, much more than the projected increase in acidity. ",1
"Despite a constant barrage of stories portraying rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) as a danger and threat to the planet, more and more scientific evidence is accruing showing that the opposite is true. ",1
"Carbon dioxide is a well-known aerial fertilizer, and many thousands of studies have proven the growth-enhancing, water-saving and stress-alleviating benefits it provides for plants. The reality is that rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations are providing a multitude of benefits to the biosphere. ",1
"Indeed, even now, we may already be unknowing participants in the great plan, as our burning of fossil fuels releases long-sequestered carbon to the atmosphere, awakening earth’s plant life from the lethargy of the low CO2 concentrations under which it has basically slumbered throughout the entire history of man. Let us deeply consider these matters—even prayerfully—before we put forth our arm to steady the ark of God. He is clearly capable of doing His own work. ",1
CO2 is not a pollutant. It is a benefit. It is the very elixer of life. ,1
"As just one example, and a damning one at that, all of the computer models upon which this vision is based failed to predict the current plateau in global temperature that has continued for nearly two decades now. That the Earth has not warmed significantly during this period, despite an 8 percent increase in atmospheric CO2, is a major indictment of the models’ credibility in predicting future climate, as well as the assertion that debate on this topic is 'settled.' ",1
"Despite thousands of scientific articles affirming numerous benefits of rising temperatures and atmospheric CO2, IPCC makes almost no mention of any positive externalities resulting from such…Climate Change Reconsidered II corrects this failure, presenting an analysis of thousands of neglected research studies IPCC has downplayed or ignored in its reports so that scientists, politicians, educators, and the general public can be better informed and make decisions about the potential impacts of CO2-induced climate change. ",1
"The Industrial Revolution has been a tremendous boon to humanity, as it has lifted large numbers of our kind from poverty to prosperity.  It has also helped the rest of the biosphere - and thereby us once again - via the powerful aerial fertilization effect of the carbon dioxide that has gone into the atmosphere as a consequence of the burning of fossil fuels.  Indeed, it's been win, win, win for all of life; and if there's ever been a recipe for success, this is it. ",1
"I can tell you with complete confidence that there is absolutely no observational evidence that provides any compelling support for the contention that there is something unusual, unnatural, or unprecedented about earth's current warmth. Neither are there any real world data that confirm that floods, droughts, wildfires, or hurricanes are becoming either more frequent or more severe as a result of global warming. Nor is there any indication that the total mass of earth's polar ice sheets is on the verge of declining any faster than the proverbial snail's pace at which it has done so in the recent past. Nor is there any reason to believe that sea levels are about to rise precipitously and inundate the world's coastal lowlands. ",1
"President Trump’s nomination of Kathleen Hartnett White as chair of the Council on Environmental Quality further demonstrates his innate ability to draw the most qualified and highly respected talent into his administration. The United States will benefit from the leadership of Hartnett White. She has a well-established track record of addressing challenging environmental issues, and she has the requisite knowledge, capabilities, and management skills to restore integrity to an office that requires policy decisions be based on sound science. Congratulations to Kathleen Hartnett White, and congratulations to America! Idso declared. ",1
"Talking about the IPCC, Idso said ,They have all these predictions of climate catastrophe, but what it really boils down to is this. When you look at the data, the observed data, you find there is nothing unusual, unnatural, or unprecedented about Earth’s current climate.  He added, There is no compelling evidence to conclude that rising CO2 concentrations are heaving a measurable influence on climate. ",1
"In my own studies, I have calculated that the benefits of CO2 on agriculture are so important that without them, world food supply will fall supply of world food demand by mid-century, Idso said. ",1
"For far too long now, the political climate has pursued policies at the federal, state, and local level that besmirched and defamed the many virtues of this important and essential trace gas. Atmospheric CO2 is not a pollutant; it is, in fact, the very elixir of life. ",1
"Projected future decline [in pH, a measure of a substance’s acidity] is based on a theoretical postulation by models based on absorption of CO2 by the oceans. Regardless, there really is no such thing as a representative pH for the whole ocean. It varies vastly near the coast and in upwelling regions, much more than the projected pH decline. ",1
"InsideClimate News reports Idso as saying that carbon-reduction policies are  are unnecessary, unwise, and unwarranted, during his time on stage at the ALEC conference.  Instead of being shunned like the plague, the ongoing rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide should be welcomed with opened arms, Idso also said. ",1
I find no compelling reason to believe that the earth will necessarily experience any global warming as a consequence of the ongoing rise in the atmosphere's carbon dioxide concentration. ,1
"Since something other than atmospheric CO2 variability was […] clearly responsible for bringing the planet into the Little Ice Age, something other than atmospheric CO2 variability may just as well have brought the planet out of it. ",1
"These proven positive consequences of elevated CO2 are infinitely more important than the unsubstantiated predictions of apocalypse that are hypothesized to result from global warming, which itself, may not be occurring from rising atmospheric CO2 levels. The aerial fertilization effect of atmospheric CO2 enrichment is the only aspect of global environmental change about which we can be certain; and to restrict CO2 emissions is to assuredly deny the biosphere the many benefits that accrue from this phenomenon. ",1
"With this information, in light of the increasing human demands on vegetation, it is my personal opinion that capping CO2 emissions or reducing them to some prior level would be akin to 'biting the hand that feeds us.' ",1

"The Kyoto Protocol has no environmental benefits; natural variability, not fossil fuel emissions, is the overwhelming factor influencing climate change; satellite data, confirmed by NOAA balloon measurements, confirms that no meaningful warming has occurred over the last century; and climate models predicting dramatic temperature increases over the next 100 years are flawed and highly imperfect.

You don’t hear that because the national media doesn’t like the idea, Inhofe said to the audience, pointing to changes in polls from 2002 when global warming was the number one issue in America, to now as number fifteen.  The people have caught on. They know that the science is not definite, hasn’t been decided yet. ",1
"We all know climate always changes. But it changes and is more severe in some areas. And all I can say is I don’t see that our effort right now is going to change from what we’re doing trying to provide the help that we can provide, Inhofe said. ",1

That is why calls to radically reduce carbon emissions are so irresponsible — and why dire warnings of what will happen if we don't are little better than reckless fearmongering, Jacoby wrote at The Boston Globe. ",1
"But while climate change brings negatives, it brings positives, too, Jacoby wrote at The Boston Globe. Shifts in climate are like shifts in the economy: They invariably spell good news for some and bad news for others. ",1
"Ours is a much safer, richer, cleaner, healthier planet than it would ever have been without fossil fuels. Break up with the industry that makes our energy so abundant? Sending a valentine would make more sense, Jacoby concluded. ",1
"In truth, global-warming alarmism is not science at all – not in the way that electromagnetic radiation or the laws of planetary motion or molecular biology is science. Catastrophic climate change is an interpretation of certain scientific data, an interpretation based on theories about the causes and effects of growing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, Jacoby wrote at The Boston Globe.

"Yet for all the hyperventilating, Pruitt's answer to the question he was asked — whether carbon dioxide is the climate's 'primary control knob' — was entirely sound, Jacoby wrote at The Boston Globe. ",1
"Apply that approach to climate change, and it becomes clear why the best response to the alarmists' frantic predictions is a healthy skepticism. ",1
"If Jacoby is going to keep at this topic, he needs to do so in a serious manner, not by citing the rare outlier. He needs to change course and stop citing evidence based on conflicting opinions. He needs to start presenting an argument for why we should listen to dissenters, rather than the overwhelming majority of people who have studied the issue. ",1
"The climatically inefficient and economically disastrous Kyoto Protocol, based on IPCC projections, was correctly defined by President George W. Bush as fatally flawed.

Remembering all this when the percentage of man-made carbon dioxide Australia produces is 1 per cent of .001 per cent of carbon dioxide in the air. Nature produces nearly all of the carbon dioxide in the air. Human beings produce 0.001 per cent of the carbon dioxide in the air and Australians produce 1 per cent of that.

"Newspapers should think about the damage they are doing to many persons, particularly young kids, by spreading the exaggerated views of a human impact on climate. As far as I can see the IPCC 'Global Temperature' is wrong. Temperature is fluctuating but it is still most places cooler than in the 1930s and 1940s. It will take about 800 years before the water level has increased by one meter. ",1
"'The [IPCC report] relies extensively on an attempt to reconstruct the global climate during the last 1000 years,' said Karlen.

"Alberta is a cold place blessed with huge coal, oil, and gas resources. Regarding 'global warming,' Albertans are inordinately skeptical. Despite this, the Government of Alberta is so concerned with 'global warming' it spends $500 million a year assailing this phantom menace. […] Environmentalists claim wilderness parks preserve Alberta’s 'natural heritage.' In reality, Alberta’s environment has undergone so many natural transformations that any talk of preservation betrays an ahistorical, unscientific mindset. ",1
"Environmentalists' irrational love of vacant ground, their religious zeal for the ecology integrity of wilderness, and their infatuation with petite heritage farms on cities’ outskirts play crucial roles in this crusade to suppress land development. ",1
"One: You hear a lot about the claim that 97% of all scientists agree we face a global warming threat. That figure is garbage. Those are not my words. They’re the words of one of the leading global warming alarmist scientists who heads one of Britain’s foremost climate research centers. […] The 97% figure is pure nonsense. Over the last three years, over seven hundred peer-reviewed articles have been published that dispute various aspects of the alleged global warming consensus. ",1
"To many of these people we have global blight and it consists of the fact that people are alive and living their lives and having kids and flourishing.

"The fossil fuel divestment movement encourages investors to 'take a stand' against climate change by selling the holdings of fossil fuel companies in their portfolios 'to stigmatize the fossil fuel industry' and deprive these firms of capital. A growing economic literature finds, by contrast, that fossil fuel divestment is little more than a political statement; it has little or no effect on the targeted companies while creating additional costs and lower risk adjusted returns for investors. ",1
"The fossil fuel divestment movement promises that the problem of climate change can be ameliorated if investors in certain companies refuse to hold the securities of those companies in their portfolios. […] [F]ossil fuel divestment has minimal or no environmental impact because it is highly unlikely to affect the production or distribution of fossil fuels on the part of targeted companies. Moreover, not only is fossil fuel divestment ineffective, it is also costly to investors, Kendall wrote in a  report commissioned and financed by the Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA).

"Divestment is a bad idea, and so there really is an opportunity to avoid these losses. Now, and not suffer them in the future, Kendall told Burnett. ",1
"You know I would send a message to the environmentalists, the people who feel very strongly about climate change, and want strong public policy responses to it. There's certainly lots of ways to go about advocating that through public policy through shareholder activism and engagement through conservation. All of those things may or may not save the earth but at least at least there's a chance of achieving your policy goals in that way. Divestment on the other hand, really has no shot. ",1
And that's great. But if the bumper sticker is gold-plated—it's a really expensive bumper sticker—and you don't personally have to pay the cost of that bumper sticker… that raises a lot of costs. And that's exactly what fossil fuel divestment is in the context of public pension funds. ,1

"Nevertheless, there is another threat on the horizon. I see this threat in environmentalism which is becoming a new dominant ideology, if not a religion.

It became politically correct to caricature us, who dare to speak about it, as those who are talking about things they do not understand and are not experts on. This criticism is inappropriate. People like me do not have ambitions to enter the field of climatology. They do not try to better measure global temperature or to present alternative scenarios of the future global climate fluctuations. ",1
"To reduce the interpretation of the causality of all kinds of climate changes and of global warming to one variable, CO2, or to a small proportion of one variable — human-induced CO2 — is impossible to accept. Elementary rationality and my decades-long experience with econometric modelling and statistical testing of scientific hypotheses tell me that it is impossible to make strong conclusions based on mere correlation of two (or more) time series.

"I'm convinced that after years of studying the phenomenon, global warming is not the real issue of temperature. That is the issue of a new ideology or a new religion. A religion of climate change or a religion of global warming. This is a religion which tells us that the people are responsible for the current, very small increase in temperatures.

"The reason that pipelines are an issue now is because they were made into an issue. They were made into an issue by a campaign and it has a name, it's called the tar sands campaign. And Tzeporah has been involved with it, uh, for my guess is about 10 years now. ",1
"Okay. I was just gonna say that and there's an oil boom in the United States, but here in Canada we can't get a pipeline built. And I think we need to look at the true environmental cost of this and seeing that there's zero environmental benefit to where we're at. We haven't kept a single barrel of oil in the ground. It's time to take stock of what's happening and rethink this campaign. ",1
"I agree with Vivian that the fact is we didn't see in the past, say a decade ago, a lot of pipeline campaigns. But what I disagree with is that Canada is just being targeted because I work with groups all over the world, and there is rising concern about oil and gas expansion all over the world. And in fact, there are pipeline campaigns all over the world. Many people have seen the news that Norway just announced that they're no longer going to drill off the Lofoten islands because of concerns about climate change. So we're in a situation now where some of the world's largest financial institutions in the world have said that they will no longer fund the expansion of oil and gas, where our oil from Alberta is high cost and it's high carbon, and it struggling to compete. ",1
"Add that onto the fact that our oil is highest cost. And that's why you see a flight from the oil sands, Total, Shell. Um, many other companies, Stat Oil have left the oil sands. So there's this idea that Vivian's promoting that somehow it's our fault environmental groups and indigenous nations who are campaigning against the expansion of oil and gas. We're doing that because of the rise in the fires and floods and because we think we need to prepare in Canada. So we talk about the money that is used for environmental campaigns and indigenous groups, trying to raise these risks and awareness and call for different policies in Canada. But let's talk about where the money comes from to fund oil and gas. The majority of the funders are not from Canada. These companies are making massive profits. They're producing more and more and they're automating at all levels. ",1
"And now I have a message to those foreign funded special interests who have been leading a campaign of economic sabotage against this great province, he said.

"The amount of money coming from foreign sources to Canadian environmental groups seems really small compared to foreign investment in and ownership of key Canadian industries, the impact of foreign demand for our exports on the ways we're developing our lands … and the kinds of environmental risks, so it's a very selective voicing of concerns about the impact of foreign funding on Canadian politics.

"But merely stating these opinions, even talking about these issues, was kind of dangerous during the Obama administration. Now, things have changed dramatically.

Basically, all the government grants go to one purpose. And that purpose is to identify and sound the alarm about human influences on the climate. ",1

"As Louisiana's chief legal officer, I have significant concerns that these junk suits could find a home here and have serious negative effects on our economy, wrote Landry, a Republican. While these types of public nuisance lawsuits have failed time and time again, it does not mean they cannot hurt Louisiana if they emerge. For the sake of our economy and the future of our workers and manufacturers, responsible elected officials must oppose these baseless lawsuits. He added: Any threat, including misguided lawsuits, that endangers a manufacturing industry employing one in seven Louisiana workers must be opposed. ",1
"I grew up just appreciating and loving the oil and gas industry, Landry said. There is no industry … the energy industry … there's no industry like the energy industry in this country. ",1
"To have the government inflict that type of pain unnecessarily was extremely disappointing, Landry said. And so, here we are trying to get the President to understand that you gotta start the Gulf of Mexico back.

Lawson agrees that there has been some global warming over the past hundred years and that increased man-made emissions of carbon dioxide are partly to blame. But he argues that natural causes are more important than commonly agreed and that the science of climate remains in its infancy. ,1
"But overall, it is far from clear that the inhabitants of the planet as a whole would suffer a significant net cost, or indeed any cost at all. ",1
"As well as taking account of the rights of marginal voices like Lord Lawson to be heard, the BBC should also take account of the harm that its audiences can experience from the broadcast of inaccurate information. ",1
"Lawson: Well, look, the point is not, just the costs – although we do have in this country, in England, one of the highest energy costs in the world, which is very hard on the poor and hard on business and industry, which is because of our absurd climate-driven energy policy. The energy in – renewable energy, so-called – is heavily subsidised, and, if they say it’s economic, well then, let’s get rid of the subsidies…[crosstalk] ",1
"Lawson: No, we don’t. That’s not true. We tax fossil fuel energy. Anyway, we subsidise renewable energy. But the main point is that the conventional energy is reliable and cheaper, and that is important. What is the reason for Al Gore, I listened to the interview you had with him, and he was talking complete nonsense. I’m not surprised that his new film bombed completely, it’s a complete fiasco… ",1
"Lawson: For example, he said that, er, there had been a growing increase, which had been continuing, in the extreme weather events. There hasn’t been. All the experts say there haven’t been. The IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which is sort of the voice of the consensus, concedes that there has been no increase in extreme weather events. Extreme weather events have always happened. They come and go. And some kinds of extreme weather events of a particular time increase, whereas others, like tropical storms, diminish… ",1
"Two aspects are particularly concerning, the letter to the editor reads. The first is that neither the quality bar that broadsheet newspapers regularly apply to scientific evidence, nor the simple concept of balance, appear to exist in all of your paper’s reporting on climate change (although we note, for example, that your coverage at the close of the Paris climate summit was both balanced and comprehensive). The second concern is that many of the sub-standard news stories and opinion pieces appear to concern, in some way, GWPF. Whether any newspaper should involve itself repeatedly with any pressure group is a matter for debate; it would be deeply perturbing to find that a paper as eminent as The Times could allow a small NGO, particularly one whose sources of financing are unknown, a high degree of influence.",1
"Vote Leave is competing with the rival group Leave.EU to be designated as the official Brexit campaign by the Electoral Commission, The Guardian reported.

"In his article, Lawson wrote: If there is to be a ban on non-scientists discussing climate change issues (which I do not, of course, support), this should in the best BBC tradition be an even-handed one. That is to say, they should also ban non-scientists such as energy secretary Ed Davey, Ed Miliband, Lord Deben (chairman of the government’s climate advisory committee), Lord Stern (former adviser to the government on the economics of climate change and development) and all the others who are regularly invited to appear.

"Overall, it appears that anthropogenic climate change estimates are still uncertain (given the discrepancies between most models) and scenarios derived from still incomplete GCMs should not be used to assess future climate change or make national assessments. ",1
"Models have too much sensitivity to climate change, particular with relation to the greenhouse effect, because there’s just too much water in the atmosphere. ",1
Students are increasingly being fed climate change advocacy as a surrogate for becoming climate science literate. This makes them easy targets for the climate alarmism that pervades America today. ,1
"Legates concluded at the Heartland Institute's Tenth International Conference on Climate Change (ICCC10) that it is difficult to continue to argue that the climate, of the US at least, is becoming more extreme. ",1
"Regarding the IPCC: I am not a reviewer, because reviewing the IPCC allows them to put your name on the list, and then you become one of the 'major scientists,' twenty-five hundred or so, that are supposedly 'all in agreement.' I do know that there was a lot of concern, but not much of that made it into the final document. ",1
"Carbon Dioxide is not the dangerous gas it’s made out to be. […] The most important greenhouse gas is not carbon dioxide, it is water vapor. ",1
"Is a warmer climate and more carbon dioxide a net benefit to life on the planet? You bet. The answer to the question is a resounding yes. More people die from exposure to cold than heat. A longer growing season is more beneficial to feeding a growing population as carbon dioxide is plant food, and under higher carbon dioxide concentrations virtually all plants grow faster and they’re more efficient at using water. ",1
"To summarize this overview, the historical and geological record suggests recent changes in the climate over the past century are within the bounds of natural variability. Human influences on the climate (largely the accumulation of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion) are a physically small (1%) effect on a complex, chaotic, multicomponent and multiscale system. Unfortunately, the data and our understanding are insufficient to usefully quantify the climate's response to human influences. However, even as human influences have quadrupled since 1950, severe weather phenomena and sea level rise show no significant trends attributable to them. Projections of future climate and weather events rely on models demonstrably unfit for the purpose. As a result, rising levels of CO2 do not obviously pose an immediate, let alone imminent, threat to the earth's climate. ",1
"There is no agreement among climatologists as to the relative contributions of Man and Nature to observed planetary warming, they claimed. As for the consensus view, it says nothing about whether anthropogenic global warming was, is or will be catastrophic. ",1
The media willfully ignores thousands of scientists who believe in global warming but do not believe its effects will be 'catastrophic.' The only global warming catastrophes are going to be bad public policies based on fear and panic rather than caution and science. ,1

So, it is a tragedy that America can no longer build modern coal-fired power stations to replace its aging fleet. Clearly, the rule limiting CO2 emissions from new coal-fired power stations must be cancelled as soon as possible, Harris wrote at Townhall. ",1

"Don’t use the guidelines either to shut down existing coal plants, or to enact a national clean energy standard through the regulatory back door, Lewis said in a summary of his comments.

"[D]o we have more to fear from Kyoto than from global warming itself? The purpose of the Precautionary Principle is to sweep such questions under the rug, he said.  ",1
"A variety of empirical evidence suggests we have little or nothing to fear, Lewis begins.  [M]uch of this century's modest warming may be due to natural causes such as changes in solar energy output. Second, since the models overestimate the warming of the past 100 years, they likely also overestimate the warming of the next hundred years. ",1
"From such facts, we may conclude that the climate system is probably less sensitive to ‘greenhouse forcing’ than the climate models assume. ",1
"What about extreme weather events, melting ice sheets, and the spread of tropical diseases? Here I would simply refer you to the work of hurricane scientists like Chris Landsea and William Gray, glaciologists like Howard Conway, and infectious disease experts like Paul Reiter.

"A crediting program would energize and expand the greenhouse lobby – the coalition of politicians, advocacy groups, and companies supporting the Kyoto Protocol and kindred energy rationing policies, Lewis said. ",1
"In candid moments, Administration spokespersons will admit that the theory of catastrophic warming has not been validated by experimental or empirical evidence, Lewis claimed. They’ll concede that scientists know too little about the underlying physics, that computer models are too slow, and that the evidence is too conflicted, to permit a genuine resolution of the global warming debate. In other words, they’ll admit, at least privately, that the science supporting the Kyoto Protocol isn’t really clear, compelling, or ‘settled.’ But they don’t see this as a great liability. Indeed, in their view, our very ignorance about the extent of human influence on the climate system is reason enough to justify an enterprise like the Kyoto Protocol. ",1
"The Chancellor believes that it will cost a trillion pounds, which could otherwise be spent on welfare programmes, health and education; the UN climate committee believes it will cost at least twice what the Treasury estimates; and the New Zealand Government have estimated that it will cost five times as much relative to their economy, as has been suggested. Given ​that, is it not irrational to enter this, as any, policy programme without first estimating the costs and calculating the benefits? Why are we doing it? ",1
"I hope that we will listen to those scientists, many of whom are in Government employ, who have warned against alarmist views, and that we will take a more consensual view of the basic minimum science that is agreed and open that up to debate and discussion, without trying to silence those who disagree by calling them deniers and equating them with holocaust deniers. As I said, I am not a denier-I am a lukewarmer-but even those who deny the existence of anthropological global warning deserve to be heard, just as the alarmists do, and it is sad that we have heard only one or two such views expressed in the House today, Lilley declared in a Commons debate.

"Eventually all these costs [for renewable energy] add up and in the end they get passed along to the consumer. Under the bottom line, consumers have to pay more and more, and for a lower and lower quality supply. ",1

"In this complex multifactor system, what is the likelihood of the climate (which, itself, consists in many variables and not just globally averaged temperature anomaly) is controlled by this 2% perturbation in a single variable? Believing this is pretty close to believing in magic. Instead, you are told that it is believing in ‘science’, Lindzen wrote. ",1
"The only meaningful question would be whether we are seeing anything sufficiently unusual to to warrant concern. And the answer to this is unambiguously 'no', Lindzen declared at the At the Crossroads III: Energy and Climate Policy Summit, organized by the Heritage Foundation and the Texas Public Policy Foundation (TPPF). ",1
"It is propaganda. So all scientists agree it’s probably warmer now than it was at the end of the Little Ice Age. Almost all Scientists agree that if you add CO2, you will have some warming. Maybe very little warming. But it is propaganda to translate that into it is dangerous and we must reduce CO2. ",1
"Lastly, there is a clear attempt to establish truth not by scientific methods but by perpetual repetition. An earlier attempt at this was accompanied by tragedy. Perhaps Marx was right. This time around we may have farce–if we're lucky, Lindzen wrote in an article at the Wall Street Journal.  ",1
"Warming of any significance ceased about 20 years ago, Lindzen claimed in a lecture at the Global Warming Policy Foundation. ",1
Both the evidence and the motivation have been clear early on. Energy is a multi-trillion dollar sector of the economy. Control over this sector is an obvious target for those who want increasing state control over society. ,1
"Demonization of CO2 is irrational at best and even modest warming is mostly beneficial. […] When someone says this is the warmest temperature on record. What are they talking about? It's just nonsense. This is a very tiny change period, Lindzen said in a panel at a climate summit arranged by the Texas Public Policy Foundation shortly before the UN climate summit in Paris. ",1
"Even the connection of fossil fuel emissions to atmospheric CO2 levels is open to question. In the ice core records of the ice ages, it appears that CO2 levels may follow temperature increases, rather than vice versa, Lindzen declared in June 2015 testimony.

"As with any cult, once the mythology of the cult begins falling apart, instead of saying, oh, we were wrong, they get more and more fanatical. ",1
"[…] [T]here is no substantive basis for predictions of sizeable global warming due to observed increases in minor greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and chlorofluorocarbons, Lindzen told a gathering at the Heartland Institute's International Conference on Climate Change. ",1
"To say that climate change will be catastrophic hides a cascade of value-laden assumptions that do not emerge from empirical science, Lindzen said in an interview with The San Diego Union-Tribune. ",1
"Future generations will wonder in bemused amazement that the early 21st century’s developed world went into hysterical panic over a globally averaged temperature increase of a few tenths of a degree, and, on the basis of gross exaggerations of highly uncertain computer projections combined into implausible chains of inference, proceeded to contemplate a roll-back of the industrial age, Lindzen was quoted, offering praise for Christopher C. Horner's Politically Incorrect Guide to Global Warming and Environmentalism.  ",1
I think it's mainly just like little kids locking themselves in dark closets to see how much they can scare each other and themselves. ,1
"Goebbels claimed that a big enough lie repeated often comes to be regarded as truth. Climate alarmism is a perfect example. We are actually taking things that, as has been pointed out, are beneficial and claiming that they are catastrophic. ",1
"While large increases in sea level would be dangerous, we’ve just seen there’s no evidence that the centuries long rate of fifteen centimeters a century is accelerating. And we have long demonstrated that accommodating this is readily achieved. The expenditure of trillions of dollars to avoid benefits is even more absurd than the implausible science. ",1
"Even the connection of fossil fuel emissions to atmospheric CO2 levels is open to question. In the ice core records of the ice ages, it appears that CO2 levels may follow temperature increases, rather than vice versa. ",1
"Demonization of CO2 is irrational at best and even modest warming is mostly beneficial, Lindzen said. The most important thing to keep in mind is – when you ask 'is it warming, is it cooling', etc.  — is that we are talking about something tiny (temperature changes) and that is the crucial point. ",1
"The conference discussion underscored two themes: (1) the need for stringent, open, external peer-review of the scientific basis of federal environmental actions, and (2) distortions in the teaching of environmental issues, i.e. 'Who peer-reviews what is being taught under the guise of environmental education?'

This industry is the largest single renewable fuels user because it uses wood waste to generate steam and power at paper mills. It is also the largest recycler (of paper), plants millions of trees every year, and manages millions of acres of forest land to ensure protection of wildlife. Only a fraction of my work concerns climate change. ",1

"This thought-provoking talk is based on Dr. Lomborg's bestselling book and film, Cool It. Here, Lomborg will demonstrate how we're often told very one-sided and exaggerated claims about the environment and climate change, leading to unwarranted panic, instead of rationally assessing where and how we can do the most good. He argues that to tackle global warming we need smarter solutions focused on getting long-term solutions like cost-competitive renewables and that many of the impacts of global warming would be better addressed through adaptation. ",1
"[J]ust like every other issue, there's both positives and negatives to global warming. Overall, and in the long run, the negatives will outweigh the positives, but there is a lot of positives to global warming right now. ",1
"Climate change is a genuine problem that will eventually be a net detriment to society. Gradually rising temperatures across decades will increase the number of hot days and heat waves. If humans make no attempts whatsoever to adapt—a curious assumption that the report inexplicably relies on almost throughout—the total number of heat-related deaths will rise. But correspondingly, climate change will also reduce the number of cold days and cold spells. That will cut the total number of cold-related deaths. ",1
"If we insist on 2C, we will pay an extra $60,000 billion, but only prevent a stream of $100 billion damages that begins in 70 to 80 years. Moreover, all of these estimates assume cost-effective climate policies, whereas in real life they have often become many times more expensive. ",1
"The Australian government recently released an issues paper for the review of the renewable energy target. What everyone engaged in this debate should recognise is that policies such as the carbon tax and the RET have contributed to household electricity costs rising 110 per cent in the past five years, hitting the poor the hardest. ",1
"In 1971, 40 per cent of China’s energy came from renewables. Since then it has lifted 680 million people out of poverty using coal. Today, China gets a trifling 0.23 per cent of its energy from wind and solar. Africa gets 50 per cent of its energy today from ­renewables — and remains poor. New analysis from the Centre for Global Development shows that, investing in renewables, we can pull one person out of poverty for about $US500. But, using gas electrification, we could quadruple that. By ­focusing on our climate concerns, we deliberately choose to leave more than three out of four people in darkness and poverty. Addressing global warming requires long-term innovation that makes green energy affordable. Until then, wasting enormous sums of money at the expense of the world’s poor is no solution at all. ",1
"A new paper by Todd Moss and Ben Leo from the nonprofit think tank, Center for Global Development, puts it very clearly. If Obama spends the next $10 billion on gas electrification, he can help lift 90 million people out of poverty. If he only uses renewables, the same $10 billion can help just 20 million-27 million people. Using renewables, we will deliberately choose to leave more than 60 million people in darkness and poverty…Our development aid should be used to help 60 million more people out of poverty, not as a tool to make us feel virtuous about facile, green choices. ",1
"There’s no question that burning fossil fuels is leading to a warmer climate and that addressing this problem is important. But doing so is a question of timing and priority. For many parts of the world, fossil fuels are still vital and will be for the next few decades, because they are the only means to lift people out of the smoke and darkness of energy poverty. ",1
"9:30-10:20 If you look at the time period from 1900 to 2050, surprisingly, for a lot of people, the net impact of most global warming was actually positive. That's because CO2 is actually fertilizer, that means it increases our agricultural production. Of course, in the long run increasing temperatures is also going to reduce agricultural production. We will also see more people die from heat, but many more people will avoid to die from cold, again with moderate global warming. We are also seeing the lower costs of heating outweigh the extra costs of cooling. So, actually, if you look at what the cost is [of global warming] it turns out to be a slight negative around 1900 at about 0.5% and across the most of the century, mostly a negative. ",1
"We have to ask ourselves: what do we want to do first? Do we want to focus on cutting CO2, at fairly high costs and doing fairly little good a hundred years from now? Or would we rather want to fix some of the many obvious problems in the world, where we could do a lot more good and do it now? ",1
"Mr Hammond is right to highlight the cost - and in fact, he is likely to be underestimating the real price tag. ",1
"It is true more people die when it is unusually hot, but lives are not shorter in hotter places. (Otherwise, everyone would move from Texas to Alaska). Studies of migrants show people adapt quickly, within weeks. They also take actions like getting an air conditioner or adapting their houses that reduce their risk of overheating. ",1
"Global annual carbon emission reduction targets for example, 2°C reduction below preindustrial level are extremely costly compared to benefits due to a lack of low-carbon energy sources. Returns less than one dollar for every dollar spent. ",1
[H]alf the world's area has greened because of global warming. So we're basically seeing a gigantic greening […] Lomborg says. ,1
"Another issue: most people die from cold deaths, not heat deaths. And so when temperatures increase, we're going to see about 400,000 more heat deaths because of global warming by mid-century, you hear a lot about those, but you're probably going to see 1.8 million fewer cold deaths. ",1
"While the US GCRP report is based on thousands of scientific publications, Lomborg cherry-picked only a few to support his case that 1) 'cold kills many more people than heat' and 2) 'climate change will reduce the number of cold days' and 'that will cut the total number of cold-related deaths.' the open letter reads.

"I do still think there's plenty of disagreement on how much warming is man-made, how quickly the planet is warming, what a doubling of CO2 emissions will mean for global temperatures, he said.

"Distinguishing what climatologists know, what they do not know, and what they might know is necessary so that objective, transparent science can guide public policy. […] Science should be a guiding principle for Congress; however, the politicization of science jeopardizes sound policymaking, Loris claimed in his testimony. ",1
"No matter where one stands on the urgency to combat climate change, proposed federal policies like cap and trade, a carbon tax, or regulations on power plants would be ineffective in combatting climate change. In fact, the U.S. could cut its carbon-dioxide emissions 100 percent and it would not make a difference abating much warming. ",1
"Whether a challenge occurs slowly over time like sea-level rise or occurs without much warning like a hurricane, adaptation to extreme weather is critical to increasing resilience of America’s infrastructure. Learning lessons from previous storms and using the best scientific and technical information available will improve the ability to reduce dangers from future climate-related challenges. ",1
"Rather than extend the tax credit for electric vehicles, Congress should eliminate preferential treatment for all energy sources and technologies. That way, innovative companies will be chasing after the preferences of consumers rather than the next handout from Washington. ",1

It's ambiguous. It's not clear that climate change is being driven by carbon dioxide levels. But let's move beyond that argument and let's start talking about how we can adapt to what will be a different climate in the future. ,1
"Global warming is actually not a hard issue to dissect, because fundamentally it relies on evidence of there being a general trend of temperature increase - and measuring temperatures is not rocket science. Of course, there is nowhere on Earth where the mean global temperature anomaly can be measured. So, steer-clear when this statistic is mentioned by an expert - you can probably dismiss it as something entirely contrived, like say the Virgin birth. ",1

"I actually think that it's good if we can get beyond this debate of whether increase in carbon dioxide levels are driving more extreme climate events. I think that we need to move beyond that and accept and recognize that whether or not we can reduce carbon dioxide levels, there will be climate change. ",1
"I think what we see as an inability by so many in Australia to actually work from the basis of the evidence, work from the basis of the facts, is actually a global issue and I think that Lomborg will hopefully, by putting some of these issues in a global context, make us aware of what is happening globally and where we sit in that. Bjorn Lomborg has a lot of opinions with respect to greenhouse and the signing of the Kyoto Protocol and they’re very relevant in the context of current deliberations in Australia. ",1

"Consequently, there is a serious risk that climate related socio-economic or geopolitical decisions made by political decision-makers are based on unsubstantiated scientific evidence. The development of a low carbon economy, the promotion of, and subsidies for  alternative energies, electrical vehicles, underwater or underground carbon trapping, cap and trade mechanisms, etc. could be part of such unsubstantiated decisions with huge global consequences for the competitiveness of industries, and of nations in attracting these industries.

For power companies that produce during peak periods, this lapse in production on the part of renewable generators represents a profit opportunity. Indeed, despite a rapid growth in renewable generation in Texas, electricity prices have fallen further than those in any other state and reliability remains high. ",1

"Let me be very clear. First, I believe that the climate is changing. I am not in denial. Second, CO2 is a contributor or 'forcing function' for climate change – certainly not the exclusive forcing function, but a major contributor – and it does require an energy strategy in this country and globally to address the long term implications. These two facts, I believe, are scientifically and technically documented and we have an obligation to address them as a society. With that said - what is also clear both scientifically and technically is that the EPA’s CPP is not a plan that will significantly impact global CO2 emissions. It’s not an environmental regulation, it is energy regulation. If the definition of 'clean' were the reduction of atmospheric CO2 levels – and that is a naively narrow, incorrect perspective, but if it were – then this CPP is not really clean, because it is neither relevant nor impactful to the environment.

"The conference also has a moral duty to examine the corruption of science that can be caused by massive amounts of money. The United States has disbursed tens of billions of dollars to climate scientists who would not have received those funds had their research shown climate change to be beneficial or even modest in its effects. Are these scientists being tempted by money? And are the very, very few climate scientists whose research is supported by industry somehow less virtuous? ",1
"The Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) own computer model easily shows that President Obama’s proposed regulations would reduce global warming by around 0.02 of a degree Celsius by the year 2100.

"Reports of rapid disintegration of Greenland’s ice ignore the fact that the region was warmer than it is now for several decades in the early 20th century, before humans could have had much influence on climate. Similar stories concerning Antarctica neglect the fact that the net temperature trend in recent decades is negative, or that warming the surrounding ocean can serve only to enhance snowfall, resulting in a gain in ice. Global warming affects hurricanes in both positive and negative fashions, and there is no relationship between the severity of storms and ocean-surface temperature, once a commonly exceeded threshold temperature is reached. Reports of massive species extinction also turn out to be impressively flawed. ",1

"Public disclosure of a company's funding of New Hope and its employees has already caused considerable financial loss to New Hope. For example, in 2006 Tri-State Generation & Transmission Association, Inc., an electric utility, had requested that its support of $50,000 to New Hope be held confidential. After this support was inadvertently made public by another New Hope client, Tri-State informed me that it would no longer support New Hope because of adverse publicity. Also, in 2006, when a $100,000 contract between New Hope and electric utility Intermountain Rural Electric Association to synthesize and research new findings on global warming became public knowledge, a public campaign was initiated to change the composition of the board of directors so that there would be no additional funding. That campaign was successful, as Intermountain has not provided further funding. ",1

"Coal is ground-zero in the environmental wars, and it is the most important battle that we’re fighting today. The overarching eco-myth that I will debunk is the one about coal being a dirty form of energy that our country can do without. First, I am going to talk about the need for coal and then discuss the wanton and reckless smearing and elimination of it. The coal industry helps generate about 40% of the U.S.’ electricity. Coal makes the lowest cost and most reliable electricity. The coal industry, directly or indirectly, employs about 800,000 people, generates 50 billion dollars in labor income, and contributes about 100 billion dollars to GDP. Yet, these impressive statistics don’t somehow come close to doing justice to the benefits America, and the world, derive from the tremendous natural resource that is coal, of which we are blessed to have a several hundred-year supply. ",1
"Of the many guises of the War on Coal, global warming is perhaps the most used excuse… Simple math shows that the Obama war on coal, for purposes of climate control, is futile. Even if U.S.’ CO2 emissions stopped today and were to be zero for the remainder of this century, atmospheric CO2 levels would only decrease by about 3%. There would be no measurable impact on global climate, at a cost of 25% of global GDP. We can debate the science of global warming to our heart’s content, and we should, but the reality is worldwide hydrocarbon use is increasing. By itself, China is adding the equivalent of the entire U.S. coal fleet between now and 2020, India is adding 71 gigawatts of coal power between now and 2018—almost as much as the Obama EPA has already shuttered. Obama’s unilateral actions are all based on junk science that will accomplish nothing except hurt our standard of living, devastate coal communities, raise electricity prices for all, and cause power outages.

"Many Greens think that they have a good grip on the likely trajectory of the planet’s climate over the next 100 years. If we keep burning fossil fuels at current rates, their climate models tell them, we’ll face a meltdown on a much larger scale than Chernobyl’s, beginning with the polar ice caps. Saving an extra 400 million tons of coal here and there—roughly the amount of carbon that the United States would have to stop burning to comply with the Kyoto Protocol today—would make quite a difference, we’re told. But serious Greens must face reality. Short of some convulsion that drastically shrinks the economy, demand for electricity will go on rising. ",1

"As I have stated publicly on many occasions, there is no definitive scientific proof, through real-world observation, that carbon dioxide is responsible for any of the slight warming of the global climate that has occurred during the past 300 years, since the peak of the Little Ice Age, Moore said at the 2015 annual lecture for the Global Warming Policy Foundation.",1
"There is no scientific proof that human emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) are the dominant cause of the minor warming of the Earth’s atmosphere over the past 100 years, Moore declared in testimony before the U.S. Senate Environment & Public Works Committee. ",1
"We do not know if we are a small or large part of the present global warming. It is not possible through science to determine an exact answer to this question. Certainly the natural factors, and there are many, that have acted to change the climate many times through the history of the Earth, are still operating today. They have not gone away. But human emissions of CO2 is a new (natural) factor. So it is very unlikely that we are the only factor causing the present global warming but we may be one of the factors, Moore said in an interview with EUWatch.  ",1
"According to an article in the Honolulu Advertiser, Moore contended that global warming and the melting of glaciers is positive because it creates more arable land and the use of forest products drives up demand for wood and spurs the planting of more trees. He added that any realistic plan to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and the emission of so-called greenhouse gases should include increased use of nuclear energy. ",1
So I say celebrate CO2. It is the most life-giving substance along with water on this planet and it's doing the world a lot of good. ,1

",1
"If there were no CO2 in the atmosphere there would be no life on this planet. Surely that should be enough to permit questioning the certainty of those who demonize this key molecule, Moore wrote in the opinion section of The Province.  We should celebrate CO2 as the giver of life it is. ",1
"Why did I leave Greenpeace after 15 years? When I began with Greenpeace, they had a strong humanitarian orientation to stop all-out nuclear war, to save civilization from destruction. By the time I left 15 years later—that's the 'peace' in Greenpeace of course—by the time I left 15 years later, Greenpeace had drifted into a position along with the rest of the movement as characterizing humans as the enemies of the Earth, Moore said in his presentation, later highlighted by the Heartland Institute in 2018.

"I support sustainable forestry, which is sometimes best done by making clearings where new trees can grow in the sun. I have given my reasons for supporting nuclear power, vinyl and genetic engineering in my books, all of which stem from a concern for the environment and human welfare.

Yes, the Arctic ice was lowest in 2007 in any summer since we started measuring it, only in 1979, so we don’t really have a very long dataset here, but for the last two years it has been rebuilding. Antarctica never did get warm, it has remained cold and the sea ice around Antarctica has not shrunk in the slightest, and you can find this easily on the Internet. ",1

[H]uman emissions are restoring a balance to the global carbon cycle by returning some of the CO2 back to the atmosphere that was drawn down by photosynthesis and CaCO3 production and subsequently lost to deep sediments.

"Global climate change is another area where extreme statements are made, in this case on both sides of the debate, when there is little in science to defend them. Some things are quite certain. Carbon dioxide levels are rising and our consumption of fossil fuels and deforestation in the tropics are probably the main causes. There is a lot of evidence that the earth’s climate is warming: the glaciers in Alaska are retreating and great egrets are visiting northern Lake Huron. But here the consensus ends. ",1
"I am a skeptic on climate change. I know the climate is changing, and it always has been. I've studied this intensively over many years. I started what I call the Carbon Project here in British Columbia back in 1989 in order to bring everybody together to discuss this subject and figure out the facts behind it. Since then, I have watched as hysteria has grown, as if the whole world is going to come to an end and civilization is going to die because of humans causing this climate change. I don't buy that, and I certainly know we don't have any proof of it. I'm not denying that we might be playing some role, but the natural factors that have always caused climate change have not suddenly disappeared. I'm very skeptical of the alarmist nature of climate campaigning. ",1

We’ve talked about global warming as climate improvement. […] The good news is that the bad news is wrong. ,1
"Carbon pricing harkens back to the idea, you know, that Massachusetts had to deal with, is the witchcraft trials. The idea that witches change the weather. Now they're claiming SUVs and our coal plants are changing the weather, Morano said. ",1
"The bottom line is, not only do we not face a climate crisis, but if we face a climate crisis what Congress is proposing, what the United Nations is proposing, is scientifically meaningless. It would have no detectable impact. So we'd all be doomed if we had to rely on them for a solution. ",1
If people want to waste money and do symbolic gestures and start ratcheting down their cities' energy use and emissions and start putting in mandates for energy that doesn't produce the same for fossil fuels – more power to them. But the big news here is the United States as a country is saying 'no' to the United Nations. ,1
"And then you add in the media, with people like Leonardo DiCaprio and Laurie David telling kids if you’re a global warming skeptic, you are not cool. I guess they’re afraid the kids will instantly become skeptics if they hear any opposing ideas. ",1
"Morano on Pope Francis and climate change: The Pope has picked a contentious scientific issue which – now going on almost two decades of no global warming, sea ice recovering, sea level rise actually decelerating, On every metric from polar bears on down, the global warming narrative has weakened.

"I don't know what [Ben Santer's] complaint is. But I'll give you the philosophy behind it […] I think people should be thanking me. I was doing a service. And people go like 'oh, they're death threats.' Well, I get death threats. I enjoy them. I usually email back. So I think it was one of the healthiest things that could have happened in the climate debate. I make no apologies for it. I still do it and I enjoy doing it. ",1
I am jealous of the leadership of Canada & Australia. It is so sad being in America – The rest of the world is abandoning carbon pricing as the U.S. is jumping right in. ,1
"Coal is the moral choice, particularly for the developing world… The model for the world right now should be Australia. Australia gets it. Scientifically they get it, politically they get it and particularly when it comes to the United Nations, they get it.

"The goal [of Climate Depot] is to expand on key elements from the award-winning Senate EPW website and quite simply revolutionize climate and environmental news dissemination. Unlike much of the establishment media, CFACT's news outlet will provide the public with links to all sides of the climate and environmental debate, with links to Gore's blog, environmental groups, the United Nations, as well as skeptical voices. It is very hard to get accurate information on global warming and environmental issues. Much of what the media reports is simply a regurgitation of the rhetoric from partisan and ideologically driven environmental groups, foundations, and the United Nations, which are spinning data to promote a cause.

"Even in the Senate, I’d put up any of the stories we did against any pablum Time or Newsweek has put out on global warming. We’d link to the other side; we’d present their arguments. They do one-sided screeds. ",1

"This is politics, not science, Morano said. The U.N. is trying to expand its base to include climate and species. They are looking for more treaties, more regulation. They have identified a problem, they've juiced it up, and put themselves in charge of solving the problem. That is called a self-interested lobbying organization. ",1

"Levant: That's a good point. And, as you they say, personnel is policy as well. […] ",1
" Whilst there are certainly other potential drivers of changes in the climate we know that over the last century we have greatly increased the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere and, through detection and attribution analyses, we know that the rising levels of atmospheric CO2 and other greenhouse gases have driven the rise in global temperature, King said. Changes in other potential drivers, like solar activity, simply can't explain the 1C rise in global temperature we have observed. ",1

"Climate is becoming increasingly warmer we hear almost every day. This is what has become known as Global Warming. The driving idea is that there is a linear relationship between CO2 increase in the atmosphere and global temperature. The fact, however, is that temperature has constantly gone up and down. From 1850 to 1970, we see an almost linear relationship with Solar variability; not CO2. For the last 30 years, our data sets are so contaminated by personal interpretations and personal choices that it is almost impossible to sort up the mess in reliable and unreliable data, Morner said in written evidence he presented to the UK Parliament Select Committee on Economic Affairs.  ",1
"If you have a temperature rise, if it’s a problem in one area, it’s beneficial in another area. But sea level is the real 'bad guy,' and therefore they [The IPCC] have talked very much about it.

"[U]niversal adoption of the institutions of the free society would better enable adaptation to climate both now and in the future.

"Under the veneer of promoting environmental stewardship, 'green' pressure groups have dominated the European public policy debate on climate change, agriculture and forestry.

He said he was looking forward to reading The Shadows of Power, a 1988 book by James Perloff with the subtitle The Council on Foreign Relations and the American Decline. The book advances conspiracy theories about the New York-based think tank, alleging that it advocates the creation of a world government.

"There are many feasible scenarios for how climate change may effect economic interests […] climate change may not be detrimental (a little warming will probably be good for the world as a whole), Murray wrote, claiming that the Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies (CERES) was ignoring such possibilities.

"For instance, data from satellite and weather balloons indicate that certain areas of the atmosphere are not warming as the models suggest they should. Some suggest that this means that the data, not the models, are inadequate. As there exist many questions as to the fit between the models and the data it cannot truly be said that a scientific consensus has emerged that they are accurate. All we have is a theoretical consensus that may or may not stand up to the tests the theories need to be subjected to. ",1
"Reducing artificially high energy costs is the first step in tackling fuel poverty. In America, the market is alleviating the burden of energy costs on poor households, even as the government goes the wrong way. That shows us the way forward for tackling the much greater problem in the developing world. ",1
"That is an important consideration in deciding whether the current warming endangers human health and welfare. EPA's decision to simply ignore it and press forward with its endangerment finding represents a premature rush to judgment. Thus, the finding is a purely political move. ",1

"To the extent that the UNEP researchers have toned down the claims of Myers, Wilson and Ehrlich, they are to be congratulated. What they have done instead, however, is to play up the threats to the 'cuddly' animals – mammals and birds – and thereby maximize media attention, Murray wrote at Tech Central Station in an article suggesting that mass extinction predictions were exaggerated.

"One rule Westminster should do its utmost to repeal is the directive on Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), the most wide-ranging and restrictive in the world on chemical innovation and use.

"So, what would I suggest as a conservative approach to the global warming issue? I would suggest one based on three ideas. One is improved technology to mitigate the greenhouse gas emissions. Second is an adaptation strategy. And third is a resiliency strategy. ",1
"		But the price of this understanding is that we now know that we do not know why the Earth is warming. We do not know if humans have anything to do with it, and they may well not. The scientific assumption behind the Kyoto protocol, namely that humans are known to be significantly interfering with an otherwise unchanging climate, is simply false. A new era of climate science lies before us. ",1

"Spokane can join the club of cities that chose trendy environmentalism over environmental results, or it can do the hard work of finding real ways to do more with less; that is at the heart of true environmentalism, Myers writes. ",1
"Many advocates who promote LEED or similar rating systems point to the supposed carbon dioxide emission reductions achieved by green schools. The failure to save energy, or even slow the increase in energy use, wastes resources on efforts that do nothing for climate change or the environment. Instead misguided green  building rules divert scarce funding from efforts that could have a positive environmental impact, or which could be used to fulfill other public needs, Myers claims. ",1
"A regulator is supposed to be clear and objective. In this case, the regulation is far from clear and far from being an objective standard and has become an arbitrary tool, Todd Myers said. Ecology’s suggestions are probably the most expensive things that you can do and do almost nothing for the environment, Myers said. ",1
"Despite Western Washington’s status as one of the worst places in the United States for solar energy production, legislators continue to subsidize a technology that costs more and delivers less environmental benefit than virtually all other strategies, Myers writes. Shifting to solar energy only reduces CO2 emissions by a very small amount. ",1
"Cap-and-trade continues to be the preferred climate policy of the environmental left. The arguments they make to support it, however, are often incorrect or contradicted by experience. A serious approach to environmental policy and funding education should be built on more than the hope that it will work out better this time. ",1
"According to the WPC's description, Eco-Fads exposes the pressures that cause politicians, businesses, the media and even scientists to fall for trendy environmental fads. It examines why we fall for such fads, even when we should know better.

"The documents show the extent to which the E.P.A., which is the main federal agency charged with protecting human health and the environment, worked with groups like the Heartland Institute, which holds positions on climate change that are far outside the mainstream of scientific opinion, as opposed to the agency’s own chief scientists, The New York Times reported.",1

"Fear of Global warming - aka climate change - led to the adoption of numerous taxes, regulations, and subsidies aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Real-world observations and improved scientific methods, however, reveal the threat of global warming was exaggerated. Laws discouraging or restricting carbon dioxide emissions have almost zero impact on climate and temperature. ",1
"The selection of Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt is an obvious commitment to a pro-environment, pro-energy, pro-jobs agenda. Pruitt has been a vocal critic of federal overreach and understands that state agencies are well-positioned to take on a larger role in protecting the environment while also allowing for responsible and necessary commerce and energy production. This pick will go a long way towards correcting the Obama administration’s regulatory overreach, which has cost us jobs, hurt farmers, and has had an insignificant effect on the environment. ",1

"Global warming started 200 years ago, but human emissions of CO2 were bugger-all-of-nothing until after World War II. Humans have put out nearly 90% of all our CO2 molecules ever since the War started. We’ve put out 30% of all our emissions ever since the year 2000. The message hammered home over and over, is that temperatures don’t correlate at all well with our CO2 emissions and never have, Joanne Nova wrote at her blog. ",1
"And as far as evidence goes, surprisingly, I agree with the IPCC that carbon dioxide warms the planet. But few realize that the IPCC relies on feedback factors like humidity and clouds causing a major amplification of the minor CO2 effect and that this amplification simply isn’t there.

Advocates assert that the hypothesis that increased atmospheric carbon dioxide—CO2—from fossil fuel use will lead to unacceptable increases in global temperatures is no longer open to debate.

"For almost two decades, the climate debate has been dominated by advocates and environmental ministries, primarily those from the European Union. They used the image of a distant environmental apocalypse caused by human activity to fashion an unsustainable and unachievable treaty and to demonize any one who questioned their orthodoxy. That orthodoxy holds that climate science is settled, that humans are the major cause of warming in recent decades, and that there is only one way to avoid a climate-induced apocalypse later this century. That one way is to drastically reduce green- house gas emissions to levels 60% below 1990 levels by 2050. That orthodoxy is not built on observation, measurement, validation, and objective analyses, which are the bases of scientific information and sound policy. ",1

"That process is in fact not consistent with the view that mankind is confronted with a potential catastrophe. Instead, global warming appears to be yet another example of predicting catastrophe to reshape political decisions and economic outcomes. This is an overused strategy. ",1
"Global warming may turn out to be a reality but right now there also are enough reasons to conclude that what is masquerading as the most serious of environmental threats may be just another hobgoblin being used to advance agendas that can't survive on their own merits, O'Keefe said. I want to be absolutely clear that I am not asserting that the global warming threat is a hoax. I am challenging the process — the way it is being addressed, he clarifies. Instead of rational debate, what we have is advocacy driven by pseudo-science and hyped by the media. ",1
Those who advocate deep emission reductions contend that a scientific consensus exists and that man-made emissions of greenhouse gases will lead to a dangerous level of global warming. That's simply wrong. ,1
"First, the cost of mitigation is a function of time. Reducing emissions over a longer time period will be far less harmful to our economic well-being than forcing rapid reductions. I have no doubt that if we tried to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent over the next few years we would bring on a full-scale depression. ",1
Paul Johnson (2008) wrote that the greenhouse bandwagon is like Marxist or Freudian science. A better parallel might be with Lysenko pseudo-science. ,1
"The global warming doomsday writers claim the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are melting catastrophically, and will cause a sudden rise in sea level of 5 or more metres. This ignores the mechanism of glacier flow which is by creep. ",1
"I just don't see a point to staying in a treaty that was basically designed to transfer money away from the American people to developing countries and hurt our business. I don't see where we benefit from that, Orr said. ",1
"I like to think of shale as bubble wrap. You need to pop it in order to have fun, Orr said in his presentation at the Heartland Institute's Eleventh International Conference on Climate Change (ICCC11), also the European Institute for Climate and Energy's 9th conference. ",1
"Contrary to the common misconception that wind and solar are able to generate affordable electricity because they have no fuel costs (the wind and sunlight are free), electricity generated from wind is 2.5 times more costly than generating electricity from existing coal, nuclear and natural gas power plants, and solar is 3.5 times more costly. The subsidies paid to the owners of wind and solar systems hide the true cost of these expensive sources of energy and cushion states from the negative consequences of their detrimental policies mandating the use of renewable energy, Orr wrote. ",1
"The oil, gas, and coal industry received a total of $7.4 billion in 2016. By contrast, permanent tax expenditures available to renewable energy companies, including solar, wind, geothermal, biofuel and hydropower, were only worth $1.1 billion in 2016. ",1
"The report, done at the request of Congress, provides scientific evidence that hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources in the United States under some circumstances, the EPA wrote in a press release announcing the study's final conclusions. As part of the report, EPA identified conditions under which impacts from hydraulic fracturing activities can be more frequent or severe. ",1
"[T]here has been no conclusive evidence provided to support the claim that hydraulic fracturing has caused groundwater contamination, Orr claimed, adding With no confirmed cases of water well or groundwater contamination directly linked to the process of hydraulic fracturing, calls for moratoria are not supported by science.

I would never attempt to second-guess whatever he's doing in the interest of making this a free country. He has a strategy that probably we are unaware of. He's so smart and so successful that I’m just going to await the outcome. ,1
"With the recent gradual scientific acceptance - even among scientists who have spent their whole lives studying the subject - that global warming is simply much less significant than had been thought, the chance of anyone caring enough to take action is now even lower. ",1
"A vote for that politician [a climate change skeptic] is a vote against this sort of vicious price rise, this sort of stealth tax targeted on ordinary folk who find their energy bills a significant cost - the sort of hit that most of us will find pretty painful, given the current economic climate.

"It would seem that this is highly unlikely [that the Antarctic ice sheet might melt due to global warming] given current and near-future levels of atmospheric CO2: at current rates of increase it will take a century at least to reach 600 ppm, the level at which the ice sheet formed itself, and higher levels would be needed to actually start it melting.

"Those who are predicting catastrophe have been very effective at getting their message across in national media, and in so-called ‘public service’ announcements. But there is another viewpoint, a substantial viewpoint from a body of reputable scientists, and that viewpoint has really not been made available to a large majority, Klappa told The New York Times in a telephone interview. ",1
" I went to my board not long after the Hansen presentation, probably in 1990, and I said, you know, these coal plants have the most CO2 coming out of them than anywhere else. It was the top of the food chain, I called it. The board agreed. The board said I could go on the ICE board, so I did. ",1

"Coal is not dirty. Coal is green. And I say that because coal is electricity, and electricity at the point of use is the cleanest, most efficient form of energy, Palmer said at the Heartland Institute's America First energy conference. Coal is green. It is not dirty, because of electrification. CO2 is a benign gas required for life on Earth and is not dirty. ",1
It's not dirty; it's green. It's electricity. Electricity is life. Coal is life. ,1
"The 'regulate CO2' push will focus 'inside the fence' on existing plants by trying to force the use of very expensive technology, but CO2 is a benign gas required for life on Earth, so there would be no commensurate environmental improvement under any CO2 regulatory regime. ",1
"It’s hard not to concede that coal hasn’t been put on Earth and other fossil fuels as part of a divine plan, Palmer said. ",1
There are no observations that we have been having catastrophic global warming — it’s sophistry. […] ,1
"CO2 is implicated in this because of the endangerment finding which has to go, period, Palmer added, pointing to Heartland studies authored by research fellow Isaac Orr. Every day that goes by that endangerment's in place, American society is at risk and that if we go down this path that we've been on, our rates will be what they are in California.  ",1
" In particular, we are inviting state legislators, think tank leaders, energy executives, Trump administration political appointees and staff, and policy analysts who write and speak on environment and energy topics, Palmer said in the letter. ",1
"The nomination of Kathleen Hartnett White as chair of the Council on Environmental Quality is great news for the American people. The CEQ role over the years has been significant in leading the way on environmental issues under the National Environmental Policy Act in its advisory capacity to the president and to all federal agencies.[JH1]  Under the Obama administration, CEQ was used as a vehicle to eliminate the use of fossil fuels. Those days are over. The White nomination to this crucial post illustrates the seriousness of President Trump and his administration in moving the needle in favor of the American people and against radical environmentalism, Palmer said. ",1
"Maybe they do [despise that kind of activity]. But they don’t understand life and they don’t understand advocacy. I can’t help that […] I am reaching out to the fossil fuel community right now and raising money for Heartland, he said.  Of course that’s acceptable. ",1
"It’s hard not to concede that coal hasn’t been put on Earth and other fossil fuels as part of a divine plan. Because it’s easy to get to, it’s here and more people live better and longer from it, I believe that. I’m not terribly religious but I’m a believer in Christ and all of those things. But I’m relaxed about it. ",1
"There are no observations that we have been having catastrophic global warming — it’s sophistry, Palmer declared in the interview. It’s an agenda driven by lawyers who make their own facts and make up their own laws and that was called the Obama administration. [Former vice president Al] Gore would have been the same way if he had been in power.  ",1
"I have been in and around Washington, D.C a long time. It’s an exciting time in our development and I think Donald Trump will succeed, said Palmer. This town still doesn’t. We are going to have eight years of Donald Trump and then eight years of President Pence so get ready. Then tell me what D.C. looks like after that period.  ",1
Most Americans don’t realize that the scientific community has grave doubts about whether human activities cause ‘global warming’ and what the proper course of action should be. We’re making up for the poor job that television stations and newspapers have done conveying the truth about the global temperature record and the benefits of rising atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (C02). ,1

"The warming since 1910 occurred at a nearly constant rate. Over the full length of the long Australian records since the end of the 1800s, there is no sign of warming or increased occurrence of extreme events. The monthly highest and mean maximum temperatures do not exhibit any positive trend. The differences between monthly highest and lowest, or monthly mean maximum and mean minimum temperatures, are all reducing because of urban heat island formation, Albert Parker and Clifford D. Ollier wrote in a paper abstract, republished by Principia Scientific International. ",1
"The lack of global warming over this century in the measurements of ground and deep oceans temperatures and the lack of positive acceleration in the measurements of sea levels suggest that the climate models have greatly exaggerated the influence of the anthropogenic carbon dioxide emission, Parker wrote in an article at Principia Scientific International. ",1
"The reason why climate models are failing so badly so quickly is not because of the variability in the climate, but because of the overrated effect of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions and neglected natural oscillations, Parker claimed in a comment published at Principia Scientific International. ",1
"The claim that the sea levels are accelerating since the 1990 is not supported by any measurement of proper length and quality. We should therefore conclude that the local tide gauge results may give a good estimate of the sea level growth in the next few decades, and a lower bound of future sea level rises in 2100 or 2200, Boretti said in a journal comment. ",1
"And this is again due very heavily to Jan Veizer at the University of Ottawa […] And this is where the work he did with Shaviv came in, and they found that there was no statistical correlation between CO2 and climate. And in my research, I didn’t really see any CO2 impact at all; there was nothing changing in more recent times that didn’t correlate well with the sunspot cycle. So, that’s how I got where I am. ",1
"[C]hanges in the output of the sun caused the most recent climate change. By comparison, CO2 variations show little correlation with our planet's climate on long, medium and even short time scales. ",1
"Based on the paleoclimatic data I and others have collected, it's obvious that climate is and always has been variable. In fact, the only constant about climate is change; it changes continually. We certainly have no chance of stopping this natural phenomenon. ",1
"The message I always give, and again I teach a large climate change class at Carleton University, and the message I always say 'the only constant about climate is change.' Climate changes all the time. ",1
I teach a general climate change course. To get the significance of this correlation over to the students I use the following analogy. I tell the students that based on these records if you believe that climate is being driven by CO2 then they probably would have no difficulty in accepting the idea that Winston Churchill was instrumental in the defeat of King Herold by Duke William of Orange at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. If you can believe that this historical temporal incongruity could be feasible then you can have no problem believing that CO2 is what's driving Earth's climate system. ,1
"There is an intense debate in the climate science community about the causes of the past century's modest warming, and more recently, the reasons for our observation that there has been no warming in the first decade of the 21st century, Patterson wrote. To say that the debate is settled, as David Suzuki and Al Gore maintain, is ridiculous. New discoveries and theories about climate are put forth all the time and it is crucially important that no one, school children included, be under the impression that this rapidly evolving field is somehow stagnant, with little left to be discovered. […] Rather than damping their enthusiasm for science by misleading them into thinking that scientific debate is something of the past in this field, we need to inspire them to join us in this exciting scientific adventure – the unraveling of the Earth's massively complex climate system, easily the most challenging problem in the history of science.

"The AfD is using the Bundestag as a stage for its dissemination of climate lies. They invite fake experts to a so-called symposium on climate change to generate content for mass dissemination via social media channels and stir up hatred and anger on the internet. We are experiencing a shift to the right on social media and in society. In a short period of time, the new right has established its own counter-society on climate issues. With troll armies, agitating magazines and the support of climate skeptics like EIKE, it has created its own sphere that is massively underestimated. ",1

"George Pearson, a former member of the John Birch Society in Wichita, who served as Charles Koch's political lieutenant during those years, expanded on this strategy in his own eye-opening paper. He suggested that libertarians needed to mobilize youthful cadres influencing academia in new ways. Traditional gifts to universities, he warned, didn’t guarantee enough ideological control. Instead, he advocated funding private institutes within prestigious universities, where donors could exert influence over hiring decisions and other academic matters while hiding the radicalism of their aims, Jane Mayer noted. ",1
"Papers described how donors can maintain control over the use of their campus donations, how the libertarian movement should learn from the Nazi Youth program and its success in capturing the state, and what lessons the movement should learn from Koch’s longtime membership in the industry-funded/farright group, the John Birch Society, UnKoch noted.

"In the last 5-10 years, we have heard ad nauseam that there is a scientific consensus— that anthropogenic global warming is real, that man is causing the earth to warm at an alarming rate by the burning of fossils fuels, that we are nearing a tipping point after which we are doomed. That consensus arose out of the UN’s IPPC group of 2500. However, in that group there are only about 300 qualified scientists. At the same time, dissenting groups of scientists numbering 100’s to 1000’s, and in one case, 10s of 1000s have disagreed, the event description claims. ",1
"In fact, more and more evidence from long ago is suggesting we understand imperfectly why climates change, and that many factors as well as carbon dioxide contribute: for example, activity on the sun, the orbit of the earth and its wobbles, clouds, water vapour, oceans, volcanoes and bovine flatulence. Scientific evidence is not changed by governmental consensus, political will, or strong arm tactics, Pell wrote in a column at the Sunday Telegraph. ",1

"Why would I say this book is not science?

"Pence Said, A lot of these men and women are wonderful leaders in the evangelical community, and I respect their right to be heard on issues unrelated to their expertise. Every American has that right. (But) any fair reading of the science today, while global warming has taken place, it is not yet clear that it is being driven by human activity. But I'm trying to read as much as I can. And my mom used to say 'better safe than sorry,' so I am glad the energy bill authorized construction of a number of nuclear power plants in this country, which represents electric-generating facilities that don't produce so-called greenhouse gases. … It seems to me that this issue has such a significant ability to have an enormous drain on our economy and on our national economic vitality that we should simply let the science drive it.

"Once again, I am formally asking you for a public correction and apology, Pielke wrote to Trenberth. If that is not forthcoming I will be pursuing this further. More generally, in the future how about we agree to disagree over scientific topics like gentlemen? ",1
" Humans influence the climate system in profound ways, including through the emission of carbon dioxide via the combustion of fossil fuels […] It does mean however that some activists, politicians, journalists, corporate and government agency representatives and even scientists who should know better have made claims that are unsupportable based on evidence and research. ",1
"Since becoming sci advisor Holdren has always stayed on safe (boring) ground in his public remarks, Pielke Tweeted. ",1
"[N]ot all glaciers and ice caps are melting. While the Arctic ice, for example, has been decreasing in areal extent…Antarctic sea ice coverage has not. ",1
"There has not been warming significantly, if at all, since 2003, as most everyone on all sides of the climate issue agree. ",1
"[…] I have reproduced below the current plots of lower tropospheric temperature anomalies. The trend of temperatures using that climate metric is NOT accelerating, and, indeed, has not even been positive for over 12 years! ",1
"[U]pper ocean heat, in terms of its annual average, did not accumulate during the period ~2004 through 2009. ",1

"What is now regarded as human-induced climate change, any scientist will say well that's just normal variability. Climate varies, temperatures vary, sea levels go up and down like  a yo yo.",1
There is no problem with global warming. It stopped in 1998. The last two years of global cooling have erased nearly 30 years of temperature increase. ,1
Greens don't read book. That's evident from their perpetual ignorance. ,1
"Climate has always changed. It always has and always will. Sea level has always changed. Ice sheets come and go. Life always changes. Extinctions of life are normal. Planet Earth is dynamic and evolving. Climate changes are cyclical and random. Through the eyes of a geologist, I would be really concerned if there were no change to Earth over time. In the light of large rapid natural climate changes, just how much do humans really change climate? ",1
"Satellite measurements show that there has been a greening of the planet over the last few decades, thanks to a slight increase in traces of plant food in the atmosphere. Plimer adds that, Without CO2, there would be no plants and without plants, there would be no animals. ",1
"There’s been that many climate changes in the past, and it’s survived in the past, Duck said. The reefs will come and go. The sea level will rise and the sea level will fall. ",1
"Do you know how many young scientists' and old scientists' lives have been ruined because they wouldn't go along with that? I would tell Donald Trump to reach out to them and bring the real scientists back into science and into medicine. So that America can see real science and real medical research again, not the Soviet-style science that has emerged under Barry Obama from Honolulu. ",1
"To me, this is only the latest hysteria. I have lived through so many in my lifetime, that I don’t believe a single one has actually panned out. […] And then the hysteria over heterosexual AIDS in America, millions were predicted to die from it, Newsweek and Time were culprits there as they so often are. The popular media are spectacularly irresponsible, because hysteria sells and non-hysteria does not sell copy. […] If it turns out that global warming is a tragedy, then so I should be so judged. In the meantime, the President and others should be judged because they are transforming the American economy and therefore the world economy based on drivel. ",1
"It is an axiom of contemporary marital life that if a wife is not in the mood, she need not have sex with her husband. Here are some arguments why a woman who loves her husband might want to rethink this axiom. ",1
"In Part II, I advance the argument that a wife should do so even when she is not in the mood for sexual relations, Prager begins. He then outlines eight reasons for a woman not to allow not being in the mood for sex to determine whether she denies her husband sex. ",1
"It is easy for feminists to forget this, but it was men who gave up their monopoly on political power and gave women the right to vote, Bruce says in the video. Men who invented birth control, the refrigerator, the washing machine, and so many other devices that liberated women. ",1
"The rape of a name can be as vicious a crime and as destructive an act as the rape of a body. Sometimes the rape of a body is worse, sometimes the rape of a name is worse. But they are both rapes, he wrote. ",1
Another aspect of feminism that has probably contributed to many women's unhappiness was the rejection of femininity. ,1
"The left has a monopoly, almost a monopoly, on hysteria, he said. And I will just give you a few examples of the hysterias of your lifetime. One was heterosexual AIDs in America. Do you remember that? when we were told by Time and Newsweek and The New York Times, remember when they said AIDS doesn’t discriminate? Well, that was a lie. AIDS does discriminate. It happens to attack in America—and I emphasize in America— overwhelmingly, gay men and intravenous drug users and his partners. You know the group least likely to get AIDS? Gay women. So it can’t be homophobic to say the truth. ",1
"We dropped two atom bombs over Japan, Prager said. Why? Because the context morally demanded it and the moral demand in our time in America is the defeat of the Left. ",1
[L]eftism is a terminal cancer in the American bloodstream and soul. So our first and greatest principle is to destroy this cancer before it destroys us. We therefore see voting for Donald Trump as political chemotherapy needed to prevent our demise. ,1
"Where I live in Southern California, the reason we have no water is not because of drought, it is because of the worship of nature. For example, the incredible amount of water that is taken from humans in order to save some six-inch fish. This is the worship of nature. ",1

"[T]he self-esteem movement officially launched by California in 1986 has been at best silly and at worst injurious to society, Prager wrote. There is no correlation between goodness and high self-esteem. But there is a correlation between criminality and high self-esteem. […] Yes, people with high self-esteem are the ones most prone to violence. ",1
"High self-esteem in children does not produce good character, and in fact is likely to produce a less moral individual, Prager wrote. ",1
" Right now, America's only hope of staying American rather than becoming European lies in making these principles as clear as possible to as many Americans as possible. The left is so giddy with power right now, we actually have a chance. ",1
"I don't think that the press covers always what's most important. Because, honestly, whatever side you're on, I can't think frankly of a more important issue even including the economy, than the definition of marriage. ",1
"Without citing a source, Prager also notes, While the typical lesbian has had fewer than ten 'lovers,' the typical male homosexual in America has had over 500. […] Men, not women, are sexually sadistic. The indiscriminate sex that characterizes much of male homosexual life represents the antithesis of Judaism's goal of elevating human life from the animal-like to the Godlike. ",1
They are called environmentalists. ,1
"I have never written that there is a threat of fascism in America. I always considered the idea overwrought. But now I believe there really is such a threat – and it will come draped not in an American flag, but in the name of tolerance and health, Prager wrote at the National Review. ",1
"The lesson the NCAA is teaching young people — that history and truth don’t matter if enough powerful people don’t want them to matter — can be as injurious to society as the cover-up was to the victims of Sandusky, Prager added. ",1
"I need to introduce to you yet another highly prominent scientist from around the world who has so much important data to give to us about the, what is called global warming, or has been now metamorphosed into climate change since it may not be warming, Prager began. ",1
"IP: The ice sheets wax and wane all the time. They expand and they contract. It’s rather like having a Christmas pudding. If you put your fist into it, then some of the pudding will move out of the bowl and will rise. ",1
"DP: All right, so again, I have to review this for my sake and my listeners’ sake, that in the past, there have been times of far greater carbon dioxide amounts in the atmosphere of Earth, and it was not hotter, and ice was not melting. ",1
"IP: Carbon dioxide is not a pollutant. It’s plant food. And every time we’ve had high carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, we’ve had a thriving of life on Earth. ",1
"Prager adds that Ellison, would be doing more damage to the unity of America and to the value system that has formed this country than the terrorists of 9-11. ",1
"Democrats tell us they understand the world, but then they call climate change, not radical Islamic terrorism, the greatest threat to national security. Look, I think we all care about our planet, but melting icebergs aren't beheading Christians in the Middle East. ",1
"I can assure you – and I've been approved to say this – that the top levels of the intelligence community have assured me that that story is not only inaccurate but it's grossly overstated and it was wrong, Priebus said. He added that They have made it very clear that that story in The New York Times is complete garbage.  ",1
"As far as this issue on climate change — the only thing he [Trump] was saying after being asked a few questions about it is, look, he’ll have an open mind about it but he has his default position, which most of it is a bunch of bunk, but he’ll have an open mind and listen to people, Priebus said. ",1
"There are basically two things that I want to make really clear, as for myself as your speaker, Ryan said in the recording. I am not going to defend Donald Trump — not now, not in the future. As you probably heard, I disinvited him from my first congressional district GOP event this weekend — a thing I do every year. And I’m not going to be campaigning with him over the next 30 days. ",1
"The world is well aware of this history, Ryan spokesman Brendan Buck responded to Breitbart And obviously a lot has happened since then. As everyone knows. ",1
"The patchwork of limits on political speech undermines the First Amendment and puts high transparency, full-disclosure groups like the RNC on an unequal footing with other political entities, RNC Priebus said in a statement. We are asking that political parties be treated equally under the law.  ",1
"If the RNC is successful, we will again see party committees brazenly soliciting $1 million contributions from wealthy contributors seeking to directly purchase influence over candidates and officeholders, with the party committees acting as the sales agent, said Lawrence Noble, former counsel to the FEC and current adviser at the Campaign Legal Center.

"Kansans and Americans shouldn't be forced to shoulder the costly burden of President Obama's careless attempt to secure his legacy, Pompeo said of the Paris climate accord, E&E News reported. Congress must also do all in our power to fight against this damaging climate change proposal and pursue policies that support American energy, create new jobs, and power our economy. ",1
"There are scientists who think lots of different things about climate change. There's some who think we're warming, there's some who think we're cooling, there's some who think that the last 16 years have shown a pretty stable climate environment, Pompeo said. ",1

"It’s a complete coincidence that Pruitt went behind the White House’s back and used this in the most unethical way possible, just as the [inspector general] starts asking questions, one EPA staffer told The Atlantic. Now they just have to connect the dots. ",1
"It’s a safe assumption that Pruitt could be the most hostile E.P.A. administrator toward clean air and safe drinking water in history, Ken Cook, head of the Environmental Working Group, told the New York Times in December 2016. ",1
"I mean, we know that humans have most flourished during times of what, warming trends? I mean, so I think there's assumptions made that because the climate is warming, that that necessarily is a bad thing. […] ",1
"Science tells us that the climate is changing, and that human activity in some manner impacts that change. The ability to measure with precision the degree and extent of that impact, and what to do about it, are subject to continuing debate and dialogue, and well it should be. ",1
"During his time as Oklahoma Attorney General, Pruitt was accused of collaborating with oil and gas companies when he sent a letter to the EPA complaining that they were overestimating pollution levels and unfairly burdening activity in the Oklahoma energy sector. ",1
"It is extremely difficult for me to cease serving you in this role first because I count it as a blessing to be serving you in any capacity, but also because of the transformative work that is occurring, Pruitt said in his resignation letter posted by Fox News. [163], ",1
"The documents show the extent to which the E.P.A., which is the main federal agency charged with protecting human health and the environment, worked with groups like the Heartland Institute, which holds positions on climate change that are far outside the mainstream of scientific opinion, as opposed to the agency’s own chief scientists, The New York Times reported.

" We were thinking this meeting could be purely informative in nature, and not necessarily in the context of a specific EPA exercise, Tate Bennett, associate administrator at the EPA wrote to Cass.  ",1
"The science that we use is going to be transparent, reproducible and able to be analyzed by those in the marketplace, Pruitt said. This is the right approach. Today is a red letter today. It's a banner day. It's an agency taking responsibility for how we do our work and respect the process to make sure we can enhance confidence in our decision making. ",1
"The Obama Administration's determination was wrong, Pruitt said, quoted in the April 2 EPA press release. Obama’s EPA cut the Midterm Evaluation process short with politically charged expediency, made assumptions about the standards that didn’t comport with reality, and set the standards too high. ",1
"[…] We need to embrace a stewardship mentality. And, to whom much is given, much is required. And use those natural resources we’ve been blessed with to bless others, both domestically and internationally. And we’ve got to have that dialogue. ",1
"He’s made very, very courageous decisions, Pruitt said. He’s willing to take on the culture here in Washington and across the country. As an example, that is the Paris Accord agreement, to exit that. There was tremendous pressure brought on the President to stay in that, by the way, for no good environmental reason. It was a bumper sticker. Paris was a bumper sticker. It was not about CO2 reduction. It was about penalizing our own economy. […] The President made a very courageous decision to exit.  ",1
"After reviewing the CPP, EPA has proposed to determine that the Obama-era regulation exceeds the Agency’s statutory authority. Repealing the CPP will also facilitate the development of U.S. energy resources and reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens associated with the development of those resources, in keeping with the principles established in President Trump’s Executive Order on Energy Independence, the press release reads.

"Pruitt has drawn criticism from environmentalists and other critics for letting prominent GOP backers and industry groups influence the agency's agenda — even as he has kicked scientists off of EPA's advisory panels and moved to limit the kinds of peer-reviewed research it will consider when making decisions, Politico reported. ",1
"He’s got a serious problem because of his emails down in Oklahoma — he’s burned himself, said Schnare, referring to the thousands of emails released as part of a request by the Center for Media and Democracy (CMD). (Pruitt had previously asserted the emails did not exist). ",1
"My view was that under this administration we would be good at transparency, particularly in the regulatory area, he said. But these guys aren’t doing that. ",1
"The Heartland Institute has been a long proponent of a red team to critically examine what has become alarmist dogma rather than a sober evaluation of climate science for many years, Lakely said. In fact, Heartland has worked closely with a red team that has been examining the science for several years: the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change, or NIPCC. ",1

"History shows that depopulation, social disruptions, extinctions, disease, and catastrophic droughts take place in cold times yet life blossoms and economies bloom in warm times. If indeed there is a period of global warming, why are we afraid of it? ",1
"I was pleased with the overall direction that Mr. Trump wants to go with respect to energy policy. It's mainstream, it's main street, and makes a lot of sense. ",1
"It’s important to remember that President Obama’s carbon regulation, the crown jewel of his climate legacy, has no impact on climate change. EPA’s own models show that their carbon rule will limit global temperature rise by a mere 0.018 degrees Celsius by 2100. That’s a bad deal for the American people. State leaders should protect their citizens from Obama’s costly carbon rule by refusing to submit a plan. ",1
"The American Energy Alliance has organized a coalition to proclaim in one unified voice that there should be no expansion of the misguided electric vehicle tax credit, Pyle wrote in a statement, quoted at The Daily Caller. There is no question that the electric vehicle tax credit distorts the auto market to no gain. ",1
"Contrary to the naysayers, we have drilled our way to prosperity at home. And as this energy revolution continues, U.S. energy exports will lift millions of people out of poverty around the world. ",1
"The economic contradictions found within the green new deal further expose that the whole proposal is nothing more than a green activist manifesto. […] The Green New Deal is unnecessary, illogical and immoral. ",1
"Enough is enough. Wind advocates have claimed for decades they wouldn’t need handouts within a few more years, claims that have proven wrong time and again. Wind’s recent history illustrates this reality. When the PTC is active – aka, when the tax spigot is open – new wind installations soar. When it’s temporarily expired and no more tax dollars are available, installations plummet, Pyle writes. ",1
"Congress should reject any attempt by [Senate Majority Leader Harry] Reid to revive the wind production tax credit in the lame-duck session. It’s clearly a bad deal for Nevadans, enriching out-of-state billionaires at the expense of working families. ",1
"While one may not doubt the fact that the climate, by and large, does appear to be getting warmer; what, however, does tax the mind is the attempted linkage of the glacier retreat in the Himalayas to the global warming. ",1
Nothing abnormal is happening to Indian glaciers. They're retreating because of negative mass balance. There’s no evidence of climate change. ,1
"You can’t have an energy policy that means you can only have a bath when the wind blows, Ratcliffe said in an interview with The Guardian/The Observer. ",1

"Without having participated in the Federal Register review process that had led up to the draft report being made available for public comment (after two rounds of technical review), nor having participated in the public meetings discussing the draft report and its contents until the very end, the ExxonMobil proceeded to make a number of charges in the advertisement, generally based on rather poor understanding of what was being done and why the National Assessment was being undertaken. ",1
"And it is completely wrong, as is often argued, is that it would have never been as warm as today. This is absurd: 120,000 years ago, there were hippos along the Rhine and the Thames. This data should be evaluated before you exaggerate the current figures on horror scenarios. In addition, and in retrospect of the past thousand years makes it abundantly clear: it was the cold times in which we and other parts of the world have been hit by major disasters. Not the warm periods. ",1
A warmer climate helps promote species diversity. ,1
"In warmer regions, it takes far less effort to ensure survival. How did the polar bear survive the last warm period? Whether bears survive will depend on human beings, not the climate. ",1
"I am not a climatologist, nor an expert on sea level or polar ice. But I do know from talking to many scientists in many disciplines that this 'consensus' is a mirage. Every discipline has many critical, unanswered questions and many dangerous distortions. ",1
"This statement is clearly contradicted by reality and credible studies. For example, the economic consulting firm NERA found that the cost of EPA’s so-called 'Clean Power Plan' could total nearly $300 billion. Nearly $300 billion in compliance costs will significantly impact jobs. ",1
The cherry-picking method used to manufacture these projections has been written about extensively. ,1
"The administration equating our commentary on the relevance of the [mercury rule] to [the carbon rule] as apples to oranges presents a straw man that distracts from the lesson states should take away from [the mercury rule] — if you start implementing the rule before full legal resolution, there's no going back. Even worse, the EPA is counting on this to happen. ",1
"They are more voluminous, said Hubbel Relat. They've delved a little deeper into the quest for a range of information that appears to, at times, be asking for every document that's ever been created by the Department of the Interior. ",1
"What they are doing is a very thinly veiled effort to target critics of the Trump administration and to keep their corruption a secret, said Chris Saeger, the Western Values Project's executive director. ",1
"Despite how important this industry is to all of our lives and our economy, the African-American communities and a lot of rural communities in general are underrepresented and left out of this industry, Relat said. A lot of the time they are simply not made aware of the job opportunities in the industry. ",1
"I thought we defeated Communism on the other shores, and now it's inside our own country. It's been in the school systems and everywhere else, and now we have the fight right here, and it's going to be the fight of our lifetime. ",1
"The underlying issue is based on faulty science to begin with. But now, at this point, the endangerment finding was decided on science that came out in the 1990s and it was all speculative and all the models Al Gore did his original movie on, none of which have come anywhere near the truth. So what Scott [Pruitt] is trying to do, Administrator Pruitt and others, is say let's open up that scientific debate. Let's have that scientific debate. Let's look at the data and see whether or not this is actually an endangerment. And that's the battle that needs to happen. ",1
"I was actually in Paris. I was at the COP21 where the UN folks signed all that. We were the anti-COP group, and my colleague Chris Horner and others had wanted posters plastered all over Paris when we arrived. ",1
"Thanks to lots of people including Anthony Watts, Jennifer Marohasy, Jo Nova, Benny Peiser (GWPF), Willie Soon for spreading the word. Also a huge thanks to the IPA for helping with the organisation, Ridd said. His GoFundMe campaign raised its first $99,322 in just 49 hours. ",1
"Due to the remarkable mechanisms that corals have developed to adapt to changing temperatures, especially the ability to swap symbionts, corals are perhaps the least endangered of any ecosystem to future climate change – natural or man-made. ",1
"As I have been stating clearly for some time now, the scare stories about the Great Barrier Reef started in the 1960s when scientists first began work on the Reef.  Since then, they have been crying wolf. […] The Reef is actually in great order. So are farmers really killing the Great Barrier Reef through run-off of pesticides and fertilisers, and mud in flood periods? No. ",1
"[I]t might be predicted that a modest increase in temperature, of a few degrees, would allow corals to grow faster on the Great Barrier Reef, Ridd wrote. ",1
"Policy science concerning the Great Barrier Reef is almost never checked. Over the next few years, Australian governments will spend more than a billion dollars on the Great Barrier Reef; the costs to industry could far exceed this. Yet the keystone research papers have not been subject to proper scrutiny. Instead, there is a total reliance on the demonstrably inadequate peer-review process, Ridd claimed. ",1
Is there a chance that many marine scientists are partially driven by ideology? Is there a chance that peer review among this group is self-selecting of the dominant idea? Is there a robust debate without intimidation? Ridd asked. ,1
"Geological research shows that climates always change, naturally and on virtually all timescales, so his view was that humans needed to get used to the idea and, most importantly, that society needed to prepare for change and to adapt, Ridd wrote with co-author Piers Larcombe. ",1
"Ridley has always maintained his own coal interests are immaterial to his climate sceptic views and political activities, Shrubshole said. This disclosure paints a different picture – of a peer who attacks clean energy whilst seeking to extend the lifetime of the coal industry in this country. ",1
"And that in that sense the physics is undeniable, and the trend is clear. But it is happening slower than forecast […] the effects of climate change are not showing up as bad as we had feared by now, Ridley said in an address to the Wageningen University. ",1
"I am a climate lukewarmer. That means I think recent global warming is real, mostly man-made and will continue but I no longer think it is likely to be dangerous and I think its slow and erratic progress so far is what we should expect in the future. That last year was the warmest yet, in some data sets, but only by a smidgen more than 2005, is precisely in line with such lukewarm thinking, Ridley wrote in My life as a climate change lukewarmer at The Times. ",1
"I am not a 'denier'. I fully accept that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, the climate has been warming and that man is very likely to be at least partly responsible. […] you can accept all the basic tenets of greenhouse physics and still conclude that the threat of a dangerously large warming is so improbable as to be negligible, while the threat of real harm from climate-mitigation policies is already so high as to be worrying, that the cure is proving far worse than the disease is ever likely to be, Ridley said in the 2011 Angus Millar speech on Scientific Heresy, reposted in its entirety at the skeptical blog Watts Up With That. [15], ",1
Thus Paris embodies precisely what the green movement worried about after Copenhagen: that a weak and non-binding agreement would be worse than futile. Yet the disastrous Kyoto story is repeating itself; adherence to Paris has become a totem of global determination to tackle climate change while the agreement seems purpose-built to prevent the very economic sophistication on which any low-carbon future depends. ,1
"So far, the benefits of global greening have been greater than expected, while the costs of global warming have been smaller than expected and the price of reducing carbon dioxide emissions has been higher than expected. That price is falling more heavily on poor than on rich people. The evidence suggests that this imbalance will persist for most of this century, perhaps longer. It is time for a rethink, Ridley wrote at The Spectator. ",1
"Climate policies are hitting mainly poor people while enriching mainly wealthy people. The lack of affordable electricity in poor countries is responsible for poverty and at least three million deaths a year from indoor smoke, yet western countries and international institutions largely refuse to support the cheapest source of electricity, fossil fuels. It is reasonable that journalists should occasionally report challenges to the evidence on which these policies are based, Ridley wrote at The Times. ",1
"My Lords, this latest report clearly states that the impact of climate change by the latter years of the century is likely to be less than 2% of global income and will be small relative to other factors such as economic development. Given that the co-chair of that report, Chris Field, is on record as saying that the really big breakthrough in this report is the new idea of thinking about management of climate change, would my noble friend agree that the time has come to congratulate my noble friend Lord Lawson, who has been saying exactly this for eight years? I declare my energy interests as listed in the register, Ridley said in testimony at the House of Lords. ",1
"Obviously, the oil industry and the gas industry cause problems but hydraulic fracturing itself has not produced a single environmental problem, Ridley said in testimony at the House of Lords. ",1
"A cumulative change of less than 2°C by the end of this century will do no net harm. It will actually do net good […] rainfall will increase slightly, growing seasons will lengthen, Greenland's ice cap will melt only very slowly, and so on, Ridley wrote at The Wall Street Journal. ",1
"Ocean acidification looks suspiciously like a back-up plan by the environmental pressure groups in case the climate fails to warm: another try at condemning fossil fuels. […] Even if the world warms as much as the consensus expects, the net harm still looks small alongside the real harm now being done by preventable causes; and if it does warm this much, it will be because more people are rich enough to afford to do something about it, Ridley wrote in his book The Rational Optimist, as quoted in a New Scientist article examining his claims. ",1
"The answer to the second question is less certain, he admits. It remains possible that tropical cyclones are becoming slightly fiercer, but slightly less frequent, which would be consistent with some predictions of climate-change theory. ",1
"Climate change means that when we do have an event like Harvey, the rainfall amounts are likely to be higher than they would have been otherwise, UN spokeswoman Clare Nullis said at a conference. ",1
"Judith Curry said of Hurricane Irma last week: 'The surprising thing about this development into a major hurricane was that it developed over relatively cool waters in the Atlantic, 26.5C, when the rule of thumb is 28.5C for a major hurricane'. So it was not exceptional warmth, but exceptionally low wind shear (high-altitude wind) that led to Irma’s birth. ",1
"What does it mean for policy? Pause to notice one truly spectacular feature of Harvey and Irma: how few people they have killed so far, Ridley wrote. Wealth is the best defence against storms.[…] Adaptation is and always will be the way to survive storms. ",1
"Thus Paris embodies precisely what the green movement worried about after Copenhagen: that a weak and non-binding agreement would be worse than futile, Ridley concludes. ",1
"The motto of the Royal Society is ‘Nullius in verba’, which translates to ‘take nobody's word for it’. It is an affirmation of legitimate scepticism, but not the sort of pseudo-sceptical, anti-scientific, bad-faith contrarianism displayed by the Matt Ridleys of the world, he added. ",1
"Indeed, it appears that Viscount Ridley obscured the truth about Professor Myneni’s work by showing slides from his July 2013 lecture, but claiming they were part of his earlier 2012 lecture.",1
"Warming (and possibly the CO2 fertilisation effect) has also been correlated with global trends in satellite greenness observations, which resulted in an estimated 6% increase of global NPP, or the accumulation of 3.4 PgC on land over the period 1982–1999 (Nemani et al., 2003). ",1
"The first thing I should say is that I've lost some of my respect for those kind of consensus arguments since covering the acid rain story in particular, since covering a lot of the environmental scares, swine flu, everything, Ridley said. Acid rain in particular turned out to be, in terms of its effect on forests in Europe and North America…lakes and things are a different point to some extent…but forests; hugely, hugely exaggerated. And I should have taken that kind of story with a much bigger pinch of salt than I did when I was covering it in the 1980s as a science journalist. So I come to the climate debate now just a little chastened by that and saying well, okay, you say this is scary, show me the evidence. And I keep getting shown evidence that does not scare me. I keep getting shown evidence that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, yes, that we are increasing it, yes, that there will therefore be net warming, yes, but that the positive feedbacks on top of that that are being assumed, there is no evidence for. So I think we are looking at, certainly for the next few decades, just what we've had in the last few decades, which is a mild and gradual warming that will not do catastrophic harm either to human beings or to biodiversity, in fact probably the reverse.

To argue that we need to keep drastically warming the world for generations in order to protect us from temporary volcanic cooling is about as silly an argument I have ever heard. Recall the massive Mt. Pinatubo volcano in 1991 that caused about 0.5C cooling for a few years? Where are we now? Obviously much warmer than we were in 1991 and Pinatubo is a distant memory. […] Ridley also repeats the very misleading meme that nature emits more CO2 than humans. He fails to tell his readers that nature also absorbs about the same CO2 that it emits. ,1
"Lord Monckton propounds widely discredited fictions about climate change and misrepresents the research of countless scientists, said the letter. With zero peer-reviewed publications, he has declared that the scientific enterprise is invalid and that climate science is fraudulent … Over the last month there has been a great deal of coverage in the Australian media of the death threats and abusive emails that have targeted Australian scientists working on climate change. These threats are fuelled by misinformation spread by figures like Lord Monckton and the distorted coverage that they receive in the Australian media. As academics, we expect our universities to support us against this kind of abuse. We expect our universities to foster academic standards of conduct and argument. ",1

Some people say that the claim that human CO2 causes global climate change is the biggest fraud ever perpetrated. It’s not. It’s arguably the third biggest fraud. Investigating the drivers of climate change corruption leads to the same people who are perpetrating the second biggest fraud being creation of money out of nothing and the most destructive fraud being antihumanism. Investigating those scams leads to the international bankers as their perpetrators and primary beneficiaries. ,1
The UN IPCC’s unfounded core claim about human CO2 is part of UN Agenda 21 campaign for global governance. ,1
The core problem is massive over-government through international bankers seeking to control. ,1
"NGO’s such as WWF and Greenpeace are responsible for corrupting UN IPCC reports. They falsely use and then spread political campaign material as science. Their frequent public claims contradict empirical scientific evidence. WWF is a UN agent pushing global governance and funded by major foundations connected with international bankers.

"Senator Roberts could have made effective inquiries of the British High Commission by which he would have been informed of the steps necessary to renounce his foreign citizenship. He could have obtained and completed a form of renunciation declaration, such as Form RN, and returned it with the required fee to the Home Office as he belatedly did. ",1

"Here are more undeniable facts proven by data: firstly, changes in the carbon dioxide level are a result of changes in temperature, not a cause. That is the reverse of what we have been told. Secondly, we do not and cannot affect the level of carbon dioxide in air. That too is the reverse of what we have been told. That means we cannot and do not affect global climate. Thirdly, warming is beneficial—after all, science classifies far warmer past periods as climate optimums. Again, that is the reverse of what we are told. ",1

"Ironically, the evidence is overwhelming that adding CO2 to the atmosphere is highly beneficial.  CO2 makes crops grow better with less water.  A touch of global warming, all that we can possibly expect, is also beneficial, especially compared to global cooling, Rogers claimed in an article at the American Thinker.  The scientific credibility of the global warming has fallen to near absolute zero in the face of the 18-year failure of the Earth to warm, he added. ",1
"It’s perfectly reasonable that adding CO2 to the atmosphere could cause some warming, probably minor. This perfectly reasonably supposition was turned into unreasonable dogma by certain scientific disciplines that sensed an opportunity. They realized that if CO2 were inflated into the great Satan, it would be very beneficial for their careers, Rogers wrote at the American Thinker. ",1
Global warming is a political movement disguised as a scientific movement. ,1
Global warming scare stories are good for global warming science because the scare stories promote research funding.  If it weren't for the scary predictions these scientists would be toiling in a poorly funded and obscure branch of academic science. ,1
I’ve discovered that if a person is committed to green ideology it is very difficult to change their mind about global warming alarmism. This is true even if they are technically qualified and able to understand scientific arguments. You can’t change their thinking because their thinking is faith based. In other words they have come to believe in a green religion. Even though these believers could have a green religion without global warming they are very reluctant to let go of global warming because it is a justification for other tenets of the green religion like using less energy. However scientific arguments and facts are very important for informing people who are open minded on the subject of global warming. ,1
"There are very eminent older climate scientists, like Richard Lindzen and Roger Pielke Sr. that are publicly critical of the green doctrine. These are scientists who are so accomplished and established as to be immune to retaliation. Mid-career climate scientists, like Roy Spencer and John Christy, both from the University of Alabama Huntsville, are critical of global warming doctrine and have done very important scientific work trying to point the science in a sounder direction. But most of the critics of global warming alarmism come from related fields of science, for example meteorology, engineering or physics. ",1
"There's been no warming in over 17 years. So all of this discussion about shutting down certain parts of our energy industry is nothing short of a disaster for the economy, Rollins said in an interview during a TPPF At the Crossroads energy conference. ",1

She added: When Big Brother gets so big that they have to know everything about you to be able to give you everything you want, that begins the ruin of our country. ",1
"And, however, what I do think — which I originally talked about, which is opening up the markets a little bit and giving kids a choice — that all of a sudden you see the market begin to work in that area and, you know, a lot of parents don't love what their kids are being taught in some of these schools in terms of the economy and American history and the American founding, and what they're teaching on governments and the environment, and so giving those parents the opportunity to find a place that maybe better aligns with what they believe to be true is really important.

As an example, that is the Paris Accord agreement, to exit that. There was tremendous pressure brought on the President to stay in that, by the way, for no good environmental reason. It was a bumper sticker. Paris was a bumper sticker. It was not about CO2 reduction. It was about penalizing our own economy. And I could give you some information about that if you’d like, but the President made a very courageous decision to exit. ",1
"In his recent Saudi Arabia speech, Trump rightly declared that, when it comes to the survival of the free world, defeating Islamist terrorism is 'history’s greatest test.'

"A chart of observed global temperatures against climate model outputs is the main evidence provided in the article. It claims that the chart blows apart the scientific basis for reducing emissions.

"But don’t be too frightened: the same governments who authorize the UN reports never take the steps needed to reduce the supposedly horrifying carbon dioxide level.

"We certainly hope that students will form an opinion, based on the way we have taught them to analyze evidence for themselves, about whether it was more likely natural fluctuation or industrial gas that caused the one degree rise in temperature from 1860 to 2000, and whether that one degree rise has led to havoc in hurricanes, droughts and sea level rise.

This implies that Earth’s temperature increases less (from the influence of CO2) than IPCC predictions, because those were based on a high climate sensitivity ascribed to CO2. ",1
"The oceans are now heading into one of their periodic phases of cooling… . Modest changes in temperature are not about to wipe them [coral] out. Neither will increased carbon dioxide, which is a fundamental chemical building block that allows coral reefs to exist at all. ",1
"Global warming was never about the science, it was about money and power. There are several different agendas in play; world governance and wealth redistribution, population control, and, of course, money. ",1
"When a climate scientist calls me a denier, or a columnist from the New York Times or the Washington Post calls me a racist, I can wear the terms with pride. Not because I am a denier or a racist, but because I know that for those individuals, calling me a name is a sign of how desperate they are. ",1
"In recent decades global temperatures have risen. Yet, our planet has been far warmer and cooler than today many times in the geologic past, including the past 10,000 years. ",1
"Despite some doom and gloom predictions, excluding waves washing onto shores by relatively rarely occurring tsunamis and storm-surges, low-lying areas on the face of our planet have NOT yet been submerged by rising oceans… so probably low-lying areas along shorelines of Canada and the USA will be SAFE into foreseeable and even distant futures.

"Since I am no longer affiliated with any organization nor receiving any funding, I can speak quite frankly….As a scientist I remain skeptical…The main basis of the claim that man’s release of greenhouse gases is the cause of the warming is based almost entirely upon climate models. We all know the frailty of models concerning the air-surface system. ",1
"…a vocal minority of scientists so mistrusts the models and the complex fragmentary data, that some claim that global warming is a hoax. They have made public statements accusing other scientists of deliberate fraud in aid of their research funding. Both sides are now hurling personal epithets at each other, a very bad development in Earth sciences. ",1
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has to provide proof for significant human-caused climate change; yet their climate models have never been validated and are rapidly diverging from actual observations.  The real threat to humanity comes not from any (trivial) greenhouse warming but from cooling periods creating food shortages and famines. ,1
"One thing is quite certain, however: Current IPCC climate models cannot explain what the observations clearly show. This makes the models unsuitable for climate prediction – and for policy purposes generally. ",1
"[U]nlike the land surface, the atmosphere has shown no warming trend, either over land or over ocean — according to satellites and independent data from weather balloons. ",1
"Climate change is a natural phenomenon. Climate keeps changing all the time. The fact that climate changes is not in itself a threat, because, obviously, in the past human beings have adapted to all kinds of climate changes. ",1
"I go back to the major error of the UN climate panel, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). They have been claiming in all their 5 major reports that CO2 increases are the cause of warming.  I am of the opinion, and have tried to back it up with publications, that these arguments don't hold water and that their evidence does not exist. ",1
"[…] That is why we must strongly oppose creating a second Kyoto in Paris in 2015 — with the active assistance of India, Japan, Australia and Canada, who all share our doubts. ",1
"The forthcoming (Sept. 2013) IPCC report claims that the reported surface warming of 1978-2000 is sure (better than 95% – by IPCC's own unsupported estimate) evidence for AGW. But the missing hotspot is sure (better than 96%, by my personal reckoning) evidence against the existence of any such warming. But before you dispose of the 2000-page-plus IPCC report, stop and consider: it makes a wonderful paper weight or door stop. ",1
"It is ironic that the attempt by two environmental activists to misrepresent my credentials [letters, Feb. 6] coincides with a sustained cold spell in the United States that set a 100-year record. As for full disclosure: My resume clearly states that I consulted for several oil companies on the subject of oil pricing, some 20 years ago, after publishing a monograph on the subject. My connection to oil during the past decade is as a Wesson Fellow at the Hoover Institution; the Wesson money derives from salad oil. ",1
"[S]ince 1979, our best measurements show that the climate has been cooling just slightly. Certainly, it has not been warming. ",1
"This conclusion is worth highlighting: It shows that sea-level rise does not depend on the use of fossil fuels. The evidence should allay fear that the release of additional CO2 will increase sea-level rise, Singer wrote. ",1
"Currently, sea-level rise does not seem to depend on ocean temperature, and certainly not on CO2. We can expect the sea to continue rising at about the present rate for the foreseeable future. […] There is nothing we can do about rising sea levels in the meantime. We’d better build dikes and sea walls a little bit higher, Singer concluded. ",1
"I do not remember seeing any review by Roger of any text by Dr. Singer before a day in February 1991 when he came to Roger's office. For quite some time Dr. Singer had been trying to get Roger to work on an article that Dr. Singer was writing for the Cosmos Club Journal.  He seemed quite anxious to get Roger's comments. […] After a series of unsuccessful attempts to get Roger to work on this document, Dr. Singer must have decided that the only way he was going to get this thing done was to come in person. ",1
"[C]limate change resulting from emissions of CO2 (and from releases of other greenhouse gases) will have an indisputably global effect, Smil wrote in a 2000 report titled Energy in the Twentieth Century in Annual Review of Energy and the Environment. ",1
"Surely, hydraulic fracturing will not invariably poison the air, will not cause spates of local mini-earthquakes, and will not produce flaming faucets in all nearby areas (the three frightening clichés advanced by its opponents) — but the activity, especially if done in thousands of hurried repetitions and sometimes without careful planning, has the potential to be often unpleasant and disruptive, and sometimes outright damaging, Smil wrote in an article at the American Enterprise Institute's publication, The American.

"Obviously, there will come a time when global oil extraction will reach its peak, but even that point may be of little practical interest as it could be followed by a prolonged, gentle decline or by an extended output plateau at a somewhat lower level than peak production. At the beginning of 2013, there are no signs that the beginning of this new oil era (regardless of its specific course) is imminent, and forecasting its onset remains an exercise in futility. Only one thing is abundantly clear to me: for the past 15 years I have been quite confident that there is no imminent danger of any sharp peak of global oil extraction followed by an inexorable production slide — and early in 2013 that confidence is greatly strengthened by new facts. Is it too much to hope that even some catastrophists and peak-oil cultists will find it impossible to ignore those numbers? Smil wrote in The American. ",1
"Public unease about safety and problems with costs, liability, and permanent storage do not make a flourishing nuclear industry impossible, but they do demonstrate the enormous influence that mistaken public risk perception can have on government policy and reveal the consistently inept bureaucratic handling of the challenge so far, Smil wrote at the American Enterprise Institute's blog, AEIdeas. ",1
"To think that the United States can install in 10 years wind and solar generating capacity equivalent to that of thermal power plants that took nearly 60 years to construct is delusional, Smil wrote in The American. ",1
"There are major costs, we've heard, of rationing energy. Yet there are no obvious gains, even if one accepts the alarmist views of global warming. No one is proposing any carbon use curtailment that would do anything meaningful to reduce the theoretical threat of carbon use. The current proposals are all pain, no gain, said Smith. ",1
"Greed is just a pejorative term for the human condition of self-interest. And it's the only thing that drives mankind to make the world better for all, said Smith. ",1
"Environmentalism poses a real and present danger to America’s future, Smith declared in his remarks.

"Environmentalism is no longer the ideology of reform, of rebellion, of revolution: it is fully co-opted as the dominant dogma of stasist conformity and control. ",1
"I believe that climate is changing and humans play a role. However, I also believe significant questions remain as to the extent. ",1
[…] Climate alarmists have failed to explain the lack of global warming over the past 15 years. They simply keep adjusting their malfunctioning climate models to push the supposedly looming disaster further into the future. ,1
"I believe climate change is due to a combination of factors, including natural cycles, sun spots and human activity. But scientists still don't know for certain how much each of these factors contributes to the overall climate change that the Earth is experiencing. ",1

It is regrettable that two state attorneys general and several organizations continue to threaten legitimate scientific debate about climate change. The attorneys general have appointed themselves to decide what is valid and invalid regarding climate change. Attorneys general are pursuing a political agenda at the expense of scientists' rights to free speech. ,1
" The president’s Paris pledge will increase electricity costs, ration energy and slow economic growth. Congress has repeatedly rejected the president’s extreme climate agenda. The president’s climate pledge is a bad deal for the American economy, the American people and would produce no substantive environmental benefits. ",1
"This week, President Obama is in Paris trying to negotiate climate change regulations. His pledge to cut U.S. carbon emissions by 28 percent in the next 10 years is an attempt to bypass Congress and the American people. But worse, his plan to get us there, the EPA’s Power Plan, will do a world of harm to Americans while doing almost nothing to impact climate change. ",1
America cannot afford to drive its economy over a cliff with the hopes that the rest of the world will make the same mistake.  The only economy the EPA’s plan will help is that of our competitors. ,1
"We now know that prominent scientists were so determined to advance the idea of human-made global warming that they worked together to hide contradictory temperature data. But for two weeks, none of the networks gave the scandal any coverage on their evening news programs. And when they finally did cover it, their reporting was largely slanted in favor of global warming alarmists. The networks have shown a steady pattern of bias on climate change. During a six-month period, four out of five network news reports failed to acknowledge any dissenting opinions about global warming, according to a Business and Media Institute study. The networks should tell Americans the truth, rather than hide the facts. ",1
"The way to address climate change is not by increasing regulations and taxes. The future lies with research and development. Forget the alarmists’ hysteria and look to technology and innovation to solve climate change challenges, Smith wrote in conclusion. ",1

"The American people should be made aware of both the negative and positive impacts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Without the whole story, how can we expect an objective evaluation of the issues involving climate change? Smith asked. He added, A higher concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere would aid photosynthesis, which in turn contributes to increased plant growth. ",1
"Alarmist predictions amount to nothing more than wild guesses, Smith began. The ability to predict far into the future is impossible. Anyone stating that they know what the climate will be in 500 years, or even at the end of this century, is not credible. He concluded his opening statements, claiming that Much of climate science today appears to be based more on exaggerations, personal agendas, and questionable predictions than on the scientific method.

As such, this is not an area of delegated legislative authority by Congress to the Executive (unless you are proposing that Congress should somehow legislatively overrule peer-reviewed scientific findings). Moreover, in none of the letters do you allege any scientific misconduct, abuse of discretion, or fraud. In sum, NOAA has provided all the information necessary for the Committee to understand the scientific process at play. You have not articulated a legitimate need for anything beyond what NOAA has already provided. ",1

Clean coal can become cleaner still. We can take even more of the pollutants out of coal and I believe we should. Clean coal, I think, is the immediate answer to Canada’s energy needs and the world’s energy needs. There are hundreds of years available of coal supplies. We shouldn’t be squandering that resource. We should be using it prudently. ",1

"My testimony will address the validity of climate model projections of global and regional temperatures used in the determination of the social cost of carbon (SCC). Three independent classes of temperature observations show that the climate models used by governments for policy guidance have warmed 2 to 3 times faster than the real climate system over the last 35 to 55 years, which is the period of greatest greenhouse gas emissions and atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Recent research suggests that the climate models are too sensitive to these emissions, and that increasing greenhouse gases do not cause as much warming and associated climate change as is commonly believed [emphasis added]. These results suggest that any SCC estimates based upon such models will be biased high. ",1

Climate science is probably one of the most extraordinarily complex areas of scientific study that anyone can undertake. The variables are numerous. Many of the variables are measurable and – and we can replicate models. Many of the variables we cannot measure them. We cannot model them but we know they're part of the climate system. And so the models are extraordinarily complicated. And therefore how certain do you feel about the competency of the model and its ability to predict the future. And it's my view that the models have become increasingly more competent because of high speed computing capabilities and just more sophisticated mathematical modelling and more data to inform the model. But at the end of it there are still a range of uncertain outcomes around these models. And every scientist I know agrees there's a range of uncertainty. And if you read that PCC-detailed report they talk about these ranges of uncertainty.  ,1

I investigated this phenomenon scientifically and found that it has nothing to do with CO2 and global warming, but that natural climate processes are responsible for it.

My work indicates that it's not been a statistically significant driver of recent climate change. […] And there is a lot of really good work being done by people like Christopher Monckton and David Legates and Willie Soon on this.  […] We don't deny that globe is warming. We just disagree as to what the cause is. ,1
"It appears that the most prudent course is to assume that the science on climate change is not settled and that, in light of numerous uncertainties, much work remains to be done. In particular, each of the ideas proposed by the skeptics must be fully assessed through careful, exhaustive research, and then either embraced or debunked on the weight of the empirical evidence, Viterito wrote. ",1
"There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gases is causing or will, in the foreseeable future, cause catastrophic heating of the Earth's atmosphere and disruption of the Earth's climate. Moreover, there is substantial scientific evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many beneficial effects upon the natural plant and animal environments of the Earth. ",1
"[…] To me, the most important takeaway from all of this is that the science is nowhere near settled. There's a tremendous amount of work that needs to be done. ",1

"In the debates about global warming, a lot of you remember that the IPCC and some of the other advocates of man-made global warming alarmist theories believe that the most dangerous of all greenhouse gases is methane, Walcher said. ",1
"The truth is that scientists advocating the theory of catastrophic manmade global warming have no idea what the weather will be like next year. Neither does anyone else. They hand out lots of charts, but none of them are based on anything but educated projections and computer models, which have already proven to be wrong in predictions they made a few years ago. So you might think a world-famous expert would be cautiously telling us to be careful about such assumptions. You would be wrong, Walcher wrote at his blog, Resources and Reality. ",1
"These monuments are different than the others in one vital respect: They were created by Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama despite the objections of the people and lawmakers who live in and around the monuments, not in response to local support.

"And you have to be willing to do that too. I think it's a really important part of the equation, and we did that in Colorado. We stopped them from putting the black-tailed prairie dog on the endangered species list with the threat of a lawsuit.

"[C]ap-and-trade is a bureaucrat’s dream. Carbon is among the most abundant natural elements, and carbon dioxide is central to all life. As MIT climate scientist Dr. Richard Lindzen wrote, 'If you control carbon, you control life.' So predictably, advocates of big central government not only want to regulate carbon and the ability to buy and sell it, they also want to tax that right, Walcher wrote in a blog post where he compared carbon pricing to selling Indulgences.

"I don't personally claim to be an expert on climate science, although I've studied it for a number of years, Walcher said. Science is very complex and public policy perhaps even more complicated. These children ought to be left alone to grow up, go to school, learn something, and gain some life experiences that might eventually, someday, qualify them to come and educate the rest of us and make public policy.

"For decades, conventional wisdom has been that America was in a state of decline. This drumbeat, repeated relentlessly, held that raw-material scarcity and resource consumption would doom America. Costs would inexorably rise and resources would become more scarce. Indeed costs did rise. But the truth is that the political class made it so. President Obama famously sought to reduce American access to natural resources, to massively raise gasoline prices and thereby reduce its use. Last night President Trump highlighted the folly of such thinking. One year of change has brought not only lower gas prices, but the president noted that the United States is now a net exporter of energy. Decades of poor policy tied up the American economic engine in reams of red tape. President Trump highlighted his efforts to free the people and unlock America’s awesome energy potential. The ultimate resource is a free people and we, the people, like it. ",1

"I would call myself what some people describe as a 'lukewarmer' in that the CO2 effect that people have done thousands of studies on is in fact real. However, it is not a crisis.

What then? Blame that on global warming and call it another Houston we have a problem moment when we get flooding in California like in 1997/1998 after that big EL Niño changed the weather pattern in a single year to drench the state?

[…] I’m asking for two things: help with content/moderating, and some donations, so that I can choose a place to go disconnect, and not worry. I don’t want a staycation, and if that darned Koch Brothers check that many Mann-like people seem to think I’m getting would just show up in the mailbox, I’d not have to ask. ",1
"Watts is using an old image of our house perhaps? We have a good-sized array deployed on our roof. Yesterday we generated 59 kWh, which more than covered our own energy use, including air-conditioning on a hot day, and thus we fed the excess back into the utility grid. ",1

The episode does nothing other than to demonstrate both the man’s lack of integrity and dullness of mind. ",1
Most of the extremist views about climate change have little or no scientific basis. The rational basis for extremist views about global warming may be a desire to push for political action on global warming. ,1
"In a Democratic Society, Published opinion and public perceptions are the main drivers for political action, not indisputable scientific facts. Cases and point are the European Union's Climate Change Strategy of 10 January 2007 and the Green Package of 23 January, 2008, but also some regional activities in the US and proposed action by US legislative bodies. Those Policies and proposals have been justified by the extremist view on climate change. ",1

You can make a strong case that all this ‘denial’ has been good for climate science. Some of these ‘deniers’ actually found that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s supreme icon – the ‘hockey stick’ graph showing a recent alarming rise in global temperature – was wrong. Then they pointed out that the global annual average surface temperature was not rising as predicted. ,1
"If we have not passed it already, we are on the threshold of global observations becoming incompatible with the consensus theory of climate change. If the standstill (lower temperatures) continues for a few more years, it will mean that no one who has just reached adulthood, or younger, will have witnessed the Earth get warmer during their lifetime. ",1
"The bottom line is that the recent global temperature standstill is a real event. It is explained in a hand-waving way as due to natural climatic variations masking the long-term trend, even if we do not understand those natural variations. ",1
"We are reaching the point where the temperature standstill is becoming the major feature of the recent global warm period that began in 1980. In brief, the global temperature has remained constant for longer than it has increased. ",1
"It does seem that the sea ice is returning to 'average' after the record lows of 2007 and 2008. There has been a definite recovery trend since then, so far from being a progression towards ice free summers it seems that it was a temporary dip. The recent observations do make the 2007 projections that the region would be ice free by 2013 look very unrealistic. Given what is happening only the foolish would look many years into the future and predict ice free summers now. ",1
"Referring to professor Muller's Berkely Earth Surface Temperature Project, The Best project's treatment of science and of the public has been shoddy.

It deserves better. ",1
Reporting the consensus about climate change … is not synonymous with good science reporting. The BBC is at an important point. It has been narrow minded about climate change for many years and they have become at the very least a cliché and at worst lampooned as being predictable and biased by a public that doesn't believe them anymore. ,1

Because of the economic inferiority of solar energy, cap and trade legislation is necessary to handicap coal energy in order to make solar energy viable in the competitive marketplace.

"The global warming scam has nothing to do with the science behind global warming. It has everything to do with the economics.

"Even if the U.S. implemented a carbon cap, worldwide carbon emissions may not be reduced; instead, the likely outcome is that carbon emissions will be simply redistributed from the U.S. to places like China and India.

In fact, to the extent that the industrialized countries use cleaner technologies, the regulations could actually have a net negative impact on the environment. ",1
"These big government policies haven’t been shown to be more effective in reducing emissions. Ohio and West Virginia show that you don’t have to impose new taxes, create big government programs, or increase energy burdens to cut emissions.

"The problem is that the earth is very large and the temperature is always changing, everywhere, so how can we possibly tell if overall it is a mere half-degree warmer today than it was around 1902? The origin of the theory of global warming (for it is just a theory) lies in taking the thermometer readings we happen to have from the last 100 years and massaging them in various ways. Some places have clearly warmed, others have clearly cooled. Many have gone up and down but with little apparent trend. To get a global result requires a lot of statistical manipulation. […] even if the earth has warmed a little bit there is still the very real possibility that this warming is natural, that the models are no good, that warming is beneficial, etc. Wojick wrote in A skeptic's guide to global warming at the National Post .

"The evidence strongly suggests that humans have had an influence on higher CO2. However, the evidence is equally as strong that there are other factors, such as rising ocean temperatures, that have a greater influence. ",1
"'I’m not a climate scientist expert, but I can tell you I will become a lot more familiar with it, he added. And it will be based on objective science. ",1
"Interior should not be in the business of being an adversary. We should be in the business of being a partner, Zinke said to the audience, which included leaders of energy companies and oil-producing countries. [30], ",1
"Spread out over the life cycle of a typical turbine, scientists estimate that the typical wind plant generates between .02 and .04 pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilowatt-hour of electricity produced. Even at the high end, that's less than 3 percent of the emissions from coal-generated electricity and less than 7 percent of the emissions from natural gas-generated electricity. ",1
"The revoked order would have stopped the needless, incidental poisoning of wild animals by toxic lead ammunition and fishing tackle on more than 150 million acres managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Wayne Pacelle, president and CEO of The Humane Society of the United States told HuffPost. ",1
"Ben Zycher was one of their later recruits, and his role was mainly to provide help in convincing other economist that the ultra-libertarian version of free-market economics applied to the health industries, and that cigarettes should not be regulated in any special way. […] He appears to have shifted to the Cato Institute which also did contract tobacco industry lobbying work, SourceWatch reported. ",1
"Almost all of the climate models have overestimated the recent temperature record. Global temperatures appear to be on a long-term upward trajectory, but the degree to which that trend is anthropogenic is far from clear […] ",1
"But the temperature records are not consistent with a looming crisis view. Atmospheric temperatures have been roughly flat since 2002, Zycher wrote at Investor's Business Daily. ",1
"The constant warnings about the adverse impacts of increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, apart from being utterly inconsistent with the evidence, are similar to the ancient interpretation of destructive weather as the gods’ punishment of men for the sins of Man, Zycher wrote at AEI. ",1
"Since the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol, the satellite temperature record essentially has been flat, Zycher claimed at AEI, citing charts by Roy Spencer for support. ",1
"In reality, the Canadian oil will be produced, and the only questions are where it will be refined and at what higher cost, Zycher wrote at AEI. ",1
"[T]he divestment campaign, perhaps realizing it and perhaps not, has slipped into the anti-human trap that is the hidden but essential core of modern environmentalism: Far from being a resource, ordinary people are a scourge on the planet, he wrote. ",1
"With respect to the effects of greenhouse gas concentrations, the evidence suggests that increases in extreme weather events have not happened despite the predictions of many. ",1
There is no long-term trend in sea-level increases correlated with atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. ,1
"There has been no temperature trend over the last 15 or so years despite increasing atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (GHG), Zycher wrote at AEI, linking to data from climate change denier Roy Spencer. ",1
"There is nothing 'clean' about it. There is heavy-metal pollution created by the production process for wind turbines. There are noise and flicker effects of wind turbines. There is the large problem of solar-panel waste. There is wildlife destruction caused by the production of renewable power. There is massive and unsightly land use made necessary by the unconcentrated nature of renewable energy, Zycher wrote at National Review. ",1
"And above all: There is the increase – yes, increase – in the emissions of conventional effluents caused by the up-and-down cycling of the conventional backup generation units needed to avoid blackouts caused by the unreliability of wind and solar power, Zycher wrote. ",1
Earth Day is a classic religious holiday: The interpretation of destructive weather as the gods’ punishment of men for the sins of Man is ancient. ,1
"Tens or hundreds of millions of the world’s poor have died from malaria as a direct result of the multination ban on DDT use, driven by deeply disingenuous propaganda on its harmful effects on various bird species, vastly exaggerated on Earth Days past. This indifference to the death toll among the least fortunate is strangely reminiscent of Joseph Stalin’s view of the difference between one death and millions; and it is no accident, as Pravda used to put it, that the modern Earth Day mindset reflects that of the original.

"As Mussolini might have put it: All within the climate crusade, nothing outside the climate crusade, nothing against the climate crusade. Thus has the climate industry evolved into a totalitarian ideology happy to crush the preferences of ordinary people, Zycher wrote at AEI. ",1
"The description of carbon dioxide — the most important anthropogenic (manmade) greenhouse gas (GHG) — as 'air pollution' is political propaganda. Carbon dioxide is a colorless, odorless gas a certain minimum atmospheric concentration of which is necessary for life itself. It is not a 'pollutant,' and it certainly is not 'carbon' or 'carbon pollution,' the propaganda terms used more frequently in the debate over climate policy, Zycher wrote. ",1
"If science is to affect policymaking, an inherently political undertaking, research conducted or funded by government cannot be separated from politics, Zycher wrote at AEI. ",1
"Put aside that neither the Clean Power Plan nor the administration’s larger climate policy would have a measurable effect on temperatures. The reality is that the plan is so inflexible and costly that states heavily dependent on coal power will suffer an artificial competitive disadvantage, and will be forced to join regional cap-and-trade emissions trading systems. Since those states disproportionately are red ones—Mississippi, North Dakota and Texas, for example—the dominant effect will be payments for emissions credits from red states to blue ones, Zycher wrote. ",1
"The clear objective of the anti-smoking groups is economic rent, that is, the ability to obtain revenue and political power from the smoking issue, Zycher wrote in a paper prepared for presentation at the Western Economic Association's annual meeting in San Diego, California. ",1
"The debate over the effects of greenhouse emissions and policies to address them is intense, and the Trump administration clearly intends to moderate and reverse many of the regulatory initiatives the Obama administration implemented. One policy discussed broadly is a carbon tax on greenhouse gas emissions, as a substitute for the regulatory approach or as a component of a larger tax reform intended to reduce the taxation of capital, often advocated as a revenue-neutral tax shift, the event description read.
