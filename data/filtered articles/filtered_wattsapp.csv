" Guest essay by Eric Worrall h/t Dr. Willie Soon – Swedish climate messiah Greta Thunberg has a problem. She desperately wants to attend climate conferences in New York (September) and Santiago (December), but unlike most greens she is serious about avoiding air travel. How do you cross the Atlantic Ocean without flying?  I’ve got a few ideas, but I doubt arriving by luxury transatlantic cruise liner is quite the down to earth minimalist image Greta wants to project.  Some of Greta’s fans have suggested telecommuting, but if this was a solution surely all greens would be telecommuting to climate conferences, instead of scarring their personal consciences with distasteful but ecologically necessary air travel. I’m sure you are all as keen to help as I am. Perhaps we can all pitch in, help little Greta figure out how to attend those crucial climate conferences in far flung locations, without compromising those heartfelt climate principles which have attracted so much global media attention.",1
" I’ve been able to take some much needed time-off, thanks to Charles Rotter aka “Charles the Moderator”, but I wanted to say how much I appreciate this opportunity to reach around the world with our message, and to touch lives. I’ve been given a great gift. I also wish to thank Kip Hansen, who was instrumental in me getting back on my feet by helping my employees recover after the devastating #campfire. I very nearly lost my business due to the fallout. Thanks to everyone who helped. The situation is slowly turning around now, and I have hope. In 2019, there are going to be some changes, good changes (though some may not see it that way) and I hope to rejoin daily operations. Look for some announcements soon. In the mean time, I appreciate you all; the readers, the moderators, the guest contributors, and even my detractors, because you fuel my fire. I wish you all a Merry Christmas, wherever you are, and a happy and prosperous new year in 2019.- Anthony  h/t to Raphael Telis for the graphic",1
" “We suspect you won’t hear too much about this from the liberal mainstream media, or the environmental movement, or even Al Gore,” says zerohedge.com. “But, according to the  latest energy report from The Energy Information Administration (EIA), under President Trump, per-capita carbon dioxide emissions are now the lowest they’ve been in nearly seven decades.”  Even more interesting is the fact that US carbon emissions dropped while emissions from energy consumption for the rest of the world increased by 1.6%, after little or no growth for the three years from 2014 to 2016. https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-07-08/co2-emissions-hit-67-year-low-trumps-america-rest-world-rises The U.S. emitted 15.6 metric tons of CO2 per person in 1950. After rising for decades, it’s declined in recent years to 15.8 metric tons per person in 2017, the lowest measured levels in 67 years.

 Guest essay by Larry Hamlin The Los Angeles Times is at it again hyping anti science climate alarmist propaganda trying to conceal the global wide Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age that are supported and justified by hundreds of scientific studies.  This climate alarmist propaganda Times article cites a new “study” that ridiculously attempts to deny these clearly established warm and cool periods in our past. This alarmist hyped new “study” is addressed in a superb article at the JoNova website demonstrating the complete lack of scientific veracity of this studies claims.  There is nothing I can add to show how politically contrived and inane the claims are from this new “study” beyond the excellent presentation in the JoNova article. Provided below are excerpts from this excellent article which demonstrate the lack of scientific credibility of the new “study” as well as the politically driven anti science climate alarmism bias of the Times.            Nothing else needs to be said.,1
" Wow, this is really something. Three days after a declaration about “faking climate science” to be “more emphatic” Not a peep from NASA GISS head Gavin Schmidt. That’s a troubling omission of condemnation, especially since both sides of the climate debate should be condemning this. Science is no place for “faking graphs”. Period. Here’s the screencap:  And here is the link to the Twitter thread: https://mobile.twitter.com/o_glyndwr1404/status/982373647905062917 I’ve said before (after the OIG report slammed them) that NASA GISS is wasteful and redundant, and should be closed. Now it appears they may be under mendacious leadership as well. h/t to Dave Burton. UPDATE: For those that say Gavin shouldn’t bother, etc. there’s this:  “Silence is an advocacy practice,” declared Gavin Schmidt, head of NASA’s climate division, when he spoke at the annual Australian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society conference in February this year.
