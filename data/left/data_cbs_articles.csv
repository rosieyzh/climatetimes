    ","¶Oil and gas companies may face far looser oversight of emissions of potent climate-changing methane gas under a proposal expected from the Trump administration as soon as Thursday, oil industry and environmental groups said.¶The government's plan would ease requirements on oil and gas sites to monitor for methane leaks and plug them. But not all energy companies are in support of the plan, with Shell U.S. President Gretchen Watkins telling the Washington Post on Thursday that it supports national limits on methane.¶The Environmental Protection Agency's move would be the latest in a series by the administration easing Obama-era emissions controls on the oil, gas and coal industries, including for methane.¶More in Climate Change¶Methane is a component of natural gas that's frequently wasted through leaks or intentional releases during drilling operations. The gas is considered a more potent contributor to climate change than carbon dioxide, although it occurs in smaller volumes.¶Under President Trump, both the Interior Department and the EPA have proposed a series of rules — some blocked by courts — to loosen regulations of methane emissions.¶Environmental advocates expected the new methane plan to go further than previous proposals, with a goal of exempting companies from requirements to detect and stop methane leaks at existing oil and gas sites.¶For the EPA, part of the goal is ""they want to get rid of direct regulation of methane,"" said Matt Watson, a vice president of the energy program at the Environmental Defense Fund, an advocacy group.¶Other environmental activists expressed their concerns with the proposal, such as environmentalist and 350.org founder Bill McKibben, who wrote on Twitter, ""The fracking boom is spewing clouds of methane, it's a huge driver of climate change, and now we're going to drop the (minimal) regulation we've had in place.""¶This is literally insane. The fracking boom is spewing clouds of methane, it's a huge driver of climate change, and now we're going to drop the (minimal) regulation we've had in place. Trump and his buddies are pure nihilists. https://t.co/pi9GmEfoHf¶The oil and gas industry is the nation's primary source of methane emissions, according to the EPA, accounting for nearly one-third in 2016.¶The administration rollbacks on emissions from oilfields, storage sites and pipelines have split the oil industry, worrying some in the industry about growing blowback in a world increasingly mindful of climate change.¶Shell U.S. told the Washington Post it would continue to work toward its goal of reducing its methane leaks to less than 0.2 percent by 2025.¶""We believe sound environmental policies are foundational to the vital role natural gas can play in the energy transition and have made clear our support of 2016 law to regulate methane from new and modified onshore sources,"" Shell's Watkins told the publication. ""Despite the administration's proposal to no longer regulate methane, Shell's U.S. assets will continue to contribute to that global target.""¶Royal Dutch Shell this year urged the administration to crack down — not ease up — on the emissions. Many others in the oil and industry have welcomed the easing, however.¶The latest rollback ""highlights the Trump administration's complete contempt for our climate,"" Kassie Siegel of the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group, said in a statement. ""The EPA is now so determined to actually increase greenhouse pollution that it's even shrugging off concerns from oil and gas companies about gutting these protections.""",0

    ","¶The world's largest hotel chain is working to reduce its environmental impact. Marriott International will eliminate small plastic toiletry bottles by December 2020, the company announced Wednesday. ¶Marriott, which operates more than 7,000 hotels worldwide, plans to replace all of its single-use bottles of shampoo, conditioner and bath gel with larger pump bottles in hotel rooms globally, the company said in a press release. ¶The announcement echoes initiatives by Holiday Inn and its parent company, InterContinental Hotels, which announced a plan last month to ditch its tiny toiletries in more than 5,600 hotels by 2021. Last year, Walt Disney Co. also pledged to reduce plastic in guest rooms by 80 percent through switching to refillable toiletries in hotels and on cruise ships. ¶More in Climate Change¶Marriott said over 1,000 of its properties across North America have already made the switch. The aim is to prevent about 500 million plastic bottles — about 1.7 million pounds of plastic — from entering landfills annually. According to the hotel chain, that's a 30 percent annual reduction. ¶When fully implemented, Marriott International’s expanded toiletry program is expected to prevent about 500 million tiny bottles annually from going to landfills; that’s about 1.7 million pounds of plastic, a 30% annual reduction from current amenity plastic usage. #Serve360 pic.twitter.com/PQAUdV6Rx8¶""This is our second global initiative aimed at reducing single-use plastics in just over a year, which underscores how important we believe it is to continuously find ways to reduce our hotels' environmental impact,"" said Arne Sorenson, president and CEO of Marriott International. ""It's a huge priority for us."" ¶The hotel chain said one of its large, pump-topped bottles contains the same amount of product as 10 to 12 tiny, single-use bottles, most of which are never recycled. ¶Hotel chains around the world may soon be forced to follow suit. Lawmakers in California are considering banning hotels from using small shampoo bottles in 2023, while the European Union is banning a wide range of single-use plastic items, like cutlery and plates, by 2021, the Associated Press reports. ¶Despite global efforts to curb the problem, plastic use is expected to increase through the next decade as oil and gas companies double down on petrochemicals production. Many environmental activists say the U.S. should halt plastics production altogether.¶Scientists have warned about the increasing dangers of plastic waste in our oceans, in part because plastic trash gets into the marine food chain. Recycling is only a partial solution because most products cannot be recycled, and plastic takes hundreds of years to decompose.¶Large amounts of discarded plastics have been found in dead sea animals around the world in recent years. Most recently, a beloved dugong whose rescue went viral in Thailand later died with a stomach full of plastic waste. ",0

            Greta Thunberg set to arrive in New York City after sailing across Atlantic in zero-emissions yacht - CBS News
    ",CBS News,"August 28, 2019, 10:25 AM","¶A flight to New York would've taken just eight hours, but Greta Thunberg wanted to prove a point on her two-week journey across the ocean. The teenage activist is sailing across the Atlantic as part of her campaign to highlight the need for action on climate change, and her voyage is almost complete.¶Thunberg set sail from England two weeks ago aboard a zero-emissions yacht. When she arrives, the 16-year-old will be attending two climate summits at the United Nations and wants to raise awareness about environmental issues. Thunberg refused to fly to New York because of the carbon footprint of traveling by plane. Instead, she chose to sail about 3,000 miles. ¶Earlier Wednesday morning she tweeted that she can see the lights of New York, but won't actually touch shore until later this afternoon.¶Land!! The lights of Long Island and New York City ahead. pic.twitter.com/OtDyQOWtF5¶""What I am concerned about is whether we will do something or not, whether the people in power will react and act with necessary force,"" Thunberg said before setting sail.¶Gale-force winds meant it wasn't plain sailing to get to the United States. The 60-foot racing yacht, powered by underwater turbines and solar panels, was hit by heavy seas, but Thunberg made it across the Atlantic without raising carbon emissions. ¶Conditions on board included no showers and little privacy, but that didn't stop Thunberg from celebrating the one-year anniversary of the start of her climate change movement.¶She began striking alone outside the Swedish parliament last August, and soon students around the world began walking out of school too, demanding action from their governments.¶Thunberg became the unlikely leader of a global youth movement. She's been called ""the voice of the planet,"" and has even been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. ¶""I want you to act as if the house is on fire, because it is,"" Thunberg said while addressing the World Economic Forum at Davos in January.¶Earlier this month, she told CBS News that it's time to see if leaders in the U.S. and globally are really listening.¶""They say they're listening to us, and now it is up to them to prove if they have listened,"" Thunberg said.¶While she's here in the U.S., Greta will attend two global climate strikes in addition to the U.N. summits. It's still unclear how she plans to eventually travel back home.",0

            Thousands of new wildfires burn across the Amazon - CBS News
    ",CBS/AP,"August 26, 2019, 12:09 PM","¶Smoke thick enough to nearly shield the sun is blanketing parts of the Amazon as flames ravage the forest beneath. Nearly 10,000 new fires have been reported in a little over a week.¶Many are believed to be intentionally set by farmers clearing land, as Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has relaxed environmental laws to promote economic expansion in the rainforest.¶""This year we had more devastation, more deforestation so the livestock can come,"" said Jarlene Gomes, a researcher who promotes sustainable farming. Referring to the downed trees, she said, ""So they have to take this mass and do something with that. And the easiest way is to burn it.""¶The Associated Press reports that Brazil's federal police agency is investigating reports that farmers in the state of Para had called for ""a day of fire"" earlier this month. More than 77,000 fires in the Amazon have been recorded so far this year, according to the country's satellite monitoring agency — 10,000 more in a little over a week.¶Reporting from Rio Branco, Brazil, CBS News correspondent Manuel Bojorquez witnessed a spot fire erupt just a few minutes earlier on the side of the road. The flames quickly spread, devouring shrubbery and trees. ¶Bojorquez also visited a field where a fire had erupted yesterday. The flames quickly spread; within a half-hour, there was nothing left. ¶On Friday, President Bolsonaro announced he is sending 44,000 army troops to help battle the flames, but only after facing protests from the public and pressure from critics of his policies.¶Bojorquez asked Gomes, ""Do you think we're at the tipping point where the Amazon may not be able to recover?""¶""We think that the risk is too big,"" Gomes replied. ""I mean, it's too great to take on. Because when fire hits the forest, we have no way to control it.""¶What's at stake affects everyone: the Amazon produces a substantial amount of the world's oxygen. It also stores carbon, yet the amount of carbon that the rainforest is taking from the atmosphere has been lessened in recent years by deforestation. Scientists are afraid that that balance could be changing, speeding up climate change. ¶At the G-7 summit, leaders of member countries were nearing an agreement on how to help Brazil battle the fires and repair the damage.¶
                                                            A record number of fires have devastated the Amazon rainforest in Brazil and neighboring countries
                                                    ¶""Of course (this is) Brazilian territory, but we have a question here of the rainforests that is really a global question,"" said German Chancellor Angela Merkel. ""The lung of our whole Earth is affected, and so we must find common solutions.""¶There is some help from the U.S., including a 747 supertanker, now in Bolivia, which can hold up to roughly 19,000 gallons of water per trip.¶Back in Brazil, the fires are also threatening homes. Desperation drove one family to use a pail of water as they waited for a pump to start pushing water through a hose — trying their best just to keep the fire away from the houses.¶Their efforts only highlight how unstoppable the flames can be.",0

    ","¶Leonardo DiCaprio's new environmental foundation, Earth Alliance, has made an initial pledge of $5 million to help fight the raging fires devastating the Amazon rainforest. The Oscar-winner's organization, which made the announcement over the weekend, addresses urgent threats against the planet. ¶After Brazil's space research center INPE identified a record-breaking surge in fires in the iconic rainforest this summer, outrage and concern have grown across the world. The massive Amazon rainforest, known as the ""lungs of the planet,"" is the most biodiverse ecosystem on earth. Many organizations have stepped up to help provide aid to the affection region and its indigenous population, including Earth Alliance, which launched the Amazon Forest Fund on Sunday. ¶The fund will focus on ""providing critical resources for indigenous communities and local partners working to protect the life-sustaining biodiversity of the Amazon against the surge of wildfires burning across the region,"" according to Earth Alliance. It says the donations will be distributed directly to local partners and the indigenous communities protecting the Amazon. ¶ #EarthAlliance, launched in July by @LeonardoDiCaprio, Laurene Powell Jobs, and Brian Sheth, has formed an emergency Amazon Forest Fund with a commitment of $5 million dollars to focus critical resources for indigenous communities and other local partners working to protect the life-sustaining biodiversity of the Amazon against the surge of fires currently burning across the region.  Join Us.  100 percent of your donation will go to partners who are working on the ground to protect the Amazon.  Earth Alliance is committed to helping protect the natural world.

Bolsonaro's policies have emboldened farmers and ranchers to clear more land in the rainforest for agriculture, speeding up the rate of deforestation.¶Facing public pressure over the fires, Bolsonaro authorized Brazil's armed forces to aid firefighting efforts, saying he's committed to protecting the Amazon region. However, conservationist Paul Rosolie told ""CBS This Morning"" that military action isn't enough and said the Amazon is at risk of ""collapsing.""¶""As we chop more of the rainforest down — and this has been going on for decades, this is not an isolated issue — as we chop more of the rainforest, what we're risking is reaching a tipping point, where that moisture system might be too dry to produce the rain. And then you have a serious problem on your hands, because you're talking about the entire Amazon sort of collapsing,"" Rosolie explained.¶Earth Alliance also warns that destruction of the Amazon rainforest releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, diminishing an ecosystem that absorbs millions of tons of carbon emissions every year and is one of the planet's best defenses against the climate crisis.

            New seeds may help cotton farmers in face of drought, climate change - CBS News
    ",CBS News,"August 26, 2019, 9:39 AM","¶The U.S. is the world's leading cotton exporter, with an industry estimated to generate more than $21 billion of products and services a year. Drought and climate change are having an effect on the crop, though. So scientists in Boston are growing cotton in labs to develop new ways to reduce environmental stress.¶""Virtually every major crop in the U.S. and around the world is at significant risk to climate change, and cotton is no exception to that,"" Geoffrey Von Maltzahn said.¶Von Maltzahn and his team at a startup called Indigo say they've developed a breakthrough: drought-resistant seeds.¶""Water stress and drought in cotton is the most important stress in agriculture that has almost no solutions today,"" Von Maltzahn said. ""Remarkably, nature has found a whole bunch of solutions to that in the microbiome.""¶Think of a microbiome as a plant's gut filled with tiny microbes. Indigo discovered which ones from within a cotton plant deal with water stress. They then coat the seeds with those specific microbes, to make them more resilient in dry conditions. ¶""It's allowed us to grow cotton that is better able to withstand the stress that a plant experiences with a given amount of water restriction,"" Von Maltzahn said. They say their methodology is more natural than genetically-modified, mass-produced seeds. The plants are exposed to scorching temperatures in grow rooms and then tested in the hot fields.¶More than a century and a half ago, cotton dominated agriculture in the American South, first picked by generations of slaves and then share-croppers. But many farmers have abandoned cotton because of low profits and challenging conditions. ¶Modern-day cotton farming continues in states like Texas, but dry and hot weather has pushed farmers to get creative. ¶""We were looking for any way to find an edge,"" said Stetson Hogue, whose family has been growing cotton for generations.¶The Hogues have one of the few cotton farms in Lubbock, Texas, to survive a 4-year drought that started in 2011.¶""We've definitely lost a few growers in the last few years,"" Hogue said. ""And I would say that certainly has more to do with the whole economics of farming, the whole environment that we're dealing with.""¶ Like many farmers, Hogue believes the droughts he's experienced are part of normal weather trends, not the result of climate change. ""We are used to the drought here,"" Hogue told CBS News' Adriana Diaz. ""It's just something that we've always had to deal with. Our weather is always changing year in and year out, and we don't expect that to change any time soon.""¶Still, he wants seeds that can perform better in dry conditions to provide a much needed lift to profits. ¶""My grandad, 30-40 years ago, could buy a new tractor for $20,000,"" Hogue said. ""A new tractor today costs $200,000. So we're selling our cotton today for 70 to 75 cents, he sold his cotton for 70 to 75 cents, so obviously there's a big gap there and it's been a challenge. But for many cotton farms, this innovation came too late. Over the last few years, some cotton growers in the area have shut down completely. Others have diversified into other crops that can better survive dry conditions, like grapes. ""This land has been cotton, historically, for the last 60 years,"" Katy Jane Seaton said. ""One-hundred percent of it. And we changed our minds and decided to take a chance with a vineyard here."" In 2015, with her cotton yields declining, Seaton poured her efforts into wine-making, since grapes are more resistant to drought. ¶""There is much more vitality in growing grapes. If you can keep them alive you are not beholden to the marketplace,"" Seaton said. That marketplace is sure to keep changing as the Earth gets hotter, which means more demand for seeds that can thrive in our warmer world. ¶You may wonder how the higher cost of producing cotton will impact U.S. consumers, and the farmers say it won't. While the cost of producing cotton keeps increasing, they are the ones who bear the brunt of it.",0

    ","¶Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has fired back at critics around the world who are outraged by the fires raging across the Amazon rainforest. He called the global alarm ""sensationalist"" and warned foreign governments not to meddle in the territory. ¶Bolsonaro, a right-wing populist, has dismissed protections for the Amazon rainforest — a vast ecosystem known as the ""lungs of the planet"" — as a barrier to economic development. Since taking office in January, he has encouraged farmers, ranchers and loggers to clear land in the Amazon, speeding up the rate of deforestation and encroaching on the land of indigenous peoples.¶Environmentalists say humans are the root cause of these Amazon fires — many were deliberately set to clear the forest for large-scale agriculture, though wind and heat helped them spread. Now, the Brazilian government is defending itself as activists and political leaders around the world are seeking urgent action. ¶More in Climate Change¶On Thursday, French President Emmanuel Macron called the fires an ""international crisis"" and urged leaders at the G-7 summit to prioritize the fires during their discussions in France this weekend. ¶""Our house is burning,"" Macron tweeted. ""Literally. The Amazon rain forest — the lungs which produces 20% of our planet's oxygen — is on fire.""¶Our house is burning. Literally.

Members of the G7 Summit, let's discuss this emergency first order in two days! #ActForTheAmazon pic.twitter.com/dogOJj9big¶Bolsonaro responded to the criticism on Twitter. ""I regret that Macron seeks to make personal political gains in an internal matter for Brazil and other Amazonian countries,"" he wrote. ""The sensationalist tone he used does nothing to solve the problem.""¶Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau supported Macron's plea, tweeting: ""We need to #ActForTheAmazon & act for our planet — our kids & grandkids are counting on us."" But climate skeptics attending the summit — including President Donald Trump and U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson — may not agree. ¶Bolsonaro also accused Macron of a ""colonialist"" mindset for attempting to bring the issue to the forefront of the summit. Brazil is not a member of the G-7, nor are other Amazonian nations like Bolivia or Peru. ¶""These countries that send money here, they don't send it out of charity ... They send it with the aim of interfering with our sovereignty,"" Bolsonaro said Thursday, Reuters reported. Other Brazilian officials have accused media outlets and foreign leaders of exaggerating the devastation for personal gain. ¶However, Bolsonaro admitted that Brazil does not have the resources to fight the fire on its own. He said Friday that he might send in the military to help battle the flames.¶""The Amazon is bigger than Europe, how will you fight criminal fires in such an area?"" he said, according to Reuters. ""We do not have the resources for that.""¶Earlier this week, Bolsonaro suggested, without any evidence, that nonprofit groups may have set the fires themselves in an act of retaliation. He admitted Thursday that farmers could in fact be to blame for the increase in fires. ¶""The unprecedented fires ravaging the Amazon are an international tragedy and a dangerous contribution to climate chaos,"" Amazon Watch program director Christian Poirier said in a statement. ""This devastation is directly related to President Bolsonaro's anti-environmental rhetoric, which erroneously frames forest protections and human rights as impediments to Brazil's economic growth.""¶Brazil is struggling economically, and the potential provided by Amazonian land has grown more alluring, despite warnings from scientists about the dangers of deforestation. The Amazon, which covers more than 2 million square miles across nine South American countries, is the largest rainforest in the world. It produces a significant amount of Earth's oxygen and is considered vital to combating climate change. ¶There is also growing concern for indigenous peoples living in the region, and the effect the wildfires will have on their homes. Balsonaro recently shifted authority over indigenous peoples from the government's official indigenous rights agency to the agriculture ministry, which could significantly impact their long-term protections. ¶Major environmental organizations are seeking donations of any amount to assist in their efforts to protect the Amazon.",0

But it's expected to be an above-average hurricane season, which is bad news for Native Americans on a small island off the Louisiana coast. Rising waters are swallowing up their island, making them some of America's first climate refugees.¶Shrimper Steve Billiot is a member of the Houma Nation. For almost two centuries, his people have fished, hunted and farmed on and around Isle de Jean Charles.

    ","¶On Monday afternoon, the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil, went dark — but it wasn't some strange cosmic event. Powerful winds carried the smoke from forest fires burning nearly 1,700 miles away, reported the BBC. Almost 73,000 fires have been detected by Brazil's space research center INPE, according to Reuters. It's a record number this year, the agency said.¶The smoke has traveled from the fires blazing in the Brazilian states of Rondônia and Amazonas and blackened the sky above the city for about an hour, the BBC added.¶""It was as if the day had turned into night,"" resident Gianvitor Dias told the BBC. ""Everyone here commented, because even on rainy days it doesn't usually get that dark. It was very impressive.""¶And it wasn't just the city's residents who saw the smoke. NASA captured images of forest fire plumes from space last week. ¶More in Climate Change¶The agency posted satellite photos of multiple fires tearing through the Brazilian states of Amazonas, Rondônia, Pará and Mato Grosso dated August 11 and 13 of this year. Smoke appeared to blanket the states in the startling images.¶The agency stated fires are rare in the Amazon region for much of the year, as its wet weather keeps blazes at bay; fires do typically increase in July and August with the onset of the dry season. NASA explained ""activity"" peaks by early September and stops by mid-November. ¶NASA said the satellite observations revealed the ""total fire activity in the Amazon basin"" was slightly below average, compared to the past 15 years.¶The state of Amazonas declared a national emergency earlier this month due to the fires. It is the fourth most affected area in Brazil this summer, reports Euronews.¶The fires blaze as the concern for the future of the Amazon is high. Since taking office in January, Brazil's right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro has been accused of harming the Amazon rainforest and indigenous peoples in order to benefit loggers, miners and farmers who helped get him elected.¶Bolsonaro, whose anti-environment rhetoric has included a pledge to end ""Shiite ecologist activism,"" has questioned the latest official figures showing deforestation increased 88% in June compared with the same period last year.

Hedge funds are making millions off Europe's killer heat waves,"

    ","¶Hedge funds have made hundreds of millions of dollars betting on climate change and higher temperatures, particularly in Europe, as heat waves across the continent this summer have turned deadly, killing 400 people in a single week in the Netherlands alone.¶One of the biggest winners is Northlander Commodities Advisors, a U.K. fund with strong ties to the U.S. Northlander was co-founded by Harry Arora, a former Enron trader who ran for a Connecticut House of Representatives seat last year (and lost by a wide margin). Aurora's Northlander has made as much as $125 million for it and its investors on the firm's climate bets. The fund, which rose 53% in 2018, manages around $500 million, about double what it did a year ago.¶Another fund, Autonomy Capital, which is based in New York and has $5.5 billion in assets, has also reportedly been ramping up its bet on carbon-emissions credits—the same climate-influenced market that Northlander has profited from.¶More in Climate Change¶Northlander and Autonomy Capital did not return calls for comment.¶Carbon-emission credits, which are distributed by governments to utilities, manufacturers and others in an effort to cut greenhouses gases, have soared in price in recent months. Utilities and others can use the credits, which they are required to have to burn fossil fuels in their power plants, or sell them to other manufacturers.¶Rising prices have drawn in hedge funds and other speculators looking to make money by holding the credits before passing them along to an end user. Wall Street firms Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have been beefing up their trading operations in this area as well.¶In the European Union, where the market for the carbon credits (called European Emissions Allowances) is the most established, prices rose 60% starting in March this year. The credits peaked at around $33 per ton of carbon gasses in late July. And that was after rising more than 100% in a similar period last year. All told, the credits are up 350% in the past three years. California and a number of East Coast states in the U.S. also have carbon markets, but they are much smaller than the EU's system.¶Warmer weather is part of what is driving up the price of emission. Paris shattered records when temperatures soared to nearly 109 degrees in late July. Cities across Europe, even as far north as Amsterdam, rose into the mid-90s. That has caused more Europeans to reach for air conditioners, driving increased electricity usage. Others point to a move by the EU in 2017 to cut back the number of emissions credits handed out. Prices, which had been flat for years, began rising shortly thereafter.¶The credits have stirred controversy before. Some believed that traditional polluters would see windfall profits. Lax computer security made carbon-trading systems a favorite target for hackers. The fact that hedge funds are now profiting from a rise in prices likely won't help the emission credit's reputation either, even though their participation is partly by design.¶The carbon-emissions trading market is supposed to cut pollution by driving up the price of emissions as more fossil fuel is burned. And it is working. A 2016 MIT study found that the EU emission-credit trading system has resulted in a significant reduction in greenhouse gases even as the European economy was in recovery mode. Hedge funds and other speculators help drive up prices faster and hopefully reduce pollution even more. Proponents of carbon trading say hedge funds eventually have to sell to make money — and the holders of those credits, likely other hedge funds, will have to swallow the losses as well.¶The fact that hedge funds, like undertakers and doctors, may profit from unsavory events doesn't necessarily make those profits wrong. Still, that hedge funds are making money hoarding the carbon-emissions credits and driving up the cost of electricity at a time when Europeans need it to keep cool is likely to burn more than few.

""So a billion tons of ice lost here in Greenland means higher sea levels in Florida, California, New York, even as far as Australia.""¶So far, OMG's missions have shown how sensitive glaciers are to the ocean. And they've also produced a better map of the sea floor, allowing them to gauge which glaciers are threatened. The answer: more than they thought.",0

    ","¶Mercury levels in the seafood supply are on the rise, and climate change and overfishing are partially to blame, according to a new study. Scientists said mercury levels in the oceans have fallen since the late 1990s, but levels in popular fish such as tuna, salmon and swordfish are on the rise.¶According to a new study by Harvard University researchers in the journal Nature, some fish are adapting to overfishing of small herring and sardines by changing their diets to consume species with higher mercury levels. ¶Based on 30 years of data, methylmercury concentrations in Atlantic cod increased by up to 23% between the 1970s and the 2000s. It links the increase to a diet change necessitated by overfishing. ¶More in Climate Change¶But overfishing isn't the only contributor to higher mercury levels in fish. Climate change — and the rising ocean temperatures that come with it — means fish are more active and need more food to survive. Consuming more prey means consuming more mercury. ¶#ClimateChange  is hitting your dinner plate: Warming oceans are leading to an increase in the harmful neurotoxicant methylmercury in popular seafood, including cod, Atlantic bluefin tuna and swordfish https://t.co/BzCx477TFQ pic.twitter.com/G4z8rgZFwL¶The study also found that mercury levels in Atlantic bluefin tuna have increased by an estimated 56% due to seawater temperature rise since 1969. ¶Climate change ""is not just about what the weather is like in 10 years,"" said lead researcher Amina Schartup. ""It's also about what's on your plate in the next five.""¶Scientists said human exposure to methylmercury — the compound created when mercury enters the ocean — is especially risky for pregnant women, as it has been linked to long-term neurological disorders when fetuses are exposed in the womb. It is considered a major public health concern by the World Health Organization. ¶""It's not that everyone should be terrified after reading our paper and stop eating seafood, which is a very healthy, nutritious food,"" senior author Elsie Sunderland told Reuters. ""We wanted to show people that climate change can have a direct impact on what you're eating today, that these things can affect your health ... not just things like severe weather and flooding and sea level rise.""¶Since the late 1990s, mercury concentrations have declined overall following increased regulations and decreased coal-burning power plants. In 2017, a global treaty was introduced to reduce mercury emissions.¶But mercury levels in fish have not fallen as expected. The treaty failed to account for overfishing's massive effects on marine ecosystems or climate change's impact on the diets of fish. So, much of our current seafood supply actually contains more mercury than before.¶According to a recent report by Australian climate experts, the world's oceans will likely lose about one-sixth of its fish and other marine life by the end of the century if climate change continues on its current path. If the world's greenhouse gas emissions stay at the present rate, that means a 17% loss of biomass — the total weight of all marine animal life — by the year 2100. But if the world reduces carbon pollution, losses can be limited to only about 5%, the study said. ¶But our regulations against mercury pollution could be weakening under the Trump administration. In December, the Environmental Protection Agency targeted an Obama-era regulation credited with helping dramatically reduce toxic mercury pollution from coal-fired power plants.¶In the U.S. coal power plants are the largest single manmade source of mercury pollutants. As coal combustion emits mercury into the atmosphere, the ocean absorbs it, converting it into methylmercury. The EPA proposal argued that savings for companies were greater than any increased perils to safety or the environment.¶The carbon we release into the atmosphere has a direct correlation to the toxins that end up in our food supply. ¶Methylmercury levels increase when an animal eats its prey — accumulating in larger doses as it goes through the food chain. So when a human consumes tuna, for example, it is also consuming all of the mercury consumed by its prey, all the way down the food chain. ¶According to the study, about 80% of exposure to Methylmercury in the U.S. comes from seafood, and 40% from tuna alone. Scientists said stronger regulations are needed for greenhouse gases and mercury emissions in order to keep our fish supply healthy and thriving. ",0

Since trees absorb carbon dioxide, which contributes to global warming, a worldwide planting initiative could remove a substantial portion of heat-trapping emissions from the atmosphere.¶But rather than adding trees, in many parts of the world, they're being cut down on a massive scale. Deforestation is a major concern in the Amazon, where acres of rainforests are being cut down every day to make room for agriculture.¶So while reforestation may be the best solution, halting deforestation and reducing animal agriculture would also provide immediate benefits.

    ","¶While Massachusetts beachgoers may be worried about sharks this summer, environmentalists are warning about a much smaller organism. E. coli, a bacteria present in animal and human waste, could hurt many more people—and it shows up on half of America's beaches, according to new research from Environment America and  the Frontier Group.¶Half the beaches in the U.S. have at least one day per summer season in which it's not safe to swim because of elevated bacteria levels in the water, according to a report the group released recently. Some states had it much worse. In Louisiana, all of the 24 beach sites sampled were potentially unsafe for at least one day last summer. In Mississippi, all 21 of 21 beach sites sampled were. ¶There are several ways for bacteria to get into water, but two of the most common ones are overflows from sewage treatment plants or runoff during heavy rain. ¶More in Climate Change¶""Particularly in major urban and suburban areas where we've paved over everything, when there are heavy rains, there's no place to absorb the water anymore,"" said John Rumpler, senior director of Environment America's Clean Water for America campaign.¶""In nature, when it rains, the storm water gets absorbed in the soil, but in a heavily developed world, the rainwater hits the asphalt and picks up bacteria, and gravity brings it to the nearest stream, river or lake."" ¶A third, slightly less common, cause is runoff from industrial livestock operations, Rumpler said. That's why many of the most contaminated beaches in the report sit near the mouths of rivers, where they're more likely to receive runoff.¶In New Jersey, Beachwood Beach West, in Ocean County, was the top offender in the state. Nearly two-thirds of the days on which it was sampled showed potentially dangerous bacteria levels. Last summer, there were 20 days during which officials found potentially harmful levels of enterococcus bacteria on Beachwood Beach West, county officials said, although more than half of those tests took place before the beach was open to the public. ¶""It's part of our tourism, part of our ecology, so we take it very seriously,"" said Pete Curatolo, the Coastal Cooperative Monitoring Program coordinator.¶For a state like New Jersey, where oceanfront counties contribute nearly half of the state's $44 billion in tourist dollars, beach closures can have a significant economic impact. But water recreation is potentially even more crucial in the Great Lakes region, which has seen a spate of water safety closures already this summer. ¶""Particularly in Erie, Pennsylvania, but I would say across the Great Lakes, the economy in these rural areas is largely focused around tourism and recreation,"" said Michael Ferguson, an assistant professor of recreation management and policy at the University of New Hampshire. That's especially true since many industrial employers that used to have a presence in the upper Midwest have gone.¶""If we're seeing beach closures that are being enforced by the Department of Environmental Protection, they're trying to protect the user, but it's having a big impact on the economy,"" Ferguson said. ¶Some two-thirds of Great Lakes beaches that were tested had at least one unsafe day, according to the Environment America report. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, which border Lake Erie, all but three of the tested beaches had at least one unsafe day last year. In Illinois, 19 out of 19 beaches were potentially unsafe for at least one day; in Indiana, it was 22 out of 23. Michigan and Minnesota, with just about half of tested beaches having one potentially unsafe day, fared the best. ¶Environment America looked at just one metric to determine if a beach was unsafe—the presence of E. coli, which comes from human or animal feces, as tested by the National Water Quality Monitoring Council. (To be deemed ""potentially unsafe,"" a beach needed to have enough a E. coli to sicken 32 per 1,000 swimmers, which is the standard used by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.) ¶Plenty of other issues can make water unsuitable for swimming, including chemical pollution and algal blooms, caused by fertilizer runoff. Toxic algae forced Mississippi to close all the state's beaches earlier this month and caused a state of emergency in Florida last year.¶What's more, with greenhouse gas emissions making waters warmer and rainstorms more intense, it's likely that we'll see more instances of both bacteria and algae in swimming areas. ¶""These are age-old problems, and they're really being exacerbated by climate change,"" Ferguson said.¶But towns aren't helpless when it comes to preventing bacterial overload. Green infrastructure—things like parks, wetlands, gardens and ""green"" roofs—can help the ground absorb rainwater and reduce storm runoff. Philadelphia is in the middle of a 25-year greening project to reduce its stormwater runoff; Kansas City last year adopted a ""green infrastructure"" framework aimed at making the city more resilient to floods.¶Tighter regulations around industrial animal operations can also help, Environment America suggests. ¶""One of the top goals of the Clean Water Act was to ensure that all our waterways would be completely safe for swimming by 1983,"" said Rumpler. ""So we're a little late on that.""",0

    ",CBS News,"August 8, 2019, 9:56 AM","¶A major report from the United Nations focuses on the key role of our food and land use in fighting climate change. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says agriculture, forestry and other land uses produce nearly half of the world's methane emissions, a greenhouse gas that also comes from cows.¶But many ranchers argue the cow-climate change connection is overblown. One study says going vegan for a year reduces your carbon footprint by half as much as avoiding a single flight to Europe. Rancher Brandi Buzzard says the cattle she raises for beef are part of the solution to climate change, not the problem.   ¶""When cattle graze on grass pastures, they are actually improving the grass and what they're grazing on,"" she said. ""We are doing everything we can to improve our environmental footprint.""   ¶ That footprint, according to the UN report, contributes to 44% of methane emissions that come from agriculture, forestry and human land use. According to the authors, ""There has been a major growth in emissions from managed pastures due to increased manure deposition."" ¶ Cow manure emits methane which can also come from cow burps, and yes, cow flatulence. Electricity generation and transportation like car emissions make up the majority of U.S.-produced greenhouse gases. But cows account for 2.6%.¶ ""So I think we can make more impactful changes in our lives through recycling, or walking to work, or using public transportation than we can by actually changing what we eat, because it will have such a minimal impact,"" Buzzard said. ¶ But changing what we eat, is what the report suggests. It argues, in part, that eating more plant-based foods and sustainably-produced meats can change land use and mitigate climate change.¶ ""The purpose of this report is to say that just doing transportation and electricity isn't enough, we need to also think about our land use and we need to think about agriculture,"" said Steve Blackledge, the conservation program director for Environment America. ¶ That's why some dairy farms are trapping methane from manure under tarps and converting it to fuel for trucks. At University of California Davis, scientists are using the equivalent of a cow breathalyzer to measure how different feed affects manure outputs. ¶UC Davis professor Frank Mitloehner, who studies livestock and air quality, wants Americans to focus on the energy wasted on food they don't consume.¶""40% of all food produced in this country goes to waste and you know who the main culprit is? You and I,"" Mitloehner said. ""So if you're really concerned about your personal environmental footprint around food, well, waste less.""¶Some ranchers say that they do believe in climate change and are taking steps to combat it, but they say the earth is being impacted by changing weather patterns, not global warming. Still, the UN report says temperature over land since the pre-industrial era has already increased by nearly 3 degrees Fahrenheit.",0

    ","¶Climate change is hitting us where it counts: the stomach — not to mention the forests, plants and animals, a new United Nations scientific report finds. Human-caused climate change is already making food more expensive, scarcer and even less nutritious.¶But there is hope if people change the way they eat, grow food and manage forests, scientists said. No-till farming techniques could reduce carbon emissions, for instance, while consumers could also help by switching to a plant-based diet and skipping meat, they said.¶Thursday's science-laden report examines how global warming and land interact in a vicious cycle. Human-caused climate change is dramatically degrading the land, while the way people use the land is making global warming worse.¶More in Climate Change¶""The cycle is accelerating,"" said NASA climate scientist Cynthia Rosenzweig, a report co-author. ""The threat of climate change affecting people's food on their dinner table is increasing.""¶🌍 IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land: ¶Land is under growing human pressure. Land is a part of the solution. But land can’t do it all. #SRCCL #ClimateChange #GlobalGoals¶Read more ➡️ https://t.co/J1SszBYBjS pic.twitter.com/nQgAvJkzEh¶Earth's land masses, which are only 30% of the globe, are warming twice as fast as the planet as a whole. While heat-trapping gases are causing problems in the atmosphere, the land has been less talked about as part of climate change. A special report, written by more than 100 scientists and unanimously approved by diplomats from nations around the world at a meeting in Geneva, proposed possible fixes and made more dire warnings.¶""The way we use land is both part of the problem and also part of the solution,"" said Valerie Masson-Delmotte, a French climate scientist who co-chairs one of the panel's working groups. ""Sustainable land management can help secure a future that is comfortable.""¶Scientists in Thursday's press conference emphasized both the seriousness of the problem and the need to make societal changes soon.¶""We don't want a message of despair,"" said science panel official Jim Skea, a professor at Imperial College London. ""We want to get across the message that every action makes a difference""¶The report said climate change already has worsened land degradation, caused deserts to grow, permafrost to thaw and made forests more vulnerable to drought, fire, pests and disease. That's happened even as much of the globe has gotten greener because of extra carbon dioxide in the air. Climate change has also added to other forces that have reduced the number of species on Earth.¶""Climate change is really slamming the land,"" said World Resources Institute researcher Kelly Levin, who wasn't part of the study but praised it.¶And the future could be worse.¶""The stability of food supply is projected to decrease as the magnitude and frequency of extreme weather events that disrupt food chains increases,"" the report said.¶In the worst case scenario, food security problems change from moderate to high risk with just a few more tenths of a degree of warming from now. They go from high to ""very high"" risk with just another 1.8 degrees (1 degree Celsius) of warming from now.¶Scientists had long thought one of the few benefits of higher levels of carbon dioxide, the major heat-trapping gas, was that it made plants grow more and the world greener, Rosenzweig said. But numerous studies show that the high levels of carbon dioxide reduce protein and nutrients in many crops.¶For example, high levels of carbon in the air in experiments show wheat has 6 to 13% less protein, 4 to 7% less zinc and 5 to 8% less iron, she said.¶But better farming practices — such as no-till agricultural and better targeted fertilizer application — have the potential to fight global warming too, reducing carbon pollution up to 18% of current emissions levels by 2050, the report said.¶Some farmers in the U.S. are already practicing no-till farming, which focuses on an updated version of using cover crops like clover and legume to reduce the tillage of farm soil. Cover crops help fix nitrogen in the soil, and have been used for centuries to add nutrients to farmland. ¶The approach skips the process of tilling the soil, which can limit the soil's ability to absorb nutrients and water and make it more likely to suffer erosion. It also helps sequester carbon in the soil, because tilling exposes soil carbon to the air, which then transforms it into carbon dioxide.¶If people change their diets, reducing red meat and increasing plant-based foods, such as fruits, vegetables and seeds, the world can save as much as another 15% of current emissions by mid-century. It would also make people more healthy, Rosenzweig said.¶The science panel said they aren't telling people what to eat because that's a personal choice.¶Still, Hans-Otto Portner, a panel leader from Germany who said he lost weight and felt better after reducing his meat consumption, told a reporter that if she ate less ribs and more vegetables ""that's a good decision and you will help the planet reduce greenhouse gas emissions.""¶Reducing food waste can fight climate change even more. The report said that between 2010 and 2016 global food waste accounted for 8 to 10% of heat-trapping emissions.¶""Currently 25-30% of total food produced is lost or wasted,"" the report said. Fixing that would free up millions of square miles of land.¶With just another 0.9 degrees of warming (0.5 degrees Celsius), which could happen in the next 10 to 30 years, the risk of unstable food supplies, wildfire damage, thawing permafrost and water shortages in dry areas ""are projected to be high,"" the report said.¶At another 1.8 degrees of warming from now (1 degree Celsius), which could happen in about 50 years, it said those risks ""are projected to be very high.""¶Most scenarios predict the world's tropical regions will have ""unprecedented climatic conditions by the mid to late 20th century,"" the report noted.¶Agriculture and forestry together account for about 23% of the heat-trapping gases that are warming the Earth, slightly less than from cars, trucks, boats and planes. Add in transporting food, energy costs, packaging and that grows to 37%, the report said.¶But the land is also a great carbon ""sink,"" which sucks heat-trapping gases out of the air.¶From about 2007 to 2016, agriculture and forestry every year put 5.7 billion tons (5.2 billion metric tons) of carbon dioxide into the air, but pulled 12.3 billion tons (11.2 billion metric tons) of it out.¶""This additional gift from nature is limited. It's not going to continue forever,"" said study co-author Luis Verchot , a scientist at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture in Colombia. ""If we continue to degrade ecosystems, if we continue to convert natural ecosystems, we continue to deforest and we continued to destroy our soils, we're going to lose this natural subsidy.""¶Overall land emissions are increasing, especially because of cutting down forests in the Amazon in places such as Brazil, Colombia and Peru, Verchot said.¶Recent forest management changes in Brazil ""contradicts all the messages that are coming out of the report,"" Portner said.¶Stanford University environmental sciences chief Chris Field, who wasn't part of the report, said the bottom line is ""we ought to recognize that we have profound limits on the amount of land available and we have to be careful about how we utilize it.""¶CBS News' Pamela Falk contributed to this report.

    ","¶More than 200 reindeer carcasses have been found in the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard this year, and researchers are blaming climate change. According to scientists in the region, the reindeer starved to death due to a particularly harsh winter. ¶Scientists at the Norwegian Polar Institute (NPI), Norway's government institution for research and environmental management, spent 10 weeks investigating the population. They said a rainy season early last winter led to more reindeer deaths than usual, because when winter rain turns to ice, reindeer are unable to dig for food. ¶A relatively large number of calves were born last year, which only made matters worse. ""The animals starve and can die and it is the youngest and weakest animals that succumb first,"" the institute said. ¶More in Climate Change¶NPI has been mapping wild reindeer on Svalbard, a collection of Norwegian islands just 800 miles from the North Pole, since 1978. ""Never before have they seen so many carcasses at once,"" Norway public broadcaster NRK said.¶ UVANLIG MANGE REINSDYRKADAVRE  Tradisjonen tro har vi også denne sommeren telt reinsdyr i dalene rundt Longyearbyen og på Brøggerhalvøya nær Ny-Ålesund på Svalbard.  Tellingen i år skilte seg ut ved at et regnvær tidlig på vinteren førte til ekstra mange kadavre. Effekten av vinterregn er is på bakken som hindrer reinen fra å grave seg ned til beitet. Dyrene sulter og kan dø, og det er de yngste og svakeste dyrene som bukker under først.  I fjor ble det født relativt mange kalver og en hard vinter med vanskelige beiteforhold førte til en ekstra belastning for dem.  Reinsdyr på Svalbard overvåkes og telles fordi den er en nøkkelart som påvirker økosystemet på tundraen, den er følsom for klimaendringer og det drives jakt på den i enkelte områder sentralt på Spitsbergen.  Foto: Siri Uldal / Norsk Polarinstitutt¶A post shared by  Norsk Polarinstitutt (@norskpolarinstitutt) on Jul 22, 2019 at 8:25am PDT¶Scientists fear the reindeer deaths are just another sign of rapid climate change in the region. ""It is scary to find so many dead animals,"" researcher Åshild Ønvik Pedersen told NRK. ""This is a terrifying example of how climate change affects nature."" ¶It is not uncommon for reindeer to die of starvation in the winter. But the number of deaths and food shortages are alarming. ""Some of the mortality is natural because there were so many calves last year,"" Pedersen said. ""But the large number we see now is due to heavy rainfall, which is due to global warming."" ¶Reindeer can dig through snow for food, but not ice. So, during a typical snowy season, most of the reindeer population does not suffer. But a milder climate has led to more rain than snow, followed by more ice and less access to food, Pedersen said. ¶According to NPI, Svalbard has been disproportionally affected by climate change, which has had major consequences for animals native to the region. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Arctic Report Card for 2018, the region has been warming at twice the rate as the rest of the planet in recent years.¶And climate change isn't the only threat to Norway's reindeer population. In 2017, freight trains killed more than 100 reindeer in the Helgeland region over a three day period. In 2016, more than 300 wild reindeer were killed by lightning in central Norway.¶After being severely depleted by hunting in the early 20th century, the population of reindeer in Norway has significantly recovered since becoming a protected species in 1925. But climate change threatens to reverse the work that has been done. ¶Reindeer can be found in almost all non-glaciated areas of the archipelago, according to NPI. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Arctic Report Card for 2018, caribou and reindeer populations have declined 56 percent over the last two decades.¶NPI estimates the population of Svalbard reindeer to be somewhere between 400-1,200, while the total reindeer population for all of Norway is estimated to be around 220,000.",0

Eleven billion tons of ice melted across the country on Wednesday alone — its biggest melt this season. ¶While Greenland's ice sheets usually melt during the summer, record temperatures have meant a longer and more dramatic melt season. As sea levels rise globally, so do the likelihood of extreme weather events and coastal flooding. ¶Roughly 197 billion tons of ice from Greenland melted into the Atlantic Ocean in July, Ruth Mottram, a climate scientist with the Danish Meteorological Institute, told CBS News Friday. That's about 36 percent more than scientists expect in an average year. ¶This is a roaring glacial melt, under the bridge to Kangerlussiauq,  Greenland  where it's 22C today and Danish officials say 12 billions tons of ice melted in 24 hours, yesterday. pic.twitter.com/Rl2odG4xWj¶Mottram said the recent heat waves have escalated this year's loss of ice.

According to Mottram, residents of Ilulissat have been pictured wearing shorts in recent weeks. ""This is very unusual!"" She said. ¶Last week, Europe experienced a life-threatening heat wave, with France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Britain all hitting record temperatures: 100 degrees Fahrenheit in London, 109 in Paris. As the heat wave moved on to the Arctic and Greenland, Arctic sea ice is reaching new record low levels. ¶July may have been the hottest month in recorded history, according to U.N.

This year, record temperatures were reached without the aid of an El Niño.¶Europe experienced a life-threatening heat wave, with France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Britain all hitting record temperatures: 100 degrees Fahrenheit in London, 109 in Paris. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies warned that the threat posed by extreme heat ""will only become more serious and more widespread as the climate crisis continues.""¶At the U.N. Thursday, the Secretary General laid out what must be done: limit global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees C to avoid the worst impacts of climate change; cut greenhouse emissions by 45% by 2030; and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.¶""Arctic sea ice is now close to new record low levels,"" the new statistics, announced by the U.N. chief, said, adding that the heat which recently affected Europe is now beating down on the Arctic and Greenland. ¶According to the WMO, ""more frequent, longer and more intense heatwaves are exactly what we expect as greenhouse gases continue to lead to a rise in global temperatures."" ¶The organization also noted, ""The last time the earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO2 [carbon dioxide in the atmosphere] was 3 to 5 million years ago when the temperature was 2-3°C warmer and sea level was 10-20 meters higher than now.""¶When world leaders come to U.N. headquarters in New York for the annual General Assembly two months from now, the focus will include a Youth Climate Summit on September 21 and a Climate Action Summit on September 23, a day before heads of state, including presumably President Trump, will speak. ¶The mandate, Guterres said, is: ""Don't come to the Summit with beautiful speeches. Come with concrete plans – clear steps to enhance nationally determined contributions by 2020 — and strategies for carbon neutrality by 2050.""¶Asked if there is a message to the Trump administration, which withdrew from the international Paris climate accord, Guterres said that all nations have to do better. ¶""Preventing irreversible climate disruption is the race of our lives and for our lives,"" the U.N. chief said.

    ","¶Moscow -- Gigantic forest fires have regularly raged through the vast expanses of Russia's Siberia, but the magnitude of this year's blazes has reached an exceptional level, with fears of a long-term impact on the environment. As fires sweep across millions of acres, enveloping entire cities in black smoke and noxious fumes, environmentalists warn of a disaster threatening to accelerate the melting of the Arctic. ¶More than 7.9 million acres were in the grip of fires on Monday, mainly in the vast regions of Yakutia in the north and Krasnoyarsk and Irkutsk in Siberia, authorities said. ¶The fires, triggered by dry thunderstorms in temperatures above 86 degrees Fahrenheit, were spread by strong winds, Russia's federal forestry agency said. ¶The acrid smoke has affected not only small settlements but also major cities in Western Siberia and the Altai region as well as the Urals such as Chelyabinsk and Yekaterinburg, and disrupted air travel.¶More in Climate Change¶""The smoke is horrible. I am choking and dizzy,"" pensioner Raisa Brovkina, who was hospitalised in Russia's third-largest city Novosibirsk, told state television.   ¶Aside from health fears for the local population, environmentalists warn the fires may accelerate global warming.  ¶""The forest fires in the eastern part of the country have long stopped being a local problem,"" the Russian branch of Greenpeace said in a statement. ""It has transformed into an ecological disaster with consequences for the entire country."" ¶According to the environmental group, almost 12 million hectares were burnt this year, causing significant CO2 emissions and reducing the future capacity of forest to absorb the carbon dioxide.¶""Then there is the added problem that soot falling on ice or snow melts darkens it, thus reducing the reflectiveness of the surface and trapping more heat,"" the World Meteorological Organization told AFP in a statement. ¶Some scientists posted satellite images from NASA showing the clouds of smoke reaching Arctic areas. ¶Greenpeace Russia expert Grigory Kuksin said the soot and ashes accelerate the melting of the Arctic ice and permafrost -- the permanently frozen layer that has begun melting -- releasing gases that reinforce global warming.  ¶Kuksin called the impact on the climate ""very serious.""¶""It is comparable to the emissions of major cities,"" he said. ""The more fires affect the climate, the more conditions are created for new dangerous fires.""¶Greenpeace has launched a petition demanding Russian authorities do more to fight the fires. ¶But the situation is complicated by the fact that Russia does not have enough money to contain the wildfires, environmentalists add.¶The majority of the fires rage in remote or inaccessible areas and authorities make the decision to extinguish them only if the estimated damage exceeds the cost of the operation, experts say.¶Otherwise, the role of Russian authorities is limited to monitoring the wildfires, they say.¶Kuksin of Greenpeace said Russian officials do not prioritize financial resources to put out fires in remote areas, taking issue with such an approach.¶""The maximum amount possible should be put out from the start,"" he said.¶""We need to plan and allocate resources, but we continue to save money claiming it is 'economically impractical.'""",0

            ""Everything is changing"": Farmers seek solutions, not slogans, on climate change - CBS News
    ",CBS News,"July 29, 2019, 12:07 PM","¶Watch the CBSN Originals documentary, ""A Climate Reckoning in the Heartland,"" in the video player above.¶Among climate scientists, the reality of climate change is virtually indisputable, with a consensus of more than 97 percent agreeing that the climate is changing and human activity is the primary cause. A majority of American farmers —finely attuned to conditions affecting their land and livelihoods — also agree the climate is changing, yet many of them express doubts about the reasons and reject the label ""climate change."" Dialogue among farmers and scientists is now evolving, however, and helping to bridge the divide on the issue.¶""I'm scared for my future. I'm scared for my family's future,"" said Brett Adams, a fifth-generation farmer in Peru, Nebraska, located 50 miles south of Omaha, along the still flooded Missouri River. A levee breach during the ""bomb cyclone"" storm last March left 80 percent of his 4,000-acre farm under water. ""It's just sad to see something that was so great turn into this."" ¶Though he's seen the damage caused by increasingly extreme rainfall, he resists putting a name to the trend.¶""I'm not a climate change guy, as far as climate change, global warming, or any of that stuff,"" Adams said. ""But have I seen the weather change in, say, my 20-year farming career? Absolutely.""¶Adams is not alone. A 2016 Iowa State University social science study on farmers' attitudes towards climate change reveals that ""although two-thirds of farmers believe that climate change is occurring, only 40 percent implicate human activity."" That's far below the 62 percent of the general population that agrees global warming is mostly human-caused.¶The reasons for the skepticism among farmers are varied and complicated, ranging from mixed climate signals to partisan politics and everything in between.¶CBS News spoke to Adams at length and a common theme of the conversation was, ""Everything has changed. It's not just the climate.""¶""Thirty, 40, 50 years ago the population of Omaha was one-tenth of what it is now. There's so much more concrete and runoff in the metropolitan area and that has changed the inflow into the rivers,"" says Adams. But even with that increased flow, according to Adams, the levee near his home, which was built in 1950, has not been upgraded since. In his view, that unchanged infrastructure played a big role in the flood.¶Still, Adams has no doubt that something is different with the weather. ""Two-inch rains used to be a big deal… now it seems like there are three-, four-, five-inch rains all the time,"" he said.¶He's right. According to the federal government's 2018 National Climate Assessment, since the 1950s, heavy rain events in the Upper Midwest have increased by more than a third. Scientists say climate change has contributed to that increase, but Adams is unsure. ""No one even knows, is this even change or is this normal? We don't know. Maybe this is a long cycle,"" he said.¶""They talk, talk, talk about global warming and then comes last winter, one of the coldest, snowiest winters on record. Well, is that an aspect of global [warming]?"" Adams contemplates, ""Then everybody looks back and says you must be full of baloney.""¶Omaha, Nebraska did in fact record its snowiest winter ever in 2019, and February was one of the coldest on record. Globally, however, 2019 is on track to be the second or third warmest year on record. With mixed climate signals like that, to understand the climate change connections you either need a degree in atmospheric sciences or a willingness to take the scientists at their word. And that's where things turn from science to ideology.¶""It's embedded deep. It's woven so deep,"" said Graham Christensen, also fifth-generation grain producer in the region. ""It's very bewildering for me too that we are battling some of the scientific consensus on this."" ¶Christensen is leading an effort to educate farmers on the benefits of regenerative farming practices that aim to improve soil health, the environment — and profitability as well. In his travels around the state, Christensen meets with farmers in some of the most remote rural stretches of the nation. ¶""We don't get as much access to information that other people do,"" he says, observing that what access farmers do have is often limited to conservative radio or television. ¶Compounding that, he says, is the fact that many young, creative people are leaving rural areas due to a lack of opportunity. He believes this perpetuates a homogenous narrative: ""The same people get the same thing pounded over and over again into their heads and they believe it.""¶Political identity appears to play a significant role in farmers' skepticism about climate change. In Adams's view, ""The Democrats kind of came up with global warming, right? It's a critical platform for them. So I think that's why in red states they have different views on it.""¶He added, ""When people start talking about climate change it's like someone is trying to push an agenda here.""¶J. Gordon Arbuckle, a sociologist at Iowa State University, is part of team of university extension and agriculture outreach educators that's been doing research on this subject since 2011. ""I think it's mostly political worldview. Climate change and similar terms are just plain not welcome in some political circles,"" said Arbuckle.¶While farmers like Adams may be dubious about what they view as a political agenda, Christensen says he does not get that same pushback. ¶""When I go out into places and talk about climate change it's usually not that divisive,"" he said. In his experience, Nebraskans are more open to discussing climate change among people they trust. ""These farmers respond better when they hear it from other farmers and ranchers,"" Christensen said.¶Former Illinois State Climatologist Jim Angel has lifelong experience with farmers. He says climate change acceptance can be risky proposition because it has consequences: ""To admit to human-induced climate change means you are now obliged to take significant steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions."" ¶Angel continues, ""Some of the ideas being advocated for greenhouse gas reduction, such as a carbon tax or the promotion of a vegan diet, would have significant impacts on farmers. That makes my job of talking to farmers about climate change a lot harder."" ¶To bridge the political and cultural gap on the issue, Adams suggests ditching what he considers the loaded term ""climate change"" and replacing it with more neutral discussion of extreme weather. ""When you stop and talk about it that way, you get more understanding of it than just plain, 'do you believe in climate change?',"" he said. ¶The research supports this. ""Terms like 'increasing weather variability,' 'long-term weather patterns' and 'extreme weather events' and their local impacts are less controversial than the topic of climate change,"" Arbuckle and his Iowa State University colleagues write. They also suggest ""limiting discussion of the causes of climate change, which are less relevant to changing farm practices and more likely to alienate audiences.""¶And they stress that it's worthwhile to keep engaging with farmers on the topic. ""Farmers and advisers, like anyone else, can change their perspectives on things as they learn from new experiences and information,"" they write.¶Christensen says he's had great success in minimizing talk of causes and focusing on providing solutions to help save farms with sustainable agricultural practices. ""Once they do this stuff, all of a sudden they are believers. They are saying the right things, defying the stigmas and doing the right thing for the next generation,"" he said. ¶Solutions are exactly what Adams wants to focus on right now on his flood-damaged farm. ""I have millions and millions of dollars lost in this. You could walk through my local community right now and ask these questions about climate change and the answer you'd probably get is they could probably give a damn about climate change, because they are beaten down from this disaster and they just need help getting back on their feet.""",0

She also met with Pope Francis, who praised Thunberg's efforts and encouraged her to continue campaigning.¶Although little-known in the United States, Thunberg has arguably become the figurehead for a new generation of European eco-activists worried that they'll suffer the fallout from their parents' and grandparents' unwillingness to take strong actions to combat climate change.¶""This past year, my life has turned upside down,"" Thunberg told the AP. ""Every day is an adventure, basically. Sometimes I have to pinch myself and say 'Is this really real? Has this actually been happening?' Because it has all happened so fast and it's hard to keep up with everything.¶""In a way, I am more optimistic, because people are slowly waking up and people are becoming more aware of the situation. This whole 'Fridays for Future' movement is very hopeful,"" she said. ""But also ... one year has passed and still almost nothing has happened.""¶Her visibility has made Thunberg a target for those who reject the overwhelming consensus among scientists that climate change is being driven by man-made emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, released by the burning of fossil fuels.¶""I don't care about hate and threats from climate crisis deniers,"" she said. ""I just ignore them.""¶Thunberg said she's unsure how her message will be received in the United States, where there's broad opposition to the kind of radical measures scientists say are required to limit global warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century compared with pre-industrial times.¶""I will just try to go on as I have before,"" the young Swede said. ""Just always refer to the science and we'll just see what happens.""¶Thunberg wouldn't rule out meeting with President Donald Trump, who wants the U.S. to withdraw from the landmark 2015 Paris climate accord, but appeared doubtful such an encounter would happen because she thinks it would be ""just a waste of time.""¶""As it looks now, I don't think so, because I have nothing to say to him,"" she told the AP. ""He obviously doesn't listen to the science and the scientists. So why should I, a child with no proper education, be able to convince him?""¶Aside from attending a summit hosted by U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on the sidelines of the global body's annual assembly on Sept. 23, Thunberg plans to take part in several climate protests in New York. The British band The 1975 has released an album with a short essay by Thunberg set to music. It ends with her declaring ""it is now time for civil disobedience. It is time to rebel.""¶Thunberg stressed that she rejects violence, citing her school strikes for climate as the kind of action she backs. Last week she deleted a tweet showing her wearing a T-shirt with the slogan ""Antifascist All Stars,"" after some accused her of supporting far-left extremists.¶""You can rebel in different ways,"" she said. ""Civil disobedience is rebelling. As long as it's peaceful, of course.""¶After New York, Thunberg intends to travel to the annual U.N. climate conference in December, held in Chile this year, with stops in Canada, Mexico and other countries along the way, traveling by train and bus.¶The yacht she'll be crossing the Atlantic with is a far cry from the Viking ships that first brought Scandinavians to America. Captained by yachtsman Boris Herrmann, the 60-foot Malizia II is fitted with solar panels and underwater turbines to generate zero-carbon electricity on board.¶Thunberg will also be accompanied on the two-week journey by a filmmaker, her father Svante and Pierre Casiraghi, the grandson of Monaco's late Prince Rainier III and American actress Grace Kelly, who is the head of the Malizia II racing team based in Monaco.¶""I haven't experienced anything like this before,"" Thunberg said, a giggle breaking her normally serious demeanor. ""I think this will be a trip to remember.""¶Thunberg will be setting a very high bar for the activists and leaders from outside the Americas who are attending the U.N. climate conferences, almost all of whom will likely be coming by plane.¶""I'm not saying that people should stop flying,"" she said. ""I'm just saying it needs to be easier to be climate neutral.""¶Both Casiraghi and Herrmann lauded the young passenger-to-be on their yacht in a statement posted to the sailing team's website.¶""Convincing governments  and international institutions to make the step and enforce laws that  will protect mankind and biodiversity is of the utmost importance for  the future of humanity. Greta is an ambassador who delivers a  fundamental message both for our society and for the survival of future  generations,"" Casiraghi said. ""Team Malizia and I are proud to take Greta across the  Atlantic in this challenging mode of transport, unfortunately today this  is still the only way with out fossil fuel emissions. Hopefully this  will change in the near future. I respect Greta's courage to take on  this adventure and fully commit, sacrifice and fight for probably the  greatest challenge of humanity.""  ",0

            What is regenerative farming? Experts say it can combat climate change - CBS News
    ",CBS News,"July 28, 2019, 8:00 AM","¶Watch the CBSN Originals documentary, ""A Climate Reckoning in the Heartland,"" in the video player above. ¶Family farming has always been a tough business. In recent years, more extreme weather events have made it even tougher.¶""The average farm across the United States has been in the red, has gone backwards, not made money, for five years in a row,"" said Graham Christensen, a 39-year-old Nebraska farmer whose community was acutely impacted by flooding in the spring of 2019. ""Then when you have something that is devastating as what the bomb cyclone and the 2019 floods were here in Nebraska, those folks that were barely able to hang on, for some folks this was the final icing on the cake.""¶The record-setting floods overwhelmed levees, submerging fields and obstructing farmers' access to acres of their land. Raging waters not only destroyed crops stored from last season, but also scoured the soil that crops so deeply depend on, which will affect production for next season. For some, the water still hasn't fully subsided. Even when it does, farmers will find their fields covered with silt and debris, and it will take hard work to nurse the soil back to health. ¶Christensen believes that regenerative farming, a strategy focused on the nourishment of the soil, is an effective way for farmers to adapt to the challenges of a changing climate and even help reverse the problem.¶Maybe it doesn't look like much more than dirt, but soil does more than just give crops life — it also serves as the terrestrial ecosystem's most significant carbon storehouse. Fertile soil is microbe- and carbon-rich. Improperly cultivating it with traditional practices like excessive tilling and monocropping (producing a single crop every year on the same land) kills off those critical microbes and releases large amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. It's estimated that 10% to 20% of the 450 billion tons of carbon emitted since the Industrial Revolution may be attributed to soil carbon losses. Carbon that is released from the soil then oxidizes in the air and transforms into carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that traps heat and contributes to warming temperatures. ¶Faced with the fact that his multigenerational family farm and others like it may not survive if unprecedented flooding events become the new normal, Christensen decided something needed to change. His business, GC Resolve, offers grassroots education and mobilizes the public to support initiatives including regenerative farming. ¶""About 12 years ago, I started understanding the science of climate change,"" Christensen explains. ""At that point in time, as a farmer myself, it was clear that there's a lot of things that the farming community and farmers can do to help reverse the detrimental impacts of climate change.""¶Christensen encourages farmers to use a range of regenerative methods to prevent soil erosion and degradation. Utilizing cover crops, or plants sown after harvesting the farm's primary crop, can help to anchor the soil in place, slow down rainfall, and increase biodiversity. ¶These conversations about sustainable agricultural practices are moving beyond farming communities and into national politics. Recent polling shows 72% of Americans consider climate change an important issue, and 48% say the science on climate change is more convincing than five years ago — mostly because they've seen evidence of more extreme weather. ¶On the campaign trail, 2020 presidential candidates have proposed a range of strategies to tackle the problem and protect the livelihoods of Midwestern farmers. In the first Democratic presidential debate, former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke threw his support behind efforts like Christensen's, saying, ""We're going to put farmers and ranchers in the driver's seat, renewable and— and sustainable agriculture, to make sure that we capture more carbon out of the air and keep more of it in the soil.""¶But to make headway in deep red states like Nebraska, it can't be a partisan effort. Farmers here may not buy into progressive rhetoric on climate change, but they know what they're seeing on their land.¶Brett Adams's family has been farming in Nebraska for five generations, and he's troubled by the impact of increasingly severe flooding. ""When I was a kid,"" he said, ""an inch of rain, or an inch and a half of rain, was a big deal. Now it's like we get four- or five-inch rains all the time, or six-inch rains, even. That was unheard of.""¶""I'm not a climate change guy, as far as climate change, global warming, or any of that stuff,"" Adams said. ""But have I seen the weather change in, say, my 20-year farming career? Absolutely.""",0

            Massive waves of toxic seaweed inundate Yucatan shorelines - CBS News
    ",CBS News,"July 27, 2019, 9:24 AM","¶It is the biggest algae bloom in the world: Massive waves of seaweed called sargassum washing up on shore day after day.¶Jose Escalante, who has owned a small hotel in Tulum, Mexico, for eight years, said seaweed, which had been cleaned from the beach that day, will again cover the shoreline in a couple of hours. ¶Every day workers here in Tulum, and up and down the Yucatan Peninsula, remove tons and tons of decomposing sargassum from beaches. And every night it comes back.¶Rosa Rodríguez-Martínez, from Mexico's National University, is trying to figure out why. She said sargassum used to wash ashore for two or three weeks during the summer. Now? ""We are getting sargassum almost from March to October,"" she told ""CBS This Morning"" co-host Jeff Glor. ""So basically, more than half of the year we are receiving massive amounts.""¶""That's a huge difference,"" said Glor.¶""It's impressive,"" she said. ""It's a problem. Economical problem, ecological, and probably a human health problem also.""¶Since 2011 the amount of sargassum in the Atlantic has increased dramatically. It currently forms a 5,000-mile mass from Africa to the Caribbean. It is estimated to weigh 22 million tons.¶Why is it so bad right now? ""I think it's because we have polluted the sea too much,"" said Rodríguez-Martínez. ""So, now we have a lot of nutrients [in the ocean], and the algae are taking advantage of it."" ¶Fertilizer run-off from Brazil, increased by deforestation, is believed to be the largest fuel source for the sargassum. That, combined with warming ocean water and changing ocean currents, has put the Yucatan squarely in the crosshairs. ¶It has gotten so bad the Mexican navy has just been put in charge of dealing with it.¶They took Glor up in a reconnaissance mission to locate the largest sargassum waves.¶""We are fully aware that we are only addressing the effects of sargassum,"" said Rear Admiral Enrique Flores Morado, who said the navy will build new sargassum-busting ships to reel in as much as they can. ""But that does not solve any problem. In reality the causes have to be addressed. But given the lack of research, we are now implementing immediate actions.""¶Right now, many towns, and resort owners, are using floating barriers to corral and collect sargassum, including in Puerto Morelos, half an hour south of Cancun.¶""We can say for sure that we are the first destination in the whole Mexican Caribbean with already a control about the sargassum,"" said Héctor Tamayo, director of tourism for Puerto Morelos.¶""There's a lot of it, though. It doesn't look controlled,"" said Glor. ¶Tamayo said there are more than 50 trucks every day carting out sargassum. ¶And some are developing novel ways to use sargassum, including Omar Vasquez, who is building homes with it. Vasquez mixes with sargassum with clay and compost, which is then compressed into bricks.¶""They're better than the other bricks,"" he said. ""It does not have even a gram of cement. Everything is organic.¶""I mean, it's ironic because I grew up without a house, without a home. We crossed the border to the States when I was eight years old. I came back to live my Mexican dream!""¶Even though Vasquez says his homes are 100-percent organic, there may be an issue with what accumulates in the sargassum at sea.¶Rosa Rodríguez-Martínez's latest research shows sargassum is high in heavy metals, like lead and arsenic. And disposal is a major issue.¶Sargassum is either being dumped inland, or buried under the beach, which is illegal.¶One dump site where the sargassum is taken is in the jungle, miles away from the ocean. It's unclear if the sargassum left there seeps into the ground, goes up into the air, or will just sit there forever.¶It is a crisis stretching across the Caribbean, with no end in sight.¶Glor asked Escalante, ""For folks watching this who may not be familiar with this problem or what's happening here, what do you say?""¶""It's something that is happening to the world, not just to the region,"" he replied. ""This is just a consequence of the entire planet being in trouble.""¶See also: ",0
Moody's buys climate-data firm to help investors price impact of a warming planet,"

    ","¶Moody's bought a controlling stake this week in Four Twenty Seven, a research firm that prices climate-change risk. It's the latest indication that Wall Street is coming around to putting a price on climate change and its economic impact—albeit more slowly than many economists and investors have called for. ¶Moody's is one of three agencies—along with Standard & Poor and Fitch Ratings—that evaluates debts and issues credit ratings. The letter grades that result indicate how likely a public company or a private hospital or an entire nation is to repay a debt, and therefore how expensive it is for them to borrow.¶The likelihood of a debt being repaid can change dramatically in a warmed-up world. In Miami, for instance, a commercial property stands a 50% chance today of being in a flood zone. As sea level rises, more and more of them will be regularly flooded. That existential threat to the occupants of buildings will cascade on their landlords, developers and investment portfolios based on those properties, potentially threatening billions of dollars. Meanwhile, many organizations remain unaware of their own exposure to climate-driven events, Moody's said. ¶That's where Four Twenty Seven comes in. The company, based in Berkeley, California, measures a range of physical risks related to climate change, including heat stress, intense rainfall or flooding, wildfires and rising sea levels, and analyzes how those risks affect companies. The company, founded in 2012, has been called a ""pioneer"" in pricing climate risk. ¶More in Climate Change¶""When I started it, there weren't other companies doing this. There also wasn't a lot of demand for it. A lot of companies hadn't integrated what the science is showing, which is that climate change is going to affect us quickly—now,"" said Emilie Mazzacurati, its CEO and founder. ¶Since then, a range of companies have sprung up to provide intelligence on climate change. ""This is something that is bound to become mainstream, and that's a good thing,"" Mazzacurati said. ¶""Moody's is committed to offering global, transparent standards for assessing environmental risk, and the acquisition of Four Twenty Seven advances our objective of integrating climate analytics into our offerings,"" Myriam Durand, its global head of assessments, said in a release. ¶Big business has been slow to incorporate climate-related risks despite prodding from increasingly vocal investors and money managers. To the extent that companies have grappled with this issue, they have focused on risks they would face if governments put a price on carbon or otherwise forced drastic cuts in emissions more than the physical risks to their assets.¶""Companies are not pricing those risks very well,"" Nicolette Bartlett, global director of climate change for CDP, told CBS MoneyWatch recently. ""I would have thought, in the U.S., that realization would be a bit more stark now, given that the country has now suffered two years of weather damage.""¶That disconnect was made clear in testimony by Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell earlier this month. Powell said he agrees that climate change is making severe weather more frequent—as a growing body of scientific research indicates. But when Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii pushed Powell to incorporate severe weather risks into the way the Fed oversees banks, Powell demurred.¶""I guess I see climate change as a longer-run issue. I don't know that incorporating it into day-to-day supervision of financial institutions would add that much value,"" he said. ¶If Moody's were to integrate climate risks into its pricing models, it could spell a radical change for corporations and investors. In the aftermath of the housing crash, rating agencies were widely panned for failing to assess how insecure mortgage-based securities were, thus playing a part in the financial collapse that followed. With the potential hits from climate change dwarfing the 2008 crash, many investors are calling on Wall Street to be smarter this time around. ",0

            ""I'm not a climate change guy, but..."": Farmers reckon with new reality in the heartland - CBS News
    ",CBS News,"July 26, 2019, 7:57 AM","¶Watch the CBSN Originals documentary, ""A Climate Reckoning in the Heartland,"" in the video player above. ¶Walking over soggy lifeless crops, Brett Adams, a fifth generation Nebraska farmer, paused to catch his breath. Under the dark grey clouds of the Midwestern spring, he was forced to come to terms with an alarming reality: 80% of his farmland was under freezing floodwater. ¶In March 2019, record-breaking floods inundated America's breadbasket, a region that's also a key exporter of corn and soybeans to the world. Much of the Midwest was overwhelmed with floods as a result of torrential rains, frozen ground unable to absorb more water, heavy snowmelt, and a series of extreme weather events that culminated in a major winter storm—described by meteorologists as a ""bomb cyclone.""¶""Winter was colder than normal, overall. We also had a wetter-than-normal winter as well as fall, so the soils were at or near saturation,"" Nebraska State Climatologist Martha Shulski said. ¶The floods damaged public infrastructure and led to the loss of crops, livestock and the evacuation of thousands of people from their homes. Nebraska's governor said that in that state alone alone, the cost of damage has surpassed $1.3 billion. ¶""I lay around at night and think about it, you know, and try to estimate how much these grain bins are going to cost to replace, how much corn I had in them that's now laying in the water that's ruined... how much, if any, of it's going to be salvageable,"" Adams said. ¶Like many farmers in the area, Adams's land runs along the Missouri River, the longest waterway in the U.S. The storms breached levees that were built decades ago to protect the areas along the banks. Much of the flood-prevention infrastructure was built 70 years ago, but over the last three decades, the region has seen about an 8% increase in precipitation. ¶The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the federal agency responsible for the management of the country's levee systems, say they've seen record runoff in the past 15 years. This historic flood has made it clear that unpredictable weather patterns are getting more extreme. After massive flooding in 2011, the Corps had to repair five breaches. So far in 2019, they are dealing with 50. ¶""Our current goal is to close all the breaches by March of 2020,"" said Matthew Krajewski, the Readiness Branch Chief of the Army Corps of Engineers. However, if the Corps were to update the levee to newer engineering standards — to help it withstand the rising flood levels predicted in the coming years — they would need funding approval from the U.S. Congress. ¶A recent report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) found that the U.S has seen the wettest 12 months on record, with an average of 38 inches of rain falling from July 2018 to June 2019.¶Adams put it in personal terms. ""When I was a kid,"" he said, ""an inch of rain, or an inch and a half of rain, was a big deal. Now it's like we get four- or five-inch rains all the time, or six-inch rains, even. That was unheard of.""¶""I'm not a climate change guy, as far as climate change, global warming, or any of that stuff,"" Adams said. ""But have I seen the weather change in, say, my 20-year farming career? Absolutely.""¶In response to these troubling changes, some farmers in Nebraska are considering new solutions to keep their businesses afloat. One of those farmers, Graham Christensen, travels the country discussing a green farming initiative called regenerative farming.  ¶Regenerative farming advocates say their practices foster healthier soil and can support a wider variety of crops, providing more opportunities for farmers to profit. The soil can also absorb more water, lessening the impact of floods. ¶""If everybody was utilizing more regenerative practices based on increasing soil health, this flood wouldn't have been so damaging,"" Christensen said. ""We're working against the ecosystem instead of with it.""¶Modern agriculture and food production aren't just impacted by climate change — they also contribute to it. According to the EPA, more than 8% of all U.S greenhouse gas emissions in 2017 came from the agriculture sector.¶While some farmers in conservative parts of the country may be reluctant to define increasingly extreme weather as climate change, Christensen says with each storm, more attitudes start to change.¶""There's more and more people every day that are drawing the connection to that — 'No, I've never seen this, my parents have never seen this, and my grandparents have never seen this,'"" Christensen said. ¶""So every time stuff like this happens, you see more folks that are more opened up to some of these concerns around the climate that we're talking about.""

Cement is a huge greenhouse gas emitter — investors want to change that,"

    ","¶Climate-conscious investors have their sights on another greenhouse gas emitter: The cement industry. A group of investors from the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change and Climate Action 100+ are calling on European cement companies to reduce their carbon emissions, with the goal of net zero emissions in 31 years. ¶""Delaying or avoiding this challenge is not an option. This is ultimately a business-critical issue for the sector,"" Stephanie Pfeifer, CEO of the IIGCC, in a statement earlier this week.¶Cement, a key component of concrete, accounts for 7% of human-made carbon dioxide emissions, according to the International Energy Agency. If it were a country, that would make it the third-largest carbon emitter in the world, behind the U.S. and China.¶More in Climate Change¶Part of the reason cement produces so much carbon dioxide that it's so widespread. Concrete is the world's most widely used building material, and demand for it is growing along with urbanization. Under a business-as-usual scenario, ""The emissions of the global cement sector alone are very likely to surpass the total amount of CO2 emissions of the EU"" in the next decade, the World Wildlife Fund said in a recent report.¶Still, there's no ""silver bullet"" to reducing the industry's emissions, Chatham House, a London-based nonprofit, said last year. Small emission cuts can be made by producing cement in a more energy-efficient manner, but a large portion of its carbon dioxide comes from the chemical reactions that create the substance itself.¶Other ways to cut cement-related emissions include using alternative ingredients; investing in carbon capture and storage; and simply using less cement in favor of other building materials such as steel or brick. Getting the industry to net-zero emissions, as the IIGCC are demanding, would require companies to offset their cement-related emissions.¶The investors are targeting four European construction companies: CRH, Lafarge Holcim, Heidelberg Cement and Saint-Gobain. In May, Heidelberg Cement announced it would reduce its carbon emissions in line with the Paris Agreement, which aims to keep global temperature increases below 2 degrees Celsius. Dalmia Cement, an India-based cement producer, aims to be carbon-negative by 2040 — that is, to take in more carbon out of the atmosphere than it contributes.¶Other companies have a limited window of time to get in line or risk obsolescence, the investors warned. With major economies, including the U.K., France and California aiming to be carbon-neutral by the middle of the century, ""The cement sector needs to get ahead of the profound transformation their sector faces …. if companies are to secure their future,"" Pfeifer said.",0

Dozens of cities and towns have issued weather warnings or watches, reminding residents to avoid the sun, stay hydrated and utilize cooling centers for relief.¶Public health professionals and environmental activists have long warned about the effects of extremely hot summers. The financial community is increasingly concerned as extreme weather, which is projected to become more common, is likely to have a huge impact on the U.S. economy in the coming decades.¶More in Climate Change¶Earlier this year, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco named human-caused climate change as one of three major factors affecting the economy (along with an aging population and rapid technological change). In the extreme, ""climate-based risk could threaten the stability of the financial system as a whole,"" the Fed wrote. ¶The letter cited recent research showing that hotter weather had already slowed U.S. economic growth and ""could reduce overall growth of U.S. economic output by as much as one-third by 2100."" To put that in perspective, the hundreds of billions in tariffs currently being imposed by the U.S., China and the European Union are estimated to reduce the U.S. economic product somewhere between 0.25 and 0.74 percent.¶A reduction in the economic growth rate is more damaging in the long run than a drop in economic output, the cited research indicates, because ""changes to the growth rate compound over time and, as a result, are more lasting.""¶Southern states are the most sensitive to changes in summer and fall temperatures, according to a paper published last year by the Richmond Fed. Auto plants reduce production when temperatures rise above 90 degrees, the paper noted. Services and the finance, insurance and real estate industries — the two largest sectors in the U.S. economy — are also hurt by higher summer temperatures.¶""More housing transactions take place in the spring and summer, perhaps because house shopping involves travel and outdoor activity,"" the paper said. ""As temperatures rise, potential homebuyers may tend to stay inside, which could help explain the finding that higher summer temperatures negatively impact the real estate sector.""¶Warmer-than-normal temperatures result in increased hospitalizations, creating more work and expenses for the insurance industries. Such weather also hurts agriculture, forestry and fishing.¶But extreme heat can benefit other industries such as utilities and mining, which profit from increased energy use.¶Heat also lowers food production and is credited with destroying an estimated one-tenth of the world's cereal crops between 1964 and 2007, according to a Nature article. ¶Writing in Science last year, scientists estimated climate change could erase as much as 6 points off U.S. GDP by the end of the century. Climate change will also redistribute wealth as workers flee from hard-hit areas to more resilient ones. ¶Last month was the hottest June recorded in the 200 years that humans have been keeping track, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. And temperatures continue to move higher. Even regions typically known for their temperate climates — including Alaska, Russia, Ireland, Scotland and Canada — have also been battered this summer by higher-than-normal temperatures. ¶""No single record, in isolation, can be attributed to global warming,"" noted the Washington Post. ""But collectively, these heat records are consistent with the kind of extremes we expect to see increase in a warming world.""",0

That is one conclusion of a new study which highlights the robust links between climate change and wildfires in western North America, with a focus on California.¶From 1972 to 2018, California has experienced a five‐fold increase in area burned year round, with an eight-fold increase during summer.  ¶The two largest fires in California since 1932 (the year accurate records date back to) occurred the last two years, the Mendocino Complex fire in 2018 and the Thomas Fire in 2017. ¶More in Climate Change¶The spike in larger fires really ramped up around the beginning of this century. Sixteen of the 20 largest  fires in California history have occurred in the last 20 years, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. ¶But there has been some controversy about the reasons behind these more massive fires. In a November tweet, President Trump blamed poor forest management.¶While it is true that there are various intermingling factors at work, the team of scientists in this new study conclude that the main cause is our warming climate. According to their research, the spike in large wildfires is most likely due to the drier conditions caused by warmer temperatures. Warm air has more energy and evaporates more moisture, leaving forest cover parched and flammable. ¶Since 1896, average summer temperatures in California have risen 3.25 degrees Fahrenheit. Recently the pace of the warming has quickened, with three-quarters of that increase occurring since the 1970s. Though it's only a few degrees difference, it has resulted in a growing moisture deficit in the atmosphere.¶The moisture deficit — or vapor pressure deficit, as scientists like to call it — is simply the difference between how much moisture the air can hold versus how much moisture it is actual holding. As temperatures rise, that spread increases and the larger deficit leads to lower humidity. Low humidity is a key ingredient for wildfires.¶The team's research shows there's a strong relationship between the extent of summer forest burned and the summer moisture deficit in a given year. According to the paper, this fact ""strongly suggests that nearly all of the increase in summer forest‐fire area during 1972–2018 was driven by increased vapor pressure deficit.""¶CBS News reached out to the lead author, Park Williams, a bioclimatologist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. We asked him about two main critiques about the role climate change plays in these recent larger wildfires in California.¶This first is: It's already dry enough for wildfires half the year and brush can dry out immediately, independent of the warming climate. In other words, a little extra drying shouldn't make much difference.¶Williams says if that argument were true, ""we wouldn't see the strong interannual correlation between California's area burned and the atmospheric vapor-pressure deficit."" Put another way, the area burned would not so closely mirror the ups and downs of the moisture deficit each summer. ¶Next we asked about historical evidence that wildfires also burned very large, and total area burned was seemingly just as high, back in the 1800s and early 1900s. ¶ Williams replied, ""Anybody else who knows anything about fire history in the western U.S. would be correct in noting that the recent increase in fire activity is to some degree a return to conditions more common in the 1800s, before Euro-American settlement led to the near elimination of fire from the landscape."" That is to say, fires were bigger back then because fire suppression was lacking. After the 1920s the size of the fires decreased dramatically as settlers took control. Only in recent decades did fire size start to spike again.¶That said, Williams does agree that the recent increase in wildfire activity is not solely due to warming. ""I do believe that by allowing forests to grow artificially dense by fighting fire for a century and also by producing a near constant supply of ignitions, we have set the table in many western forests for the effect of warming to be extra potent,"" he explains.¶It should be noted that fluctuations in large-scale natural oscillations in both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans also factor into the ebb and flow of moisture, heat and wildfire activity in the West. There are plenty of other intermingling factors. ¶However, given the large upward trend in recent decades, Williams goes back the strongest evidence his research bears out: ""Based on the statistical analyses we have done, it simply cannot be accurately said that warming has not been the proximate driver of the increases in forest fire size.""",0

    ","¶United Nations — Warning that heat waves are ""one of the deadliest natural hazards facing humanity,"" the head of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said Tuesday that the threat posed by extreme heat ""will only become more serious and more widespread as the climate crisis continues."" ¶The group's president, Francesco Rocca, presented a new 90-page action plan at the United Nations to help combat the negative impact of rising temperatures. The plan, entitled ""Heatwave: Guide for Cities,"" was produced by the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Center with over two dozen partners.¶Calling heat waves the ""silent killers"" of climate change, Rocca said the harm they cause is both predictable and preventable. ""The actions that authorities can take to save lives and significantly reduce suffering are simple and affordable,"" he said.¶More in Climate Change¶June 2019 was the hottest month on record in Europe, where countries like France, Germany and the Czech Republic suffered through record-breaking triple-digit temperatures.¶""The U.S. has escaped some of the largest international heat waves over the past few years, but our luck is bound to run out,"" CBS News contributing meteorologist Jeff Berardelli said, adding that much of the United States is going to experience ""dangerous heat"" this week.¶""A preview of extreme summer heat is developing across the nation right now. The big cities up and down the I-95 corridor like New York, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Richmond and Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina, will experience highs near 100 to perhaps as high as 105,"" with heat index numbers as high as 115 degrees, Berardelli said.¶He pointed out that there's growing evidence of the role climate change plays in temperature extremes. ""Scientifically, the link between global warming and heat waves is very direct and robust. Seemingly small changes in average temperature yield large changes in the extremes,"" he said.¶In an article Berardelli wrote for Yale Climate Connections, he cautioned that extreme heat causes more deaths per year in United States than any other weather hazard. ""As the climate continues to warm, that number could rise dramatically in the U.S. and around the world,"" he wrote.¶At the U.N. Tuesday, CBS News asked Rocca about those countries that are not focused on mitigating the effects of climate change. He replied, ""When there is a lack of attention to climate change, or denying climate change or the consequences… I wonder how it is possible to be so irresponsible.""¶One of the principal authors of the report, Julie Arrighi of the Climate Center of Red Cross Red Crescent, said the report provides recommendations for cities that have already experienced extreme heat, but also makes proposals for cities that have not yet faced serious problems because they may suffer in the years to come.¶Rocco said the problems go beyond the obvious discomfort of life in hot weather. ""This is a climate crisis of real global dimensions,"" he said. The devastating consequences of heat waves will include forced migration, food insecurity, and new conflicts. ¶""I'm scared for the future of my son,"" he told CBS News.¶The new report says that as many as 5 billion people live in areas of the world where heat waves can be forecast before they happen, which means there is time to take early action to save lives. The study focuses on the impact in some key cities, including New York City and Phoenix in the United States. The report also has case studies of Dhaka, Bangladesh; Prague, in the Czech Republic; Nairobi, Kenya; Surat, India; Hanoi, Vietnam; and Cape Town, South Africa.¶The report includes recommendations for urban planning to help mitigate the damage from heat waves. Among the suggestions:¶The effects of extreme heat are gaining more attention around the world because heat waves are increasing. Climate Central, an independent organization of scientists and journalists who research climate change, says the data show cities across the U.S. will experience an increasing number of days of extreme heat in the years ahead.",0
The first coal mine to open in Wyoming is in danger of closing,"

    ","¶Belle Ayr, a strip mine that sits in the northeast corner of Wyoming, was the very first strip mine to open in the West back in 1972, kicking off a shifting of the coal industry from the eastern U.S. to the Powder River Basin, which straddles Wyoming and Montana. ¶It closed on July 1—and could be shuttered permanently, a sign of the shifting fortunes of the coal market as much as the poor management that ran it into bankruptcy. ¶Belle Ayr and the adjacent Eagle Butte mine shuttered a few hours after its operator, Blackjewel LLC—the country's sixth-largest coal producer—abruptly filed for bankruptcy protection. It had about $250 million in debt and less than $100,000 in the bank—not enough to cover payroll.  ¶More in Climate Change¶Closing down a mine was unheard of in the region, but coal bankruptcies have become common. Cloud Peak Energy filed for bankruptcy in May and is searching for a buyer for its three mines in the region. Westmoreland Coal, in neighboring Montana, filed for bankruptcy last November. ¶""The Blackjewel bankruptcy you could consider the 'heart attack moment' in the Powder River Basin… when you realize that changes have to be made,"" said Robert Godby, director of the Center for Energy Economics and Public Policy at the University of Wyoming. ¶""There are too many mines, too little demand, and that's been driving prices down. In that situation, you'd expect the weakest most costly mines to shut down or retire first.""¶A decade ago, the region produced 450 million tons of coal a year, most of it sold to customers out of state. That figure has since dropped to 300 million, as less and less of the rock is used across the U.S. What's pushing it over the edge is the arrival of cheap fracked gas—which already has taken much Appalachian coal out of commission in places like West Virginia—west of the Rockies. ¶Now, with the extraction industry booming in West Texas, cheap natural gas is flooding the West, reaching states like Missouri, Illinois and Wisconsin, which were traditional energy markets for Wyoming. ¶""It's become a situation where there's no room for Wyoming coal to hide,"" said Steve Piper, director of energy research at S&P Global Market Intelligence.¶The growth of renewable energy has also played a role. This spring, the U.S. produced more energy from solar, wind and hydropower than from coal, and it's become cheaper in most parts of the country to build a new solar or wind farm than to keep a coal plant running. With California, New Mexico, Colorado and Washington targeting 100% clean electricity, the markets for Wyoming coal is set to shrink further.¶S&P Global Intelligence estimates that some 28 gigawatts of coal-fired capacity will retire in the next five years, which works out to 30 or 40 power plants. ¶""We're seeing a steady stream of coal plant retirements and we expect that to continue,"" Piper said.¶The story now unfolding in Wyoming is familiar in Appalachia, which has been left devastated by closing mines and plants in parts of Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Kentucky. What's kept Western coal relatively safer is its profitability. ¶While Eastern coal sits deep below the surface of the earth and is mostly accessed through deep shafts, coal west of the Rockies sits in large deposits close to the surface, and is mined by stripping away what's on top of it. The nation's 10 largest mines are in the West, where one worker, along with heavy machinery and sometimes explosives, can extract the same amount of coal it would take eight or 10 workers back East.¶""The last ton of coal that comes out of an American mine will come out of the Powder River Basin,"" said Richard Horner, director of emerging technologies at the University of Wyoming.¶For Wyoming, which voted for Donald Trump -- with his promise to put coal miners back to work -- by a 3-to-1 margin, that far-off future is now that much closer. ¶The state is today in a crisis, with hundreds of coal miners out of work, many unable to even cash their last checks or transfer money out of their retirement accounts, and uncertain of finding new jobs in the field. But Wyoming also faces a long-term unwinding that's not much prettier. There's no clear industry that can replace the number of jobs at the level of pay—and the revenue to the state—that coal mining has produced. ¶""Wyoming has huge potential for renewable energy in both solar and wind, but it doesn't create the jobs that coal does,"" said Mike Scott, a senior campaign representative at Sierra Club Montana. ""Renewables can help, but it's not going to be a one-for-one replacement.""",0

The waste management project is in a total of nine states and the District of Columbia. ¶THIS IS NOT A DRILL: Loop is now available in Delaware, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island! That's approximately 10% less comments asking when we're coming to your state... And twice as many people to welcome into the Loop family 😉🎉 #GetInTheLoop pic.twitter.com/ZLqOCA1h7B¶Having launched in May, the project has attracted more than 40 participating household brands, including consumer giants Nestlé, Procter & Gamble, PepsiCo and Unilever. Early shoppers can finish their Häagen-Dazs ice cream or Tide detergent, toss the reusable containers in a tote and arrange for pick-up from waste management company Terracycle or drop the packaging off at a Kroger or Walgreens. ¶Users do not even have to clean the containers. TerraCycle will sterilize the glass, metal, or plastic packaging, refill the containers and ship them off once more for household use. ""We don't want you to change your consumer behavior,"" TerraCycle CEO Tom Szachy told CBS MoneyWatch. ¶The unique consumer approach helped Szachy pitch his waste management idea to the world's biggest consumer-good giants, some of the most notorious repeat offenders on climate change at the World Economic Forum in Davos. ""We wondered is recycling the answer to waste? And we realized it's good at solving the symptom of garbage, but not the root cause, which is disposability,"" Szachy said. ""And that got us to thinking of disposability and what could be the solution.""¶More in Climate Change¶Announced in Davos in January, the program launched more than one year after China's ban on plastic waste had the U.S. scrambling for new countries to dump its waste. The U.S. shipped its recyclable plastic and cardboard overseas for more than 25 years and sent China more than 760 million tons of plastic just in 2016. Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines even recently sent waste back to the developed world so as to avoid becoming dumping grounds for rich countries.   ¶In response, cities and towns across the U.S. have scaled back on their recycling programs or dropped them altogether. However, many environmentalists have long said that recycling itself is a poor solution to the world's waste problem. While items like glass bottles can be recycled back into new glass bottles, products made with plastic are often recycled into lower quality plastic goods or aren't accepted by waste management programs. That means recycling barely makes a dent in plastic waste.¶""When they say, 'Reduce, Reuse, Recycle,' 'Recycle' is in the last place for a reason,"" said Michelle Stevens, owner of the Refill Shoppe in Los Angeles, California, which refills products for customers.¶Still in its infancy, whether consumer-goods companies continue to participate in Loop will depend on how subscription users use the service. While the products' prices are expected to remain the same, shoppers will have to pay a deposit for the packaging that will be refunded once the package is returned. The deposit can change depending on the price of packaging.¶For example, Nestlé will charge $6.49 for its Häagen-Dazs ice cream, with a $5 deposit for the container. ""We're assessing the willingness to pay to cover the cost,"" said Kim Peddle Rguem, president of the ice cream division of Nestlé USA.  ¶But Nestlé is hoping that a new stainless-steel ice cream container it has designed will give customers an experience that brings them back. The dual-canister container is supposed to keep the ice cream cold and let it melt from the top once opened, as opposed to the sides. The container itself should be warm to the touch. ¶Rguem declined to say how much Nestlé has invested in Loop or how much it's paying TerraCycle to clean and refill the product. But she said the company has already dedicated one year of time and resources to develop the new packaging. ¶""The fact that it's available in this way, which also reduces waste, is exciting for us,"" Rguem said. ""We know consumers are interested in this.""¶In addition to the five Northeast states, Loop is also available in Maryland, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. It plans to launch in London in September. It expects to expand next year in Canada, Germany and Japan. ",0

It's a topic the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates bring up almost daily, but not one Mr. Trump often addresses.¶But a White House fact sheet obtained by CBS News ahead of the speech did not mention climate change, nor did the president. ¶In his speech, the president claimed his administration is working diligently to improve the environment, insisting the environment and economy go hand-in-hand. The environment can't be strong without a strong economy, Mr. Trump said. The president did tout the importance of forest management to prevent fires in California, and blasted the ""Green New Deal.""¶More in Climate Change¶""While we're focused on practical solutions, more than 100 Democrats in Congress support the so-called Green New Deal,"" the president said. ""Their plan is estimated to cost our economy nearly $100 trillion. A number unthinkable. A number not affordable even in the best of times. If you go 150 years from now, and we've had great success, that's not a number that's even thought to be affordable. Kill millions of jobs, it'll crush the dreams of the poorest Americans and disproportionately harm minority communities. I will not stand for it. We will defend the environment but we will also defend American sovereignty, American prosperity, and we will defend American jobs.""¶The president brought various Cabinet members and supporters on stage in the East Room to tout his administration's work in energy and the environment, and promised to repeat the ""Salute to America"" Fourth of July celebration he held last week. ¶""It was something really special and I will say this it was a wonderful day for all Americans and based on its tremendous success, we're just making the decision, and I think we can say we've made the decision, to do it again next year, and maybe we can say for the foreseeable future,"" the president said. ¶An aide told CBS News the president has been wanting to talk about environmentalism. Axios reported the president's daughter and top adviser, Ivanka Trump, urged him to make the speech. The aide said that Brooke Rollins, a White House staff member who has teamed up with Ivanka Trump's husband, Jared Kushner, on other projects, has also been working on the speech.¶Mr. Trump, over the course of his presidency, has undone much of President Obama's environmental achievements, withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement and rolling back regulations like the Clean Power Plan. The president has also expressed skepticism about government research that shows a warming planet and potentially catastrophic consequences if the trend continues.¶""One of the problems that a lot of people like myself, we have very high levels of intelligence but we're not necessarily such believers,"" the president said in an interview with the Washington Post last year, asked why he was skeptical of the dire National Climate Assessment his administration released. ""As to whether or not it's man-made and whether or not the effects that you're talking about are there, I don't see it,"" he added.¶The president, who campaigned alongside coal miners and oil and gas barons, believes the economic toll of converting energy production from fossil fuels to renewable sources is too great. And he has consistently argued that doing so would put the U.S. at a competitive disadvantage.¶""We are reaching our environmental goals in a manner that also encourages economic growth,"" said a White House fact sheet that was provided to CBS News. The fact sheet did not contain any new environmental initiatives.¶Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler insisted on a conference call with reporters that the air and water are cleaner under the Trump administration. He also insisted the administration cares about climate change. ¶""We are addressing climate change,"" Wheeler told reporters.¶But not all conservatives are keen on how the Trump administration is addressing the environment. ¶Benji Backer, president and founder of the American Conservation Coalition, which participated in Monday's White House event, said the White House hasn't really been on board with environmental reforms, ""so we're trying to help change that and show that conservatives are also on board with environmental reform.""¶The best thing the administration can do, Backer said, is first acknowledge that man-made climate change is a problem, which would ""help set the tone on policy"" because ""so many Republicans toe the Trump line.""¶""We would love to see that. I don't know how realistic that is, but obviously we'd love to see that,"" Backer added.¶According to a fact sheet on the speech obtained by CBS News, Mr. Trump intended to highlight some of the following.

    ","¶If a tree falls in a forest, will replanting it help curb global warming? Scientists say planting a trillion trees globally could be the single most effective way to fight climate change. ¶According to a new study in the journal Science, planting billions of trees around the world would be the cheapest and most effective way to tackle the climate crisis. Since trees absorb carbon dioxide, which contributes to global warming, a worldwide planting initiative could remove a substantial portion of heat-trapping emissions from the atmosphere.¶The researchers say a program at this scale could remove about two-thirds of the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions caused by human activities since the start of the industrial revolution, or nearly 25% of the CO2 in the atmosphere.¶More in Climate Change¶The scientists used Google Earth mapping to determine there is enough space globally to plant more than a trillion trees without interfering with existing farmland or cities. According to the study, an area of trees about the size of the United States could scrub 205 billion metric tons of carbon from the atmosphere — out of the roughly 300 billion metric tons of man-made carbon pollution produced over the past 25 years. ¶Researchers report in Science that Earth could support enough additional trees to cut #carbon levels in the atmosphere by nearly 25%, suggesting that forest restoration could be “the best #ClimateChange solution available.” ($) https://t.co/ecwMmuCyi2 pic.twitter.com/WeNdVXB40k¶""This is by far — by thousands of times — the cheapest climate change solution,"" study co-author Thomas Crowther, a climate change ecologist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, told The Associated Press.¶He stressed the need for urgent action, given how rapidly climate change is already progressing, and said tree planting would have near-immediate results, since trees remove more carbon when they are younger. ¶""It's certainly a monumental challenge, which is exactly the scale of the problem of climate change,"" Crowther said.¶Russia, the United States, Canada, Australia, Brazil and China have the most available room for reforestation. The study's lead author, Jean-Francois Bastin, estimated there's space for at least 1 trillion more trees, and potentially 1.5 trillion, on top of the estimated 3 trillion trees currently on the planet.¶Bastin said reforestation should be the main priority of governments and corporations looking to tackle climate change moving forward. ""They should not only focus on it, but this should be a top priority,"" he told CBS News Friday. ¶But it's not a be-all and end-all solution — Crowther said we still need to stop burning oil, coal and gas to tackle the climate crisis. ""None of this works without emissions cuts,"" he said.¶And rather than adding trees, in many parts of the world they're being cut down on a massive scale. Deforestation is a major concern in the Amazon, where acres of rainforests are being cut down every day to make room for agriculture. There's as much carbon captured and stored in all the trees of the Amazon as the amount the entire planet has emitted over the past 10 years.¶Cut those trees down, and we effectively double the heat-trapping gases of the past decade. So while reforestation may be the best solution, halting deforestation and reducing animal agriculture would also provide immediate benefits. ¶""We need to stop deforestation, otherwise we would restore ecosystems for nothing,"" Bastin said. ""The beautiful thing is that it is a universal issue, it can unify us against a common threat, where anyone can have a role to play, by acting on supporting the restoration of ecosystems, but also by changing the way we are living on the planet."" ¶Stanford University environmental scientist Chris Field, who wasn't involved in the study, told AP its findings make sense but acting on it wouldn't be easy.¶""The question of whether it is actually feasible to restore this much forest is much more difficult,"" Field said in an email.¶BBC News reports other scientists were even more skeptical.¶""Restoration of trees may be 'among the most effective strategies', but it is very far indeed from 'the best climate change solution available,' and a long way behind reducing fossil fuel emissions to net zero,"" said Professor Myles Allen from the University of Oxford.¶And Professor Martin Lukac from the University of Reading said, ""Planting trees to soak up two-thirds of the entire anthropogenic carbon burden to date sounds too good to be true. Probably because it is.""",0
Climate change could mean more pesticides in your wine,"

    ","¶Summer is the perfect time to sit outside and uncork a bottle of chilled white wine or Rosé. But drinkers who prefer European pours, watch out: Much more of it is likely to have been treated with pesticides.¶The culprit? Climate change. ¶Too much greenhouse gas in the atmosphere has led to warmer springs and, in much of the temperate U.S. and in Europe, more humid air and more frequent rain. While warmer temperatures help grapes ripen faster, humidity makes them more prone to pests and diseases, like fungal diseases, mildew and cluster rot. ¶More in Climate Change¶In Germany's Moselle region, prized for its Riesling, farmers are using more pesticides to cope with increased pests, Deutsche Welle reported. Pesticide use in the country increased from 2010 to today. There is little research on whether pesticides applied to grapes stick  around in finished wine. A French study in 2003 found that most French  wines contained at least one pesticide, although at levels that were too  low to do damage. ¶Warmer temperatures aren't just a problem for European wine areas. In New York State, which produces much of America's Riesling, a destabilized climate means grapes bloom and ripen earlier. ""On average, grapes are blooming seven days earlier than in the 1960s,"" said Tim Martinson, a senior extension associate in Cornell University's agricultural division.¶However, it also means unpredictable cold snaps and extreme winters, such as the polar vortex in January. And those cold winters can kill grape vines before they have a chance to bloom. Severe frosts in 2014 and 2015 killed off a great deal of vines at Hunt Country Vineyards, a 38-year winery in New York's Finger Lakes region that emphasizes sustainable winemaking.¶""In 2014, it went down to minus 18 degrees Fahrenheit during the vortex,"" said Suzanne Hunt, a winegrower and sustainability consultant. ""We had enormous amounts of damage and very little harvest in our [European grapes] that year.""¶To head off future frosts, the Hunts have started laying vines along the ground and baling hay around them, keeping them above the minimum temperatures in cold winters. It's a laborious process that adds to the vineyard's costs, Hunt said. ¶European grapes‚ like Riesling, Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Pinor Noir varieties, are better known and command higher prices -- but are also among the most delicate of thousands of grape varieties, showing susceptibility to cold and needing multiple doses of pesticides to stave off disease.¶There is little research on whether pesticides applied to grapes stick  around in finished wine. A French study in 2013 found that most French  wines contained at least one pesticide, although at levels that were too  low to do damage.¶Hunt Country Vineyards has gone the opposite route of many conventional vintners, reducing its pesticide use in favor of better soil management through mulching and composting. The vineyard has installed a full complement of green-energy systems, including over 500 solar panels, geothermal heating and cooling and five electric car chargers.¶In addition to its European-style grapes, the vineyard is also growing native North American and hybrid grape varieties that are more resistant to disease and cold than European counterparts. But getting consumers to accept them is another story. ¶""People go for names. People order chardonnay, they don't order white wine,"" said Martinson. ""At Cornell we have an active breeding program, and we've developed some varieties that have an excellent wine quality, but they don't have the name."" ¶Climate change affects all wine-growing regions, not just the coolest areas. In places like California's Napa Valley, higher temperatures will make some areas too hot for wine cultivation. But it's also expected to open up wine growing possibilities in more northerly latitudes that were previously too cold to grow grapes. ¶""There are a number of wine producers and grape growers in countries like Norway and Sweden that weren't there before,"" said Damien Wilson, chair of the Wine Business Institute at Sonoma State University. Southern England is seeing an influx of wine producers, with a number of growers from France's Champagne region -- now too warm for reliable wine -- buying up land and planting grapes on the southeast coast of England. ¶While many growers find the thought of climate change unbearable -- ""another thing they have no control over"" -- a sliver of a silver lining is the possibility of expanding wine regions. ""We're seeing more climates becoming wine growing-regions,"" Wilson said, ""and you're seeing a lot of innovation.""",0

Residents are being encouraged to kill the animals ""on their own property whenever possible.""¶The state Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission released a statement asking homeowners for their help in tackling the species, which are not native to Florida but thrive in its climate. Residents are encouraged to kill the animals on their property and on 22 public land areas across the state.¶Green iguanas are considered to be invasive based on the damage they have caused to seawalls, sidewalks and landscape plants. They do not pose a threat to humans and can be kept as pets in Florida. ¶More in Climate Change¶""Green iguanas can cause damage to residential and commercial landscape vegetation, and are often considered a nuisance by property owners,"" the statement said.¶Because green iguanas are not protected in Florida — except by anti-cruelty law — homeowners do not need a permit to kill them on their own property. The statement does not specify how the iguanas should be killed, but it does say that trapped ones can be euthanized in some cases.¶Green iguanas are native to Central America, tropical parts of South America and some eastern Caribbean islands. Females can lay nearly 80 eggs per year, and the animals can live up to 10 years in the wild.¶PETA wrote a letter to state officials Friday urging them to more effectively regulate the possession of green iguanas. The animal rights organization said that, if authorities want to continue telling the public to kill iguanas, they should properly inform them of the most humane methods to do so. ¶""This cruel and ineffective advice sentences iguanas to painful deaths at the hands of people who are wholly unprepared to end the animals' lives humanely,"" PETA Foundation VP and Deputy General Counsel Lori Kettler told CBS News in a statement. ""PETA is calling on Florida officials to withdraw this call to kill immediately and to take logical, sensible regulatory steps to reduce the iguana population statewide.""¶Green iguanas aren't the only invasive species whose populations are growing exponentially in Florida. The conservation commission recently announced its ""Python Action Team"" had captured its 500th invasive Burmese python from the wild, a ""significant milestone for this program.""¶Climate change is greatly exacerbating the threats posed by invasive species.

    ","¶The extreme heat wave that's been scorching Europe in triple-digit temperatures may be up to 100 times more likely to occur today than it was in 1900, according to a new study from team of scientists at World Weather Attribution. Additionally, the analysis finds the heat wave was 7 degrees Fahrenheit hotter than it would have been in the early 20th century.¶A climate attribution study is an analysis specifically designed to determine the likelihood of an extreme weather event, especially as it relates to the contribution from human-caused global heating. ¶On Monday the heat wave began to ease, but not before shattering several remarkable records. In France, the city of Gallargues-le-Montueux, near the city of Nîmes, hit 114.6 F — breaking the country's all-time heat record, set in 2003, by an astounding 3 degrees F.  In fact, an impressive 14  weather stations surpassed or tied the country's all-time heat record. ¶More in Climate Change¶France was not alone. Germany, Switzerland, Lichtenstein, the Czech Republic, Luxembourg and Andorra all set new all-time June heat records. On Sunday the mercury soared to 103.3 F in Bernburg, Germany — the highest temperature recorded anywhere in that country in the month of June. In Austria and the Netherlands, it was the warmest June ever recorded. Furthermore, hundreds of individual towns and cities across Europe broke their June or all-time heat records.¶Of course, summer heat waves are nothing new, but a growing body of scientific evidence shows they're becoming more frequent and more extreme.¶To conduct the analysis on what role climate change may have played, the team defined the heat wave as a three-day average of daily mean temperatures over the whole country of France and also one individual city, Toulouse. They performed a statistical analysis on the observation records and a study using climate models.¶The observational analysis concludes that the June 2019 heat wave was around 100 times more likely now than it would have been in the year 1901. Also, the temperatures of the heat wave would have been around 7 degrees cooler at that time.¶Next, to determine the contribution from heat-trapping greenhouse gasses in the environment, the team compared the observations with results from various climate models. The study concludes, ""All models and observations qualitatively agree on a strong human influence in increasing heatwave risk.""¶Specifically, the model average shows, at minimum, humans have made this heat wave 5 times more likely —  but some models show more than a 100-fold increase. The models also show that human-caused climate change contributed an extra 3 to 4 degrees F to the heat wave temperatures, as compared to 1900.¶A factor of 5 times greater ""is most likely a conservative estimate, while the best estimate would likely be substantially higher,"" one of the authors of the report, Sonia I. Seneviratne of the Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science at ETH Zürich, told CBS News.¶Another of the authors, climate scientist Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, explained that climate models tend to have biases in representing heat waves at these small space and time scales, consequently showing fewer severe heat waves. ""The big problem is that the models simulate heat waves that look different from observed ones. This can be due to other effects influencing the observations or to the models misrepresenting some physics that is needed for these extreme events,"" he said.¶Oldenborgh said the models ""do fine on monthly mean temperatures,"" which is a larger time frame, ""just not on 1-day or 3-day extreme heat waves.""¶CBS News also asked Oldenborgh whether his analysis found any sign that changes in atmospheric steering patterns, or wavier jet streams caused by abnormally fast warming in the Arctic, contributed to this heat wave. In response, he said, ""We found no change in the statistics of the weather pattern that caused this heat wave, so no connection with wavy or resonant jet streams for this event.""¶Jet stream changes due to warming is a growing area of climate research which is hotly debated among climate scientists. CBS News reached out to Professor Michael Mann from Penn State University, who studies this phenomenon, for his opinion on the influence of steering patterns.¶Mann feels the methods used in this study do not sufficiently detect the changing steering patterns. ""The approach used by this group is deficient in its inability to account for such factors. As a result, they systematically underestimate the role that climate change is playing with these events,"" he said.¶Mann continues, ""The problem with their attribution analysis is that they can only attribute mechanisms resolved by their models. As we showed in our Science Advances article last year, the models fail to resolve the jet stream dynamics behind many of these events.""¶Although the two scientists may disagree on some of the specifics, they do agree that society's dependence on the burning of fossil fuels, and the heating it causes, are fueling more severe heat waves and extreme weather in general.",0

On Friday, many cities near the Mediterranean exceeded 111 degrees Fahrenheit, shattering the former all-time year-round record of 111 degrees set back in 2003.¶Météo-France, the equivalent of the U.S. National Weather Service, certified a high of 114.6 degrees in the southern city of Gallargues-le-Montueux in the Provence region.¶#Canicule Des températures très élevées relevées cet après-midi sur une large partie du pays.

It was his 1988 congressional testimony on climate change that first brought greater awareness of the dangers of human-caused environmental changes.¶During his testimony more than 30 years ago, Hansen said he believed with 99 percent accuracy that humans were causing a worldwide increase in temperatures. The former NASA scientist told CBS News he believes extreme heat waves such as in France have become more common because of human activity.¶""In dry subtropics such as the Mediterranean area, the [temperature distribution] shift in the summer is so large that events as extreme as those of 2003 and 2019 now have a probability of happening that is at least a couple of orders of magnitude (factor ~100 or more) greater than it was in the climate without human influence,"" Hansen said.¶""In other words, the chance of those extreme events in the pre-industrialized world was not zero, but it was negligibly small compared to the chance today,"" Hansen continued. ""So you can say with a very high degree of confidence that this extreme event is a consequence of human-made climate change.""¶For several days now, a strong storm system has been parked west of Portugal. It has been stuck in an atmospheric blocking pattern — kind of like a traffic jam — continually pumping hot air from Northern Africa into Europe.¶#HEATWAVE2019 in #Europe caused by spinning low pressure west of Portugal pumping heat north from Africa.

NAO block, which is a normal cycle BUT is likely being enhanced by Arctic Amplification due to human-forced #climate change. pic.twitter.com/vZZvutpuaA¶For the past two months, the Northern Hemisphere has been locked in what is called the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The NAO is partly related to warm high pressure over Greenland. When this kind of pattern occurs, the jet stream across the Northern Atlantic Ocean is deflected and becomes more amplified, or intense fluctuations.¶In this type of setup, systems tend to slow down or even break free from the jet stream and stall out. Meteorologists call this a ""blocking pattern."" This has led to a record-breaking upper-level high pressure (what's known as a ""heat ridge"") over Europe.¶Europe is currently under historically strong upper ridge.¶Sounding from Payerne, Switzerland just recorded 500-hPa height of 5987 gpm, which is hands down the highest reading ever recorded in Switzerland (soundings began in 1943). pic.twitter.com/CjKSbaUCkR¶While this kind of weather pattern and the fluctuations in atmospheric winds that contribute to them occur naturally, there's growing evidence that amplified steering patterns are becoming more common because of human-caused climate change.¶Michael Mann is a Distinguished Professor of Atmospheric Sciences at Penn State University. He has studied and published cutting-edge research on the topic of climate change. Mann says that the current setup responsible for the record heat in Europe is indeed associated with something he calls ""planetary wave resonance"" — a widely meandering, slowed jet stream that favors stalled weather systems leading to ""more frequent persistent weather extremes like we are seeing right now.""¶compare current jet stream to diagram from @MichaelEMann @sciam pic.twitter.com/V3CrlqQMLW¶Mann says his research confirms the human fingerprint on these amplified patterns: ""Extreme warmth in the Arctic and the loss of Arctic sea ice due to human-caused climate change, favors this jet stream pattern and indeed we are right now witnessing record Arctic warmth and record-low sea ice for so early in the season.""¶A group of scientists are meeting about extreme heat in the heart of the heat wave in Toulouse. The team led by Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, a climate expert with the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute, has already initiated an on-the-fly ""attribution study."" This kind of study is designed to tease out the contribution from human-caused climate change.¶In an interview with BBC, Oldenborgh said, ""Heat waves are becoming more common in Europe for sure. We better get used to it because they will get worse in the future.""¶Since this attribution study is being done quickly, its scope will be limited to examining statistical properties of the temperatures. Scientists will not be looking into circulation changes as referred to by Michael Mann, but that is part of Oldenborgh's longer-term goal. ¶On Monday, Oldenborgh's team will run the numbers and reach a conclusion as to what extent climate change contributed to this particular heat wave. He said the group's forthcoming statement will show how much more likely this heat wave was to occur because of climate change.¶via GIPHY¶Since climate change is not the sole cause of extreme weather events, expressing how much more likely an event was made by global warming is a common way to put its contribution into perspective.¶For instance, in 2003 more than 70,000 people were killed in a disastrous European heat wave. In a landmark first attribution study, the 2003 heat wave was found to be at least twice as likely because of climate change.¶Summers are indeed getting hotter in Europe. Climate scientist Stefan Rahmstorf from the Potsdam University in Germany said the five hottest summers since 1500 AD have all occurred since 2002, the hottest being 2018.¶The hottest summers since 1500 AD in Europe were: 2018, 2010, 2003, 2016, 2002. Each summer gets one vertical line, the histogram (grey steps) shows how frequent summers were in each temperature interval.

    ","¶For the first time, the U.S. has generated more energy from renewables than from coal, marking a landmark for non-polluting energy.¶A full 22% of the electricity generated in the U.S. in April came from renewable sources like wind, solar, hydroelectric and geothermal power, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which released the official figures this week after early projections emerged in May. Just 20% of power production in April came from coal.¶The shift away from King Coal is due to seasonal factors as well as a long-running decline in the number of U.S. coal plants. In the U.S., late spring and early fall typically see the lowest electricity use because of reduced demand for heating and cooling. Meanwhile, generation of hydroelectric—the largest source of renewable electricity—""tends to peak in the spring as melting snowpack results in increased water supply at downstream generators,"" the EIA said. ¶Meanwhile, coal—considered the dirtiest electricity source—has been in a long-term decline, with use of the rock dropping to a 41-year low this year. Despite the Trump administration's efforts to prop up the industry, 51 coal plants have closed since the 2016 election. Eight coal companies have filed for bankruptcy protection in the past four years.¶More in Climate Change¶""Economics are so in favor of clean energy, the president can't really reverse it at this stage -- the economics are fundamentally so strong,"" Amy Francetic, founder of Energize Ventures, a technology-focused venture fund, told CBS MoneyWatch previously. ¶Cheap natural gas—considered a less polluting fuel—has been the primary driver of coal plant unprofitability, but the dramatic price drop of completely renewable energy has also played a part in the last few years. ¶""We've seen gas creating competition for coal for a while, but now we have renewables getting cheap,"" Mary Anne Hitt, director of the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal campaign, told CB MoneyWatch recently.¶In most of the U.S., it's now cheaper to build a new solar or wind farm than to keep an existing coal plant open. A number of states have passed laws this year moving aggressively toward carbon-free electricity, including New York, Washington, Colorado, Nevada and New Mexico, putting added economic pressure on existing fossil-fuel plants.¶""Coal plants in the Southwest are finding that they're surrounded by states with 100% clean energy mandates, or they're just too expensive,"" Hitt said. ""They're not finding new customers.""¶U.S. government projections indicate that the month of May should see a similar trend for renewable power, and then coal generation ticking up again for the remainder of the year.

Smoke from wildfires increases health risks for millions of Americans,"

    ","¶Climate change in the Western U.S. means more intense and frequent wildfires churning out waves of smoke that scientists say will sweep across the continent to affect tens of millions of people and cause a spike in premature deaths.¶That emerging reality is prompting people in cities and rural areas alike to prepare for another summer of sooty skies along the West Coast and in the Rocky Mountains — the regions widely expected to suffer most from blazes tied to dryer, warmer conditions.¶Other sources of air pollution are in decline in the U.S. as coal-fired power plants close and fewer older cars roll down highways. But those air quality gains are being erased in some areas by the ill effects of massive clouds of smoke that can spread hundreds and even thousands of miles on cross-country winds, according to researchers.¶More in Climate Change¶With the 2019 wildfire season already heating up and fires breaking out from Southern California through Canada to Alaska, authorities are scrambling to better protect the public before smoke again blankets cities and towns. Officials in Seattle recently announced plans to retrofit five public buildings as smoke-free shelters.¶Scientists from NASA and universities are refining satellite imagery to predict where smoke will travel and how intense it will be. Local authorities are using those forecasts to send out real-time alerts encouraging people to stay indoors when conditions turn unhealthy.¶The scope of the problem is immense: Over the next three decades, more than 300 counties in the West will see more severe smoke waves from wildfires, sometimes lasting weeks longer than in years past, according to atmospheric researchers led by a team from Yale and Harvard.¶Smoke from wildfires was once considered a fleeting nuisance except for the most vulnerable populations. But it's now seen in some regions as a recurring and increasing public health threat, said James Crooks, a health investigator at National Jewish Health, a Denver medical center that specializes in respiratory ailments.¶""There are so many fires, so many places upwind of you that you're getting increased particle levels and increased ozone from the fires for weeks and weeks,"" Crooks said.¶Harder to grasp are health impacts from microscopic particles in the smoke that can trigger heart attacks, breathing problems and other maladies. The particles, about 1/30th of the diameter of a human hair, penetrate deeply into the lungs to cause coughing, chest pain and asthma attacks. Children, the elderly and people with lung diseases or heart trouble are most at risk.¶Death can occur within days or weeks among the most vulnerable following heavy smoke exposure, said Linda Smith, chief of the California Air Resources Board's health branch.¶Over the past decade as many as 2,500 people annually died prematurely in the U.S. from short-term wildfire smoke exposure, according to Environmental Protection Agency scientists.¶The long-term effects have only recently come into focus, with estimates that chronic smoke exposure causes about 20,000 premature deaths per year, said Jeff Pierce, an associate professor of atmospheric science at Colorado State University.¶That figure could double by the end of this century due to hotter, drier conditions and much longer fire seasons, said Pierce.",0
Oregon Republicans walk out on state Senate over climate change bill as governor threatens police roundup,"

    ","¶Salem, Oregon — Republican state senators in Oregon continued to engage in a high-stakes game of brinksmanship over the weekend with Democratic lawmakers, remaining away from the capitol and threatening a lawsuit over a $500-per-day fine from the Senate president. At the center of the debate is a climate change bill.¶Eleven Republican senators fled the Legislature — and in some cases, the state — to thwart the passage of a cap-and-trade proposal that would dramatically lower greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The minority GOP caucus wants the plan to be sent to voters instead of being instituted by lawmakers — but negotiations with Democrats collapsed, leading to a headline-grabbing walkout.¶Portland, Oregon, affiliate KOIN-TV reported a Sunday morning Senate session promptly adjourned because only 18 members showed up, as 11 Republican senators are still not participating. The Oregon State Senate is made up of 30 senators: 18 Democrats and 11 Republicans. Republican Jackie Winters died last month and has not yet been replaced.¶More in Climate Change¶Because the Republican walkout has prevented the 20 senator quorum in the Senate, legislation cannot be passed in a legislative session scheduled by law to end on June 30. ¶In a dramatic move on Thursday, Governor Kate Brown authorized the state police to round up and bring back the missing state senators. According to KOIN-TV, Brown said she will call a special session if Republicans ""run out the clock.""¶Carol Currie, a spokeswoman for Senate President Peter Courtney, confirmed that each missing senator was hit with a $500 fine Friday morning, which will be renewed each day they continue to delay a vote. She said in an email that ""they will receive a bill for the amount owed.""¶Republicans immediately pushed back. ""We will file legal action,"" said Sen. Tim Knopp, a Republican from Bend who has said he has been in three states in the past three days. ""If they were trying to bring us back, threatening to arrest us and impose fines isn't going to work.""¶Senate Majority Leader Ginny Burdick, a Democrat, said Republicans have no legal recourse as the fine is explicitly written in statute. A GoFundMe to cover the rogue lawmakers' expenses and fines raised nearly $40,000 between Thursday and Sunday. State ethics laws prohibit officials from receiving gifts exceeding $50, so it's unclear whether senators could access the money.¶State Police can force any senators they track down in Oregon into a patrol car to return them to the Capitol, although the agency said in a statement that it would use ""polite communication"" and patience to bring the rogue lawmakers back. The state police don't have jurisdiction outside Oregon. But the Oregon State Police confirmed Thursday evening it was working with out of state agencies to track down the Republicans.¶Under the proposed cap-and-trade bill, Oregon would put an overall limit on greenhouse gas emissions and auction off pollution ""allowances"" for each ton of carbon industries plan to emit. The legislation would lower that cap over time to encourage businesses to move away from fossil fuels: The state would reduce emissions to 45 percent below 1990 levels by 2035 and 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.¶Those opposed to the cap-and-trade plan say it would exacerbate a growing divide between the liberal, urban parts of the state and the rural areas. The plan would increase the cost of fuel, damaging small business, truckers and the logging industry, they say.¶Democrats say the measure is an efficient way to lower emissions while investing in low-income and rural communities' ability to adapt to climate change. It has the support of environmental groups, farmworkers and some trade unions.¶The walkout also puts other major Democratic priorities on hold, including affordable housing, tobacco taxes and paid family leave. Legislation addressing these topics sailed through the House Thursday, but their fate remains uncertain with the Senate shutdown.¶This is the second time in this legislative session that minority GOP lawmakers have used a walkout as a way to slow the process. Democrats have a rare supermajority in the House and Senate, meaning Republicans don't have many ways to influence the debate.",0

    ","¶New Delhi -- Millions of people in the South Indian city of Chennai, the country's sixth largest metropolis, are facing an acute water shortage as the main reservoirs have dried up after a poor monsoon season. Some schools in the city have cut working hours and dozens of hotels and some restaurants have reportedly shut down due to the shortage. ¶The city of more than 4.5 million has been left to rely on wells and water brought in by truck. Thousands of wells dug across the city are leading to a rapid drop in the ground water level, and raising even further the concerns of environmentalists. ¶New wells are being dug as deep as 1,000 feet. Much of the water they produce isn't even fit to drink. ¶More in Climate Change¶""We have been facing this for the past two months,"" Aditya Manoharan, a student in Chennai, told CBS News. ""The bore well water is so dirty that it's yellow in color. We can't drink it."" ¶The well water can be used for washing, but residents have to buy bottled drinking water, and not everyone can afford it. ¶In parts of the city that don't have wells, water has been supplied by government trucks. Long lines of people waiting with buckets to collect from the trucks have become a common sight. ¶But the government trucks are only able to meet part of the demand, leaving the rest of the population at the mercy of private vendors, who appear to be making a killing off the crisis. A private truck carrying about 3,200 gallons of water would have cost around 1,500 Rupees (about $22) in April. Now such a delivery is going for about $85. ¶Reghu Ram, a filmmaker who has lived in the city for eight years, told CBS News the cost of such a private water supply ""would mean about 50% of the monthly income of a significant part of the population.""¶Ram sent his parents, with whom he had lived in the city, back to their hometown until the water crisis is resolved. That's not expected to happen until October or November, when the rains should begin again.¶All four of the primary reservoirs that supply water to the city have dried up, either partly or completely. ¶On Tuesday, K. Palaniswami, chief minister of Tamil Nadu state where Chennai is located, acknowledged the crisis would continue for about five more months. ""Until then we have to meet the requirements only from groundwater sources,"" he said. ¶""The water table in Chennai is seriously compromised,"" ecologist and biodiversity expert Dr. Jayashree Vencatesan told CBS News. ""There is rampant extraction through bore wells in south Chennai. There are no guidelines; things are in a mess."" ¶Vencatesan has studied 200 years worth of data on Chennai's monsoon seasons. She told CBS News the data analysis by herself and other researchers at the Care Earth Trust show a marked change around nine years ago; while the overall amount of rain has remained roughly the same, the number of days with rainfall have reduced drastically. In other words, more days with severe downpours and less steady, sustained rainfall. That leads to more quick runoff and less flowing in a controlled way into reservoirs.¶""This may be a case of climate change,"" she said. ¶Climate scientists have warned that the increase in average global temperatures appears to be causing earlier melting of Arctic ice, which can have a broad impact on the Earth's climate over the course of a year -- bringing exactly the kind of dramatic changes in weather patterns that the data from India reflect.¶While this year's monsoon will likely bring relief in the autumn, environmentalists believe there needs to be a long-term water conservation plan to avoid such crises in the future -- not just in Chennai but across India. ¶""Water needs to be treated as a highly limited resource,"" Vencatesan said. ""There is a gap between government policy and the implementation."" ¶An alarming report last year by the Indian government's own research institute, NITI Aayog, warned that 21 Indian cities, including New Delhi, Chennai, Bengaluru, and Hyderabad, would run out of groundwater by 2020. ¶The report also said 40% of India's 1.34 billion people would have no access to drinking water by 2030. More than 600 million Indians are facing ""acute water shortage"" already, according to the report. ",0
Spy satellites reveal Himalayan glaciers losing ground to climate change,"

    ","¶Keeping watch over ice on the Himalayan glaciers was certainly not the intended mission of a U.S. spy satellite program, called Hexagon, which operated from 1971 to 1986. Nevertheless, the declassified photos have revealed a rapid acceleration of Himalayan ice melt — doubling in just one generation. ¶A new study by Columbia University's Earth Institute finds the glaciers have been losing 20 vertical inches of ice per year since 2000, double the rate of the late 20th century. To put that into perspective, the recent amount of ice lost each year is enough to fill 3.2 million Olympic-size swimming pools and more than enough to supply drinking water to every person on Earth for longer than a lifetime. ¶To reach these conclusions, lead author Joshua Maurer and his team took a unique approach. They analyzed 40 years of satellite images of 650 glaciers spanning 1,200 miles across India, China, Nepal and Bhutan. Much of the 20th-century data came from images taken by U.S. spy satellites. The researchers then created a system to automatically turn these images into 3D models in order to measure the changing elevations of glaciers over time. They then compared these images with more recent data from newer satellites to determine ice volume changes.¶

¶Rapid melting matters for various reasons, including the short-term potential for flooding, long-term fresh water shortages, and changes in weather patterns due to the immense size and influence of the Himalayan range. ¶More in Climate Change¶Another recent study estimates that water flowing down the mountains each year from 2000 to 2016 was 1.6 times greater because of excess melting.  As a result, meltwater lakes are swelling rapidly behind natural dams. These are threatening downstream communities with potentially destructive ""glacial lake outburst floods."" In Pakistan alone, the U.N. estimates 7.1 million people are at risk. ¶As the glaciers continue to diminish, the concern will shift away from flooding and towards water shortages. It is estimated that around 800 million people depend on seasonal runoff from Himalayan glaciers for irrigation, hydropower and drinking water. ¶Dr. Ben Orlove is an anthropologist at the International Research Institute for Climate and Society at Columbia University and creator of GlacierHub, a comprehensive source for all things glacier related. Orlove explains that the seasonal cycle of glacial melt is vital to extend Himalayan communities' growing season and to better cope with dry years. ¶""Some villages have already been forced to move because glacier retreat has reduced their supply of irrigation water to levels that are unviable, and many more are threatened,"" Orlove said. ¶And while drinking water shortages are not widespread yet, they do exist. ¶""Drinking water is already reported as a problem in some villages in Nepal,"" said Orlove. ""In steep mountain topography, alternate water supplies are often distant, hard to get to, and hard to haul water over."" In these cases, people can be forced to migrate. Although a warming climate is not always the primary reason, Orlove says, ""We are seeing cases where climate change is the key factor, and it promotes greater rates of outmigration.""¶Maurer agrees that human-caused climate change is the overarching reason for the fast melting. From 2000 to 2016, temperatures in the region have increased by 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit as compared to the period 1975 to 2000. Maurer says the melting,""looks just like what we would expect if warming were the dominant driver of ice loss.""¶Another factor for the melting is black carbon. Increasingly, Asian nations are burning record amounts of fossil fuels and biomass, launching soot into the sky. That soot eventually lands on white glacial surfaces, turning them black, which absorbs more sunlight and accelerates melting. The change between 1975 and 2007 can be seen below, with significantly less ice in 2007. The trend has accelerated in recent years.",0

    ","¶A dangerous flesh-eating bacteria may be on the rise at some popular East Coast beaches due to warming water temperatures. In the past two years, five cases of Vibrio vulnificus, a flesh-eating bacterial infection that is spread by handling or eating contaminated seafood, have been linked to Delaware Bay, according to a study.¶Vibrio vulnificus usually occurs in high-salinity, brackish waters with surface temperatures above 13 degrees Celsius, or 55 degrees Fahrenheit, the study says. It has typically been found in the warm waters of the Gulf Coast and southern states like Louisiana and Texas, especially during the months from May to October.¶Vibrio vulnificus causes about 205 infections in the United States every year the CDC estimates. The CDC also said it is important to learn more about the harmful bacteria if you live in areas where hurricanes, storm surges and coastal flooding are possible. The most common cause of infection is eating raw or undercooked shellfish, particularly oysters.¶More in Climate Change¶The bacteria is endemic along the southeastern U.S. coast, but has also been found in the Chesapeake Bay, according to the study, published Monday in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine. The illness rarely occurs in the cooler waters of the Delaware Bay and Jersey Shore, but the researchers say it is becoming more frequent due to climate change.¶The five patients infected in Delaware were all treated at Cooper University Hospital in Camden, New Jersey over the last two years. Before that, the hospital had seen only one case of severe Vibrio infection in eight years, Dr. Katherine Doktor, an infectious disease specialist at Cooper University Health Care, told CNN.¶These cases serve as a warning that flesh-destroying bacterial infections are now occurring outside the traditional geographic boundaries, the authors of the study said. One of the five patients died.¶""It is important for physicians — who may have never seen this infection before in their medical practice — to have some awareness,"" Doktor, a co-author of the study, said.¶The study notes that the past three decades have seen a significant increase in sea surface temperatures in many areas of the United States, resulting in ""longer summer seasons and ... alterations in the quantity, distribution, and seasonal windows of bacteria"" in the coastal ecosystem, providing ""more favorable conditions for Vibrio.""¶""While the infection is still rare, it is being seen with more frequency in this region,"" Doktor explained.¶The five Delaware patients experienced a number of different symptoms after becoming infected. A 38-year-old man experienced vomiting, a fever and a skin rash on his left calf. His blood cultures confirmed a Vibrio infection, although it was already evident by his dying skin, the study says. He had not been near Delaware Bay, but it is believed he became infected while working at a New Jersey restaurant that served seafood from the bay.¶A 46-year-old man became infected after going crabbing in Delaware Bay. A 60-year-old man had done the same, and became infected after making a meal of a dozen crabs; he ended up having to have parts of all four limbs amputated. A 64-year-old man became infected after cutting his leg on crab trap in the Delaware Bay.¶Another 64-year-old man became infected after cleaning Delaware Bay crabs with his hands. He ultimately died.¶Other medical conditions like diabetes or hepatitis likely made some of the men more susceptible to infection when they were exposed to the bacteria, the study said. Health officials say recommend keeping open wounds covered with clean, dry bandages until healed to avoid bacterial skin infection.¶""Water and wounds do not mix. Do not enter the water if you have fresh cuts or scrapes,"" the Florida Department of Health warns.",0

    ","¶Dogs walking on water? No, but a photo snapped by climate researchers on the melting Greenland ice sheet has highlighted the ""very warm conditions"" in the Arctic this summer — and it is a dramatic image.¶Scientists from the Denmark Meteorological Institute (DMI) have been monitoring the thickness of the Greenland ice sheet for years. Every year before the ice melts they slide out onto the sheet on dogsleds — usually traversing ice — to collect their instruments before they're swallowed up by the ocean.¶""This year the expedition to retrieve the instruments ran into a lot of standing water on the sea ice,"" DMI climate researcher Ruth Mottram told CBS News. ""The ice here forms pretty reliably every winter and is very thick which means that there are relatively few fractures for meltwater to drain through. Last week saw the onset of very warm conditions in Greenland and in fact much of the rest of the Arctic, driven by warmer air moving up from the south... This led to a lot of melting ice, both on the glaciers and ice sheet and on the still existing sea ice.""¶She said the temperatures last week, when the photos of the dogs wading through ankle-deep water were taken, hit about 63 degrees, according to preliminary — ""pretty warm for Northern Greenland, even in summer,"" according to Mottram. ¶The DMI researchers were careful to note, however, that it was too soon to attribute the wet dog teams directly to wider global warming. They stressed that it isn't unusual to see standing water on the ice sheet — but it generally comes at least a couple weeks later in the summer.¶More in Climate Change¶As CBSN reported Sunday for a Climate Watch segment, Greenland had a warm snap last week that saw temperatures more than 40 degrees above average, leading to an estimated 2 billion tons of ice loss.¶Experts believe the sudden and dramatic loss of ice this early in the summer could have a significant impact on weather across the planet.¶Ted Scambos, a senior research scientist at the University of Colorado - Boulder's Earth Science Observation Center told CBSN that the Arctic takes the relatively small increase in global average temperatures ""and amplifies it.""¶He said the earlier onset of snow and ice melt in the region ""allow the surface (of the Earth) to absorb more heat, and lead to more melting,"" which can throw the entire balance of the planet's climatic machinery out of whack.¶""There is warmth in the tropical regions and the poles are supposed to be cold, and white and radiate a lot of heat away, and that sets up a big circulation pattern that leads to all the things we think are common to weather,"" including the direction storms usually blow in from and the prevailing wind currents. ¶""Those things happen because the poles are cold, and if we start to warm the poles, and change that ice cover, we change the entire dynamic of the Earth's climate,"" said Scambos. ""That's beginning to happen, with more severe storms, more persistent weather patterns, longer droughts; all that stuff is dependent on the fact that the ice on the ocean in the Arctic and the ice on Greenland are more or less the way they used to be, or we're going to see big changes.""¶Scambos said it's not too late to ""put the brakes on"" the rate of climate change and sea level rise, however. ¶""We're going to roll into a warmer climate at the end of the century, but we don't have to careen into it at breakneck speed,"" he told CBSN. ""That's the thing that I think is being pitched more widely by the scientific community; let's adapt, let's mitigate and let's get started on a path that's slowing down the pace of global warming. That's the most important thing.""",0

Some swim in waters as shallow as waist-deep.¶""Hundreds of thousands of people every single day on the beaches of North Carolina.

    ","¶Investors are increasingly focused on the environmental impact of the companies they back — if that can readily be determined.¶To that end, a consortium of investors on Monday urged more than 700 companies to detail their plans for dealing with climate change. Nearly 90 banks, pension funds and money managers are calling on the businesses to disclose their level of greenhouse-gas emissions and to explain how they will adjust both to global warming and the transition to a low-carbon economy. ¶Targets of the campaign include household corporate names such as Berkshire Hathaway, Facebook, Netflix, PayPal and Tesla. Investors are also leaning on fossil-fuel companies, including BP, Chevron and ExxonMobil that formerly disclosed their environmental impact but no longer do.¶More in Climate Change¶""Investors are telling companies, 'This disclosure is important to us — please explain why you did not disclose or please disclose your climate change impact,'"" said Emily Kreps, global director of investor initiatives at CDP, a nonprofit that provides a platform for corporations to disclose their environmental risks.¶The 88 investors behind the campaign manage a total of nearly $10 trillion in funds.¶""Climate change, deforestation and water security are critical challenges that require immediate action,"" Sophia Cheng, chief investment officer at Cathay Financial Holdings, said in a statement.

But because it's not in the standardized format CDP asks for, it's harder for investors to parse, CDP argues.¶Amazon, which has long drawn fire from some investors for its environmental record, has set a goal of producing zero emissions in the long run. At the same time, the online retailer hasn't specified a deadline to reach that target.¶Electric car maker Tesla, whose mission statement calls for ""accelerating the world to sustainable energy,"" publishes figures on how many tons of carbon emission its vehicles have saved. But it hasn't filled out CDP's extensive questionnaire, which asks companies to quantify the carbon emissions along its supply chain and detail how various aspects of their operations could be affected by effects from climate change. For that, CDP gives it an F.¶""We would really like to see Tesla disclose, and we think they have a lot of value to demonstrate—they're different than a traditional combustion-engine car,"" Kreps said. ""But an investor evaluating the company would want to know, how do we compare Tesla to, say, Ford?""¶Ford, incidentally, gets a grade of A- from CPP.

    ",CBS News,"June 14, 2019, 9:40 AM","¶House Minority Whip Rep. Steve Scalise sidestepped questions about whether humans contribute to the growing climate change crisis. During an exchange with ""CBS This Morning"" co-anchor Tony Dokoupil on Friday, the GOP Louisiana representative was pressed on whether the climate problem facing the country was man made or not.  ¶""Scientists have agreed that climate change is a catastrophic risk, do you have a plan, as some other members of your party are beginning to to address it?"" Dokoupil asked. ¶""First of all, we do know that the earth's temperature changes -- it goes up and down,"" said Scalise. Dokoupil asked, ""So you don't accept the science?""¶""In the 1970's, they said we were entering a new cooling period,"" Scalise replied, without offering any firm plans to address global warming. NASA points out that Earth's average surface temperature has risen 1.62 degrees since the late 19th century and states that most of the warming took place ""in the past 35 years, with the five warmest years on record taking place since 2010.""¶Lawmakers have recently turned their attention to climate, as scientists grow more concerned about the rise in Earth's temperature. The House of Representatives has formed a new Select Committee on the Climate Crisis to address potential legislative fixes to the climate crisis. ¶Dokoupil also pressed Scalise on findings by the Environmental Defense Fund that his own state of Louisiana is slipping into the Gulf of Mexico at a rate equivalent of a football field of land per hour. Scalise countered that the startling statistic is more an effect of ""coastal erosion,"" and not explicitly an effect of climate change. ¶""Your own scientists say it's manmade,"" Dokoupil said, referring to research based in Louisiana.  ¶With consistently warming oceans and climates, particularly in the Gulf, residents have recently seen devastating flooding and hurricanes take effect. But Scalise declined to attribute the rise in extreme weather events to any human action. ¶""Let me tell you what we're doing -- we're actually taking revenues from drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and using that to rebuild land to rebuild our coast,"" Scalise replied.

"Bitcoin emits as much carbon as Las Vegas, researchers say","

    ","¶Bitcoin is responsible for  the same amount of carbon dioxide emissions as a city like Las Vegas or  Hamburg, and it's time to consider how to reduce its climate footprint, researchers said Thursday.¶A study by researchers at the Technical University of Munich and the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology examined how much power is  consumed by computers used to generate bitcoins and process  transactions.¶Writing in the journal Joule, researchers said they then combined the  results with the carbon emissions from electricity production in the  countries where the computers were located.¶More in Climate Change¶They concluded that, in late 2018, the entire bitcoin network was  responsible for 22-22.9 million tons of CO2 per year — similar to a  large Western city or an entire developing country like Sri Lanka. Total  global emissions of the greenhouse gas from the burning of fossil fuels  were about 37 billion tons last year.¶""There are bigger factors contributing to climate change,"" said  Christian Stoll, one of the study's authors. ""However, the carbon  footprint is big enough to make it worth discussing the possibility of  regulating cryptocurrency mining in regions where power generation is  especially carbon-intensive."" ¶The process of generating, or mining, a bitcoin involves solving a series of complex mathematical problems, which takes a lot of computing power. According to some estimates, more than half of the power used for bitcon resides in China, which still relies heavily on coal for electricity. ¶The Joule study found that about 68% of the computing power used to  generate bitcoins is in Asia, 17% is in Europe and 15% is in  North America.¶Alex de Vries, a bitcoin researcher who wasn't involved in the study,  questioned whether the method used to determine the location of  computers was reliable enough. But he said the emission figures were consistent with those he  had calculated using a different method, and could even be on  the low end.¶""The folks in this study were very conservative on the energy side,"" he told The Associated Press. ¶Previous studies have put bitcoin's energy use even higher. Researchers writing in Nature Climate Change last year warned that large-scale bitcoin mining could push the Earth's climate past the 2-degree warming limit that scientists say must be observed to avoid irreversible damage. ¶The environmental impact of bitcoin—the most popular virtual currency—is growing as a concern, especially since its adoption has been limited. Still, a few big-name retailers, including Whole Foods, Lowe's, Nordstrom, Ulta and Bed Bath & Beyond have started accepting bitcoin as payment. Facebook is also expected to launch its own cryptocurrency later this year.  ¶Last year the bitcoin network processed about 81 million  transactions, compared to 500 billion transactions handled by the  regular global banking system, said de Vries.¶""If you look at the carbon footprint per transaction, that's where  the real shock is,"" said de Vries, estimating it at about 271 kilograms  of CO2 per transaction — or several hundred times that of a standard  credit card payment.

    ","¶Washington — The world's oceans will likely lose about one-sixth of its fish and other marine life by the end of the century if climate change continues on its current path, a new study says. The study comes on the heels of a report published by Australian climate experts that warned human civilization faces ""an existential risk"" from climate change by 2050.¶Every degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) that the world's oceans warm, the total mass of sea animals is projected to drop by 5%, according to a comprehensive computer-based study by an international team of marine biologists. And that does not take into account the effects of fishing.¶If the world's greenhouse gas emissions stay at the present rate, that means a 17% loss of biomass — the total weight of all marine animal life — by the year 2100. But if the world reduces carbon pollution, losses can be limited to only about 5%, the study said.¶More in Climate Change¶Last week, a new report by Australian climate experts warned that ""climate change now represents a near- to mid-term existential threat"" to human civilization. In this grim forecast — which was endorsed by the former chief of the Australian Defense Force — human civilization could end by 2050 due to the destabilizing societal and environmental factors caused by a rapidly warming planet.¶""We will see a large decrease in the biomass of the oceans,"" if the world doesn't slow climate change, said study co-author and University of British Columbia marine ecologist William Cheung. ""There are already changes that have been observed."" Cheung added that already warm tropical areas will also see the biggest losses. ¶While warmer water is the biggest factor, climate change also produces oceans that are more acidic and have less oxygen, which also harms sea life, Cheung said. Much of the world relies on oceans for food or livelihood, scientists say.¶The biggest animals in the oceans are going to be hit hardest, said study co-author Derek Tittensor, a marine ecologist at the United Nations World Conservation Monitoring Center in England.¶""The good news here is that the main building blocks of marine life, plankton and bacteria may decline less heavily, the bad news is that those marine animals that we use directly, and care about most deeply, are predicted to suffer the most as climate change is working its way up the food chain,"" co-author Boris Worm, a marine biologist at Dalhousie University in Canada, said in an email.¶It is hard to separate past climate change impacts from those of fishing, but past studies have shown places where observed fish loss can be attributed to human-caused climate change, Chung added.¶Tittensor pointed to lobsters off the coast of main Maine and North Atlantic right whales as examples of creatures already being hurt by global warming. University of Georgia marine biologist Samantha Joye, who wasn't part of the research, praised the study as meticulous and said it is also ""an urgent call for action.""¶""Healthy oceans are required for planetary stability,"" Joye said in an email.

Around the U.S., use of the fossil fuel shows a different trend: Coal consumption is at its lowest level in more than 40 years.¶That's according to the latest data from the U.S. Department of Energy, which on Monday said coal usage fell to 687 million short tons, its lowest since 1978. Production also fell to its second-lowest level since 1978, the agency said. ¶Most of that coal is used to produce electric power. Despite the decline in both production and demand, the Trump administration is investing in the coal industry, with the Energy Department on Monday pledging $39 million for research into improving the efficiency of coal plants.¶More in Climate Change¶""The Trump administration remains committed to ensuring a coal-fueled power plant fleet that provides stable energy to the power grid,"" said Assistant Secretary for Fossil Energy Steven Winberg in a statement. ¶Despite the Trump administration's efforts, coal consumption and production were higher during the Obama administration. The reason: Competing energy sources, especially natural gas, are now taking market share away from coal. The costs of wind and solar energy have also dropped sharply, with a growing number of states and cities embracing renewable energy due to concerns about climate change. ¶Slumping demand for coal hasn't been lost on some Trump administration critics. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg earlier this month pledged $500 million toward an effort to close all remaining domestic coal plants by 2030. His goal is to put the U.S. on a path toward 100% clean energy. Bloomberg noted that 51 coal-fired plants have closed since the 2016 presidential election.¶""Despite all the bluster from the White House, as a matter of fact, since Trump got elected the rate of closure has gone up,"" Bloomberg said.¶Despite the shrinking U.S. coal industry, coal remains the main driver of carbon emissions, which rose to a new high last year, according to the International Energy Association.¶West Virginia governor Jim Justice, himself a coal mine owner, criticized Bloomberg's initiative as ""short-sighted"" and ""nonsensical.""¶""The U.S. continues to make dramatic reductions in carbon output and the vast majority of the greenhouse gas generation is coming from abroad, chiefly in the Pacific Rim countries,"" he said this week in a statement. ""West Virginia is an 'all-in' energy state. We mine coal, produce natural gas and we have a growing renewable portfolio.""¶Despite such political boosterism, coal sector employment around the U.S. has been decreasing for decades, a victim of shifting demand for new energy sources as well automation and more efficient mining practices. Since 1950, the number of mining jobs around the country has tumbled 88 percent. In West Virginia today, about 14,000 people work in West Virginia's mines, CBS News recently reported in a look at the state's coal industry.¶The dropping price of coal has also has driven eight U.S. coal companies into bankruptcy since 2015, including the three largest—Peabody Energy, Arch Coal and Cloud Peak Energy.

It's a goal he says is achievable -- ""we're already more than halfway there,"" he said, touting the 289 coal-fired power plants shut down since 2011 through a partnership between Bloomberg Philanthropies and the Sierra Club.¶More in Climate Change¶He added that 51 have been closed since the 2016 election, and ""despite all the bluster from the White House, as a matter of fact, since Trump got elected, the rate of closure has gone up.""¶The former New York City mayor, who considered joining the 2020 Democratic presidential field, slammed the candidates whose climate plans set a 2050 goal for mitigating the effects of climate change.¶""Politicians keep making promises about climate change mitigation by the year 2050 -- hypocritically, after they're long gone, and no one can hold them accountable,"" Bloomberg observed. His own initiatives would take coal out of the climate equation 20 years earlier.¶Though he didn't mention the former vice president by name, Joe Biden introduced his climate plan this week, and it features a goal of net-zero emissions by no later than 2050. ¶Bloomberg is also working to stop construction of new gas plants. ""By the time they are built, they'll be out of date because renewable will be cheaper,"" he said at the MIT address, adding that we ""don't want to replace one fossil fuel with another."" The push to end use of both natural gas and coal is the reason he's named his initiative ""Beyond Carbon.""¶The billionaire Bloomberg's investment in the Beyond Carbon initiative marks the largest ever philanthropic effort to combat climate change, according to the mayor's foundation. The organization will bypass the federal government and instead seek to pass climate and clean energy policies, as well as back political candidates, at the state and local level.¶""We're in a race against time with climate change, and yet there is virtually no hope of bold federal action on this issue for at least another two years. Mother Nature is not waiting on our political calendar, and neither can we,"" Bloomberg said in a statement. ¶Bloomberg considered but ultimately passed on seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. Instead, he vowed to point his vast wealth and political connections toward fighting climate change and defeating President Trump.¶The initiative mirrors Bloomberg's work on gun control, which has focused on bolstering state and local efforts. The former mayor's financial contributions to Democratic candidates who backed stricter gun laws was also considered integral to the party's ability to retake the House in 2018.¶Bloomberg's foundation has spent several years working with the Sierra Club to seek the closure of the nation's coal plants. Since 2011, about half of the 530 plants across the U.S. have been closed.",0

Still, the report is incomplete because many companies don't enumerate their climate-related risks. ¶Allstate Insurance predicted losing up to $6 billion as changing weather patterns lead to more severe losses for homes, businesses and other insured properties. The company currently considers cities on the U.S. Gulf Coast and East Coast to be one of the greatest areas of ""potential catastrophe"" due to hurricanes, according to its disclosures.  ¶Bank of America, whose international locations include Hong Kong, Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan, China and Australia, also foresees a growing threat of more frequent and stronger hurricanes. As a major financier for solar power projects, it expects a loss of revenue if solar installations slow down or become more costly, as could happen in several states under pending legislation.¶Not all sectors are equally aware of their climate-change risks. But the financial industry so far has the most detailed disclosures, said Bartlett, although not all financial institutions fully accounted for the hits to their portfolio if their clients were to suffer from climate change. ""The finance sector has been very focused on their own operations, and they haven't focused in-depth on what they're actually financing,"" she said.¶Power companies and the fossil-fuel industry also offered full disclosures, since they're currently facing an energy transition. However, other sectors, including manufacturing, transportation and infrastructure, have yet to catch up. ¶""The increased costs for them are probably not just the obvious — increased insurance premiums, damages to their operation or shutdowns,"" Bartlett said. ""The physical risks mean their workforce not being there, or 'it's too hot to have a factory in this country.' It's more existential than they realized.""",0
"Human civilization faces ""existential risk"" by 2050 according to new Australian climate change report","

    ","¶A new report by Australian climate experts warns that ""climate change now represents a near- to mid-term existential threat"" to human civilization. In this grim forecast — which was endorsed by the former chief of the Australian Defense Force — human civilization could end by 2050 due to the destabilizing societal and environmental factors caused by a rapidly warming planet. ¶The report, entitled ""Existential climate-related security risk: A scenario approach,"" lays out a future where society could collapse due to instability set off by migration patterns of billions of people affected by drought, rising sea levels, and environmental destruction. ¶""Climate-change impacts on food and water systems, declining crop yields and rising food prices driven by drought, wildfire and harvest failures have already become catalysts for social breakdown and conflict across the Middle East, the Maghreb and the Sahel, contributing to the European migration crisis,"" the report said. ¶The report was written by David Spratt, research director for Breakthrough National Centre for Climate Restoration in Melbourne, and Ian T. Dunlop, formerly an international oil, gas and coal industry executive and chair of the Australian Coal Association. Retired Admiral Chris Barrie, former defense forces chief of Australia, endorsed the report and wrote a forward to it. ¶More in Climate Change¶""After nuclear war, human induced global warming is the greatest threat to human life on the planet,"" Barrie wrote. ¶Using a worst-case scenario existential risk analysis, Spratt and Dunlop depict humanity falling into ruin under an additional 2 degrees Celsius of warming — a threshold scientists say the world is heading towards if current trends continue. In their scenario, ""tipping points"" occur when humanity fails to institute carbon emission reforms in the 2020s and 2030s. This creates a ""hothouse"" effect on Earth, leading to rapidly rising sea levels set off by melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet and ""widespread permafrost loss and large-scale Amazon drought and dieback."" ¶In this scenario, the ""hothouse Earth"" effect causes ""35 percent of the global land area, and 55 percent of the global population, (to be) subject to more than 20 days a year of lethal heat conditions, beyond the threshold of human survivability."" Ecosystems collapse, including coral reef systems, the Amazon rainforest and the Arctic, along with a massive die-off of the insect population. ¶As a result, the authors say, some of the world's most populated cities — Mumbai, Jakarta, Guangzhou, Tianjin, Hong Kong, Ho Chi Minh City, Shanghai, Lagos, Bangkok and Manila — would have to be abandoned due to their location in the tropical zone.¶The assessment ends with a harrowing conclusion: ""More than a billion people may need to be relocated and in high-end scenarios, the scale of destruction is beyond our capacity to model, with a high likelihood of human civilization coming to an end."" ¶The report also paints a grim picture in terms of national security, with extreme climate conditions and the disruption of huge populations placing ""the internal cohesion of nations ... under great stress.""¶""The flooding of coastal communities around the world, especially in the Netherlands, the United States, South Asia, and China, has the potential to challenge regional and even national identities,"" the report warns. ""Armed conflict between nations over resources, such as the Nile and its tributaries, is likely and nuclear war is possible. The social consequences range from increased religious fervor to outright chaos."" ¶Spratt and Dunlop do offer some solutions. They point to the national security sectors of the world's major powers and argue they could pay a unique role in mobilizing society, similar in scale to the emergency response World War II required of people and governments in the 1940s. ¶""To reduce such risks and to sustain human civilization, it is essential to build a zero emissions industrial system very quickly. This requires the global mobilization of resources on an emergency basis, akin to a wartime level of response,"" the report reads. ""The national security sector has unrivaled experience and capacity in such mobilization, and can play a unique role in its development and implementation, as well as educating policymakers of the existential security risks in failing to do so.""

"Thousands of puffins have died, and scientists believe climate change played a role","

    ","¶Thousands of tufted puffins — the instantly recognizable black and white birds with large orange beaks — starved to death in the Bering Sea from 2016 to 2017. Now, researchers say climate change is likely an underlying cause of the mass die-off. ¶According to a new study in the journal PLOS ONE, from October 2016 through January 2017, birds known as alcids — a group that includes puffins, auklets and other species —  experienced a mass mortality event. Researchers recovered carcasses of more than 350 of the birds on St. Paul Island in Alaska, and they estimate that anywhere from 3,150 to 8,800 birds in total died during the 2-3 month period. ¶Scientists found that the birds — mostly tufted puffins and crested auklets — died due to a lack of adequate food supply. The bodies they found were severely underweight, and they believe global warming may be at least partially to blame, indicative of ""a changing world."" ¶More in Climate Change¶""Mass mortality events are increasing in frequency and magnitude, potentially linked with ongoing climate change,"" the authors of the study concluded. ""These 'massive mortality events' — defined as catastrophic, but often short-lived, periods of elevated mortality — can affect substantial proportions of a population, occasionally with long-term consequences to population size.""¶The fish population — which puffins typically rely on for food — has exponentially declined in warmer water. The population of zooplankton, which those fish prey on, has also declined. ¶According to the study, many of the dead birds were also molting — a process of feather regrowth — at their time of death. The process makes flying difficult, so a lack of easily accessible prey contributed to their untimely death. ¶""Mass mortality events of marine birds are often linked to food stress,"" the researchers wrote. Two other similar events occurred in the same region in 1983 and 1997, both of which were linked to prey abundance relating to climate anomalies. ¶Scientists suggest that a broad-scale ecosystem change is responsible for increasing mass die-off events in recent years. Not only are these events becoming more frequent, they're also increasing in magnitude, with the number of fatalities higher for birds, fish and marine invertebrates. ¶Earlier this month, a U.N. report warned that the risk of extinction currently looms over 1 million species of plants and animals worldwide. That report highlighted five ways people are reducing biodiversity: Overfishing, habitat destruction, the burning of fossil fuels, pollution, and invasive species. ¶Species loss is accelerating to a rate tens or hundreds of times faster than in the past, the U.N. report said. More than half a million species on land ""have insufficient habitat for long-term survival"" and are likely to go extinct, many within decades, unless their habitats are restored.",0

    ","¶Berlin — Teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg called on world leaders Tuesday to acknowledge the seriousness of global warming and that not enough is being done to curb it. Speaking at a conference in the Austrian capital, Vienna, Thunberg suggested it was wrong to portray the worldwide shift necessary to rein in climate change as ""primarily an opportunity to create new green jobs, new businesses, green economic growth,"" as some political and business leaders have done.¶""This is above all an emergency and not just any emergency. This is the biggest crisis humanity has ever faced,"" she said, adding: ""This is not something you can like on Facebook.""¶On Tuesday, Thunberg met with United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Austrian President President Alexander Van der Bellen and former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.

""And the next second they want to expand airports, build new coal power plants and motorways. And then they fly off in a private jet to attend a meeting on the other side of the world.""¶U.N.

""Nothing (could be) more wrong. What we are doing is to use taxpayers' money, which means our money, to boost hurricanes, to spread drought, to melt glaciers, to bleach corals, in one word: to destroy the world.""¶""I believe that as taxpayers we would prefer to see our money back than to see our money used to destroy the world,"" said Guterres.",0

    ","¶The commercial extravaganza known as Prime Day is expected to generate $5.8 million of sales for Amazon's coffers -- more than it makes in a typical week -- and that's before counting the other retailers that have piled in with their own deals, hoping to turn a profit from the event. ¶But all those specials come with a dark size, and that's the impact on the climate. ¶The race toward ever-faster shipping is driving companies like Amazon, UPS and FedEx to inflate their carbon footprint. Instant shipping not only encourages consumers to make multiple small purchases instead of a single large one, but moving those purchases to a customer's home often creates multiple delivery trips a day. ¶More in Climate Change¶Not long ago online shopping was better for the climate than the in-person kind because it benefited from economies of scale. A shopper who's  driving from store to store in a car can create a lot of emissions, Anne Goodchild, founding  director  of the  University of Washington's Supply Chain Transportation  and  Logistics  Center, told CBS News. ""Delivery services can be   better -- they  can put lots of stuff in one vehicle, do one delivery   route and hit  lots of homes,"" she said. ¶But while that model   prevailed in the  early days of online shopping, today it's reversed,   with very small and  quick deliveries -- what she calls ""paid butler   services"" -- growing the  fastest. That model ""is definitely worse, and   there are other  compounding factors: You don't make a list for your   shopping anymore, you  just buy stuff online as you think of it -- and it's   delivered in five or  six deliveries,"" she said.¶Data show that package deliveries are indeed speeding up. In the last two years, the average time for an item to get from ""click"" to a customer's door dropped from 5.2 days to 4.3, according to Rakuten Intelligence. In 2017, UPS said e-commerce was leading it to make less-efficient deliveries, leading to ""more miles, fuel, and emissions per delivery."" ¶Amazon's  recent decision to make one-day shipping the default  for  its  Prime  members is likely to increase its emissions ever further. In  2017, Amazon's deliveries alone emitted about 19 million metric  tons of  carbon, according to an estimate from 350 Seattle, a group that  works  to combat climate heating. ""That's just  under five coal power plants,""  said  Rebecca Deutsch, a former tech worker who's now the Amazon  campaign  coordinator for 350 Seattle. ¶That same year, FedEx was  responsible for  14 million tons, and UPS for 13 million, according to CDP, a nonprofit that helps companies track emissions data.¶Amazon doesn't disclose its carbon footprint, despite robust efforts from workers to wean the company off fossil fuels. (It has promised to disclose its carbon emissions figures sometime this year.) Environmental groups, however, say Amazon's impact is significant, thanks to the company's enormous size and complexity. And although Americans most associate the company with shopping, Amazon's operations in internet services could have an even bigger carbon footprint than its trucks and warehouses.¶Amazon Web Services is the biggest cloud-computing provider in the U.S. It has over a million customers, ranging from small businesses to the likes of Verizon, Neflix and Unilever. The CIA is even an Amazon cloud customer. AWS is also one of Amazon's fastest-growing divisions, along with three other segments that also heavily rely on computing power: third-party sales, advertising and the subscription services around Amazon Prime, said RJ Hottovy, retail sector strategist at Morningstar. ¶Supporting AWS are more than 50 data centers across the world, according to a Greenpeace report earlier this year on the data industry. Each of those centers consumes about as much power as a small town, Gary Cook, senior IT sector analyst for Greenpeace, told CBS News recently. ¶""From a carbon footprint, data centers are super energy-intensive,"" Cook said. ""Electricity demand in the U.S. is declining, but data centers are a big growth market."" ¶Why so much growth? It turns out that internet use, and especially the media-rich internet that many Americans are accustomed to today, consumes a great deal of power. Every video call, text message or ""Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"" episode has to live on a server somewhere. That all adds up: A study last year of the information and communication industry found that the sector emits as much carbon as the airlines.  ¶While some data centers are wind- or solar-powered, nearly half still run on fossil fuels, according to Amazon's figures. The company's heavy presence in Northern Virginia, just outside Washington, D.C., is particularly polluting, according to Greenpeace. Amazon is the largest private utility customer in an area where much of the electricity still comes from natural gas and coal -- both fossil fuels that contribute to carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Just 12% of AWS' power in Virginia comes from clean energy, Greenpeace said. ¶However large Amazon's own carbon footprint is,  its biggest impact could be on the companies around it -- suppliers and contractors. ¶""Amazon's  company-wide  carbon footprint is  actually only the tip of  the iceberg,"" Dexter Galvin, global director of corporations and supply chains at CDP, said in an email. ""On average, companies  in the retail  sector report having supply  chain greenhouse gas   emissions that are  10.9 times greater than  their  own direct"" emissions, he said. ¶That's both a liability and an opportunity, environmental advocates say. Given Amazon's influence in the markets, if it makes meaningful steps to sustainability, many smaller companies would follow. ¶Said Cook: ""If companies are feeling like being responsible, they can chart a different path. A lot of them have.""",0

    ","¶Corporate America has done an about-face on climate change, Axios reports, with some 75 executives this week on Capitol Hill lobbying for the government to put a price on emissions. ¶The idea of a carbon tax is one long favored by economists—it's made appearances in the Wall Street Journal, been proposed in multiple bipartisan bills in Congress and earlier this year became national policy in Canada. It's coming back as the U.S. debates how to move the world's largest economy off carbon and raise trillions of dollars in the process.¶Climate pollution continues to be a problem because the U.S. economy hasn't evolved as quickly as the science has. An overwhelming number of scientists now agree that human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other gases are heating up the planet past the point where it can comfortably support human life. The problem -- and this is key -- is that creating those emissions is, in financial terms, relatively cheap.¶More in Climate Change¶One answer to that conundrum: Putting a price on those emissions that's equivalent to the toll they take on the environment.¶""It's the most effective way to reduce emissions,"" said John  Larsen, a director at Rhodium Group. ""There are emissions of greenhouse  gases across the economy, and it's very difficult to have a single  policy instrument that can get at all of them all at once. A carbon tax  is one instrument that can do that,"" he said.¶How much a carbon tax adds to the price of something depends on how much carbon that thing contains. Most immediately, it affects the price of energy, like gasoline and electricity from fossil fuels, and indirectly raises the costs of other products, like goods produced in a factory run by fossil-fuel power. ¶The more carbon-intensive a fuel is, the higher its tax will be. Coal—the dirtiest of fuels—would be taxed higher than natural gas, which would be taxed higher than wind or hydropower, and so forth. ¶Instead of relying on policymakers and the industries that lobby them to come up with a plan for who must cut emissions and how much—and then enforcing it—a carbon tax lets the market sort it out. ¶As a group of economists recently wrote in the Wall Street Journal, ""A carbon tax will send a powerful price signal that harnesses the invisible hand of the marketplace."" ¶Carbon tax proposals vary widely on this point, but most agree on two things: The proposed tax must be high enough to incent companies and consumers to abandon carbon-intensive fuels; and the tax must rise over time in order to drive emissions down further and further.¶In the real world, carbon taxes have had mixed results because they rarely set the price of carbon at a high enough level, Amy Harder, a climate and energy reporter with Axios, told CBS News. ""One of the detailed questions, once the legislating starts happening, is what is the right price?"" she said.¶Legislation now under discussion in Washington envisions a carbon tax that ranges from $40 a ton on the low end to $55 a ton, with the price increasingly slightly every year. That's a price experts say is more than enough to achieve the emissions reductions the U.S. agreed to as part of the Paris Climate Accord (Under President Donald Trump, the U.S. withdrew from the treaty in 2017.)¶For U.S. consumers, a $50-per-ton carbon tax would result in gas prices rising about 50 cents per gallon-- that comes to about $19 per month for a typical home  heated with natural gas (assuming that energy companies passed on the  entirety of the tax to customers instead of cutting into their profits.) For U.S. drivers, meanwhile, a 50 cent hike in prices at the pump would hurt -- it's worth noting that a move to hike gas prices in France last year set off an ongoing wave of protests, with motorists decrying the measure as a regressive tax burden on average people. ¶There are pros and cons to both approaches, experts say. Starting with a low tax initially makes a carbon tax an easier sell politically, but it takes more time to see the effects in reduced emissions. Scientists at the U.N. have said the world has only about 12 years to seriously reduce greenhouse-gas emissions before the effects of climate change become irreversible. ¶Many of the current carbon-tax proposals call for the money to be returned to consumers in the form of a dividend or a tax credit. Many studies show such a tax would also modestly redistribute income from the very richest Americans to everyone else.¶""Low- and middle-income households will, on average, receive more in rebates than they pay in carbon tax,"" said Noah Kaufman, a research scholar at the SIPA Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. ""Rich people buy more of everything, and that includes more carbon-intensive goods and services. If you're equally distributing that income to everyone, poor and middle-income households come out way ahead.""¶Many progressives prefer for that tax revenue to be invested into renewable energy development or jobs training for people whose jobs would disappear in a decarbonized economy. (Conservatives prefer to keep the money out of the government's coffers altogether, or to use a carbon tax to reduce other types of taxes.) ¶Corporations, meanwhile, support carbon-tax proposals that include language to shield them from climate litigation and potentially more stringent regulation. ""It's not really about saving the planet,"" Harder said. ""It's about legal pressure—some of them are facing lawsuits—and it's also about investor pressure."" ¶Still, there are many ideas for using tax revenue from a carbon tax, which means any proposal that advances will face vigorous debate. ¶""Rarely in the political cycle is there an opportunity where tens or millions of new revenue show up,"" Larsen said. He calculates that a $50-per-ton tax on carbon could potentially raise $180 billion in one year, about what the corporate income tax currently raises today.¶""Once you've gotten over whether or not you do a carbon tax,"" he added, ""the most contentious issue is what you do with the money.""",0

It now has 245 stores, including dozens in Europe and Canada. ¶Its latest experiment in reuse is, in a sense, a return to the company's roots as a sustainable purveyor of clothing and home goods as the company, which also owns Anthropologie and Free People, explores new revenue paths. ¶More in Climate Change¶Chief digital officer David Hayne, the son of one of the founders, will run the new service, which he expects will attract 50,000 subscribers and earn more than $50 million in revenue in its first year in business, the Wall Street Journal reported.  ¶Shoppers can rent up to six items at a time for $88 per month from Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie and Free People. Other offerings include clothing from Levis, Reebok and Fila. Customers can choose pieces from more than 100 third-party brands, including clothing and accessories that aren't for sale at any of the stores under the Urban Outfitters corporate umbrella.¶The service will allow customers to infuse ""freshness and variety into their wardrobes,"" the company said in a press release. Shoppers who fall in love with rental items have the option to purchase them. It's meant to diversify the company's revenue streams, not replace sales. ¶""We certainly don't think the customers are just going to stop purchasing,"" Hayne told the Wall Street Journal. ""Purchases make sense for things you know you're going to use often; rental makes sense for things you would like to try,""¶Social media platforms like Instagram are helping drive the market for rented clothing -- which makes sense for influencers who plan to wear an outfit just once, for a post, before burying it in the back of their closets. ¶Rent the Runway, which was founded in 2009, is a pioneer in the clothing rental market, which is expected to be valued at $2.5 billion by 2023, according to GlobalData. It rents high-end clothing and accessories from well-known designers including Diane Von Furstenberg, Proenza Schouler and Rag & Bone, and earlier this year said it was valued at $1 billion.  Memberships start at $89 per month and an unlimited plan, which costs $159 per month, allows fashionistas to select four or more styles from more than 600 designers and make unlimited clothing swaps at their own will. New items are delivered within two days. ¶Millennials in particular prize both variety and environmental sustainability and services like RTR and Nuuly, in theory, deliver both. ¶Urban Outfitters, in its announcement, acknowledged the rise of the sharing economy and increased interest in subscription services -- a shift that's ""driven by the young generation's hunger for newness while embracing sustainability,"" according to a Business of Fashion report on the state of the industry. ¶Indeed the apparel and footwear industries combined account for more than 8% of global climate impact, greater than all international airline flights and maritime shipping trips combined. ¶""We have 25 million pounds of clothing thrown out in the U.S. per year, and most of it has not reached its usable life.

Cline, author of ""The Conscious Closet: The Revolutionary Guide to Looking Good While Doing Good,"" told CBS MoneyWatch last month.¶""Viewing fashion as a service -- as something we access instead of own -- is going to be a really important part of solving the environmental crisis that is fashion,"" she said.

    ","¶Jonathan Bamber is Professor of Physical Geography at University of Bristol (U.K.); Michael Oppenheimer is Professor of Geosciences and International Affairs at Princeton University.¶Antarctica is further from civilization than any other place on Earth. The Greenland ice sheet is closer to home but around one tenth the size of its southern sibling. Together, these two ice masses hold enough frozen water to raise global mean sea level by 65 meters if they were to suddenly melt. But how likely is this to happen?¶The Antarctic ice sheet is around one and half times larger than Australia. What's happening in one part of Antarctica may not be the same as what's happening in another — just like the east and west coasts of the US can experience very different responses to, for example, a change in the El Niño weather pattern. These are periodic climate events that result in wetter conditions across the southern US, warmer conditions in the north and drier weather on the north-eastern seaboard. ¶More in Climate Change¶The ice in Antarctica is nearly 5 kilometers thick in places and we have very little idea what the conditions are like at the base, even though those conditions play a key role in determining the speed with which the ice can respond to climate change, including how fast it can flow toward and into the ocean. A warm, wet base lubricates the bedrock of land beneath the ice and allows it to slide over it.¶These issues have made it particularly difficult to produce model simulations of how ice sheets will respond to climate change in future. Models have to capture all the processes and uncertainties that we know about and those that we don't — the ""known unknowns"" and the ""unknown unknowns"" as Donald Rumsfeld once put it. As a result, several recent studies suggest that previous Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports may have underestimated how much melting ice sheets will contribute to sea level in future.¶Fortunately, models are not the only tools for predicting the future. Structured Expert Judgement is a method from a study one of us published in 2013. Experts give their judgement on a hard-to-model problem and their judgements are combined in a way that takes into account how good they are at assessing their own uncertainty. This provides a rational consensus.¶The approach has been used when the consequences of an event are potentially catastrophic, but our ability to model the system is poor. These include volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, the spread of vector-borne diseases such as malaria and even airplane crashes. ¶Since the study in 2013, scientists modeling ice sheets have improved their models by trying to incorporate processes that cause positive and negative feedback. Impurities on the surface of the Greenland ice sheet cause positive feedback as they enhance melting by absorbing more of the sun's heat. The stabilizing effect of bedrock rising as the overlying ice thins, lessening the weight on the bed, is an example of negative feedback, as it slows the rate that the ice melts. ¶The record of observations of ice sheet change, primarily from satellite data, has also grown in length and quality, helping to improve knowledge of the recent behavior of the ice sheets.¶With colleagues from the U.K. and U.S., we undertook a new Structured Expert Judgement exercise. With all the new research, data and knowledge, you might expect the uncertainties around how much ice sheet melting will contribute to sea level rise to have got smaller. Unfortunately, that's not what we found. What we did find was a range of future outcomes that go from bad to worse.¶We gathered together 22 experts in the U.S. and U.K. in 2018 and combined their judgements. The results are sobering. Rather than a shrinking in the uncertainty of future ice sheet behavior over the last six years, it has grown.¶If the global temperature increase stays below 2°C, the experts' best estimate of the average contribution of the ice sheets to sea level was 26 centimeters. They concluded, however, that there is a 5% chance that the contribution could be as much as 80 centimeters. ¶If this is combined with the two other main factors that influence sea level — glaciers melting around the world and the expansion of ocean water as it warms — then global mean sea level rise could exceed one meter by 2100. If this were to occur, many small island states would experience their current once-in-a-hundred–year flood every other day and become effectively uninhabitable.¶For a climate change scenario closer to business as usual — where our current trajectory for economic growth continues and global temperatures increase by 5℃ — the outlook is even more bleak. The experts' best estimate average in this case is 51cm of sea level rise caused by melting ice sheets by 2100, but with a 5% chance that global sea level rise could exceed two meters by 2100. That has the potential to displace some 200 million people.¶Let's try and put this into context. The Syrian refugee crisis is estimated to have caused about a million people to migrate to Europe. This occurred over years rather than a century, giving much less time for countries to adjust. Still, sea level rise driven by migration of this size might threaten the existence of nation states and result in unimaginable stress on resources and space. There is time to change course, but not much, and the longer we delay the harder it gets, the bigger the mountain we have to climb.¶This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

    ","¶Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet unveiled the first policy of his presidential campaign Monday, a plan to address climate change. He promised that not only would his plan fight the effects of global warming, but it would also boost the economy. His plan was announced just after a weekend spent campaigning in Iowa, touring farms and areas affected by extreme flooding that some have blamed on climate change.¶""We need bold action and enduring solutions,"" Bennet said in a press release. ""Our plan will drive economic growth for the 21st century and create millions of high-paying jobs.""¶The plan is broken into five ""principles"" which contain plans to fight climate change through a mix of individual and corporate incentives, government reforms, and executive actions. His proposal includes an implementation timeline, too, that would begin on his first day in office as president.¶More in Climate Change¶Last October, a report by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicted that the world has twelve years to reverse the effects of climate change. Working off that timeline, Bennet proposed multiple policies that would take effect on or by 2030, including a ""Climate Challenge"" to states to ""compete for federal infrastructure funding"" by addressing climate threats and reducing emissions. The senator also plans to commit to conserve 30 percent of American's lands and seas by 2030.¶Bennet would also require power providers to provide zero-emission energy plans to businesses and households. His so-called ""Climate X Option"" would, Bennet believes, empower Americans to more easily adopt clean energy practices.¶If elected, he also says he'd call a global climate summit of world leaders within the first 100 days of his presidency. And he's proposing the creation of a ""Climate Bank,"" a trust that would hold $10 trillion to be used by the private sector for ""innovation and infrastructure that creates new markets for American businesses not just at home, but also around the world.""¶Bennet said that to institute his policies, he will work with Congress. However, if Congress cannot come together, he would use executive actions to authorize the Clean Air Act and other climate statutes. ""This crisis is too important for us to wait any longer,"" he said.¶Other 2020 Democratic candidates have introduced policies after spending time in Iowa. An aide to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders previously told CBS News that his agriculture policy came out of discussions with Iowans. Earlier this month, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke amended his climate change policy after meeting with people impacted by historic flooding and holding climate change roundtables in Iowa, according to a campaign aide.¶On a call with reporters, Bennet said that flooding in rural Iowa has waterlogged land, making it difficult for farmers to preserve topsoil. Several Democratic strategists and officials have told CBS News that policy proposals following campaign swings are key ways for candidates to show voters they're listening to concerns.",0

    ","¶Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old who leads a global climate movement, asked in a recent tweet, ""Can we all now please stop saying 'climate change' and instead call it what it is: climate breakdown, climate crisis, climate emergency, ecological breakdown, ecological crisis and ecological emergency?""¶She's not alone in her sentiment. Many of those engaged in environmental advocacy feel the term ""climate change"" fails to convey the specificity or urgency needed to address the gravity of the climate challenge. ¶A new recent study shows they may be right. ¶More in Climate Change¶New York City-based SPARK Neuro, a neuroanalytics company that measures emotion and attention, studied how participants responded to six terms -- ""climate crisis,"" ""environmental destruction,"" ""environmental collapse,"" ""weather destabilization,"" ""global warming"" and ""climate change."" ¶A total of 120 people -- 40 Republicans, 40 Democrats and 40 independents -- participated in the study, which measured the ""emotional intensity"" of responses to audio recordings of various controversial phrases, with each term inserted, like this example below:¶""Sea levels will rise dramatically, to the point that many coastal cities will be submerged, as a result of [INSERT TERM]."" ¶The electrical activity of the participants' brains and skin was rated on a scale of zero to five -- five being the strongest. Those results were then compared to a traditional survey for reference.¶Two terms stood out from the pack: climate crisis and environmental destruction. ¶Among Democrats, the study found a 60% greater emotional response to the term ""climate crisis"" than to ""climate change,"" and a tripling in emotional response among Republicans.¶Spencer Gerrol, CEO of SPARK Neuro, said evoking emotion is vital to getting people to act. Because terms like climate change and global warming do not imply good or bad, they don't spark passion, he said.¶""People tend to underestimate how much emotions factor in,"" he said. ""Ultimately it is emotions that change hearts and minds and lead to actions."" ¶Among the Republicans in the study, the term ""environmental destruction"" evoked what was considered an extreme reaction, registering an emotional response almost four times greater than that of their responses to the term ""climate change.""¶However, Gerrol said that kind of visceral intensity can backfire. ¶""The term 'environmental destruction' seems to have crossed a line with Republicans. It is likely seen as alarmist, perhaps even implying blame, which can lead to counterarguing and pushback,"" he said.¶The term ""climate crisis"" appeared to fall in a sweet spot. It performed well in terms of responses across the political spectrum and elicited the greatest emotional response among independents. ¶""Independents are thinking less about what camp they fall into because they are not driven by partisan beliefs and visceral reactions. It implies they are thinking more critically about the term,"" Gerrol said. ¶One online petition from The Action Network, a progressive advocacy organization, shows some are pushing for this change. It calls on major TV networks to ""call the climate crisis transforming the Earth exactly what it is: a climate crisis."" ¶This week, people in the climate-engaged community have fielded a flurry of emails from organizations like The Climate Reality Project and 350.org. The climate advocacy non-profits have asked them to sign the petition, which garnered more than 35,000 signatures by Thursday morning.¶Sarah Finnie Robinson, a senior fellow at the Institute for Sustainable Energy at Boston University, said she signed ""because we have not addressed climate change properly, despite scientists' dire warnings.""¶""It's now a crisis, an emergency, and we need to engage people to demand smart policy and innovation,"" she said. ""Time is not on our side.""¶But not everyone is convinced a name change is needed or even possible. ¶""I think it is too late to attempt to change the terms global warming and climate change,"" said David Fenton, founder and chairman of Fenton Communications, a social change agency. ""They are now fully implanted in people's consciousness and would be very hard to change.""¶More important, Fenton said, is ""to simply explain how we are heating the planet and how that is hurting people, communities and the economy. Too few people really understand this in simple terms or images.""¶Whether it's rebranding or reframing, one thing everyone in the climate conscious community agrees on is: ""climate change needs a kick in the butt."" Those are the words of an Ohio woman involved in a focus group conducted by John Marshall, a senior client advisor at Lippincott, a brand strategy consultancy.¶In Marshall's words, this is the most ""wicked"" branding and communications challenge because of vast political divisions and feelings of detachment from climate change, such as people believing, ""It's not important to me and I'm not important to it."" Marshall said the term seriously lacks energy and relevance, and ""badly"" needs rebranding.¶To help formulate a messaging strategy, he united 16 prominent firms in the creative industry that are forming a non-profit coalition called the Potential Energy Coalition. It will soon launch a series of creative climate campaigns that will appear in print and digital media, as well as on TV and radio. The campaigns are designed for awareness and persuasion. ¶""We hope to find very new and effective ways to engage people in the climate crisis, and scale what works to help dramatically accelerate action,"" Marshall said. ""Our goal is to help people realize how massively important this issue is.""",0

    ","¶Just 43 of 596 urban areas around the globe earn an ""A"" rating for measures aimed at cutting emissions and strategies to combat climate change. That's according to new rankings from CDP, a nonprofit that runs a global disclosure system for cities, states, regions, companies and investors. CDP's ratings run from ""A"" at the top to ""D-"" at the bottom.¶North America was home to 24 top-ranked urban areas worldwide. They include New York, Boston, Toronto, Calgary, Minneapolis and West Palm Beach, a city next door to President Donald Trump's Mar-A-Lago club in Florida. A cluster of nine cities in Northern California near and including San Francisco also made the high end of  the list.¶CDP's database provides a structure that lets anyone evaluate a city's plans to cut carbon emissions or mitigate climate change -- and how their record stacks up against other municipalities. The group decided to make its city rankings and data public just as the world's population shifts toward urban areas and climate change worsens economic inequality. ¶More in Climate Change¶In a recent report, the U.N. predicted almost 70 percent of the global population will live in cities by 2050. In North America, the U.N. said cities are already home to 82 percent of the population. That makes tracking efforts to mitigate emissions and other planet-warming practices vitally important.¶Since Mr. Trump announced in 2017 that the U.S. would withdraw from the 2015 Paris Climate agreement, alliances of U.S. cities and states have pledged to stand by the accord's goals to combat the planet's rising temperatures. Under the terms of the Paris agreement, signatories committed to  ""holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels.""¶The Paris deal requires countries to set their own targets for reducing emissions by 2020. But the world isn't yet on the path to reach the agreement's limit. Instead, it's trending toward 3 degrees of warming, according to recent research from Carbon Tracker.In October, a report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change included measures for urban policymakers that helped spur action. ¶Some 40 U.S. municipalities submitted data and a questionnaire to the CDP for the first time last year, a ""striking"" figure, Katie Walsh, who oversees cities, states and regions for the organization in North America, told CBS MoneyWatch. That helped prompt release of the public database and top-ranking cities as examples for the world's urban governments, Walsh said.¶""City residents, businesses, leaders -- they're committed to upholding the Paris Agreement and working on climate and reducing pollution,"" Walsh said. Participants ""recognize the benefits from that, despite what the federal government is doing or not doing, [and are] really driving driving that action at the local level,"" she said.¶Similar to elements in CDP's corporate database, the CDP urban database includes a detailed questionnaire and other public disclosures covering climate management, governance, city planning, emissions and even how cities approach areas like social risk and economic benefits. Of global cities earning an ""A,"" 13 aim to be climate-neutral or carbon-neutral by 2050. In North America they include  Boston, Indianapolis, Seattle, Washington, D.C., and West Palm Beach, Florida. Those seeking 100 percent renewable energy targets include Minneapolis and San Francisco, according to the CDP.¶The data comes at a time of great global urgency.

            We need to ditch coal before it's too late, climate activist Bill McKibben warns - CBS News
    ",CBS News,"May 13, 2019, 7:08 AM","¶The decline of coal can't come soon enough, and neither can the world's shift to renewable energy, environmentalist Bill McKibben tells CBSN. ¶""The world demand in coal has begun to sink. It's been replaced with natural gas which, sadly, isn't much cleaner,"" McKibben said in an interview. ""What we really need to do is make the leap straight to renewable energy.""¶It's a problem he's seen coming for a long time. ""I wrote the first book about climate change 30 years ago this year and at the time it was still a kind of warning, but now it's not a warning at all. Now it's the brute fact of daily life for hundred of millions of people,"" McKibben said. ""We're heading into completely unprecedented territory and if we don't take action soon our ability to forestall this will be gone.""¶McKibben's breakout nonfiction book, ""The End of Nature,"" served as a call to arms when it was published in 1989 and, for many, was an introduction to the concept of climate change. His work has earned him numerous accolades, including the Sierra Club's John Muir Award and a Guggenheim Fellowship.¶In his latest book, ""Falter,"" McKibben stresses the importance of taking immediate action in the face of a dwindling window to combat climate change. One of the reasons McKibben believes the world has been so slow to adapt is because of political ideologies that value markets over government and feed doubts about the reality of climate change itself.¶""Right at the moment when we really needed governments to step up, when we first found out about climate change in the 1970s, that was right around the time that ideology that markets can solve all problems, that government is the problem not the solution, that's when those really took hold,"" McKibben said.¶""And they've been things that have prevented us from taking action,"" he continued. ""They allowed the fossil fuel industry to mount this 30-year propaganda effort to make people doubt whether global warming was real. That's not a doubt scientists share, but it's a doubt that much of the public shares.""¶This skepticism towards moving from coal and natural gas to more renewable energy is evident in places like West Virginia. CBSN Originals traveled to the coal-mining state for the documentary,""Clinging to Coal: West Virginia's Fight Over Green Jobs,"" which explores how the region has coped with job losses from coal's decline and yet has largely resisted the transition to cleaner alternatives like wind and solar power.¶Watch the CBSN Originals documentary in the video player below:¶¶West Virginia faces an unemployment rate nearly two points higher than the national average, with miners having an especially difficult time securing work. The pension fund for retired miners could become insolvent in less than five years.¶In places where mining is practically in the DNA of generations of residents, making a career change can be daunting — especially when it's seen as a challenge to the longtime supremacy of coal.¶But some have found success in the renewable energy sector. Lower prices have made it easier than ever for homeowners and businesses to begin at least partially relying on solar and wind power, providing more opportunities for workers to install and maintain the systems.¶McKibben notes that ""the price of a solar panel has fallen 90 percent in the last decade."" He cites India as an example of a country that saw the economic sense it made to move toward using solar power over coal.¶""In India right now it costs about $40 a megawatt hour to generate electricity using the sun and it costs about $50 to do it using coal. That's why they installed about 40 times more renewable energy than coal last year,"" McKibben says. ""The trend is unmistakable."" ¶Though there's no way to reverse the effects of climate change, McKibben believes we still have the capacity to potentially halt the damage and chart a better course for the future. He finds hope in political platforms like the Green New Deal and groups like the Sunrise Movement, a youth-led political action organization committed to reducing global carbon emissions while providing job opportunities.¶""It's really wonderful to watch young people taking the lead,"" McKibben said.",0

            The fight over green jobs in coal country: ""We can become important again"" - CBS News
    ",CBS News,"May 10, 2019, 8:10 AM","¶Watch the new CBSN Originals documentary, ""Clinging to Coal: West Virginia's Fight Over Green Jobs,"" in the video player above.¶Clinging to the top rungs of a 300-foot ladder, Eric Ritchie pauses to catch his breath. Surrounding him, and disappearing below, the curved walls of a long, narrow silo echo his heavy breathing.¶Continuing up, he arrives at what feels like the curved fiberglass walls of a mini submarine. The chamber shudders and sways back and forth. As he swings open the heavy door of the top hatch, the space is flooded with bright sunlight. Ritchie clips his safety harness to a steel rail, hoists himself up though the hatch and scrambles out onto the narrow, sloping roof of a massive wind turbine.¶""I spent nine years looking through the windshield of a piece of equipment, and I traded it in for this,"" he says, scanning the 360-degree views of rolling West Virginia hills. ""I think I made a pretty good trade.""¶The 300-foot-tall wind turbine is a rare sight in a state best known for its long and rich history in coal mining. And it's not just because of the breathtaking view that Ritchie considers himself one of a lucky few. Along with most of the men in his family — his father, brother, uncles — Ritchie, 42, worked as a coal miner for nine years. But when it began to look like the mine's days were numbered, Ritchie heard from a friend about a job opening at Invenergy LLC, a Chicago-based energy company, which had a wind farm in central West Virginia.¶""I had the opportunity to make a change, and I took the gamble,"" he said. ""And I think it turned out pretty well.""¶Ritchie was skeptical at first. For much of coal country, alternative energy is almost a bad word. The coal industry, which sustained families here for generations, is regularly lambasted by environmentalists and progressive politicians. Hillary Clinton infamously said during her 2016 presidential campaign that she was going to ""put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business."" And wind and solar energy is often pointed to to as an industry that could replace coal.¶So, when Ritchie made the switch, many of his coal miner friends gave him a hard time — though he adds, it wasn't long before some of them were calling him up to ask for a job.¶Coal mining employment has been in steady decline for many decades now throughout the U.S.  Since 1950, mining jobs have declined by 88 percent, and today only about 14,000 still work in West Virginia's mines. Automation and more efficient mining practices have been a primary factor behind the change. But recently, competing energy sources, particularly natural gas, led to near-record coal plant closures in 2018.¶The costs of wind and solar energy have dropped dramatically, and concerns about climate change have pushed many states to kick their renewable energy facilities into high gear. Some states have made pledges to use mostly renewable energy within a few decades, and Texas, a fossil fuel titan, is now the leader in wind energy production.¶West Virginia, however, is a holdout. Even though many experts say the state is a strong candidate for wind energy, it still gets 93 percent of its power from coal-fired plants and only 2 percent from wind and solar. For years, the coal lobby has played an outsized role in West Virginia politics, and many argue that pressure from the industry has been able to keep leaders from pursuing renewables.¶""If a politician in this state goes five lines without mentioning coal, then he probably won't get reelected,"" says Doyle Tenney, owner of DT Solar, one of a few solar panel installation companies in the state. Tenney worked for coal-fueled power plants as an electrician before leaving to start his own solar company.¶""Coal in this state, it is embedded in the souls of people. While other countries, other states are continuing to try and vamp up the solar industry, my home state is trying to go back in time and create jobs from the past,"" he says.¶The legacy of coal in West Virginia remains powerful. Many generations of families grew up with coal salaries putting food on the table, and coal is still the backbone of the state's economy. While thermal coal, used to generate electricity, has been in steady decline, metallurgical coal, needed to make steel, is faring better. Increased demand internationally has even led to a few new coal mines opening in the past year.¶However, continued advancements in mining technology and automation does not bode well for mining employment, even if production were to increase. On average since 1950, mining jobs have declined at a rate nearly three times the decline in coal production.¶For Eric Ritchie, that reality gives him peace of mind that he made the right choice.¶""I've got no interest competing with the coal mine,"" he said. ""You know, I've got an opportunity right here that I can earn a living for my family and produce some energy, so that's my main concern.""¶He thinks there's ""no question"" West Virginia can succeed.¶""We have everything we need to be a competitor to some of the Midwest states — Texas and some of those states that are going largely renewable. West Virginia is just getting its foot in the door. We have a bright future in this state as long as we get the support.""¶He adds, ""We can become important again. Absolutely.""",0
"1 million species of plants and animals at risk of extinction, U.N. report warns","
","

    ","¶People are putting nature in more trouble now than at any other time in human history, with the risk of extinction looming over 1 million species of plants and animals, scientists said Monday. But it's not too late to fix the problem, according to the United Nations' first comprehensive report on biodiversity.¶""We have reconfigured dramatically life on the planet,"" report co-chairman Eduardo Brondizio of Indiana University said at a press conference.¶Species loss is accelerating to a rate tens or hundreds of times faster than in the past, the report said. More than half a million species on land ""have insufficient habitat for long-term survival"" and are likely to go extinct, many within decades, unless their habitats are restored. The oceans are not any better off.¶More in Climate Change¶""Humanity unwittingly is attempting to throttle the living planet and humanity's own future,"" said George Mason University biologist Thomas Lovejoy, who has been called the godfather of biodiversity for his research. He was not part of the report.¶""The biological diversity of this planet has been really hammered, and this is really our last chance to address all of that,"" Lovejoy said.¶Patricia Miloslavich, a contributor to the report and senior professor in the Department of Environmental Studies at Universidad Simón Bolívar, spoke with ""CBSN AM"" on Monday about the conclusions.¶""We have seen in the past that history has taught us there have been mass extinctions. This, however cannot be considered a mass extinction. This is just a loss of species at an unprecedented rate due to human intervention,"" she said. ""The drivers of this species loss and ecosystem loss is our extreme changes in the use of the land and the oceans."" ¶Conservation scientists from around the world convened in Paris to issue the report, which exceeded 1,000 pages. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) included more than 450 researchers who used 15,000 scientific and government reports. The report's summary had to be approved by representatives of all 109 nations.¶Some nations hit harder by the losses, like small island countries, wanted more in the report. Others, such as the United States, were cautious in the language they sought, but they agreed ""we're in trouble,"" said Rebecca Shaw, chief scientist for the World Wildlife Fund, who observed the final negotiations.¶""This is the strongest call we've seen for reversing the trends on the loss of nature,"" Shaw said.¶The findings are not just about saving plants and animals, but about preserving a world that's becoming harder for humans to live in, said Robert Watson, a former top NASA and British scientist who headed the report.¶""We are indeed threatening the potential food security, water security, human health and social fabric"" of humanity, Watson told The Associated Press.¶It's also an economic and security issue as countries fight over scarcer resources. Watson said the poor in less developed countries bear the greatest burden.¶The report's 39-page summary highlighted five ways people are reducing biodiversity:¶Overfishing the world's oceans. A third of the world's fish stocks are overfished.¶""The key to remember is, it's not a terminal diagnosis,"" said report co-author Andrew Purvis of the Natural History Museum in London.¶Marine biologist Jon Witman from Brown University, who travels to the Galápagos Islands regularly to monitor the effects of climate change on local species, spoke about the threat in the recent CBSN Originals documentary, ""Adapt or Die: Can Evolution Outrun Climate Change?""¶""There's no doubt we are in an unprecedented period of global stress in terms of climate impacts. And basically  the natural world is being hit by what I call the big three. Certainly climate change is up there. Habitat destruction by humans is absolutely key. And we're also adding pollution to the ecosystem. It sounds pretty grim, and it is grim,"" Whitman said.¶Professor Miloslavich told CBS News that what's happening in the world today is different than the natural process that led some species to go extinct in past eras.¶""It's true there have been extinctions in the past, that nature has taken its course, it's just that these have been processes that have taken millions of years and nature has had the time to adapt and provide a response,"" she said. ""We are not giving nature a time to provide a response.""¶Fighting climate change and saving species are equally important, the report said, and working on both environmental problems should go hand in hand. Both problems exacerbate each other because a warmer world means fewer species, and a less biodiverse world means fewer trees and plants to remove heat-trapping carbon dioxide from the air, Lovejoy said.¶— Turning forests, grasslands and other areas into farms, cities and other developments. The habitat loss leaves plants and animals homeless. About three-quarters of Earth's land, two-thirds of its oceans and 85 percent of crucial wetlands have been severely altered or lost, making it harder for species to survive, the report said.¶The world's coral reefs are a perfect example of where climate change and species loss intersect. If the world warms another 0.9 degrees (0.5 degrees Celsius), which other reports say is likely, coral reefs will probably dwindle by 70 percent to 90 percent, the report said. At 1.8 degrees (1 degree Celsius), the report said, 99% of the world's coral will be in trouble.¶""Business as usual is a disaster,"" Watson said.¶At least 680 species with backbones have already gone extinct since 1600. The report said 559 domesticated breeds of mammals used for food have disappeared. More than 40% of the world's amphibian species, more than one-third of the marine mammals and nearly one-third of sharks and fish are threatened with extinction.¶The report relies heavily on research by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, or IUCN, which is composed of biologists who maintain a list of threatened species.¶The IUCN calculated in March that 27,159 species are threatened, endangered or extinct in the wild out of nearly 100,000 species biologists examined in depth. That includes 1,223 mammal species, 1,492 bird species and 2,341 fish species. Nearly half the threatened species are plants.¶Scientists have only examined a small fraction of the estimated 8 million species on Earth.¶The report comes up with 1 million species in trouble by extrapolating the IUCN's 25 percent threatened rate to the rest of the world's species and using a lower rate for the estimated 5.5 million species of insects, Watson said.¶Outside scientists, such as Lovejoy and others, said that's a reasonable assessment.¶The report gives only a generic ""within decades"" time frame for species loss because it is dependent on many variables, including taking the problem seriously, which can reduce the severity of the projections, Watson said.¶""We're in the middle of the sixth great extinction crisis, but it's happening in slow motion,"" said Conservation International and University of California Santa Barbara ecologist Lee Hannah, who was not part of the report.¶Five times in the past, Earth has undergone mass extinctions where much of life on the planet blinked out, like the one that killed the dinosaurs. Watson said the report was careful not to call what's going on now as a sixth big die-off because current levels don't come close to the 75% level in past mass extinctions.¶The report goes beyond species. Of the 18 measured ways nature helps humans, the report said 14 are declining, with food and energy production noticeable exceptions. The report found downward trends in nature's ability to provide clean air and water, good soil and other essentials.¶Habitat loss is one of the biggest threats, and it's happening worldwide, Watson said. The report projects 15.5 million miles (25 million kilometers) of new roads will be paved over nature between now and 2050, most in the developing world.¶Many of the worst effects can be prevented by changing the way we grow food, produce energy, deal with climate change and dispose of waste, the report said. That involves concerted action by governments, companies and people.¶Individuals can help with simple changes to the way they eat and use energy, said the co-chairman of the report, ecological scientist Josef Settele of the Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research in Germany. That doesn't mean becoming a vegetarian or vegan, but balancing meat, vegetables and fruit, and walking and biking more, Watson said.¶""We can actually feed all the coming billions of people without destroying another inch of nature,"" Lovejoy said. Much of that can be done by eliminating food waste and being more efficient, he said.",0
Beto O'Rourke rolls out climate plan with $1.5 trillion federal investment,"

    ","¶Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke announced a climate plan that would include a federal investment of $1.5 trillion over 10 years, in what his campaign is calling the ""largest investment in fighting climate change in history."" The first major policy proposal put forward by the former Texas congressman, O'Rourke's campaign laid out a four-part plan to address climate change, what he calls ""the greatest threat we face.""¶""We have one last chance to unleash the ingenuity and political will of hundreds of millions of Americans to meet this moment before it's too late."" O'Rourke said. ""The actions we're announcing today will help us get there.""¶The plan, released Monday, claims the initial $1.5 trillion investment would spur $5 trillion in infrastructure, innovation and communities most at risk to the effects of climate change. O'Rourke is also calling to increase pre-disaster mitigation grants ten-fold, saying the grants would save $6 for every $1 invested. ¶More in Climate Change¶Funding for the bill would come from taxes levied on the wealthy and corporations and ending tax breaks given to fossil fuel companies. The O'Rourke campaign says the investment will ""drive economic growth and shared prosperity – spurring job creation and adding to our GDP."" The plan also calls for expanding coverage to the federal crop insurance program.¶According to the O'Rourke campaign, the framework would call for a series of Executive Actions on the first day of an O'Rourke administration including a commitment for the United States to re-enter the Paris Climate Agreement, reversing President Donald Trump's decision to withdrawal in June 2017.¶To limit global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius, O'Rourke's plan calls for Congress to enact a legally enforceable standard, within his first 100 days, which would achieve the goal of net-zero emissions by 2050.  This is the same goal presented in the Green New Deal, proposed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, D-New York, and Sen. Ed Markey, D-Massachusetts. Upon joining the crowded Democratic field, O'Rourke said the Green New Deal was the best proposal he'd seen that addresses issue of climate change.¶David Hayes was the former Deputy Secretary of the Interior under President Barack Obama and is currently the Executive Director of the State Energy and Environmental Impact Center at the NYU School of Law and he says this plan recognizes the size and threat climate change poses to the world.¶""This is a very serious comprehensive and detailed roadmap to deal with climate change that differs in nature and scope from any of the other candidates."" Hayes said.¶O'Rourke is to continue addressing this issue in Central Valley California, an area heavily affected by the impacts of climate change. The O'Rourke campaign says, ""Beto will continue listening to and learning from Americans about their ideas to fight climate change and outline additional elements supporting his framework in the months ahead.""",0

But their fight isn't over. The group behind the protests says they are moving on to the next phase of their ""rebellion.""¶Activists camped on the edge of London's Hyde Park for 10 days as they took action across the U.K. capital, including gluing themselves to trains, blocking major intersections and shutting down shopping areas.¶""I don't go to many marches, this isn't really normal for me, but this one is the most important thing that anyone could ever do,"" a woman carrying an infant told CBS News as she marched past Buckingham Palace on Tuesday.¶More in Climate Change¶The group behind the demonstrations, Extinction Rebellion, operates out of an upscale office building in central London. Organizers say they use the space rent-free, because the corporate landlord is sympathetic to their cause.¶Volunteers work on laptops, and signs and fliers are scattered around. The symbol of the group is graffitied over nearly every wall.¶""I think about how to effectively change society in a crisis. That's why Extinction Rebellion has been successful,"" said Roger Hallam, who co-founded the group and has been researching effective protest movements for a PhD.¶""It's not like three people in a pub going 'let's have a rebellion.' It's like a systematic survey of the academic literature on how societies change radically in a short amount of time,"" he said. ""People need to break the law nonviolently, en masse, preferably in a capital city.""¶So that's what the group has been doing -- staging almost daily actions that, according to London Mayor Sadiq Khan, have presented a ""huge challenge"" for London's ""over-stretched and under-resourced"" police. ¶But Hallam said straining resources is insignificant compared to the threat posed by climate change. ""The theater is on fire,"" Hallam said. ¶The group is now planning its next steps. ¶""The government is guilty of criminal inactivity on climate change. Period,"" Hallam said. ¶Extinction Rebellion protests over the last two weeks coincided with a visit from 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg, who visited the U.K. on Tuesday to speak to lawmakers. She has led worldwide school strikes to demand aggressive government action on climate change.¶""We have not taken to the streets for you to take selfies with us and tell us that you really admire what we do,"" Thunberg said in Westminster.

Trying to reduce your carbon footprint? Don't fall for these myths,"

              ","

    ","¶Since Earth Day's founding nearly 50 years ago, April 22 has been an occasion for people to reflect on how they can treat the environment better. In recent years, with scientists around the world issuing increasingly urgent warnings about the scale of climate change and the shrinking window of time to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the focus has been on reducing our climate footprint. ¶But when it comes to cutting down on carbon emissions, scientists say, many consumers  are focusing on the wrong thing. Popular clean-living guides often focus on small changes while glancing by substantive choices that make a real dent in emissions. If carbon were money, these guides obsess on saving $400 a year by drinking fewer lattes instead of slashing your rent in half by getting roommates. Conversely, some things we love that may be good for the Earth aren't necessarily helpful to your carbon footprint.¶With that in mind, here are some popular myths coupled with their climate-friendly alternatives.¶There are plenty of good reasons to eat locally produced food, but climate change isn't one of them. ¶More in Earth Day¶Most of the carbon emissions created by food are created when it's grown and processed. Getting food from the farm to the store accounts for only about 4 percent of its overall carbon footprint, said John Rogers, senior energy analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists. You can have much more impact changing the types of things you eat than worrying about how far they travel. (There are exceptions to this — any food that was shipped via plane, like Peruvian asparagus in December, is probably a bad choice from the climate perspective.)¶""If you're going to make one change in your diet to address the climate implications, the most effective choice for the average American is to eat less meat, especially beef,"" said Rogers. If a family of four were to cut its beef consumption in half, it would be the carbon equivalent of not driving for six months. ¶Beef is the most carbon-intensive food because of the sheer amount of plant food needed to raise a cow to eating age. And while they're growing, those cows create lots of methane — a  greenhouse gas with four times the earth-warming gas than carbon dioxide. Other carbon-heavy foods are pigs, sheep and dairy products. ¶Overall, eating a plant-based diet is the top change a person can make to reduce their carbon footprint, scientists say.¶With cities and states banning single-use plastic bags, consumers may be wondering about a substitute. Here, there's no easy answer — because many plastic-bag substitutes are themselves not great for the environment. ¶From the point of view of carbon emissions, paper bags can be worse than plastic. They're heavier (requiring more fuel to transport), and they're made from trees. A cotton tote needs to be reused at least 52 times to have the same climate impact as a single-use plastic bag, according to a 2018 study from Denmark. Woven mesh bags or plastic bags intended for reuse have a smaller carbon footprint than cotton bags. ¶But the best option is whatever bag is currently in your house, be it a tote or balled-up plastic bags. The key is to reuse it as much as possible, until it falls apart. And when it falls apart, use it to line your trash bin.¶When it comes to consumer goods, Rogers' guiding principles is ""buy less stuff and buy good stuff."" He said: ""Don't buy stuff you don't need, and buy quality when you do buy.""¶Buildings, and the fuel used to heat and cool them, are a massive contributor to climate emissions. And while making your house more efficient will help (as well as reduce your bills), a bigger impact comes from considering what type of house you live in — or whether to live in a house at all. ¶Urban planners have long noted that dense neighborhoods, with dwellings close to each other and on top of each other, are far more climate-friendly than their suburban counterparts. Not only are the buildings in those neighborhoods more energy-efficient compared to the number of people they accommodate, but their density means very little energy is used getting from place to place.¶Density ""is the front line of design where buildings intersect with the environmental problem,"" said David Erdman, chair of Graduate Architecture and Urban Planning at the Pratt Institute. ""It is the elephant in the room, and it's the most difficult thing to design for because everyone wants lots of space, views and the like."" ¶Density is the reason a place like Hong Kong can have carbon emissions that are currently at the levels set by the Paris Accords, Erdman noted. ""It has nothing to do with solar panels — it has to do with the density and the fact that people walk a lot.""¶But living in a city isn't an option for everyone. And even if humans were to build nothing from now on except tall, energy-efficient buildings, that still leaves a whole lot of existing housing stock that doesn't meet those standards.¶When it comes to existing buildings, owners can consider moving heating systems off natural gas — a fossil fuel — and on to electric.¶""Buildings already use electricity. So it's about adding electric capacity and equipment,"" said Jacob Corvidae, a principal in the buildings practice at Rocky Mountain Institute, a think tank focused on sustainability. A furnace, air conditioner and water heater can all be replaced with an electric heat pump. And efficiency has a role to play, too. ""Simple low-cost things like sealing up air leaks and adding insulation — those tend to be the fastest, cheapest way to reduce your energy needs and also make a place more comfortable,"" Corvidae said.¶Emission from airplanes are a huge contributor to climate change, and increasing awareness of jet travel's impact is leading travelers to seek out alternatives. One climate scientist, who flew 50,000 miles for conferences in 2010, swore off flying when he discovered ""the dissonance between my principles and my actions.""¶In nearly every case, the most climate-friendly way to travel long distances is via bus or train (and if the bus is electric, so much the better). If that's not an option, the ""correct"" choice can vary greatly depending on individual circumstances — how many people are traveling together, and what the alternative to driving is.¶""If you're driving a typical SUV and it's just you, that could be a whole lot more emissions than flying on a large plane, if you're going 250 miles,"" said the UCS's Rogers. Indeed, UCS issues a guide ranking climate impacts of various travel methods, based on distance and number of people traveling together.¶In day-to-day travel, cutting out or cutting down on driving can have a major effect, Rogers said. If you can't avoid driving, get the most efficient car possible, whether that's an electric car or a high-efficiency conventional car.¶""If you go from a car that gets 20 miles per gallon to a car that gets 40, that cuts close to 4 tons of carbon dioxide off your annual emissions,"" nearly 20 percent of an individual's total emissions, he said. Driving less, by doing multiple errands at once and carpooling, can also help. But, he said, ""it's easier to make a good decision once — and the chances are, most Americans are going to be buying a new or used car sometime soon."" ",0

            Earth Day 2019: A younger generation pushes South Africa's solar power revolution - CBS News
    ",CBS News,"April 22, 2019, 10:06 AM","¶A major energy crisis has affected millions of peoples' livelihoods in South Africa. A decade of mismanagement and corruption has left the national electricity grid close to collapse, regularly plunging much of the nation into darkness.¶Widespread blackouts can cost the country's economy up to $284 million every day. But the energy shortages are also spurring a new generation of entrepreneurs, as renewable energy is increasingly being seen as the answer to the problem.¶One thing South Africa has a lot of is sunshine – 2,500 hours a year on average, according to the weather bureau, which makes it ideal for the country's solar power revolution. It's a revolution led by a younger generation which has no allegiance to old ways of doing things.¶""For our generation climate change is obvious; we not only experience it, but we're not threatened by what it means to change the ways of doing business in order to respond to that,"" said Fumani Thembi, a co-founder of Pele, a company committed to building renewable energy plants across Africa.¶Their plant at Touws River, near Cape Town, contributes enough energy to power 36,000 households. It's cheap, it's clean and – unlike coal – in endless supply.¶Thembi said, ""I think it's time, it's history and perhaps also opportunity, for us to finally get on a development path that is sustainable as the African continent.""¶Pele has given residents here a 5 percent stake in their company. And it also supplies electricity to the Touws River Primary School. Most of the children here will grow up only knowing solar energy, which not only powers their school but provides them with hidden educational benefits. They've cut their electricity bill by half – a huge saving for a school servicing an impoverished community. Deputy principal Sidney Louw said, ""It's cheap, it's clean electricity. No pollution, and it only uses the sun.""¶His 10-year-old students agree. Jo-Marie Matthys told correspondent Debora Patta, ""It's pretty mind-blowing, because it just looks like windows, but it's actually generators, and it makes its own power from the sun.""¶And it's that power that could ensure the survival of South Africa's internationally-renowned wine country. In Franschhoek, just outside Cape Town, the switch to solar has been borne out of necessity, on the back of more than three years of drought. Constant power outages have had a dire effect on the farming industry.¶One 300-year-old fruit farm uses only renewable energy. Farmer Frans Van der Merwe says it was cheaper to build a floating solar farm – a continental first – than to plant more orchards. ""We have taken so much from this Earth, that I think it's time that we give something back,"" he told Patta. ¶Giving back in a way that's good for business, and good for Planet Earth.¶Check out our Earth Matters blog for more in our Earth Day series!",0

However, there is a group of people hard at work trying to find a viable solution.¶Recent research shows the problem is worse than previously thought. Nearly 18 billion pounds of plastic ends up in our oceans every year. By 2050, researchers estimate there could be more plastic in oceans by weight than fish, unless something changes.¶In the waters around the capital city of Sydney, a device called a Seabin is working around-the-clock slowly filtering out debris, in marinas, ports and yacht clubs.¶""It collects plastics, microplastics, fuel and oil from the surface of the water,"" said Alexandra Ridout, who works with the Seabin Project. ¶Each Seabin costs $4,500 and runs on either electricity or solar power. ¶One Seabin is capable of catching the equivalent of 90,000 shopping bags or nearly 170,000 plastic utensils over the course of the year. There are more than 700 Seabins working in harbors and marinas around the world. ¶The company is deploying an additional 60 Seabins in the U.S. this week, on top of the six currently cleaning the waters around California. ¶Scott Tweedie of Network 10 in Australia asked Ridout, ""Will the Seabins save our oceans?"" ¶""They won't save the oceans; the only way to save the ocean is through behavioral and cultural change,"" she replied. ""But they're a positive impact. It can make a small difference in the grand scheme of things.""¶And they're not the only ones working to clean the ocean. There are other ambitious efforts, including a plan (that is currently on hold) to use a 2,000-thousand-foot boom to help collect a massive area of floating trash known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.¶Marine biologist Vanessa Pirotta said that marine wildlife are consuming plastics at alarming rates.  ¶""We're seeing turtles and dolphins with plastics inside their stomachs, which is likely a contributing cause as to why they may have died,"" Pirotta said. ¶She said that plastic has even been detected in remote places like Antarctica. ""Due to awareness around protecting our oceans not only within Australia, but hopefully around the world, we are working towards ways to protect our marine environment.""¶Some areas around the world are starting to take action against single-use plastics, like banning plastic straws, bags and utensils that litter our oceans and beaches.¶Researchers here hope that inventions like Seabins and changes in attitudes toward plastics will make Sydney's Bondi Beach – and beaches around the world – cleaner. ¶Check out our Earth Matters blog for more in our Earth Day series!",0

            Earth Day 2019: How deforestation threatens the Amazon rainforest - CBS News
    ",CBS News,"April 22, 2019, 7:32 AM","¶Tanguro Ranch, a 200,000-acre industrial farm in the remote Mato Grosso region of Brazil, may not be what you imagine as the Amazon, but it sits right up against massive walls of dense rainforest. In essence, it's the last line of civilization, and the frontline in the battle against deforestation.¶Mike Coe is a soldier in that battle: ""This is a perfect laboratory to work. It's a very large farm, it's half-forest, and half-farmland, so we're able to set up different experiments in both farmland and forest to see what the differences are.""¶As the head of the Woods Hole Research Center's science station based here at the ranch, his weapons are data. ""If you cut down the forest, you're just adding to global warming. You're doing it by increasing the amount of carbon that goes into the atmosphere, and you're doing it by just heating up the surface.""¶For the past 20 years, environmentalists in Brazil thought they were making progress as the rate of Amazon deforestation slowed way down. But now, activists are noticing it's starting to speed up again. Combine that with a newly-elected Brazilian president who is openly critical of environmental priorities, and environmentalists are seriously concerned.¶Since the rise of large-scale, industrial farming here in the past 50 years, scientists like Coe estimate that almost 20 percent of the original Amazon has been deforested – cut down to make way for agriculture. ¶To measure the impact of all those lost trees, you've got to get above it all .... and that's where scientist Paulo Brando works. A tower helps him observe and measure how forests ""breathe.""¶""First thing you notice when you're 130 feet above the Amazon is how breathtaking the view is from up here,"" he said. ""But for scientists, it's not about the view, it's about the science.¶""That tree is probably three or four tons of carbon that it's storing. So, they assimilate carbon that otherwise would be in the atmosphere.""¶""What happens if these trees are cut down and that carbon is released into the atmosphere?"" asked CBSN's Vladimir Duthiers. ¶""This carbon goes into the atmosphere, and contributes to heat-trapping in the atmosphere,"" Coe replied. ¶There's as much carbon captured and stored in all the trees of the Amazon as the amount the entire planet has emitted over the past 10 years.  Cut them down, and we effectively double the heat-trapping gases of the past decade. ¶But the trees are more than just carbon containers. Brando said, ""In some regions of the Amazon, about 30 percent of the rain depends on the trees. [It rains] because of the trees.""¶They're a key part of the global weather cycle: a tree soaks up water from the soil, it evaporates off the treetops, and creates the life-giving rain that supports millions of people downwind.¶Coe said, ""I prefer to call it the air conditioner of the Earth, because all that water rains out somewhere else, so without that recycling of water, you've got a lot less rain, you've got a lot hotter planet.""¶Coe's data shows that, with fewer trees, the dry season around here has expanded by three-and-a half weeks in the past 50 years. The problem is that the rain forest being deforested is not being re-forested. ""Each year there's more being taken out, and there's none being replaced, so that's actually the problem,"" Coe said. ¶He and his team may have discovered a solution, by relying on the jungle's original inhabitants. Using field data and remote cameras, the Woods Hole team has learned that large mammals actually are the best fertilizers.¶""They are great at eating seeds and then dropping them somewhere else,"" Coe said. ""These animals are playing a big role in getting new trees to grow.""¶Also playing a big role: indigenous human populations who live in the area. With generations of climate knowledge over a huge swath of territory, they're the people most immediately affected by recent droughts and previously-unheard-of forest fires.  One resident told Duthiers through an interpreter that his grandfather recognized there were changes happening. ¶And they might also have some of the answers.¶Coe said, ""It's going to be really important to engage indigenous people in this whole discussion of how can we make a landscape that works for everyone?""¶The native communities in the Amazon have long been protected by the Brazilian government, but that, too, is threatening to change. Brazil's new president, Jair Balsonaro, recently shifted power over them from the government's official indigenous rights agency to the agriculture ministry. Some see that as just another attempt to exploit the rain forest they call home.¶Check out our Earth Matters blog for more in our Earth Day series!",0

Back in 2011, just 42 percent thought that global warming was a man-made phenomenon.¶And more than half of Americans (53 percent) think global warming is causing a serious impact now.¶Differences by political party remain on this issue. Most Democrats and independents believe global warming is caused mostly by human activity and think it's having a serious impact now. Republicans, however, are more skeptical that humans are the main cause (45 percent think so) and roughly just three in 10 Republicans think global warming is having an impact now.¶Most Americans (59 percent) think humanity can do something to either stop or slow down climate change if everyone really tried, while 36 percent think climate change is beyond humanity's control. Most who think global warming is caused by humans believe humanity can do something (72 percent), but among those who think natural patterns are the chief cause, most say stopping or slowing climate change is beyond humanity's control (62 percent).¶For some Americans — 49 percent — the environment is so important to them that they do things in their own lives to help it even if it costs time or money. Another 38 percent think it is important, but that they don't have the time or money to help right now. Eleven percent think it's not that important right now. Republicans and Americans with lower incomes tend to be less likely to say they make personal sacrifices to help the environment.¶More in Earth Day¶There is some division on the role the U.S. should take regarding climate change.

How wind and solar became America's cheapest energy source,"

    ","¶In late 2009, as America was clawing its way from the worst recession in 80 years, fiscally pressured local and state governments were doing everything they could to slash costs. That included cutting back on clean-energy initiatives. Here's how the New York Times described the case of Durango, Colorado, a town of 18,000 in the southwest part of the state:¶But for many other groups, even green-minded ones, the higher price of clean electricity has caused soul-searching and hesitation. Early this year, the city government of Durango, Colo., stopped buying renewable power from its utility, saving $45,000 a year. The clean electricity had cost 40 percent extra. ¶Ten years later, nearly one-third of Colorado's electricity comes from renewable sources, the state's biggest utility is moving to entirely carbon-free energy, and its voters have elected a governor who promised to set the most aggressive clean-energy standard in the nation. ¶That story is mirrored in dozens of other states, where consumers have demanded cheap power and corporations have moved into clean-energy projects in droves. Behind this shift is not just increasing environmental awareness, but simple economics. The price of renewables has been dropping exponentially—and shows no sign of reversing.¶In most of the U.S. today, it's cheaper to build a new solar or wind farm than to simply keep an existing coal plant running. Most of those cost decreases have happened just in the last 10 years, to the surprise of some energy analysts.¶More in Earth Day¶Part of this is technological improvement—solar panels and wind turbines have gotten steadily more effective at generating power. But most of it is economies of scale, said Rushad Nanavatty, principal at the Business Renewables Center at the Rocky Mountain Institute, a sustainability think tank.¶""When renewables get cheaper, we buy more, and then they get even cheaper and we buy even more,"" Nanavatty said. ""When you're talking about wind and solar, the cost declines are driven mainly by manufacturing volumes and the cost declines that come with it.""¶Since the first large-scale wind project in the U.S. took root in California in 1981, wind turbines have gotten taller and wider. Taller turbines are more effective because they can access the steady wind that blows at higher altitudes, while larger rotors mean turbines can create more energy. A mid-sized turbine today creates as much energy as 15 of the earliest model. ¶Larger turbines also mean lower installation and construction costs. ""Instead of deploying 10 turbines and moving your crane from site to site to build 10 foundations, you only have to build one foundation, and you are able to access more wind,"" said John Hensley, vice president of research and analytics for the American Wind Energy Association, or AWEA. Modern turbines also make it easy to identify problems and breakages, so repairs take less time and often don't require shutting down the machine. ¶Utilities—the large entities that historically buy power and sell it to homes and businesses—are no longer the only buyers for electricity. Increasingly, big business is buying power directly. ¶What started as a marketing exercise to win over the ""green"" consumer has become more and more of an economic proposition, as corporations from AT&T to Anheuser-Busch InBev sign deals to purchase large amounts of clean power.¶""In many cases, the motivation is to do the right thing, but what makes these deals viable is that it makes economic sense,"" said RMI's Nanavatty. ¶Last year, a record 37 corporations signed contracts for wind power, with nearly half of them being first-time buyers, according to AWEA. Contracts like these kick off the process of building new wind resources, which will be coming online in future years. The pipeline of projects seems long. The group noted that among the ""Renewable Energy 100"" — a group of companies that pledged to move to 100 percent clean energy—just 25 percent of the total corporate demand has been met to date. ¶It's not just big business. Medium-sized business, increasingly, is getting in on the renewables game. ¶A handful of companies and nonprofits last month launched the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance, a project to make it easier to buy clean power projects. The group's aim is to grow corporate renewable energy deals threefold in the next six years. ¶That matters because, as clean energy finds more and more buyers, these customers will need help navigating the byzantine world of electrical systems and electric purchases, where the barriers to entry can be high. ¶""When you look at the market for deals, typically only a very large, sophisticated buyer with a large energy team was in a position to transact,"" Nanavatty said. ""Now you see a situation where a group of buyers, each one of which might have a relatively small load, can come together and go to market with a much larger volume that would be attractive to developers, and make a deal that much more viable.""¶ ",0
Trump buildings could be forced to go green under sweeping New York City climate bill,"

    ","¶President Trump's hometown could make his famous real estate properties go green. A new bill approved by the New York City Council last week will make thousands of large buildings in the city — including those bearing the president's name — comply with strict environmental regulations.¶""President Trump might scrutinize or even outright deny the existence of climate change, but New York City is committed to fighting its drastic effects, which pose a serious threat to our future,"" Council Member Costa Constantinides, a Queens Democrat who led the effort, told CBS News.¶""Reports show Trump Tower and other properties are among the dirtiest emitters in the Big Apple. These are the bad actors we need to hold accountable, because their emissions make everyone's air dirtier, fuel more violent weather and put the future of New York City in jeopardy.""¶More in Climate Change¶The council on Thursday passed the Climate Mobilization Act, a package of environmental bills that has been called the city's version of the Green New Deal. Mayor Bill de Blasio is expected to sign the legislation, marking one of the largest climate initiatives passed by any city in the world.¶The legislation includes no explicit mention of Mr. Trump nor his buildings. The Trump Organization did not return requests for comment from CBS News.¶The core of the legislation is a requirement for buildings of more than 25,000 square feet to follow new rules for cutting carbon emissions. That includes skyscrapers around Manhattan bearing the president's name, including Trump Tower, which has his penthouse and the headquarters of the Trump Organization.¶The legislation also applies to many of New York's most iconic buildings, such as the Empire State Building, Chrysler Building and World Trade Center.¶Trump Tower has been singled out by the city officials and advocates as one of New York's least energy-efficient buildings. A 2015 report by the non-profit Alliance for a Greater New York said the 58-story glass tower uses more energy per square foot than 93 percent of New York's large residential buildings.¶Energy Star, a certification program managed by the EPA and U.S. Department of Energy, gave Trump Tower an energy efficiency score of 44 out of 100, which is 30 percent below the median, according to Crain's New York.¶Other buildings that Mr. Trump developed — including the Trump International Hotel & Tower, the former Trump SoHo hotel (now the Dominick hotel) and the Trump World Tower near the United Nations — had below-median scores from Energy Star. Only one Trump property, at 40 Wall St., earned a good score for energy use. (Mr. Trump proposed eliminating the Energy Star program in his federal budget proposals, but Congress refused.) No buildings with Mr. Trump's name in the U.S. are LEED certified, according to the U.S. Green Building Council database.¶These new regulations also apply to the buildings partially owned by Kushner Companies, the company run by the family of Mr. Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner. They go, too, for other pricey residential buildings that burn up energy. An Alliance for a Greater New York study in 2015 found that 10 of Manhattan's ""elite"" residential addresses are some of the least energy-efficient buildings in the city. Those buildings included two Trump properties, as well as buildings on 5th Avenue and Park Avenue with some of New York's most expensive units. The study noted that nearly all of these buildings, including those under the Trump brand, are mostly privately-owned condos.¶Under the city's Climate Mobilization Act, these buildings have to install new windows and insulation to increase energy efficiency. They also have to cut carbon emissions 40 percent by 2030 and 80 percent by 2050. Violators of the new rules could be fined.¶The Trump administration has aggressively scaled back emissions regulations as part of its broader drawbacks of environmental policies. The EPA said in 2018 that its own plan for easing emissions guidelines could cause up to 1,400 premature deaths a year. An analysis by the economic firm Rhodium Group estimated U.S. carbon emissions jumped 3.4 percent last year — the biggest increase since 2010. ¶The Climate Mobilization Act includes other provisions that clash with Mr. Trump's skepticism of climate initiatives. One bill changes building codes to support new wind turbines, and another requires some buildings to put plants, solar panels or wind turbines on their roofs. Mr. Trump has ridiculed wind turbines for years and recently made the false claim that the noise from windmills causes cancer.¶Mr. Trump has taken some steps to protect his properties from the effects of climate change. His golf course in Ireland will build a wall along the sea as a barrier against erosion and rising sea levels. The application for the permit explicitly mentioned ""global warming and its effects.""",0

            Capturing carbon, once a fringe idea, may be key to fighting climate change - CBS News
    ",CBS News,"April 20, 2019, 1:58 PM","¶Despite decades of warnings from climate scientists, the world is still struggling to cut down its CO2 emissions, the main driver of climate change. But a handful of researchers and private companies are trying to fill in some of the gaps with an idea that was once considered fringe: capturing carbon. ¶In an effort to learn more about how carbon capture works, CBS News' Brook Silva-Braga found himself on the roof of an industrial plant outside Zurich, Switzerland, where rows of circular vents suck carbon dioxide right out of the air. ¶ Louise Charles represents Climeworks, one of a handful of start-ups fighting carbon dioxide by removing it. But to make it a business they needed buyers for the carbon dioxide. They found their first one just a few hundred yards away at a greenhouse looking for fertilizer. ¶And just down the road from Climeworks, professor Markus Friedl has started using carbon to make fuel. The methane comes out of a gas pump at Rapperswil University of Applied Sciences and into a small fleet of cars. Friedl said the beauty of methane – as opposed to say an electric car – is that the gas is easily stored. An electric battery relying on solar power in the Swiss winter would be hard to charge.¶ ""I'm very convinced that this is part of the solution for climate change,"" Friedl said. ¶ For that, Climeworks will need more customers, and they got a big one on the day we visited last week: Coca Cola. At a picturesque bottling plant in the Alps, their Swiss carbonated water brand, Valser, became the world's first drink with captured carbon.¶ Patrick Wittweiler, Coke's sustainability manager in Switzerland, convinced the bosses it was worth paying Climeworks $600 a ton for CO2 that they could get elsewhere for almost nothing.¶ ""Yeah, it's more expensive but to change something and support such a company you have to invest a little bit more,"" Wittweiler said. ¶ But even all the CO2 in all those bottles is less than a drop in the climate bucket. The Valser plant uses 600 tons of CO2 a year while humanity emits 37 billion tons. And each Climeworks scrubber removes about a ton per week.¶ But before you dismiss carbon removal – and you wouldn't be alone – consider that intergovernmental climate projections count on some of these methods working.¶National Geographic journalist Andrew Revkin has been following the climate story for decades. He's watched as failure to cut emissions forced governments into mathematical contortions to prove it was still possible to hit their CO2 targets and limit warming. ¶ ""So this concept emerged of negative emissions. Like something that actually – it's a take-back thing,"" Revkin said. ¶According to him, it's the only way to make the math work.¶This family of ideas is known as geo-engineering. It could mean carbon removal like Climeworks is doing -- planting millions of trees, which of course consume CO2, or even dumping iron into the ocean to jumpstart it's natural CO2 absorption. ¶ But even if we bring CO2 emissions to zero, temperatures could stay dangerously high for decades.¶ So Harvard professor David Keith has another idea: Deliberately reflecting away some of the sunlight. We already know volcanic ash does something similar. Spraying aerosols into the stratosphere and reflecting back some sunlight is probably also the cheapest, surest way to lower the global average temperature. There is a catch.¶""You don't really care about global average temperature, you care about whether there's a heat wave, or whether your crops have enough water,"" Keith said.  ¶ Keith, who is also involved in carbon removal through his company Carbon Engineering, has spent decades studying what would happen if we dimmed the sun but has run into massive resistance to even the smallest real-world test. Much of the opposition comes from environmentalists.¶ ""People who spent decades trying to fight for emissions cuts are terrified that if we let this topic out in the open that people will use solar geo-engineering as an excuse to keep emitting. They'll say, 'Oh, we've got this problem solved … that's completely wrong,"" he said. ¶He thinks its imperative we do both. That's the argument from Climeworks, too, which is trying to dramatically scale up their capacity and bring down their costs. They're working to not only recycle CO2 in soda and fuel, which is carbon-neutral, but at a site in Iceland, actually burying it, making it carbon negative.¶Climeworks admits that to scale up to a meaningful size there will have to be a price on CO2 emissions, basically a tax of hundreds of dollars per ton that will make certain things like air travel much more expensive.",0

    ","¶Conspicuous consumption is out -- and circular fashion is in. No, the term doesn't refer to round patterns or silhouettes but to extending the lifecycle of well-made garments and recycling their materials into new items. ¶This trend is gaining traction as both designers and consumers become increasingly aware of -- and startled by -- the outsize toll linear clothing production takes on the environment. ""Fashion's carbon impact is much larger than the industry's GDP. It's taking up more than its fair share of impact on the planet,"" said Elizabeth L. Cline, author of the forthcoming book ""The Conscious Closet: The Revolutionary Guide to Looking Good While Doing Good.""¶The meteoric rise of ""fast fashion"" -- the business of quickly turning around new collections, often at lower prices to encourage consumption -- in particular is proving to be toxic for the environment. Linear systems use large quantities of nonrenewable resources, and more than half of these styles get tossed within a year, according to McKinsey's 2016 report ""Style that's sustainable: A new fast fashion formula.""¶More in Earth Day¶The apparel and footwear industries together accounted for more than 8 percent of global climate impacts -- the equivalent of 3,990 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2016, according to a report from Quantis. Total greenhouse gas emissions related to textiles production are equal to 1.2 billion tons annually -- more than those of all international flights and maritime shipping trips combined, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. ¶These challenges aren't insurmountable. Indeed, the crisis at hand represents an opportunity for industry players do what they do best -- be creative.¶Enter businesses like The RealReal, a thriving online and physical luxury consignment store valued at $450 million, according to research database PitchBook. Founded in 2011, its goal is to ""extend the life of luxury goods with the quality and craftmanship that make it possible for them to stay in circulation for longer,"" said Allison Sommer, the company's director of strategic initiatives.¶Its clients recognize the value of investing in luxury and consigning their wardrobes as an alternative to constantly turning over their closets. A clientele survey shows that 57 percent of TRR consignors cited environmental impact and sustainability as key motivators to consign, and 32 percent of customers said they shop TRR as an alternative to ""fast fashion,"" the company told CBS MoneyWatch. ¶""We are raising awareness of resale among shoppers and consignors, and what we see is shoppers understanding that investing in luxury pays off down the line,"" Sommers said. ""So that increases their motivation to spend in a smart way by perhaps spending more on an item originally but then understanding they can recoup that value when they choose to consign.""¶It's a winning formula for consumers -- and the environment. The company created a ""sustainability calculator"" to estimate that for every purchase of a consigned item, a third of that item is not newly produced. ¶It also makes good business sense. ""We have 25 million pounds of clothing thrown out in the U.S. per year, and most of it has not reached its usable life. So these companies are capitalizing on that,"" author Cline said. ¶Designer Stella McCartney, who has been dubbed ""the queen of sustainability"" for her eco-friendly fashion line, is widely considered to be a pioneer of the sustainable fashion movement. The  clothing in her collections uses reengineered versus virgin  cashmere, viscose fibers from forests, organic cotton and other  responsibly sourced and recycled materials. She doesn't use any real fur  or leather.   ¶She has also partnered with TRR by offering consigners $100 in credit to her store. ""If every single second there's a truckload of fast fashion being incinerated or landfilled, then I'm a big, big believer in reusing that and [participating in] the circular economy,"" she told Vogue in February. ""It's the biggest compliment for your product to have an afterlife -- to me, that's luxury.""¶Womenswear brand Dai, which makes versatile, comfortable workwear and launched its first collection in 2017, has been sustainable from its inception. Founder Joanna Dai designs timeless pieces intended to outlast trends, working with environmentally friendly fabrics and mills.¶""Obviously I care about the environment. And I thought if I have a blank canvas to start a supply chain from scratch, I will -- in every way I can -- build it to help the environment or lessen our footprint,"" Dai told CBS MoneyWatch. ¶Eileen Fisher, Theory and Patagonia are among the brands that accept ""take backs"" of their own clothing in exchange for store credit. ""The single best thing we can do for the planet is keep our gear in use longer and cut down on consumption,"" Patagonia says on its website. ¶A crop of rental services -- including Rent the Runway -- are capitalizing on the gradual shift toward subscription rather than ownership models of consumption. Offered at a monthly fee, the services provides members with unlimited access to ""the world's largest shared closet.""¶""Viewing fashion as a service -- as something we access instead of own -- is going to be a really important part of solving the environmental crisis that is fashion,"" author Cline said. ""Think about a generation of people expecting to be able to turn their closets over and follow fashion trends. Renting lets people kind of have it both ways.""¶Fortunately, habits seem to be shifting. The resale market is expected to outpace fast fashion within 10 years, according to the Business of Fashion's 2019 report on The State of Fashion. ¶Prizing variety, affordability and sustainability, consumers increasingly choose to rent rather than own goods outright, according to the same report. This is true across a variety of categories, including music, TV and vehicles -- think Spotify, Netflix and ZipCar. ""This trend is partly driven by the young generation's hunger for newness, while embracing sustainability,"" the report said. ¶Cline underscored that no single solution is the answer and that efforts to preserve the environment complement one another. ""We really have to come at it from every direction. Fashion brands have to be looking at their supply chain and how they make clothes and use less water, less energy,"" she said. ""Consumers have to look at the way they're shopping and say, 'how can I shop more sustainably in a way that fulfills my need to look good and feel good about myself?'"" ",0

    ","¶Trump Tower, as well as other big glass-clad buildings, must stop their polluting ways, New York City lawmakers say. The City Council on Thursday passed a slate of bills aimed at cutting buildings' carbon emissions.¶The laws apply to nearly all large buildings, but they will have an outsized impact on commercial construction because such structures have the highest emissions. An analysis from ALIGN-NY, an environmental group that supports the legislation, found that just 2 percent of the city's buildings consume 45 percent of its energy. ¶""These are New York City's largest buildings, over 50,000 square feet in size, which primarily consist of a mixture of luxury apartments, commercial buildings and multi-family housing developments,"" the group said in a 2015 report. Trump Tower emits more carbon than 92 percent of city buildings, and Trump International Hotel and the Mayfair Hotel are not far behind, according to ALIGN-NY.¶More in Climate Change¶The new rules are among a package of environmental protection laws enacted Thursday, including phasing out the city's fossil-fuel burning power plants, covering some  buildings' roofs with trees or greenery and making it easier to build  wind turbines. It marks the culmination of a decade of efforts to curb building emissions in America's biggest city. The package passed overwhelmingly, with 45 lawmakers voting in favor and two against. ¶""We're  going to send a message to the rest of the world that this is  attainable. And other cities can take this legislation and implement it  elsewhere. We expect other cities to follow New York, as they always do,"" the bill's primary sponsor, Council Member Costa Constantinides, said on its passing.¶Starting in 2024, New York City buildings over 25,000 square feet (about the size  of a  six-story apartment building) will be required to curb emissions; emissions must decline by 40 percent by 2030 and by 80 percent by 2050. Less aggressive restrictions were set for hospitals,  houses of worship and rent-regulated housing. ¶Some landlords and apartment owners say that requiring energy-saving upgrades will push the city's cost of living even higher. One coop president told the New York Daily News that the bill would ""bankrupt us, and kill the middle class.""¶But supporters of the bill, including many renters, say the cost of climate change can't be compared to potential rent increases. Rachel Rivera, a 40-year-old native New Yorker, said she nearly lost her daughter during Superstorm Sandy six years ago. Rivera had put her daughter, then 6 years old, to bed in their top-floor apartment. Minutes later, the apartment's ceiling, buckling under Sandy's heavy rain, caved in. The experience turned Rivera into an activist with New York Communities for Change, one of many groups that pushed for the bills. ¶""New York City is already sinking as it is, and it's going to be worse. There will be more superstorms like Sandy that hit New York,"" Rivera said. ""My concern is if we don't get off the dirty energy, we can't continue to worry about all this other stuff, we don't have a future. Things already are expensive as it is.""¶""This legislation is the first of its kind worldwide — there is no city that has set pollution standards on existing buildings,"" said Pete Sikora, climate campaigns director for New York Communities for Change. ""And we are thrilled, because not only does it slash pollution at the scale of the climate crisis — the level of cuts needed to give humanity a fighting chance at avoiding catastrophe worldwide —  it also creates many thousands of good jobs in the process.""¶Other U.S. cities may look to emulate New York in reducing building emissions. Hundreds pledged to cut their carbon emissions at a climate summit late last year. If the dramatic cuts that scientists say are necessary are to be met, cities will need to not only make new buildings environmentally sound, but also tackle existing buildings.¶Buildings and other structures are responsible for about 40 percent of carbon production in the U.S., but in dense cities it's the chief emitter. Buildings in New York emit nearly 70 percent of its greenhouse gases, the mayor's office recently reported.¶When it comes to carbon emissions,""The biggest piece is what's the [building's] heating and cooling  equipment. A lot of times we're using older technologies that are not as  efficient,"" said Jacob Corvidae, a principal in the buildings practice at Rocky Mountain Institute, a think tank focused on sustainability.¶Improving buildings' energy efficiency could mean switching out oil or gas furnaces for heat pumps, which are powered by electricity, or putting insulation around pipes and windows, to prevent hot or cold air from leaking. Older buildings also typically benefit from a wholesale replacement of the roof or windows. The bill leaves the choice of which improvements to make up to building owners.¶Making buildings more efficient also has other positive effects, Corvidae noted. ""People say, 'We should build a lot of renewables in the city.' But if you do things like efficiency first, you don't need to spend as much on building solar panels, because you're not using as much energy,"" he said.",0

    ","¶The blizzard pummeling the Upper Midwest and Plain States has already dished out widespread thundersnow, winds gusts close to 70 mph and over 2 feet of snow in spots. On top of that, it's happening in the month of April, just three weeks after the record-breaking bomb cyclone. By any measure these storms are considered extreme, but climate change is making them even more extreme. ¶The intensity of the storm is being powered by a sharp 60-degree temperature contrast — 80s in the Southeast and 20s in the Dakotas. Strong contrasts are typical for spring as warm and moist air surges north from the Gulf of Mexico and winter cold remains stubborn. But there's an added feature heightening the contrast called ""Arctic amplification.""¶This anomaly map is off the charts. Temperatures range from 30 degrees below normal to 20 degrees above normal on either side of the system. pic.twitter.com/2i0c0x3cPC¶Over the past couple of decades, the Arctic has warmed much faster than of the mid-latitudes, especially in winter. Warming of the globe is being caused by heat trapping greenhouse gases produced by the burning of fossil fuels. In the Arctic this warming effect is enhanced by melting sea ice. Ice typically reflects sunlight, keeping the Arctic cool. But since 1970 Arctic sea ice volume has decreased by 50%. Right now, Arctic sea ice extent is at record low levels. ¶#Arctic sea ice extent continues as a record low for the date. ¶It is ~250,000 km² below the prior record low, which was set just last year. pic.twitter.com/PurnPb16Ro¶This lack of ice results in a feedback loop with more heat being absorbed. The past few weeks are a good example of that phenomenon as the Arctic, including Alaska, has experienced record-breaking heat. Warmer-than-normal air stretches from Alaska east through Canada to Greenland. That broad warming has displaced a cold pool of air southward into the U.S. mainland. Consequently, the storm moving across the nation's middle has an excess of warm-cold contrast to feed off of.¶How does climate change lead to extreme weather? Here's a clear connection. The Arctic is unusually warm now. Much is forced by climate change-Arctic Amplification. That warm wall displaces cold air south & intensifies the thermal contrast, resulting in a more extreme blizzard! pic.twitter.com/rJn7MJQIia¶In this way it is easy to see a direct link between changing climate, specifically in the Arctic, and extreme weather events elsewhere. What happens in the Arctic does not stay in the Arctic. ¶More in Climate Change¶""This is a very active area of climate change research,"" said Sean Sublette, a meteorologist at Climate Central, a non-profit focusing on climate change communication. ""There is compelling evidence linking the warming Arctic to changing jet stream patterns in middle latitudes here in the United States. These changes could lead to a slower moving jet stream, which is more susceptible to large southerly dips."" ¶When cold pockets embedded in the jet stream dip further south, they interact with air from the sub-tropics. ¶""Yesterday's cyclone advected air from the Gulf of Mexico, which was anomalously warm for the season making it more intense. A warmer Gulf is what we would expect from climate change,"" explained Dr. Andreas Prein, a climate scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. ¶Prein says all weather events are affected by climate change because they develop in a warmer and moister climate than in the early 20th century. The degree of affect varies from event to event. But simple physics dictates that as the atmosphere warms it holds more water vapor and drops more precipitation. ¶This has been especially true in the Upper Midwest where extreme events have dumped close to 40% more precipitation since 1958. This has led to an increase in river flooding. ¶And the trend is expected to continue into the future. The 2018 U.S. federal government's National Climate Assessment projects that overall precipitation in the Upper Midwest may increase around 20% by late century, with an even greater share falling in extreme weather events.¶Image left: Trends in river flooding magnitude since 1920s.

As a result, dozens of river gauges in the area are still registering major or moderate flooding. The extreme storm hitting this week is likely to make the flooding worse in the coming days.¶As climate change continues to escalate, the adverse impacts on our everyday lives will grow. Prein stresses more study is needed.  ""Climate attribution studies have to be conducted to study the exact impact of climate change on these cyclones but events like these might become more frequent and more severe in the future.""",0
"Climate change has caused an 89% decrease in new coral in the Great Barrier Reef, study finds","

    ","¶Global warming has caused such extensive damage to the Great Barrier Reef that scientists say its coral may never recover. According to a study published Wednesday in the journal Nature, baby coral in Australia's Great Barrier Reef have declined by 89% due to mass bleaching in 2016 and 2017.¶The study measured the number of surviving adult corals in the Great Barrier Reef — the world's largest reef system — following extreme heat stress, as well as how many new corals it was able to replenish in 2018. Deadly back-to-back bleaching events devastated the reef, and now its ecosystem is struggling to recover. Not only have ocean heat waves led to a dramatic decrease in new coral, but also a change in the types of coral species being produced.¶Researchers studied adult and baby coral from 47 locations in various years from 1996 to 2016, then returned to the reef in 2018 to collect the same data. They found that a majority of the northern region's coral has not been able to recover following mass bleaching events, leading to a decline in new coral as well. ¶More in Climate Change¶""Dead corals don't make babies,"" the study's lead author, Professor Terry Hughes, director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University, said in a press release. ¶According to the study, the biggest decline in replenishment came from the reef's dominant species of adult coral, called Acropora, which supports thousands of other species. It experienced a 93% drop compared to previous years. The change is likely to reduce the reef's overall diversity, which will make it even less resilient to future bleaching events. ""Our study shows that reef resilience is now severely compromised by global warming,"" said co-author Professor Andrew Baird.¶Scientists expect the coral may recover over the next five to ten years — but only if another mass bleaching event doesn't occur during that time. That's unlikely given the current trajectory of climate change. The researchers said southern reefs that did not suffer bleaching are still in good condition, they are not close enough to replenish the damaged reefs that are further north.¶Bleaching occurs when corals are stressed by unusual environmental changes, such as increased sea temperature. They respond by expelling the symbiotic algae living in their tissues, causing the coral to turn white. Without the algae, the coral loses its major source of food and often can't survive. Widespread coral bleaching during back-to-back summers was particularly toxic, as it did not leave enough time for the corals to fully recover. ¶The Great Barrier Reef — which stretches for more than 1,400 miles off the coast of Australia — has gone through four mass bleaching events due to above-average sea temperatures in 1998, 2002, 2016 and 2017. Time periods between future bleaching events are expected to continue to shrink as global warming intensifies. ¶""It's highly unlikely that we could escape a fifth or sixth event in the coming decade,"" said co-author Professor Morgan Pratchett. ""We used to think that the Great Barrier Reef was too big to fail – until now.""¶UNESCO — the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization — placed the Great Barrier Reef on its list of World Heritage sites in 1981. In recent years it has registered official ""concern"" about the reef's condition but stopped short of declaring it ""in danger.""¶ ""There's only one way to fix this problem,"" said Hughes, ""and that's to tackle the root cause of global heating by reducing net greenhouse gas emissions to zero as quickly as possible.""",0
"Coal is a financial bust, but carbon emissions keep rising","

    ","¶Although coal remains a potent political symbol in the U.S., as a profit-making enterprise the industry is running on fumes. Most of America's coal plants cost so much to run that they'd be cheaper to replace with renewable energy, according to a new analysis.  ¶Utility-scale wind and solar power have been competitive with coal in different parts of the world for several years. But a report out this week from Energy Innovation shows just how inefficient coal plants have become as a way of delivering power. Three-quarters of U.S. coal capacity could be replaced with solar or wind resources within 35 miles of the closed plant, the research firm found. It predicts that, by 2050, 95 percent of America's existing coal fleet will be more costly than renewables. ¶Yet while the coal industry is struggling financially -- the U.S. led the world in retiring old coal plants last year -- coal as an energy source remains the main driver of carbon emissions, which rose to a new high last year. ""As a result of higher energy consumption, CO2 emissions rose 1.7 percent last year and hit a new record,"" the International Energy Association announced this week.¶More in Climate Change¶Coal plants are particularly unprofitable in the U.S. because of the country's unique mix of energy resources. Cheap renewable technology and an abundance of natural gas, fueled by the ""fracking"" push, have driven down the cost of electricity. ¶As a result, coal plants ""are putting a lot of power in the marketplace, and the price they're getting is cheaper than the price they need to cover the costs of the coal,"" said Geoffrey Heal, a professor of economics at Columbia Business School.¶The dropping price of coal has driven eight U.S. coal companies into bankruptcy since 2015, including the three largest—Peabody Energy, Arch Coal and Cloud Peak Energy. Peabody, which is responsible for one-fifth of all U.S. coal extraction, reorganized and went public in 2017. It then saw its operating income drop the following year, even as the White House launched an aggressive pro-coal policy. Coal prices dropped further in 2018, leading Peabody to remind investors in its latest annual report that ""the vast majority of third-party analysts project that prices are likely to decline.""¶Elsewhere, the dynamics are different. In Europe and Asia, natural gas costs double or triple what it does in the U.S. Unlike oil, gas is hard to transport long distances, so regional prices can vary a lot. Many foreign coal plants are also much more efficient than their U.S. counterparts, generating up to 30 percent more power from the same amount of coal.¶""Most of the coal plants in the U.S. were built between 1950 and 1980,"" said Julio Friedmann, a senior research scholar at Columbia University's Center for Global Energy Policy. ""But the U.S. doesn't make policy in other countries. You're not going to go to China and displace a coal plant with a solar farm or a wind farm.""¶The outgrowth of those economics is that China is both the world's largest user of coal and the largest developer and user of renewable power. The country last year added four times as much solar capacity as the U.S. did, but it also restarted work on 50 gigawatts of coal capacity (That's about one-fifth of the U.S.' current coal capacity.) ¶""You can accept the good news and the bad news simultaneously,"" said Friedmann. ""It's possible to deploy a whole bunch of renewables and make a whole bunch of progress -- and still grow emissions. It's the difference between not gaining weight and losing weight.""¶Newer coal plants may be more efficient, but they're still not efficient enough. For the first time, the International Energy Agency recently analyzed the contribution of various fuels to global warming. A key finding: Carbon dioxide from burning coal is responsible for 30 percent of the average temperature increase the world has seen since the Industrial Revolution. ¶""This makes coal the single largest source of global temperature increase,"" the agency said.¶Here's another way to think of it: To keep global temperatures from rising less than 2 degrees -- a threshold scientists say is vital to forestall the most catastrophic effects of climate change -- virtually all coal plants need to be phased out quickly. And total emissions from all sources need to drop by up to one-half. ¶India, which is seeing a boom in solar installations after gorging on coal plants less than 10 years ago, illustrates the problem. The country experienced a boom in coal-plant permits about a decade ago before  rapid development of solar made many of those plans obsolete.  (One-third are currently more expensive than renewables, according to a  recent analysis.)¶Given how expensive coal plants are to build, they can take decades just to break even for their owners—even as they spew climate-changing emissions, not to mention toxic ash and other pollutants. It's harder to shut down a plant that was built just 10 years ago, even if there is a much cheaper option. ¶""It's not something where you can very lightly, in five years, say, 'This was a bad idea.' The plant life is 40 years,"" said Gregory Reed, director of the Center for Energy at the  University of Pittsburgh. ""I worry about the long-term impact from these short-term decisions.""   ",0

A new report by the Canadian government's Environment and Climate Change department indicates that the country is warming at a significantly faster rate than the rest of the world. ¶Canada's Changing Climate Report concludes that, on average, Canada's climate has been warming at double the rate of the world as a whole — a trend that scientists expect to continue. Since 1948, Canada's average land temperature has increased by 1.7 degrees Celsius, or about 3 degrees Fahrenheit. Temperatures in northern Canada have increased even more. For comparison, scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies estimate that the average global temperature has increased 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit (0.8 degrees Celsius) since 1880. ¶Many of the effects of Canada's warming are ""effectively irreversible,"" the report states. And it affirms that ""human influence"" is more to blame for the observed temperature increases than natural causes.¶More in Climate Change¶Some other key findings of the report include: ¶""Climate change is real, and Canadians across the country are feeling its impacts,"" Catherine McKenna, Minister of Environment and Climate Change, said in a press release. ""The science is clear, we need to take action now. Practical and affordable solutions to fight climate change will help Canadians face the serious risks to our health, security and economy, and will also create the jobs of tomorrow and secure a better future for our kids and grandkids.""¶The effects of global warming are also being felt by Canada's neighbor, Alaska. Last weekend, parts of Alaska hit temperatures of 30 to 40 degrees above normal, shattering previous records. ""Between a rapidly changing environment and lack of societal response, I'm very concerned,"" climate expert Rick Thoman, of NOAA's Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy, told CBS News last week. ¶A recent U.N. climate report said extreme weather impacted 62 million people worldwide and forced 2 million people to relocate in 2018, and that man-made climate change is exacerbating such conditions. The past four years were the warmest on record, the report said. U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres called climate change a security and health issue for the entire world. ¶Young people are increasingly calling on government leaders to do more to combat climate change.

But this month's warmth in the state is out of bounds, even for Rick Thoman.¶The climate expert at NOAA's Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy used the word when stating that the month of March — for Alaska as a whole — will be the 29th month since January 2013 to be ranked in the warmest ten percent since 1925.¶And it's likely to get even warmer as we round out the month. On Saturday, villages along the northern coast of Alaska, right on the Arctic Ocean, are expected to spike to 40 degrees Fahrenheit above normal.¶More in Climate Change¶""March is now so warm that not only is it certain that this will be the warmest March, but would be warm enough to be in the top 10 Aprils!"" Thoman said about the temperatures in Alaska.¶This is startling: for Alaska as a whole, March is going to be the 29th month since Jan 2013 to be ranked in the warmest ten percent since 1925. That's 39% of months. In the same period, one month, April 2013, ranks in the coldest 10%. #akwx #Arctic @Climatologist49 @IARC_Alaska pic.twitter.com/VucrVBvJT5¶At least three cities in the northern half of the state — Deadhorse, Kotzebue and Eagle — are expected to soon shatter records for the largest March departure from normal for any city in the U.S. by the end of the month, according to climatologist Brian Brettschneider.¶It should be noted that while temperatures are running 23 degrees above normal in Deadhorse, the average March temperature there is 13 below zero — so the weather is by no means warm. But for residents used to subzero temperatures, an expected high of 35 on Saturday along the northern coast of Alaska will feel balmy.¶Weather computer models show the warm streak will last at least another week, if not longer.¶Deadhorse, AK, is set to finish March about 23°F above normal for the month. The U.S. record for the most above normal March was Circle Hot Springs, AK, in March 1965 (20.9°F above the 1931-1960 normal). Kotzebue and Eagle should finish 21°F to 22°F above normal. @AlaskaWx¶The warmth is all part of a rapid, long-term trend in Alaska. In the past 50 years, the city of Barrow on the northern tip of Alaska has seen an 11-degree spike in its average yearly temperature. By comparison, the average global rise in temperature since the late 1800s has been about 2 degrees.¶According to the 2018 National Climate Assessment Alaska ""is among the fastest warming regions on Earth."" It is warming two to three times faster than the rest of the lower 48 states and faces a myriad of issues associated with a changing climate. ""The dramatic warming in recent decades is in a significant part due to the decline in sea ice and ocean warming,"" Thoman said.¶Sea ice acts as a natural refrigerator. When sunlight hits the ice, it bounces directly back into space. That keeps the Arctic cool. In the last 40 years, however, Arctic ice volume has declined by an astounding 50 percent. That exposes darker shaded ocean water, which absorbs more heat. It has become a vicious cycle, fueling a phenomenon known as Arctic Amplification.¶Late fall temperature departures (anomaly) during the last 40 years in the #Arctic. This time of year coincides with the greatest ""Arctic Amplification"" ¶[Data from ERA-Interim reanalysis in October-December] pic.twitter.com/4fOM9XNiAB¶This winter has been no exception. Ice cover on the Bering Sea, which separates Alaska from Russia, has been near or below record levels much of the winter. As a result, Alaska is on the front lines of climate change.¶Ice loss can be devastating during the stormy fall, winter and springs months. Typically, solid sea ice forms as a barrier protecting coastal communities from monster storms with wicked winds and waves. Recently that solid ice is no longer reliable and when it breaks up, waves come crashing ashore eroding the shoreline, inundating villages and damaging homes.¶Another major concern with warming is the melting of permafrost, which destabilizes the ground and damages infrastructure on top if it. The trend is expected to accelerate as the climate warms.¶An alarming model of Alaskan #permafrost. Less yellow indicates permafrost thaw. Permafrost thaw means the #greenhouse gases currently stored inside will leak into the atmosphere. The problem? Permafrost stores more #carbon than has ever been released by humans.

When melted, methane is released. Since methane is 30 times more potent as a heat trapping greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, it traps even more heat and accelerates global warming.¶The rapid changes have Thoman worried. ""Between a rapidly changing environment and lack of societal response, I'm very concerned,"" he said.¶He's worried not just for his beloved Alaska, but also for everyone else. When asked if he had any wisdom for those further south, still waiting on the worst impacts of climate change to hit, he said, ""Some impactful changes will not be gradual: tipping points will unexpectedly be crossed and society will then have to respond repeatedly in crisis mode.""",0

    ","¶In 2015, it lost a piece of ice the size of Manhattan.  But now a major Greenland glacier that was one of the fastest shrinking ice and snow masses on Earth is growing again, a new NASA study finds. ¶Six years ago, the Jakobshavn glacier was retreating about 1.8 miles and thinning nearly 130 feet annually but it started growing again at about the same rate in the past two years, according to a study in Monday's Nature Geoscience. Study authors and outside scientists think this is temporary.¶""That was kind of a surprise. We kind of got used to a runaway system,"" said Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland ice and climate scientist Jason Box. ""The good news is that it's a reminder that it's not necessarily going that fast. But it is going.""¶More in Climate Change¶Box, who wasn't part of the study, said Jakobshavn is ""arguably the most important Greenland glacier because it discharges the most ice in the northern hemisphere. For all of Greenland, it is king.""¶A natural cyclical cooling of North Atlantic waters likely caused the glacier to reverse course, said study lead author Ala Khazendar, a NASA glaciologist on the Oceans Melting Greenland (OMG) project. Khazendar and colleagues say this coincides with a flip of the North Atlantic Oscillation - a natural and temporary cooling and warming of parts of the ocean that is like a distant cousin to El Nino in the Pacific.¶The water in Disko Bay, where Jakobshavn hits the ocean, is about 3.6 degrees cooler (2 degrees Celsius) than a few years ago, study authors said.¶While this is ""good news"" on a temporary basis, this is bad news on the long term because it tells scientists that ocean temperature is a bigger player in glacier retreats and advances than previously thought, said NASA climate scientist Josh Willis, a study co-author.  Over the decades the water has been and will be warming from man-made climate change, he said, noting that about 90 percent of the heat trapped by greenhouse gases goes into the oceans.¶""In the long run we'll probably have to raise our predictions of sea level rise again,"" Willis said.¶Think of the ocean temperatures near Greenland like an escalator that's rising slowly from global warming, Khazendar said. But the natural North Atlantic Oscillation sometimes is like jumping down a few steps or jumping up a few steps. The water can get cooler and have effects, but in the long run it is getting warmer and the melting will be worse, he said.¶Four outside scientists said the study and results make sense.¶University of Washington ice scientist Ian Joughin, who wasn't part of the study and predicted such a change seven years ago, said it would be a ""grave mistake"" to interpret the latest data as contradicting climate change science.¶What's happening, Joughin said, is ""to a large extent, a temporary blip.

    ","¶In the three years since most of the world's nations signed on to the Paris climate agreement, major oil and gas companies have poured more than $100 billion into their fossil-fuel infrastructure. That's more than 10 times the amount the same companies have spent on low-carbon investments, despite lip service toward that area, according to a new report. ¶InfluenceMap analyzed public disclosures of major oil and gas companies. The five biggest—ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron, BP and Total—will collectively spend $115 billion on capital investments this year, according to the report. Just 3 percent of that spending will go to low-carbon investments, like hydrogen batteries or electric-car charging stations.¶InfluenceMap contrasts this with the money the companies spent on ""branding and lobbying"" related to climate, which cost the oil and gas giants $1 billion since the end of 2015, per the report. That includes money spent directly as well as through trade groups that oppose carbon restrictions, including the American Petroleum Institute and American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers.¶More in Climate Change¶""The aim is to maintain public support on the issue while holding back binding policy,"" the report says. The spending shows ""the increasing disconnect between the oil majors' efforts towards positive climate branding and their lobbying and actual business decisions,"" it reads.¶BP last year put $13 million toward defeating a carbon pricing  proposal in Washington State. Exxon stated it would support a carbon tax, provided that the tax wouldn't raise any government money and would  offer immunity in climate-change lawsuits, of which there are many. At  the same time, Exxon ran extensive social media ads promoting  oil and gas development and opposing restrictions on fossil fuels. ¶That's significant because scientists have given the world a roughly 10-year window to rapidly move off fossil fuels if it is to avoid catastrophic levels of warming, according to the United Nations' climate change panel and the U.S. federal government. Recognizing this, oil and gas companies have devoted more attention to low-carbon rhetoric, though InfluenceMap notes there's a lack of money backing the investment in alternatives. ¶The U.S. dramatically ramped up its oil and gas production last year, becoming the world's top producer of oil for the first time in four decades.

They're not just thin layers of ice and rock, they're gigantic mountains of ice, two to three miles thick so that's a lot of sea level that's locked up in these ice sheets.""¶Scientists on NASA's ice-survey flights have confirmed that more ice melts into the sea each year than gets added back to the ice cap through snowfall.¶""There are several spots around here, around Antarctica, that are believed to be in this irreversible situation, where the ice on the ground is going to flow into the sea and there's nothing we can do to stop it at this point,"" said Ken Taylor, an ice scientist who has been studying the changes in Antarctica for years.¶The consequence is ""inevitable sea level rise,"" Taylor said. ""There's at least three feet already locked in down here in Antarctica.""¶Also inevitable is the threat to low-lying coastal areas around the world that the sea-level rise will cause.  It may take decades for that to happen, but it will happen. The more the darker sea-water is exposed, the faster the sunlight warms it, the faster the adjoining ice melts.¶In the meantime, NASA's program of ice measuring flights is coming to an end. A new satellite will take over a lot of the scientific work. But further investment is in doubt because the United States' chief executive remains a climate change skeptic.¶""What about the scientists who say it's worse than ever?"" Lesley Stahl asked President Donald Trump on the Oct. 14, 2018, edition of CBS News' ""60 Minutes.""¶""You have to show me the scientists because they have a very big political agenda,"" he responded.¶""You know, we're not politicians here, we're not policy people, we're just engineers and scientists. I don't know anything about politics, but I do know how to measure changing ice,"" Sonntag said. ""People can't hide from facts forever, and I think the American people understand that."" ¶It can take a trip down here to immerse yourself in the realities of climate change.¶""It is, for some people, a controversial discussion, what we have. But here, of course, we have it — it's all around us and I think you can do it without having a political thing behind it,"" said Kruess. ""You're just looking, really, at facts, and you are discussing those.""¶Kruess believes it's important for the people who come here to see what they see and to take back the message.¶""We believe that we are producing ambassadors,"" he said.¶Even among the tourists who come down here, like Lori Fey, there is pause for thought. ¶""It gives us a broader perspective and a deeper understanding of what the science actually is in an apolitical environment so that each of us can go back and go, well you know you might want to look a little deeper, here's some really interesting facts that I recently learned,"" Fey said.¶""My hope is that the science prevails and I think it will, because in the long path of human history, it always has,"" said Sonntag.",0
Perfect storm of extreme weather and climate change drove deadly Midwest flooding,"

    ","¶Record-breaking, historic, even Biblical — that's how many are describing the scale of flooding in the Midwest, where thousands of people in Iowa and Nebraska have been forced to flee their homes. In a region that's no stranger to rising floodwaters, a perfect storm of melting snow, ""bomb cyclone"" rain and climate change conspired to push these floods over the top.¶As of Monday, 100 river gauges in the Midwest and Mississippi River valleys remained at major or moderate flood stage, with many in record-setting territory. This weekend, the Missouri River at Plattsmouth, Nebraska — just south of Omaha — crested 4 feet above its highest recorded level. ¶So how did this happen?¶More in Climate Change¶The 2018-2019 winter has been defined by a fairly consistent, stubborn pattern featuring two distinct weather regimes. In the West, a roaring Pacific jet stream brought relentless storms and colder-than-normal temperatures. In the East, the opposite weather dominated, with mild and relatively quiet conditions. Separating the two regimes was a persistent storm track propelling storm after storm over the Midwest.¶This persistent weather pattern, boosted by a weak El Niño, combined for the wettest winter on record across the U.S. In Minneapolis, snowfall measured 20 inches above normal, while Omaha registered its snowiest season on record. As a result, the ground was saturated and frozen — making the region a sitting duck for last week's bomb cyclone.¶The bomb cyclone was itself a historic event, with wind gusts close to 100 mph and record-setting low pressure. It dropped blinding snowfall on its western side in Colorado, and heavy rains in the eastern Plains and Midwest. But those impacts paled in comparison to the flooding it triggered.¶With a dense layer of snow blanketing areas from Nebraska and Missouri to Wisconsin, the heavy rains couldn't seep into the frozen ground. Along with melting snow, the rain instead became runoff that caused rivers to swell. Further complicating matters, thick ice jams clogged the flow of the water, causing it to spill over onto adjacent land.  ¶#NebraskaFloods seen by #Sentinel2 🇪🇺🛰 pic.twitter.com/bKKlVSVcCM¶While this confluence of events can and does happen in a normal climate, a warmed climate makes it all the more likely. That's because there is more energy and moisture available.¶Last week's bomb cyclone had a low-pressure equivalent to that of a Category 2 hurricane. That kind of low pressure is occasionally seen in nor'easters, but rarely if ever in storms in the lower Plain states. This follows what is expected as the climate changes — spiked storms, with more extremes.¶A warmer climate has led to heavier rainfall. Since the early 1900s, annual precipitation has ticked up by 15 to 20 percent in the Upper Midwest. But the more important number is the increase in rainfall from the most extreme weather events, which have dropped nearly 40 percent more rain since 1958.¶Trends in heavy rain events since earlier in the 1900s. Not only is annual rainfall increasing, but much of that extra rainfall is falling in a few yearly extreme rainfalls. That is how climate change loads the dice. #MetsUnite! pic.twitter.com/8m3p18kT69¶While an increase in rain can be absorbed by the ground if that rainfall is spread out over the course of the year, additional rain on top of already heavy events magnifies flooding.¶In the case of extreme rain, the connection to climate change is simple: Warmer ocean waters evaporate more moisture into the air. A warmer atmosphere holds more moisture. That extra moisture falls as heavier rain. This effect was vividly on display in hurricanes like Harvey and Florence, when rain totals shattered all-time records.¶Research shows the Midwest is feeling a disproportionate impact from heavier flooding. Going forward, global climate models continue to project areas like the Midwest, Great Lakes and Northeast will see the greatest increases in yearly precipitation in the U.S.¶Image left: Trends in river flooding magnitude since 1920s.

Students worldwide skip school to demand tough action on climate change,"

    ","¶From the South Pacific to the edge of the Arctic Circle, students mobilized by social media and word of mouth skipped class Friday to protest what they believe are their governments' failure to take tough action against global warming. The rallies were one of the biggest international actions yet, involving hundreds of thousands of students in more than 100 countries around the globe.¶The coordinated ""school strikes"" were inspired by 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, who began holding solitary demonstrations outside the Swedish parliament last year. Since then, the weekly protests have snowballed from a handful of cities to hundreds, fueled by dramatic headlines about the impact of climate change during the students' lifetime.¶Thunberg, who was recently nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, said as protesters cheered her name  at a rally in Stockholm that the world faces an ""existential crisis, the biggest crisis humanity ever has faced, and still it has been ignored for decades by those that have known about it. And you know who you are, you that have ignored this and are most guilty of this.""¶More in Climate Change¶Across the globe, protests big and small urged politicians to act against climate change while also highlighting local environmental problems.¶#ClimateStrike NYC Columbus Circle pic.twitter.com/zM2XiIIKXG¶A website used to coordinate the rallies listed events in over 2,000 cities. In the U.S., Alexandria Villasenor founded Youth Climate Strike U.S. along with 12-year-old Haven Coleman and 16-year-old Isra Hirsi.¶They're calling for, among other things, ""100 percent renewable energy by 2030,"" CBS News correspondent Tony Dokoupil reported. For more than three months, Villasenor has been playing hooky from the 7th grade on Fridays and going to U.N. headquarters in New York in hopes of pushing adults into action against global warming.¶""Since climate change will be a global problem, I decided that this would be the best place to strike,"" she told CBS News. She expected students to be striking in all 50 states Friday.¶In a speech Friday outside the U.N., Villasenor said world leaders weren't listening. ""Our world leaders are the ones acting like children,"" she said. ""They are the ones having tantrums, arguing with each other and refusing to take responsibility for their actions while the planet burns.""¶Later, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was inspired by the students to call a special summit in September to deal with what he called ""the climate emergency."" ""My generation has failed to respond properly to the dramatic challenge of climate change,"" Guterres wrote in an opinion piece in The Guardian. ""This is deeply felt by young people. No wonder they are angry.""¶Danish Prime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen showed up at a protest in Copenhagen and tweeted Friday ""We must listen to the youth. Especially when they're right: the climate must be one of our top priorities.""¶We must listen to the youth. Especially when they’re right: the climate must be one of our top priorities. Hope all these bright young people will be back in school on Monday - we’ll need great scientists to help solve the climate issues in the future #fridaysforfuture pic.twitter.com/dn1DxcJV6P¶Carla Reemtsma, a 20-year-old university student who helped organize the protest in Berlin, said she's part of about 50 WhatsApp groups devoted to discussing climate change. ""A lot happens on social media because you can reach a lot of young people very quickly and show them: look there's lot of us,"" she told the Associated Press. ""There's a very low threshold so we reach a huge number of people.""¶""I think that's how we managed to get so big,"" said Reemtsma. Many protesters in Berlin took aim at politicians such as the leader of Germany's pro-business Free Democratic Party, Christian Lindner, for suggesting that complicated issues such as climate change were ""a matter for professionals"" not students.¶Others, including Germany's economy minister, Peter Altmaier, have urged students to stage the protests outside school hours. ¶Volker Quaschning, a professor of engineering at Berlin's University of Applied Sciences, said it was easy for politicians to belittle students. ""That's why they need our support,"" he said. ""If we do nothing then parts of this planet could become uninhabitable by the end of the century.""¶Scientists have backed the protests, with thousands signing petitions in support of the students in Britain, Finland, Germany and the U.S. ""It gives me great hope,"" environmentalist Bill McKibben told CBS News contributing meteorologist Jeff Berardelli. ""This new generation is doing all it can to make sure that we older people don't foreclose their chance for a decent life. It's beautiful to see their courage, their passion -- if anyone ever thought 'kids today' don't care about the world, or are spending all their time on video games, the photos from around the world should renew their faith.""¶Scientists have warned for decades that current levels of greenhouse gas emissions are unsustainable, so far with little effect. In 2015, world leaders agreed in Paris to a goal of keeping the Earth's global temperature rise by the end of the century well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit).¶Yet at present, the world is on track for an increase of 4 degrees Celsius, which experts said would have far-reaching consequences for life on the planet. In Germany, environmental groups and experts have attacked government plans to continue using coal and natural gas for decades to come.¶Quaschning, who was one of more than 23,000 German-speaking scientists to sign a letter of support this week, said Germany should aim to fully ""decarbonize"" by 2040. This would give less-advanced nations a bit more time to wean themselves off fossil fuels while still meeting the Paris goal globally.¶""This is going to require radical measures and there isn't the slightest sign of that happening yet,"" said Quaschning.¶A poll published Friday by German public broadcaster ZDF found that 67 percent of respondents backed the students' protests during school hours, with 32 percent opposed. The representative telephone poll conducted between March 12 and 14 involved 1,290 randomly selected voters. The margin of error was about 3 percentage points.¶In Stockholm, Greta Thunberg predicted that students won't let up their protests. ""There are a crisis in front of us that we have to live with, that we will have to live with for all our lives, our children, our grandchildren and all future generations,"" she said.¶""We won't accept that, we won't let that happen and that's why we go on strike. We are on strike because we do want a future, we will carry on,"" she said.",0

    ","¶Teen climate activist Greta Thunberg has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of her efforts to combat climate change. ¶The Swedish 16-year-old is an inspirational yet unlikely leader of weekly school strikes that have gained momentum worldwide. On Friday, she will be one of the hundreds of thousands of students around the world expected to skip school and take the streets for climate action. The Youth Climate Strike will take place in more than 130 cities in the U.S., and in 90 countries. ¶""More people are starting to become aware of the situation and that we are facing a crisis,"" Thunberg said on CBSN Thursday. ""And I think it is amazing to see that hundreds of thousands of children from all around the world are realizing this and are making their voices heard. Why should we go and study for a future that may not exist anymore?""¶More in Climate Change¶She planted the seed of the movement when Sweden was having its parliamentary elections last September. The then-15-year-old skipped school for three weeks and sat outside the country's Parliament building with a sign demanding radical action from government on climate change. But even after the elections were over, her protests continued. Her efforts eventually got the attention of world leaders when she delivered a blistering speech at the UN's climate conference in December. ¶""I just thought that nothing is happening and no one is doing anything to fight climate change,"" she told CBSN. ""And then I thought, 'If no one does anything, I'll have to do something.' When I grow older I want to look back and say I did what I could back then.""¶She soon gained a large following on social media for her work, and the movement she started spread to other countries across Europe and around the world. ¶According to the Nobel Prize organization, any national member of government can nominate an individual for the heralded peace award. Freddy André Ovstegard and two other Norwegian lawmakers chose Thunberg because of her leadership in the fight against climate change. ¶""We have nominated Greta because the climate threat may be one of the most important contributions to war and conflict,"" Ovstegard told Norwegian newspaper VG. ""The massive movement Greta has set in motion is a very important peace contribution."" ¶Thunberg told CBSN that when she heard the new she didn't know how to react.¶""There have been several people nominating me and I found out the first ones were maybe a month ago and then more people by time, but I think it is unbelievable,"" she said. ¶The prize will be announced in October and awarded in December. If Thunberg wins, she would be the youngest recipient since Malala Yousafzai, who was 17 years old when she received the prize.   ",0

    ","¶When Rep. Garret Graves of Louisiana was chosen to serve on a new House committee dedicated to climate change, the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) supported the pick. In January he co-sponsored a conservation bill introduced in the House, and environmental groups have applauded his past work to protect and restore coastal communities. The third-term congressman says he believes ""some components"" of climate change can be considered a national emergency. ¶He's also a Republican. ¶""It's important that we redefine the narrative,"" Graves said in an interview with CBS News. ""Do I think that there are components of what some view as climate change as being a crisis? Yeah. Yeah, I do.""¶More in Climate Change¶Graves, 47, is the top GOP member on the newly appointed House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, a pick conservatives applauded as ""savvy.""¶""He's a really great member to take on a really complex challenge like this,"" said Rich Powell, executive director of Clear Path, a nonprofit advocating for conservative clean energy policies. ""He's from a state that's right at the nexus of these issues.""¶Before his election to Congress in 2014, Graves served as chairman of the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority, a state agency established after Hurricane Katrina to protect and restore wetlands and shorelines. More recently, he's been pushing the Trump administration to finally provide relief funds for victims Louisiana's catastrophic 2016 floods. ¶His home state affords Graves a unique vantage point to witness the effects of climate change. Louisiana is prone to extreme weather, such as hurricanes and high coastal flooding that can lead to intense erosion. According to the EDF, the equivalent of a football field of land disappears into the Gulf of Mexico every 100 minutes. ¶""We've lost 2,000 square miles of our coast,"" Graves said. ""If the state of Rhode Island lost 2,000 square miles, we'd have 49 states today.""¶According to a recent analysis by the federal government, Louisiana also ranks among the top 10 states in both crude oil reserves and annual crude oil production. The state's 17 oil refineries account for 20 percent of the country's refining capacity. But the industry has also come with some severely detrimental environmental costs, most notably the 2010 BP oil spill, which dumped an estimated 4.9 million barrels of crude oil into the Gulf. ¶Graves' connection to the fossil fuel industry has drawn scrutiny. Graves has received $515,634 in donations from the oil and gas industry over the past five years, according to campaign finance data compiled by Open Secrets. That amount is easily higher than the other five Republicans on the climate change committee, who have received an average of $108,773 in donations from the industry over the course of their careers. ¶Additionally, the League of Conservation Voters gave Graves' a grade of 0 percent on its 2018 environmental scorecard, meaning he voted against all legislation LCV deemed important for the environment. His overall lifetime score is just 3 percent.¶""I think a 3 percent speaks for itself,"" said Tiernan Sittenfeld, the LCV's senior vice president for government affairs. ""And it's pretty appalling.""¶Other Republicans on the panel don't fair much better. Virginia Rep. Morgan Griffith clocks in with the highest lifetime score of the group at 5 percent. Georgia Rep. Buddy Carter also has a score of 0 percent. ¶Graves' Democratic counterpart is Florida Rep. Kathy Castor, chairwoman of the House climate change committee.¶""Mr. Graves represents a state and district that is bearing escalating costs from climate change, just like my district and the state of Florida,"" Castor said in a statement to CBS News. ""These impacts do not discriminate based on political party.""¶The panel held its first session March 6. The special committee was created by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in response to demands by freshmen progressive lawmakers, including New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who wasn't named to the panel.¶The committee's mandate isn't as strong as those progressive members had hoped. For example, the group has no legislative authority or subpoena power. Democrats also criticized Republicans for naming members from coal country, like Carter and Rep. Carol Miller of West Virginia. ¶However, Graves sees the lack of legislative authority as a benefit, arguing it removes party politics from the committee's work.  ¶""I really don't think this has to be a partisan issue, although it certainly can devolve to that,"" Graves said. ""Let's learn a little bit more about the science, and de-politicize it so we can focus on the facts.""¶While climate change has become an integral part of Democrats' platform, Republicans have largely downplayed its effects and hampered efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But growing public awareness of the issue could spur some Republican policymakers to change their approach.¶After Hurricane Michael devastated Florida in October 2018, a CBS News poll  found 61 percent of Americans believed global warming exists and is caused mainly by human activity. That was seven percentage points higher than in April of the same year, and 21 percentage points higher than in 2011. A recent report by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication found 73 percent of Americans say climate change is happening, an increase of 10 percentage points since March 2015.¶According to Powell, of the Clear Path nonprofit, Republicans took notice of those upticks. ¶""We're sort of moved past the debate about whether this is a problem and we're now onto the spirited debate to find the solutions,"" Powell added.¶There's additional evidence times are changing, with new progressive lawmakers in Congress forcing a conversation about climate change through proposals like the Green New Deal.¶""We're obviously thrilled to have a pro-environment majority in the House,"" Sittenfeld of the LCV said. ""We had more candidates than ever before who ran on clean energy and climate change. Now that they're in office they really want to act on them.""¶The Green New Deal has become a litmus test for Democrats vying for the party's presidential nomination in 2020. Graves said the Green New Deal ""lacks a good deal of rationale,"" echoing the sentiments of most Republicans.¶Environmental policy wasn't always so polarizing. In 1970, President Richard Nixon signed into law the landmark Clean Air Act, passed by Democratic majorities in both chambers of Congress. Twenty years later, Republican President George H. W. Bush put on the books amendments to the Clean Air Act that garnered widespread support on both sides of the aisle.¶""We would love to get back to the place where environmental protections enjoy broad bipartisan support,"" Sittenfeld said. ""We're encouraged that there are Republicans raising their hands and saying they want to be part of the solution and we certainly hope that more of their colleagues will join them.""",0

Youth-led efforts like the Sunrise Movement, the Youth Climate Strike and the lawsuit Juliana v. United States have grabbed attention. ¶At the forefront of one of the efforts is 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, an inspirational yet unlikely leader of weekly school strikes that have become perhaps the largest global protest movement.¶She has ""compelled the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker to dedicate every fourth Euro to be spent between 2021-27 to climate action,"" said Leah Qusba, deputy director of Alliance for Climate Education, a non-profit climate education organization ""That is translating youth movement building into real political action.""¶More in Climate Change¶On Friday, the youth climate strike movement will arrive on U.S. soil.

""With our futures at stake, we call for radical legislative action to combat climate change and its countless detrimental effects on the American people.""¶Villasenor's mother, Kristin Hogue, said that over just a few weeks her daughter has processed media requests at a pace more typical of rock stars and A-list celebrities -- over 200 and counting. ¶Steve Vanderheiden, a professor of Political Science and Environmental Studies at the University of Colorado at Boulder, said today's youth were born into a climate-changed world, and that it's part of their consciousness. Their clarity and authenticity are media magnets.¶""That some of these kids would get media attention for expressing this concern should not be surprising, especially given how eloquently and poignantly some of them have been able to express it,"" he said.¶Qusba of the Alliance for Climate Education said the young people her organization works with ""are inherently creative and tirelessly passionate.""¶""They show up, sit in, and rally for what they want,"" she said.¶It's that same just-do-it attitude that has propelled the Green New Deal onto the U.S. political stage. The initiative, which seeks to shift the U.S. economy to rely solely on renewable energy by 2030, is often associated with rookie lawmaker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. But its recent success is partly rooted in the work of the Sunrise Movement, a youth activist group. The Green New Deal has amassed over 100 co-sponsors in the House and Senate, including most of the Democratic presidential hopefuls.¶While Vanderheiden doubts there will be any major congressional action on climate in the next two years, he said success should be measured differently.¶""I would define social movement success as mostly in the agenda-setting and public pressure phases, and these youth movements have been effective at keeping these issues on the agenda, gaining allies among some elected officials and bringing pressure on others,"" said the University of Colorado Boulder professor. ¶The elevation of climate change in Congress has raised its exposure in the news. ¶""We saw climate coverage start trending up in some outlets after the February release of the Green New Deal resolution,"" said Lisa Hymas, who tracks media coverage of climate change as director of the climate and energy program at the not-for-profit Media Matters for America. ""Younger Americans are now changing the game by calling for dramatic action and demanding attention.""¶Attention is just what they got when Saturday Night Live parodied a recent interaction between Senator Dianne Feinstein and students. Last month, Feinstein had a heated exchange with a group of middle and high school students who asked her to support the Green New Deal. A clip of the exchange went viral.¶Senator Dianne Feinstein presents a special campaign message in this #CutForTime sketch. https://t.co/NQOK876N3t pic.twitter.com/ysQj4RVH7R¶Another example of the youth movement's momentum is the attention one legal action recently got from CBS' ""60 Minutes."" An episode that aired March 3 highlighted Juliana v. United States, a youth-led climate change lawsuit filed on behalf of 21 kids. In the words of correspondent Steve Kroft, ""Of all the cases working their way through the federal court system none is more interesting or potentially more life changing than Juliana v.

But he believes it is succeeding in winning over public opinion.¶""As the '60 Minutes' piece demonstrates, the case is extremely well framed to garner maximum attention and sympathy for the plaintiffs,"" he said.  ¶Gerrard said that if the case eventually goes to trial, it ""could be a significant embarrassment to the U.S. government - bringing media attention every day to the impacts of climate change and the role of the U.S. government in allowing or encouraging it.""",0

    ","¶As those fighting climate change look toward grand government schemes such as the Green New Deal, little Holyoke, Massachusetts, is showing how to make the kinds of on-the-ground transformations needed to win the war.¶How this city of just 40,000 went from having the last coal-powered plant in Massachusetts to laying claim to its largest solar farm might prove a valuable blueprint as more cities and states set goals for 100 percent renewable energy. It wasn't easy, and it certainly didn't happen overnight. But thanks to a lot of foresight and the recognition that the time had come to actively prepare for a future quite different from the past, Holyoke made a series of conscious decisions that are already paying off.  ¶Holyoke and the former Mt. Tom coal plant site skirt the Connecticut River in Massachusetts' Pioneer Valley, just east of the Berkshires. The first planned industrial city in the nation, Holyoke was once the world's biggest paper producer and is nicknamed ""Paper City,"" according to the Holyoke website.   ¶More in Climate Change¶For half a century, the coal plant at Mt. Tom churned out electricity for Holyoke's factories. It also emitted pollutants typical of coal plants.   ¶Historically a city of immigrants, Holyoke remains diverse. About half of its residents identify as Latino or Hispanic, and nearly 30 percent live in poverty, according to U.S. Census figures. When the coal plant was operating, asthma rates were roughly twice that of the state average, and residents had long complained about health issues.   ¶As Mt. Tom's operator, then called GDF Suez and now named ENGIE, faced legal pressure and new federal emissions regulations, employees worried about their jobs -- and Holyoke worried about lost tax revenue.   ¶By 2010, the plant's profits were shrinking as natural gas became more popular, and by then only a couple dozen employees remained. State and federal emissions rules made it even more expensive to operate.  ¶In 2014, the plant finally shut down. But Holyoke was ready for the opportunity to begin the community's transition to cleaner power. Although that effort took years to bear fruit, today Mt. Tom is home to a solar farm made up of 17,000 panels, the state's largest.   ¶ENGIE, the solar plant's operator that sends electricity to the local power grid, also runs a 3-megawatt electricity storage facility at Mt. Tom that opened last year. Storage units take electricity generated from wind and solar installations and release it to the grid when it's needed.  ¶Holyoke Gas & Electric, the utility that sells electricity to Holyoke's residents and is owned by the city, now gets roughly 90 percent of that power from carbon-free sources, including nuclear energy. More than two-thirds of it now comes from renewable sources like ENGIE's solar farm, hydro and wind, according to the HG&E 2017 annual report. Massachusetts no longer has any fully operating coal plants.  ¶Holyoke's path away from coal toward renewable sources involved several constituencies: local activists, residents, former plant employees and elected officials. A key to their success was that these groups organized early -- before the decision to shut down Mt. Tom was official. ¶  ""What's unique about this situation is that the writing was on the wall that this plant was going to close down,"" said Aaron Vega, a Massachusetts state representative who was a member of the Holyoke city council when it first seemed likely that ENGIE (then GDF Suez) was getting ready a decade ago to close the plant.¶  Mt. Tom had been operating only when demand for electricity was at its height -- the least efficient way to run. Power plant operators like ENGIE send electricity via the grid to utilities like HG&E, which in turn sell it to customers in the area they serve, in this case Holyoke. So when ENGIE rescinded its request with the city of Holyoke for paving permits at Mt. Tom, it was a tip-off that the plant's shutdown was near.¶  ""It became this really exciting opportunity where the community came together,"" Vega said.  ¶Lena Entin is a community organizer who worked with local resident group Neighbor to Neighbor. She now works with Toxics Action Center, another group that mobilized in Holyoke. On the other side of the state, a coal plant in coastal Salem was planning to close and convert to natural gas, something Entin said the Holyoke community didn't want. The group saw its opening.  ¶""What we learned from talking to activists and from Toxic Action Center's experience in these places is that we needed to have a review study -- a feasibility study done on-site before the company even announced it was closing,"" Entin said. ""We didn't want [the plant] to close and stay on-line to possibly open later.  Our thinking was, 'Who knows if the economy is going to turn around.' We didn't know that. We didn't want some opportunity to come up or risk that the new administration would come in and welcome coal.""  ¶The Sierra Club's anti-coal campaign, called ""Beyond Coal,"" also got involved, offering expertise gleaned from other campaigns. Union members pushed for meetings with plant officials to secure older workers a ""bridge"" to retirement benefits, better severance and potential training for new jobs or transfers within the company. City officials also pushed for a meeting at the plant. Pressure grew. ¶  ENGIE eventually offered retirement-age employees a ""bridge"" plan to collect pensions, said Clarence Kay, who worked at the plant for 32 years in maintenance. Kay started building his own business part-time while still working at Mt. Tom. He now runs his own company, Pioneer Valley Fiberglass Pools & Spas, full-time. It's expanding. ¶  ""That was a really big thing,"" said Kay, who helped negotiate the settlements. ""Generally speaking, the company did a pretty good job giving most of us what we needed during such a tough transition.""¶  A global company, ENGIE was already pulling back from coal plants worldwide and stopped operating them in the U.S. altogether in 2015, according to the company's annual report for that year. So while the Trump administration favors coal and has made its revival an energy priority, Holyoke was a step ahead of the change in federal-level policy.¶  ""Holyoke, we think, is an excellent example working well with the mayor and other public officials, with environmentalists and with our customer, Holyoke Gas & Electric, to transform a coal operation that had been in place since 1960 to something much more clean and modern,"" ENGIE spokeswoman Julie Vitek told CBS MoneyWatch.   ¶Holyoke Mayor Alex Morse said securing $100,000 from the state for a reuse study for the 128-acre Mt. Tom site was key to closing the plant in a ""responsible way."" For Morse, that included crucial approvals from residents, employees, activists, and city and plant officials to make sure planning was well underway when the plant shut down.¶  ""As mayor, you have to think holistically about what impact closing the coal plant would have in terms of tax revenues, loss of jobs,"" Morse said. He has separately pursued new ways to bring in revenue for Holyoke, including embracing Massachusetts' newly legal cannabis industry.¶At the time of its closure, Mt. Tom was providing Holyoke with $315,000 in annual taxes, according to the reuse study. That report allowed for all the interested groups to ""come up with a set of principles that most folks in the community"" could support, Morse said. Having a city-owned electric utility also helped because profit is a lower priority than serving the community, Morse said.  ¶State and federal support is critical because an individual city like Holyoke is just ""one small piece"" of the puzzle when it comes to climate change, said Morse, a Holyoke native first elected mayor at age 22 and now in his fourth term. The electricity storage facility was paid for in part through a state grant that will also be used to schedule, measure and analyze how well it's is working, according to Holyoke Gas & Electric. ¶  ""Without the rest of the planet -- our region, or state and our country -- our efforts are being done in vain,"" Morse said when asked if Holyoke serves as a model for communities looking to plug into the Green New Deal. ""We need this on a seriously bigger scale,"" he said. ""Because we can't just protect Holyoke from climate change disasters on our own. It's so much bigger than just our city.""   ",0
Unusual winter rains driving sea level rise in the Arctic,"

    ","¶Warmer air is turning what should be snowfall in the Arctic to rainfall, which could accelerate sea level rise beyond current predictions. Researchers are warning that rainy weather is becoming increasingly common over parts of the Greenland ice sheet, triggering sudden melting events that are eating away at the ice and priming the surface for more widespread melting in the future. ¶A study published Thursday in the scientific journal Cryosphere says some parts of the ice sheet are even receiving rain in the winter -- a new phenomenon that will spread as the Earth's climate continues to warm.  ¶Greenland has been losing ice in recent decades due to progressive warming. Since about 1990, average temperatures over the ice sheet have increased by as much as 3.2 degrees in the summer, and up to 5.4 degrees over the winter. The 660,000-square-mile sheet is now believed to be losing about 270 billion tons of ice each year. ¶More in Climate Change¶Most of the ice loss was, until recently, thought to come from icebergs calving, or breaking off into the ocean. But direct meltwater runoff has now come to dominate, accounting for about 70 percent of the loss, the study published in Cryosphere says. Rainy weather, the study's authors say, is increasingly the trigger for that runoff.¶The researchers combined satellite imagery with on-the-ground weather observations from 1979 to 2012 in order to pinpoint what was triggering melting in specific places. Satellites are used to map melting in real time because their imagery can distinguish snow from liquid water. The scientists also used a camera-equipped drone to map the area.  ¶For the study, 20 automated weather stations spread across the ice sheet offered data on temperature, wind and precipitation. Combining the data sets, the researchers zeroed in on more than 300 events in which they found the initial trigger for melting was rainy weather.¶""That was a surprise to see,"" said the study's lead author, Marilena Oltmanns, of Germany's GEOMAR Centre for Ocean Research. She said that over the study period, melting associated with rain doubled during summer and tripled in the winter. ¶Total precipitation over the ice sheet did not change; what did change was the form of precipitation. All told, the researchers estimate that nearly a third of total runoff they observed was initiated by rainfall.¶Melting can be driven by a number of factors, but the introduction of liquid water is one of the most powerful, said Mark Tedesco, a glaciologist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and co-author of the study.¶Warm air, of course, can melt ice directly, but is not very efficient by itself, he said. But warmer temperatures produce cascading effects, one being the likelihood of rain falling when snow typically should. ¶Liquid water carries a great deal of heat, and when it soaks into a snowy surface, it melts the snow around it, releasing more energy. Meanwhile, the warmer air that brought the rain often forms clouds, which hold the heat closer to the Earth's surface.¶Between 1993 and 2014, global sea-level rise accelerated from about 2.2 millimeters (0.19 inches) per year to 3.3 millimeters (0.13 inches), and much of that acceleration is thought to be due to melting of the Greenland ice sheet. Projections of sea-level rise for the end of this century generally range from two to four feet, but most of those projections don't account for the myriad conditions impacting the ice in Greenland, or the fate of the much larger ice mass in Antarctica. ¶CBS News correspondent Mark Phillips joined NASA scientists last fall as they conducted ""Operation Icebridge,"" a surveillance mission to study the Antarctic ice sheet.¶""The Antarctic ice sheet is discharging more than two Olympic sized swimming pools worth of ice, into the ocean, every second,"" the mission's alarmed chief scientist Joe MacGregor told Phillips.",0
What we know about tornadoes and climate change,"

    ","¶The deadliest tornado to hit the U.S. in six years touched down in Alabama Sunday with winds of 170 mph and a path of 27 miles. It killed 23 people and was part of an early severe weather outbreak with 50 preliminary reports of tornadoes. At least 17 have been confirmed.¶But while some were quick to point to climate change as a cause of the tornado outbreak, current science isn't definitive about how much climate change influences tornadoes.  ¶On Monday, Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders posted a warning about climate change and tornadoes on Facebook. ""The science is clear, climate change is making extreme weather events, including tornadoes, worse,"" he wrote.¶More in Climate Change¶Sanders is correct to say climate change makes extreme weather worse, though how much that applies to tornadoes is unclear.¶But climate change seems to be shifting the concentration and range of tornadoes, pushing them into more vulnerable areas. In addition, evidence suggests there will be a more favorable environment for severe weather — and probably tornadoes — in a warmer future.¶Finding trends in tornado numbers or even intensity is complicated. That's because the U.S. tornado record is rather short (since the 1950s) and prone to many uncertainties since it is compiled through eyewitness reports.¶It's logical to assume that with more people living in remote areas now, you would see an uptick in the number of tornadoes since more are being observed. However, a trend isn't discernable — the graph appears flat.¶To the naked eye, it appears there is a trend toward less violent tornadoes. But past inconsistencies in determining the strength of tornadoes make the record hard to trust. For instance, there is evidence that tornadoes may have been rated as more powerful than they actually were before the adoption of the Fujita scale in the late 1970s.¶The bottom line is that, so far, there is likely no significant trend in the overall number or intensity of tornadoes. But that doesn't tell the whole story.¶Strong tornadoes are formed from a combination of warm, moist, rising air and strong ""wind shear."" Wind shear is a change in wind speed and/or direction with height — that helps provide spin to the supercell thunderstorms that aid in tornado formation.¶Tornadoes form when certain ingredients are in place including high instability and vertical wind shear meaning winds are changing with height. This slide goes into some of the science of tornado formation and covers some safety tips as well. #SpringSafety #houwx #bcswx pic.twitter.com/MGRKquOIKm¶In this warming world, global climate models clearly show warmth and moisture will increase. But climate models also suggest a general decrease in wind shear in the future. So which will win out: the increase in warm-moist air or the modest decrease in shear?¶Armed with a global climate model ensemble, a team of researchers at Stanford and Purdue Universities in 2013 found there will be ""robust increases in the occurrence of severe thunderstorm environments over the eastern United States"" in response to global warming.¶That result shouldn't be surprising given that more warm, moist, unstable air means more energy for thunderstorms.¶But the team also found something unexpected. The computer models showed that a warmer climate would produce an increase in low-level wind shear on days when the air is more unstable. The team said that suggested ""an increasing likelihood of atmospheric conditions that contribute to the most severe events, including tornadoes.""¶It's worth noting that in their study, wind shear does decrease, but the drop is concentrated in more stable, less stormy days. So the general decrease in wind shear has no impact on tornadoes.¶A more recent study published in 2016 titled ""More tornadoes in the most extreme U.S. tornado outbreaks"" hints that some of the conclusions of the 2013 study may be happening now.¶CBS News sat down with the lead author of the 2016 study, Columbia University Professor Michael K. Tippett. He explained, ""Extreme meteorological environments associated with severe thunderstorms show consistent upward trends.""¶Tippett analyzed the tornado record back to the 1950s and found that ""the frequency of U.S. outbreaks with many tornadoes is increasing, and it is increasing faster for more extreme outbreaks.""¶But Tippett said it is unclear if the increase in tornadoes per outbreak is being caused by climate change. Tippett said that although the trend is being driven by consistent changes in the environment, the changes aren't necessarily the kind that would be expected from climate change.¶Specifically, the study found that during big tornado outbreak days, unstable air isn't increasing as climate change would imply. Instead, it's wind shear that's increasing. ¶Tippett put it this way: ""Either we don't understand all the impacts of climate change or it's not climate change.""¶But he cautioned that, in the future, ""It's clear there will be some impact from climate change such as more frequent conditions that are favorable for supercell thunderstorms and an expansion of favored areas northward.""¶In what is likely the most impactful of all the tornado trends, a fall 2018 study concluded ""Tornado Alley"" is spreading eastward from the Plains States toward the more vulnerable, more densely populated Southeast. The study found that may lead to a threefold increase in disaster potential, partly because the Southeast has more trees and a larger number of weak-framed homes where residents would be at risk. The shift is happening as drier, more stable air from the desert Southwest shoves thunderstorm formation eastward.¶Tornado Alley moving east over the past couple decades? New study says tornado frequency decreasing on the Plains and increasing in the east. https://t.co/uE1ldwYJqu pic.twitter.com/kfR8z4LN2d¶Lead author Victor Gensini told CBS News, ""It's not a big jump to say that climate change is causing this shift east. The hypothesis and computer simulations support what we are observing and what we expect in the future.""",0

            Katharine Hayhoe: To fight climate change, ""Talk about it"" - CBS News
    ",CBS News,"February 27, 2019, 1:52 PM","¶In our Ideas That Matter series, in partnership with TED, we're highlighting individuals and ideas shaping our world. ¶Climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe said the first step to fighting climate change is: ""Talk about it."" ¶""The majority of the people in the country don't talk about it. And if we don't talk about it, why would we care,"" Hayhoe said Wednesday on ""CBS This Morning."" ¶And the second? ""Step on a carbon footprint scale,"" Hayhoe said.¶""If you're going to lose weight, the first thing you do is step on the scale. If we're going to lose carbon, measure our carbon footprints online. There's lots of great resources to do that. And figure out what we can do personally that makes the biggest difference.""¶Examples of ways you could reduce your carbon footprint include eating less meat, line-drying clothing, using energy-efficient light bulbs, and reducing food waste. ¶The latest government climate assessment, co-authored by Hayhoe, warns that by 2050, heavier rainfall in the Midwest could prompt increased flooding along major waterways like the Mississippi River. It also says by 2071, temperatures in the Southwest could climb more than 8 degrees, leading to longer droughts. Additionally, at the end of the century, sea levels could rise by as much as six feet in some places, endangering more than 130 million people who live in coastal areas.¶""So often we think that we have to be an environmentalist or liberal to care about a changing climate. But the reason why we care is because it already affects each of us in the places where we live. We only have to be a human living on planet Earth to care,"" Hayhoe said.¶The reason why climate change has gotten political is due to the solutions, she explained. ¶""Many of us have been told that the only solutions to climate change are to destroy the economy and let the government set our thermostat. In reality, the solutions are very different. They involve getting our energy from clean sources that don't pollute our air and our water, that grow the local economy, and that help the U.S. lead in the coming century,"" Hayhoe said.¶While President Trump pulled out of the Paris climate accord in 2017, Hayhoe said ""cities, states, businesses, colleges, tribes that represent over 40 percent of U.S. emissions are still in the Paris Agreement.""¶""So there still is enormous forward action. DFW Airport is the first carbon-neutral airport in the country. The city of Dallas gets its energy already from clean sources, as do other towns in Texas, like Georgetown. All around the country, we are seeing changes already happening. But we do need changes at the federal level, as well, to keep up with what's happening in cities and states,"" she said.¶Hayhoe, a Christian, said her faith is the reason she is a climate scientist. While taking a course on climate science during her undergraduate studies, she was ""blown away"" that climate change went beyond the environment. ¶""It's a humanitarian issue. It disproportionately affects the poorest and most vulnerable people here in the U.S. as well as around the world,"" Hayhoe said. ""So I thought to myself, how can I — who believes that we are to love others as we've been loved ourselves by God — how can I not do everything I can to give people who do not have a voice the voice they need to help us fix this problem.""¶Watch Katharine Hayhoe's TED Talk here.

    ","¶Climate change is now officially sending animals to extinction. ¶The Bramble Cay melomys, a rodent found on a tiny island off Australia's far north coast and the only mammal native to the Great Barrier Reef, was added this week to a list of animals declared extinct by the Australian government. According to scientists, the mammal extinction is the first of its kind to be caused by human-induced climate change.¶Australia's Minister for the Environment Melissa Price quietly declared the extinction in a note on threatened species released by her office on Monday and reported in the Sydney Morning Herald. It was included in a listing of species at the bottom of the note, with the Department of the Environment and Energy recommending it for ""transfer from the Endangered Category to the Extinct Category.""¶More in Climate Change¶In a statement to CNET, Price said the findings were ""incredibly disappointing"" but there was ""no reasonable doubt"" about the extinction of the species. ¶""It has been known among scientific and environmental communities for some time that the melomys was likely extinct,"" Price said. ""Being confined to a single, very small and isolated location, the Bramble Cay melomys was particularly susceptible to a wide range of threats. Available evidence indicates that frequent and intense weather events during the decade 2004 to 2014 produced damaging storm surges and extreme high water levels, which were likely significant contributors.""¶Scientists have been warning about the fate of the mammal for years, with the last known sighting recorded in 2009 and a 2014 survey finding no remaining trace of the species. In a 2016 research paper on that survey, scientists said ""climate change-induced sea-level rise"" was one of the factors behind the extinction, concluding the rodent was ""the first mammal to go extinct due to human-induced climate change.""¶While the Bramble Cay melomys might not be the most distinctive creature, the extinction is significant and occurs in an area already feeling the devastating effects of climate change. ¶The waters off Australia's northern coast and across the Pacific are warming and rising, leading to unprecedented coral bleaching events across the Great Barrier Reef and even forcing Pacific Island nations to prepare contingency plans for climate migration as people are displaced by rising waters. ¶This article originally appeared on CNET, titled, ""Climate change officially kills off its first mammal species""",0
Solar jobs are on the decline — the industry blames Trump,"

    ","¶The solar industry was held up as a job-creation engine just a few years ago, when the fastest-growing job in America was that of the solar-panel installer. Solar sector employment quickly became key to the U.S. energy industry. Nationwide, about as many people work in solar companies as in natural gas, while coal mining employs less than half that amount, according to the Energy Futures Initiative.¶But that hiring spree has cooled notably. Since 2016, the industry has shrunk for two years in a row, losing about 18,000 jobs, according to a yearly report from the Solar Foundation. Solar employment last year was 242,300, nearly 8,000 lower than in 2017 and down from a peak of 260,000 than in 2016.¶One reason for the reversal: The Trump administration imposed tariffs on Chinese-imported solar photovoltaic units in January of 2018, which had the effect of delaying or canceling about $8 billion worth of utility-scale projects.¶More in Climate Change¶""We have the trade policies and the tariffs that have been imposed on our industry, and they've had a detrimental impact on our ability to finalize projects and hire workers,"" Abigail Ross Hopper, president of the Solar Energy Industries Association, told reporters this week.¶Large solar farms can take as long as 18 months to develop  and, because of their size, they can be sensitive to shifts in component costs.¶""There was a lot of uncertainty prior to the tariffs being announced in January 2018, and that uncertainty caused the larger projects to be delayed,"" Ed Gilliland, senior director at the Solar Foundation, told CBS MoneyWatch. ""Once they found out what the tariffs were, it maybe wasn't as bad as we thought it would be.""¶A few months later, the Chinese government cut subsidies for solar production, which had the effect of dropping prices for solar modules. ""And so now, despite the tariffs, the prices are now lower than they were last year,"" Gilliland added.¶The U.S. imports about 90 percent of solar modules installed here, but less than one-tenth of them come from China. ¶Solar installers make up a large majority of the jobs in the industry, so a slowdown in the pace of solar installations can result in job losses, as happened in California, the country's largest solar producer. Solar jobs in the state dropped by more than 9,000, to about 76,000 jobs.¶""Solar jobs are like construction-type activity — they're dependent on new solar being installed,"" said Andrea Luecke, executive director of the Solar Foundation. ""So when California slows down the rate of installation, there will be fewer jobs.""¶But 29 other states bulked up their solar workforce. Florida added 1,700 jobs after the state permitted solar leasing last summer. These programs allow residents to rent a solar system, avoiding the upfront costs of installing panels on their home. ¶Illinois, which is on course to introduce a 100 percent renewable energy target this month, added 1,300 jobs. Alabama, Arkansas, Kansas, Wyoming and Montana saw solar job growth over 20 percent. ¶The different effects highlight the importance of state-level policies, said Luecke, who expects jobs to rebound slightly in 2019. ""There's a huge backlog of projects right now that are in the queue, under development or in the planning phase,"" she said. ""Really it's an unprecedented amount of generation that's in the pipeline.""",0

Russia's northeastern Novaya Zemlya archipelago, which has a population of around 3,000 people, has appealed for help to tackle ""a mass invasion of polar bears into inhabited areas,"" regional authorities said in a statement.¶Russian authorities have so far refused permission to shoot the bears but are sending a commission to investigate the situation and have not ruled out a cull.¶Polar bears are affected by global warming with melting Arctic ice forcing them to spend more time on land where they compete for food. Scientists have long warned that the shrinking sea ice in the Arctic poses a direct threat to the bears, and increases the likelihood of encounters with humans.¶Polar bears are recognized as an endangered species in Russia and hunting them is banned.¶Russia has air force and air defence troops based on Novaya Zemlya.¶More in Climate Change¶Since December, 52 polar bears have regularly visited the archipelago's main settlement, Belushya Guba, with some displaying ""aggressive behavior,"" local official Alexander Minayev said in a report to regional authorities.¶This included ""attacks on people and entering residential homes and public buildings,"" said Minayev, the deputy chief of the local administration.¶""There are constantly 6 to 10 bears inside the settlement,"" he said.¶""People are scared, they are afraid to leave their homes... parents are frightened to let their children go to schools and kindergartens.""¶The head of the local administration Zhigansha Musin said that the numbers of polar bears were unprecedented.¶""I've been on Novaya Zemlya since 1983 and there's never been such a mass invasion of polar bears,"" he told regional officials.¶Some residents of Belushya Guba took to social media to show their own video and photos of the bears, and express their shock.¶Bears are constantly inside a military garrison and ""literally chase people"" he said as well as going into the entrances of apartment buildings.¶Local officials complained that measures to scare off polar bears such as vehicle and dog patrols have not been effective as polar bears feel secure and no longer react.¶The federal environmental resources agency has refused to issue licences to shoot the most aggressive bears.¶A working group of regional and federal officials is set to visit the archipelago to assess the situation and the measures taken so far.¶The Arkhangelsk regional authorities, which oversee Novaya Zemlya, said that if all else failed ""shooting the animals could be the only possible forced measure.""¶In January, a defence ministry official said that hundreds of disused military buildings had been demolished on Novaya Zemlya because polar bears were settling inside them.",0

    ","¶As record sub-zero temperatures grip the Midwest in the wake of extreme  coastal flooding and fire, new research from the Brookings Institution this week suggests areas where Americans are the most skeptical about climate change will be the hardest hit by its effects in the latter part of this century.¶Researchers looked at factors from mortality rates, farm yields and fires to heat-related risks for outdoor workers and coastal damage from rising seas. They used data on projected long-term harm and benefits compiled by the Climate Impact Lab research consortium, which monitors global costs.¶Then they layered recent voting patterns by Americans on top of the data. The upshot? Regions with the largest groups of climate skeptics - typically Republican strongholds like Florida and Texas - turned out to be the most vulnerable when it comes to climate change forecasts for the rest of the century.¶More in Climate Change¶Counties that voted for President Donald Trump in 2016, for instance, will on average face a 4.8 percent loss in gross domestic product by 2099, the researchers estimate. That compares to the smaller 3.3 loss for counties that Hillary Clinton won, mostly in the north, the paper forecast. ¶An even wider disparity appears when the researchers looked at income. Americans who live in regions that address climate change through policy, mostly in the northern part of the U.S, might actually see a gain while those who don't may lose income from its impact.¶Areas like the Pacific Northwest, parts of the West, upper Midwest and New England might see fewer GDP declines from climate change ""even as it creates stark losses in the Southwest, Southeast and Florida,"" according to the report. ¶Most surprising ""was the sharp unevenness of the harm effects, which then brings varied political factors into play,"" Mark Muro, co-author and senior fellow at Brookings, told CBS MoneyWatch. The resulting map across areas of the U.S. ""depicts extreme variation, South to North, coast to interior, wet sunbelt vs dry."" ¶Higher mortality rates¶One startling metric: mortality rates. More deaths occur in swaths of the country, including the dry Southwest and wet areas, ""as coastal storms and sea-level issues batter the Southeast, Florida and the Gulf Coast,"" according to the research. ¶It's not clear that if Americans who live in areas most hit by climate change will die sooner, ""but in statistical terms, more deaths do occur in such counties,"" Muro said.¶Believers may benefit¶Another surprising find: a pairing of climate change forecasts and income metrics county-by-county showed those areas where people support policies to stem the effects of climate change might actually benefit from the phenomenon in the years 2080 to 2099.¶Such benefits could include rising crop yields and income gains in counties that favor robust climate change policy, the research found.¶""Some of the areas least convinced that climate change exists will be hit the hardest by its impacts. Likewise, the places that have the most to gain from climate mitigation strategies are the most resistant to such policies,"" Muro said. ""For some this will seem really perverse—and its definitely unfortunate: for struggling parts of the nation, and the world.""¶That might eventually change attitudes ""as people are confronted with climate reality,"" the researchers argue. It even might make climate change politics ""less polarizing.""",0

    ","¶Last year, California set the most ambitious energy goal in the nation: reaching 100 percent renewable energy in just over 25 years. This year, as many as 13 other states are rearing to join it.¶While the federal government seeks to roll back climate-change regulation, state politicians -- many, though not all, Democrats with newfound majorities -- are signaling they won't wait for the feds to reverse course again.¶""Despite the fact that this isn't going to happen on the federal level, there are places around the country, in a lot of the most populated states, where people want this,"" said Mark Morgenstein, a spokesman for Environment America. ¶More in Climate Change¶Environment America has launched a campaign calling out nine states to become 100 percent renewable by 2050. Several other states are already on their way toward reaching that goal. Together, they represent 42 percent of the U.S. population and more than a quarter of its economic output. ¶The push for state legislation comes as renewable energy is growing overall, spurred by consumer demand and favorable economics. By 2050, if no new laws are passed, 31 percent of U.S. electricity will come from renewable sources, according to the Energy Information Administration. ¶Here are the states that are set to go even further.¶Massachusetts, by many measures the bluest state in the U.S., started work last year on the country's first commercial-scale offshore wind farm and plans to double its wind generation in the next two years. Lawmakers in both houses of the legislature have introduced bills to make the state's power 100 percent renewable by 2045.¶New Jersey has taken a series of aggressive climate steps since the 2017 election of Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy. The state adopted a goal last year of 50 percent renewable electricity and is in the process of creating an Energy Master Plan, which environmentalists hope will push renewables further. ¶Washington came close to becoming the first state to tax carbon last year. A bill introduced this year aims to eliminate coal within six years, require 80 percent clean utilities five years after that and make all electricity carbon-free. ¶Washington has a leg up as the nation's top producer of hydroelectric power, which accounts for two-thirds of all electricity generated in the state. Last year's wildfires across the Northwest also mean the state is deeply familiar with the effects of climate change. ¶Pennsylvania is the fourth-largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the country (after Texas, California and Florida). The state's economy, until a few decades ago, relied largely on coal. In recent years, it has become a lead generator of natural gas, a coal replacement that still creates carbon emissions, but on a smaller scale. ¶That's why its recent about-face on clean energy is notable. Last year, a Republican legislator led a bill to put the state on a path to 100 percent renewable energy by 2050. Another Republican is set to introduce it sometime this month, according to PennEnvironment, a state environmental group. The group is hopeful this will be the year it passes.¶""We're not California. We're not Hawaii,"" said David Masur, executive director of PennEnvironment. ""When you have a purple state that Trump won, where the general assembly is dominated by conservative Republicans, it's significant and shows that other states with a history of fossil fuel production can lead the way.""¶Illinois' statehouse is far bluer than Pennsylvania's, but the state is just as dependent on coal. The country's sixth most populated state, it still gets nearly two-thirds of its energy from fossil fuels.¶But the new Democratic governor, J.B. Pritzker, has signaled a change in direction. Last week he signed on to the U.S. Climate Alliance, a pact that commits the 18 states in it to the goals of the Paris climate agreement, which the U.S. exited in 2017. Pritzker also campaigned on a goal of 100 percent clean energy.¶All four of these states have newly elected Democratic ""trifectas,"" in which the party controls both chambers of the state legislature and the governor's mansion -- and they're pushing for an energy overhaul.¶In Colorado, Gov. Jared Polis has set the most ambitious target of any state -- going to 100 percent renewable energy by 2040, a full five years earlier than California and Hawaii. A recent study found that consumers would save $250 million if the state achieves that goal. Colorado's largest utilty, Xcel Energy, last month promised to go carbon-free by 2050, a move it a said was ""motivated by customers who are asking for it.""¶""Consumers look to their utilities to be good citizens, and that  includes protection of the climate,"" said Andrew Heath, senior director  of the utilities practice at J.D. Power. When utilities announce they're  shifting to renewable energy -- whether it's a response to law or on their  own initiative -- it's met favorably, he added.¶Maine is already the top wind-power producer in New England, and new Gov. Janet Mills offers the strongest contrast with her Republican predecessor. Former Gov. Paul LePage routinely drew criticism for his anti-environment moves, including quashing bipartisan pro-solar legislation and putting a moratorium on new wind turbine development. ¶On her inauguration, Mills set a goal to have 80 percent of the state's electricity come from renewable energy sources. Another Maine legislator is already leading the push for a ""Green New Deal"" in Maine, which would make the state's energy entirely renewable by 2030. ¶New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has called for 100 percent clean energy by 2040, a plan that would require boosting the state's solar, wind, hydroelectric and nuclear resources. The state legislature, which is Democrat-controlled for the first time in 10 years, must approve his plan by April 1.¶And New Mexico is eyeing a goal of 80 percent renewable electricity by 2040, which Environment America calls ""a first step"" to being 100 percent renewable.¶Both these states have Republican-controlled legislatures and Democratic governors, and they have a higher-than-average reliance on coal (getting 36 percent and 41 percent of all electricity from it, respectively). Minnesota environmental groups, in addition to pushing for 100-percent renewability by 2030, are seeking a moratorium on new pipelines in the state. Those in Michigan have set 2050 as the target date. ¶Both states have a higher-than-average reliance on nuclear power (as do others on this list, like Pennsylvania and Illinois), which is excluded from the planned legislation -- and that could be a problem when it comes to emissions. ¶Nuclear power has divided environmentalists because, while it emits no carbon, it isn't renewable and has the potential to cause massive devastation. Many clean-energy groups favor phasing out nuclear, but doing so makes it harder to reduce emissions. ¶""What we're starting to see is [renewable-energy requirements] are increasing market pressure on nuclear power plants, and the emissions increase from the loss of those plants offsets the gain in renewable energy,"" said Whitney Herndon, a senior analyst at Rhodium.¶She added: ""In order to get the emissions benefit, you really want an increase in renewables, plus keeping the existing nuclear power there.""",0

    ","¶Researchers say a massive cavity the size of two-thirds of Manhattan was found under a glacier in Antarctica. The pocket is a sign of ""rapid decay"" and just one of ""several disturbing discoveries"" made recently regarding the glacier, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said in a news release Wednesday.¶""[The size of] a cavity under a glacier plays an important role in melting,"" said Pietro Milillo of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ""As more heat and water get under the glacier, it melts faster.""¶The growing cavity sits in West Antarctica at the bottom of Thwaites Glacier, which is about as big as Florida and contains enough ice to contribute more than 2 feet to sea level rise, NASA said. It is growing at an ""explosive"" rate that surprised researchers conducting a study the agency led on the glacier.  ¶More in Climate Change¶""The findings highlight the need for detailed observations of Antarctic glaciers' undersides in calculating how fast global sea levels will rise in response to climate change,"" NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said.¶CBS News climate and weather contributor Jeff Berardelli reports that the cavity is likely a significant finding because the West Antarctic ice sheet is considered one of the most unstable and vulnerable. It seems to not only be melting on the ocean edges, but also from underneath, and warmer ocean waters are infiltrating.¶NASA said the hole is large enough to have held 14 billion tons of ice -- the majority of which has melted during the last three years. Scientists say the glacier is responsible for about four percent of global sea level rise.",0
"Extinction of lemurs would have huge implications for humans, scientists say","

    ","¶An animal that could hold the key to life-threatening human diseases is on the verge of extinction, researchers say. Nearly all of the world's lemurs reside in Madagascar, an island nation off the southeast coast of Africa. ¶We hiked up steep hills for six hours to find them hidden deep in the Ranomafana National Park. There are over 100 different species, including ring-tailed lemurs, which are playful and smart. We spot a rare Sifaka lemur — one of only about 2,000 left in the world. ¶Lemurs share many of the same genes as humans. They're not as close as chimpanzees but they're still family. The mouse lemur, for example, is our smallest cousin.¶More in Climate Change¶""They get some of the same diseases that we get. They can come down with Alzheimer's, diabetes, they can develop obesity,"" said anthropologist Dr. Patricia Wright of Stony Brook University in New York. ¶""A lot of the experiments on human health are done on the mouse and the mouse is not related to us and it only lives two years so you couldn't possibly study some of the long-term kind of diseases,"" said Wright, who has studied lemurs for more than 30 years. ¶Wright has turned this rainforest to a laboratory in the wild. Her team has embedded computer chips in hundreds of lemurs so she can monitor the development of Alzheimer's for an average of 20 years. She's built a genetic data bank from her research and her hope is that it will lead to new drugs one day. ¶It's now a race against time. Lemurs cannot survive without forests and 95 percent of the lemurs' natural habitat outside this park is gone, the land burned and cleared for crops.¶""It's like burning a library,"" Wright told CBS News foreign correspondent  Debora Patta in a report for ""Down to Earth"" by CBS News on Facebook Watch. ""It's a real shame, but hopefully we'll be able to save these little guys and we'll be unlock their secrets.""¶One day we went along with Wright's researchers. They baited traps and tied them to branches to lure the tiny lemur inside. When we returned to check them that night, the noise of the rain forest surrounded us, throbbing and pulsing in the dark. They had trapped six lemurs out of 70 traps laid.¶Back at the camp, researchers work under a red light to mimic the night-time conditions mouse lemurs like best and to prevent damage to their eyes. Testing the lemurs' strength — think of a Fitbit for lemurs — was also a test of patience. ¶Each one is weighed and measured. Researchers are looking for early signs of disease or weight loss. Once the tests are over, they are released unharmed back into the wild. ¶Now the lemurs are facing a new threat. Madagascar has been hard hit by extreme weather. In recent years, the island has been battered by unusually strong cyclones, severe drought and then torrential rain. ¶""It's a much more turbulent time. The rainy season doesn't come at the right time. The dry season is more extended,"" Wright said. ""Everything is out of balance.""¶The fruit trees, the lemurs' main food source, did not flower this year.¶""This never happened before. For the lemurs, its devastating because it means they can't get fat enough to produce offspring,"" Wright explained. ""They probably won't starve but they certainly are going to go hungry.""¶The number of baby lemurs that survive beyond six months has dropped to 47 percent from 70 percent in just three years. ¶Wright told us she was shocked by other changes she saw on this trip, too.¶""This use to be a lake and now its all dried up and its been a lake that's been shrinking every year. This time, there's no water at all. There use to be crocodiles here last year,"" she said. ""It's shocking.""¶Wright is fearful the devastating changes occurring on the island could mean the end of her lemurs. She's frustrated by how slow some are recognize the danger.  ¶""Madagascar itself is like a canary in the coal mine. This island is very vulnerable and so climate change makes a bigger impact here,"" said Wright. ""It's a warning signal to the world.""   ¶Years before Trump proposed his border wall, Europe and Africa were separated by a fortified fence – one which thousands of desperate migrants try to scale every year.¶Once victims of domestic abuse, these single mothers from Zimbabwe have gone through special forces training and come out sharp shooters. Now, they're protecting animals from poachers. https://cbsn.ws/2RbGCUd",0

    ","¶Americans are growing more convinced than ever that climate change is having an impact on our world, and the issue is becoming a more important part of their lives. That is the conclusion of a new report by the Yale Program on Climate Communication and George Mason University Center for Climate Change Communication, based on a survey of Americans nationwide.¶About 72 percent of Americans now say that climate change is important to them, an increase of 9 percentage points since last March, and a 16-point increase since March 2015.¶In addition, the number of Americans convinced that climate change is mostly caused by humans has spiked to 62 percent, a jump of 8 points in just one year. ¶More in Climate Change¶""My bet is that we've entered a new era of public concern about climate change"" says Dr. Ed Maibach, director of the George Mason University Center for Climate Change Communication. ¶An October 2018 CBS News poll found a similar result, with 61 percent of Americans saying global warming is human-caused, up 7 percent from April 2018. Four years earlier, an AP-GFK poll found only 33 percent were extremely or very confident that was true.¶Professor Michael B. Gerrard, the director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, is cautiously encouraged. ""Sometimes public opinion shifts quickly, as it did with smoking and same-sex marriage,"" he said.¶Maibach feels that may be happening now with climate change. ""We appear to have reached an inflection point in that half of Americans now see climate change as happening here, now, to us — and they feel that they and/or members of their family will be harmed by it.""  ¶Climate change has often been thought of as a distant problem whose impact might appear decades or centuries in the future. But recent studies show that extreme weather over the past few years has been supercharged by climate change. People are connecting the dots through their real-life experience. ¶""More Americans are now personally experiencing concrete, harmful impacts from climate change with their own eyes. People are more convinced when they learn experientially than when they learn analytically,"" says Maibach.¶The numbers in the Yale-George Mason study support that. About half of Americans surveyed believe this past year's extreme events, such as Hurricanes Florence and Michael and the California wildfires, were made worse by climate change. ¶Furthermore, nearly half of Americans (46 percent) now say they have personally experienced the effects of global warming, an increase of 15 percentage points since March 2015.¶But opinions vary widely based on political affiliation. The CBS News poll found 85 percent of Democrats and 60 percent of independents agree climate change is caused by human activity. While most Republicans acknowledge climate change is happening, only 34 percent of them agree humans are responsible.¶Another large gap in perception emerges when people are asked about the scientific consensus on this issue. According to the Yale-George Mason study, only 1 in 5 Americans realize there is overwhelming scientific agreement that climate change is caused by humans. This is called the Consensus Gap.¶Various studies have indeed shown that approximately 97 percent of climate scientists are convinced climate change is caused mainly by humans.¶""If the public understood that virtually all climate scientists were convinced that human-caused climate change was happening, and that it was serious, then the public would demand action,"" Maibach explains.¶Scientists warn that fast and bold action is needed to avoid what some have called an ""unprecedented climate future."" But so far congressional action on climate change has been slow, and President Trump has cast doubt on whether any action is necessary.¶Maibach believes the public's increasing concern about climate change will make a difference, especially when politicians are convinced that ""their voters will hold them accountable for taking action or not taking action."" ¶Gerrard feels that we may be reaching a threshold. ""The cascade of alarming scientific studies, the unprecedented wildfires, hurricanes and floods, and the activation of young voters who see their futures at risk may be giving action on climate change an unstoppable momentum.""",0
"In New England, home prices fall as seas rise","

    ","¶A rising tide may lift all boats, but that doesn't apply to coastal real estate. Higher sea levels have slashed the home values of four New England states by more than $400 million over a dozen years, according to research from the Brooklyn-based nonprofit First Street Foundation.¶Massachusetts' property owners have suffered the biggest losses, with rising sea levels responsible for lowering the total value Bay State homes by more than $273 million. Maine is next, with nearly $70 million in losses, followed by Rhode Island at roughly $45 million. Losses in New Hampshire, which has the shortest coastline in New England, topped $15 million.¶One extreme example includes a house in Boston currently valued at $373,725 that would have been worth almost $800,000 if not for the higher sea level.¶More in Climate Change¶Homeowners can find the information on a website called FloodIQ, which gives access to public data crunched in a way only previously undertaken by private companies such as insurers and Wall Street firms, which use the data to evaluate investments and risk. Coastal homes may face greater dangers from flooding and storms than inland properties, damping their market value and crimping a region's tax base.¶The project seeks to ""level the playing field"" for homeowners and municipalities, said Matthew Eby, First Street Foundation's executive director, in an interview with CBS MoneyWatch.¶Now, ""individual homeowners can understand the impact of sea level rise and flooding to their property which is, for the vast majority of Americans, their most valuable asset,"" Eby said.¶The research focuses on the impact of rising tides between 2005 to 2017 for 2.5 million coastal properties, rather than the cost of damage tied to specific events like storms known as nor'easters. It uses assessed property values and layers in potential lost appreciation compared with similar homes, among other factors.¶The study didn't look at Vermont, the only landlocked New England state, while Connecticut was included in an earlier report.¶Researchers said they took pains to create a ""like-for-like"" comparison for what's called ""sunny-day flooding"" or rising water strictly due to higher tides, by eliminating other factors that typically impact a real estate market from the analysis.¶Earlier First Street Foundation reports found housing values in Connecticut, New York, New Jersey dropped by $6.7 billion over the same period, and estimated five southeastern coastal states lost $7.4 billion in value.¶The data may also prove useful for city planners looking at neighborhoods that might be falling in value, and therefore cutting into tax revenue, Eby said.¶How to preserve that value is a growing concern.¶Maine's voters last year passed a more than $100 million bond that in part will be used to upgrade eroding roads, bridges and waterways. Better access to properties can mean higher property values, and for municipalities, more tax revenue.¶In Boston, Mayor Marty Walsh last year unveiled a plan to protect the city — which has a waterfront exploding with billions in development -- from flooding as seas are forecast to rise 1.5 feet by 2050. And the New Hampshire legislature is considering ways to boost funding to hold back rising tides on its relatively small coast lined with resort towns.¶The data on FloodIQ only takes into account past events, but the clock is only speeding up when it comes to rising tides, experts say.¶""There will be an exponential loss in the years to come unless there are adaptation measures that are put in place to prevent that,"" said Jeremy Porter, a Columbia University lecturer and First Street Foundation statistical consultant. The researchers plan to continue releasing data for the entire U.S. coastline, then expand to other bodies of water.¶The First Street Foundation's studies provide the latest evidence that rising seas are shifting people's preferences for living along coastlines. Last year, a torrent of studies, from the Union of Concerned Scientists studying seaside towns to the Journal of Financial Economics, showed rising seas are eroding property values amid climate change.¶The First Street Foundation study is unique because it takes a wider swath of complex data and illustrates how eroding values are impacting not only ocean-front property, but homes in adjacent areas, Jesse Keenan, who teaches urban development and climate adaptation at Harvard University's Graduate School of Design, told CBS MoneyWatch.¶""It's a technology and it's an interface that begins to translate this complexity to a consumer audience,"" Keenan said. Because the data isn't targeted to financial markets, ""the public good may be possibly advanced.""",0
PG&E bankruptcy shows we don't know how to pay for climate change,"

    ","¶Scientists recently suggested that corporations have vastly underestimated the costs of climate change. The impending bankruptcy of Pacific Gas & Electric could be proving them right. ¶The fires that raged through California in the past two years have been the some of the most devastating to ever hit the state, according to Cal Fire. In 2017, they did as much damage as all the wildfires in the prior 16 years, according to some estimates. That record stood for less than a year before it last November's disasters eclipsed it. The Camp Fire, which destroyed nearly 19,000 homes and took at least 86 lives, was the most destructive in California's history.¶""This is the new abnormal,"" former Gov. Jerry Brown said. ¶Experts agree that a changing climate has made wildfires more frequent and more damaging. Longer, drier summers have extended the typical wildfire season and made trees more susceptible to burning, according to a recent U.S. government report on climate change. But wildfires aren't just a seasonal event anymore. Now they're a year-round threat -- and not just in the West. The Southeastern U.S., which has historically not seen wildfires, is increasingly at risk, as the 2016 fires in Tennessee demonstrate.  ¶More in Climate Change¶Meanwhile, infrastructure hasn't kept up. A 2015 review of U.S. infrastructure found that the biggest threat to it, ""by far,"" was climate change. And that's complicated by the reality of more people living in wooded and fire-prone areas, in houses that are  increasingly more expensive and may not be fireproof. ¶""We're  continuing to build in areas in the urban-wildfire interface, and it's  going to lead to damages to the larger economy,"" Nik Steinberg, head of  analytics for Four Twenty Seven,   a climate-change research group, recently  told CBS MoneyWatch.¶It's possible to prevent power lines from sparking fires or power outages by putting them underground. But that option was found to be so expensive that a utility watchdog group said it was ""really not feasible,"" according to the San Francisco Chronicle. ¶And despite a state of constant crisis for infrastructure, other  spending priorities -- often for more immediate needs -- mean it's almost inevitable that maintenance and  investment get shifted to the back burner.    ¶""I've had countless delays on our projects when we're trying to get infrastructure built or work, and we have a call from PG&E that they have to postpone that work because of a mudslide, or downed power lines,"" said Brian Curtis, CEO of Concentric Power. ""When you're doing that all the time, it's hard to keep up with preventative maintenance.""¶Curtis, whose company builds microgrids, advocated for letting private customers build out parts of the grid, which they would then be responsible for maintaining. ""If you're an industrial consumer and you want to build your own generation or even just connect to the grid, the utility ends up building the infrastructure, but you're the one who ends up paying for it,"" he said.¶Plenty of people in California fault PG&E for not doing enough to mitigate the fires. Hearings before California's utility regulator have been flooded with people calling for criminal prosecution of the utility's executives. ¶""There's a growing anger,"" Steve Zeltzer, a longtime Bay Area activist, told CBS MoneyWatch recently. ""People feel like there's no accountability, and these executives violate the law and get off scot-free while lives have been destroyed and communities have been destroyed."" ¶Democratic Senator Jerry Hill this week accused the PG&E of being ""dishonest"" and ""prioritize[ing] profits way over safety,"" he told the Associated Press. ""I don't believe it will change unless there is some sort of restructure."" ¶There's no guarantee that PG&E's bankruptcy -- which would be one of the biggest by a U.S. company --will lead to the desired result. What's almost certain, however, is that the nearly $30 billion in damages PG&E potentially faces would be dramatically reduced in bankruptcy.¶Under California law, utilities must pay for wildfire damage if their equipment caused the fire, even if negligence wasn't involved. In most other states -- and for other types of natural disasters -- liability requires evidence that the utility was negligent. That system no longer works in a world where wildfires are more frequent and more destructive, said Ralph Cavanagh, co-director of the climate and clean energy program at the Natural Resources Defense Council.¶""If you want electric service, you're going to have to find a different way to structure the system because no utility will survive. That's the lesson here,"" he said. ¶Since all California utilities face similar challenges, Cavanagh is worried that crippling PG&E wouldn't only eliminate a major investor in the state's clean-energy infrastructure. It could also spell doom for some of the very companies that have been at the forefront of decarbonizing the economy -- an effort that's key to the fight against climate change. ¶""Nationwide, our utilities are cutting their emissions, cutting their carbon. It's a glorious success system for the country as a whole,"" he said. ""Trying to maintain that momentum without your hometown utility is a losing proposition."" ¶The insurance industry is demonstrating one way to handle rising costs: pass them on to homeowners in the form of high ""wildfire deductibles."" Some insurers, faced with higher payouts, could outright refuse to insure homes in wildfire-prone areas.¶Lawmakers recently let PG&E raise rates to cover the costs of the 2017 wildfires, but they balked at repeating that after the vastly more expensive disasters of 2018. Vox asked: ""How does a utility price in the risks of rising temperatures and stay in business?"" ¶The answer is still somewhere out there.",0

    ","¶After dropping for three years in a row, U.S. carbon emissions spiked in 2018, demonstrating how hard it can be to move away from fossil fuels while the economy is growing.¶Preliminary data from the Rhodium Group, a research consultancy, found that emissions rose 3.4 percent last year. That's even as Americans' reliance on coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, hit a 40-year low.¶""While a record number of coal-fired power plants were retired last year, natural gas not only beat out renewables to [replace] most of this lost generation but also fed most of the growth in electricity demand,"" the report said.  ¶More in Climate Change¶Natural gas, which has become a cheap and attractive competitor to coal, is cleaner-burning, but it is still a fossil fuel, emitting about half the carbon dioxide that coal does. Earlier studies have found that switching over all the world's coal plants to natural gas would do little to curb climate change. ¶The Trump administration's rollback of environmental laws and decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accords play a role in the increase. But the main culprit is last year's spike in economic growth. Between 2007 and 2015, U.S. emissions came down 12 percent as utilities brought on clean-energy technology and the Great Recession dampened demand for power. In 2016 and 2017, emissions still decreased, but more slowly. Last year, as the economy expanded at the fastest pace in 15 years, boosted by tax cuts and other measures, emissions also grew at a record-setting pace.¶""So long as the economy is growing, that dynamic isn't going to change without a lot of breakthrough technology innovations or federal policy actions,"" John Larsen, one of the report's authors, told Greentech Media.¶The transportation sector was the largest source of carbon emissions last year, with a slight drop in gasoline demand more than offset by increased trucking and air travel. Transport-sector emissions grew 1 percent last year, the same as 2017, according to Rhodium. In this sector, increases in efficiency—doing more with less power—and a move toward electric transport is beginning to make a dent, although a small one. ¶The largest emissions growth was in sectors that don't get much attention outside climate policy circles: Industry and buildings. The industrial sector added 55 million metric tons of carbon last year, more than four times its annual average in the past decade, because of an uptick in industrial activity. The sector is predicted to grow its ""gassiness"" and to become the leading carbon emitter in Texas within three years, according to Rhodium.¶""Absent a significant change in policy or a major technological breakthrough we expect the industrial sector to become an increasingly large share of US greenhouse gas emission in the years ahead,"" the report found.¶Emissions from buildings increased by 54 million tons last year, a sevenfold increase from its typical rate of increase. That's partly because of weather, with a colder winter requiring more heating, but Rhodium expects population growth to keep driving emissions in this sector. ¶The prospect of reducing emissions by up to 28 percent from their 2005 levels—as the U.S. would be required to do under the Paris climate agreement—will require a radical shift. It would mean cutting emissions at nearly double the pace of their 2007-to-2015 decline. That prospect, while not impossible, would require an immediate policy shift or a technological breakthrough, Rhodium found.¶""The U.S. was already off track in meeting its Paris Agreement targets. The gap is even wider headed into 2019,"" it said.",0
Surprising discoveries on how tornadoes form and how climate change could make them stronger,"

    ","¶Tuesday's very rare and strong December tornado in Washington state comes as scientists are learning more than ever about how tornadoes form and why they seem to be growing more powerful. One of those studies says your eyes are deceiving you — tornadoes do not drop down from the clouds. In fact, it's likely the opposite, according to a new study presented at the American Geophysical Union conference.¶Despite the thousands of scientists and storm chasers descending on Tornado Alley every spring, the exact mechanics on how tornadoes form is still not perfectly known. Even something as seemingly elementary as, does the funnel grow from ground or drop from the clouds, is still in debate.¶For this research, Dr. Jana Houser and her team intercepted four tornadoes. They used a special mobile rapid-scanning Doppler radar, which returns data every 15-30 seconds, as opposed to every few minutes like more traditional land-based radars. Shooting a radar beam through the depth of the column, from cloud and ground, allows them to pinpoint where the rotation shows up first.  ¶More in Climate Change¶The most notable intercept was the infamous and deadly tornado that struck El Reno, Oklahoma, in May 2013. On that day a very large contingent of scientists and storm chasers were right in the storm's path, providing an abundance of eyewitness as well as photographic, video and technological evidence. A more comprehensive analysis of how tornadoes form — what scientists call the tornadogenesis process — ""has never before been obtained, providing a missing link in the story of tornado formation: the rotation associated with the tornado was clearly present at the surface first,"" the researchers reported. ¶It turns out that in all four cases the team analyzed, none of the tornadoes formed from the top down. Either there was clear evidence the rotation was present near the ground first or the rotation took place simultaneously through the whole column.¶Houser is quick to point out that the theory of tornadoes forming from the bottom up is not new. What is different in this case is that scientists now have the high resolution rapid scan data for support. ¶This is not to say that all tornadoes form from the ground up, but many do. Houser said, ""While there are surely multiple ways you can get a tornado (we know this to be true already), I am confident that the top-down process is not what is actually happening in most situations.""¶The fact that tornadoes forming from the bottom up is at odds with our visual perception is not lost on Houser. ""I have seen multiple criticisms about this work based upon what people see with their eyes when they watch a funnel cloud,"" she said. ¶It seems obvious: tornadoes look like they drop from the clouds. But this is an illusion. The reason is rather simple. Air is invisible. The only way you can see the spinning funnel is if the circulation is illuminated by dirt, debris or condensed water. Near the ground a tornado starts off with little, if any, dirt in its rotation. You can't see it yet.¶At the cloud base, moisture and humidity is condensed into visible cloud droplets; that's why you see clouds. When a tornado forms it begins to cool and condense the humidity into visible cloud droplets further and further down the tornado funnel. Thus it appears like the tornado is moving downward. In reality the spinning funnel was already there — you just can't see it until water droplets from above and dirt from below shrouds the tornado.¶Dr Leigh Orf is a Tornado researcher and modeler at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He generally agrees with Houser's results. ""Her findings are quite compelling; a visible condensation funnel intersecting the ground long before rotation was seen on research radars."" Orf adds, ""I do not believe tornado vortices 'snake downwards towards the ground from above' — it is more likely that they form almost instantaneously along their length"" ¶But even with all this high resolution data and research, fundamental mysteries remain, says Orf: ""I would not say this observation in any way 'solves' tornadogenesis.""¶In a video posted on YouTube, Orf uses stunning computer simulations to illustrate tornadoes in action.¶As the climate warms more mysteries arise. In a recent study published in EarthArXiv, an Open Science Framework website, Dr. James Elsner of Florida State University finds tornadoes are getting more powerful. And the increase in tornado power is significant: up 5.5 percent per year from 1994 to 2016. The finding is supported by storm reports which show an upward trend in the power of tornadoes from longer and wider paths and higher damage ratings.  ¶Elsner and his team used a statistical model to derive tornado power while taking into consideration the daily 24-hour cycle, seasonality, natural climate variability, and the switch to a new damage scale in 2007.¶In his paper Elsner notes the annual number of strong and violent tornadoes (rated EF2 or worse) has remained relatively consistent from year to year. However, the number of days with large outbreaks of many tornadoes is on the rise. An increase in the number of big tornado days means a larger threat of damaging tornadoes because the percentage of violent tornadoes (EF4 or worse) increases in those larger outbreak days.¶Elsner theorizes this power increase is due to a combination of increased heat and humidity, termed Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE), co-occurring with increases in wind shear. Wind shear is when winds change speed and/or direction with altitude. Generally more shear helps bolster tornadoes. Simply put, when heat, humidity and erratic upper level winds combine you get stronger tornadoes. ¶Since Elsner's study is limited to only 22 years, CBS News asked him if this power increase could be due to known natural oscillations (cycles) in the Atlantic or Pacific Oceans or if climate change could be the culprit. Elsner said, ""We cannot yet be sure if this is a long-term trend tied to climate change or a low frequency oscillation.""¶Probing further, Elsner reveals that wind shear is increasing on days with many tornadoes, but not on days in general. So it seems that on any given day the propensity for tornado formation is not going up. But conditions on tornado days are riper than they used to be. In other words, extreme days are becoming more extreme.¶Elsner thinks the more favorable conditions may be due to a ""wavier"" jet stream. The jet stream is the fast moving river of air in the middle and upper atmosphere which guides storm systems. The idea is that a rapidly warming Arctic, due to climate change, is causing less temperature contrast between the poles and mid-latitudes. This results in a slower jet stream certain times of the year, which is more likely to wander.¶This wavy jet stream theory is a hot topic in climate change research as of the past few years. The concept of a jet stream that is wavier (undulates more) stems from work by Dr. Jennifer Francis in 2015. Since then there has been much research supporting this ""wavy"" jet stream concept. ¶As a climate expert, Francis is not a tornado dynamics expert but she sees how a wavy jet stream may lead to more powerful tornadoes. Francis said, ""It makes sense that a wavier jet stream will bring more contrasting air masses in contact, which is one factor that may favor tornadic activity. Larger jet-stream waves may also mean longer periods of the ingredients that are favorable for tornado formation.""¶There is one other piece of evidence that may help explain this uptick in tornado power. Since tornadoes form in environments that are laden with heat and humidity, a shift into a more humid zone would supply extra energy. That shift seems to be happening. A recent study, co-authored by Dr. Victor Gensini, showed a marked spreading of Tornado Alley from the drier U.S. Plains states into the more humid deep Southeast. This area has an open door to warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, a body of water that has been getting warmer in recent decades. ¶Elsner said, ""I do think that a shift of activity toward the southeast can explain some of the upward trend in power but that is not the entire story as we see an upward trend after statistically controlling for this shift."" ¶As Gensini told CBS News in October, ""it's not a big jump to say that climate change is causing this shift east. The hypothesis and computer simulations support what we are observing and what we expect in the future.""¶Regardless of what is causing the surge in tornado power, assuming it continues, structures built in the tornado zones will need to be made less vulnerable to be able to withstand more force.",0
"""Scary"" warming in the Arctic at unusual times and places","

    ","¶WASHINGTON — Scientists are seeing surprising melting in Earth's polar regions at times they don't expect, like winter, and in places they don't expect, like eastern Antarctica. New studies and reports issued this week at a major Earth sciences conference paint one of the bleakest pictures yet of dramatic warming in the Arctic and Antarctica. ¶Alaskan scientists described to The Associated Press Tuesday never-before-seen melting and odd winter problems, including permafrost that never refroze this past winter and wildlife die-offs.¶The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Tuesday released its annual Arctic report card, detailing the second warmest year on record in the Arctic and problems, including record low winter sea ice in parts of the region, increased toxic algal blooms, which are normally a warm water phenomenon, and weather changes in the rest of the country attributable to what's happening in the far North.¶More in Climate Change¶""The Arctic is experiencing the most unprecedented transition in human history,"" report lead author Emily Osborne, chief of Arctic research for NOAA, said Tuesday.¶What's happening is a big deal, said University of Colorado environmental science program director Waleed Abdalati, NASA's former chief scientist who was not part of the NOAA report.¶""It's a new Arctic. We've gone from white to blue,"" said Abdalati, adding that he normally wouldn't use the word ""scary"" but it applies. That means other problems.¶""Continued warming of the Arctic atmosphere and ocean are driving broad change in the environmental system in predicted, and, also, unexpected ways,"" the NOAA report said.¶One of the most noticeable problems was a record low sea ice in winter in the Bering Sea in 2017 and 2018, scientists said. In February the Bering Sea ""lost an area of ice the area of Idaho,"" said Dartmouth College engineering professor Donald Perovich, a report card co-author.¶This is a problem because the oldest and thickest sea ice is down 95 percent from 30 years ago. In 1985, about one-sixth of Arctic sea ice was thick multi-year ice, now it is maybe one-hundredth, Perovich said. University of Alaska Fairbanks marine mammal biologist Gay Sheffield not only studies the record low ice, but she lives it daily in Nome, far north on the Bering Sea.¶""I left Nome and we had open water in December,"" Sheffield said at the American Geophysical Union conference in Washington. ""It's very much impacting us.""¶""Having this area ice free is having this massive environmental change,"" Sheffield said, adding there's been a ""multi-species die off"" of ocean life. She said that includes the first spring mass die off of seals along the Bering Strait.¶Ornithologist George Divoky who has been studying the black guillemots of Cooper Island for 45 years noticed something different this year. In the past, 225 nesting pairs of the seabirds would arrive at his island. This past winter it was down to 85 pairs but only 50 laid eggs and only 25 had successful hatches. He blamed the lack of winter sea ice.¶""It looked like a ghost town,"" Divoky said.¶With overall melting, especially in the summer, herds of caribou and wild reindeer have dropped about 55 percent — from 4.7 million to 2.1 million animals — because of the warming and the flies and parasites it brings, said report card co-author Howard Epstein of the University of Virginia.¶University of Alaska Fairbanks researcher Vladimir Romanovsky said he was alarmed by what happened to the permafrost — ground that stays frozen years on end. This past year, Romanovsky found 25 spots that used to freeze in January, then February, but never froze this year.¶Because of warming, the Arctic is ""seeing concentrations of algal toxins moving northward"" infecting birds, mammals and shellfish to become a public health and economic problem, said report card co-author Karen Frey.¶The warmer Arctic and melting sea ice has been connected to shifts in the jet stream that have brought extreme winter storms in the East in the past year, Osborne said. But it's not just the Arctic. NASA's newest space-based radar, Icesat 2, in its first couple of months has already found that the Dotson ice shelf in Antarctica has lost more than 390 feet (120 meters) in thickness since 2003, said radar scientist Ben Smith of the University of Washington.¶Another study released Monday by NASA found unusual melting in parts of East Antarctica, which scientists had generally thought was stable. Four glaciers at Vincennes Bay lost nine feet of ice thickness since 2008, said NASA scientists Catherine Walker and Alex Gardner.¶Loss of ice sheets in Antarctica could lead to massive rise in sea level.¶""We're starting to see change that's related to the ocean,"" Gardner said. ""Believe it or not this is the first time we're seeing it in this place.""",0

""The message of this science is that our civilization is increasingly out of sync with our changing climate.""¶The report, titled ""Explaining Extreme Events in 2017 from a Climate Perspective,"" features the research of 120 scientists from 10 countries examining a wide array of extreme weather and events across six continents and two oceans during 2017. It looks at historical observations and model simulations to determine how much climate change may have influenced a particular event.¶The findings are similar to last month's massive quadrennial National Climate Assessment written by outside scientists and officials from 13 federal agencies.

    ","¶KATOWICE, Poland -- A diplomatic standoff over a single word could set the stage for a bigger showdown during the second half of this year's U.N. climate summit.¶Negotiators took time out Sunday to rest after the first week of talks ended on a sour note the previous night, when the United States sided with Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in blocking endorsement of a landmark study on global warming.¶""I think it was a key moment,"" said Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists. ""The fact that a group of four countries were trying to diminish the value and importance of a scientific report they themselves, with all other countries, requested three years ago in Paris is pretty remarkable.""¶More in Climate Change¶The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's special report on what would happen if average global temperatures rise by 1.5 Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit), and how to ensure they don't go higher, was widely regarded as a wake-up call for policy-makers when it was released in October.¶As diplomats wrapped up a week of technical talks Saturday, almost all 200 countries present in Katowice, Poland, had wanted to ""welcome"" the IPCC report, making it the benchmark for future action.¶But the U.S. and three other delegations objected.¶""The United States was willing to note the report and express appreciation to the scientists who developed it, but not to welcome it, as that would denote endorsement of the report,"" the U.S. State Department said in a statement. ""As we have made clear in the IPCC and other bodies, the United States has not endorsed the findings of the report.""¶Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait also called for the study to be ""noted"" but not ""welcomed.""¶While none of the four-oil exporting countries spelled it out, their objection to the report likely included its suggestion that fossil-fuel use needs to be phased out by 2050. Oil, gas and coal are major sources of carbon dioxide, which traps heat in the atmosphere.¶The 2015 Paris agreement set a target of keeping global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit), ideally 1.5 C by the end of the century.¶""A 1.5 C and a 2 C worlds are very different in terms of mean climate, extremes, sea level rise, and climate-related risks,"" said one of the report's leading contributors, Valerie Masson-Delmotte.¶The higher threshold increases the likelihood of ""climate change hot spots challenging basic water, food, economic security and the risk of irreversible loss of wildlife,"" she said.¶Observers at the talks said the two Gulf countries' objection to the IPCC report came as no surprise.¶""The Saudis with their sidekicks the Kuwaitis have long been troublemakers in this in this process,"" said Meyer, who has followed international climate negotiations for many years.¶Russia's intentions were unclear, he said, while the U.S. position appeared to be driven by what he called President Trump 's ""cavalier attitude toward science in general and climate science in particular.""¶""It's really an embarrassment for the world's leading scientific superpower to be in this position of having to disbelieve a report that was written by the world's scientific community including a large number of pre-eminent U.S. scientists,"" Meyer said.¶Saturday's floor fight casts doubt on whether countries will be able to reach consensus on important issues by Friday, including the need to step up national targets to curb carbon emissions.¶While many countries are sending ministers or even national leaders to the talks, the U.S. and Britain are among the countries that will be represented only by bureaucrats.",0
Trump EPA acts to roll back control on climate-changing coal,"

    ","¶The Environmental Protection Agency acted again to ease rules on the sagging U.S. coal industry, this time scaling back what would have been a tough control on climate-changing emissions from any new coal plants.¶The latest Trump administration targeting of legacy Obama administration efforts to slow climate change comes in the wake of multiplying warnings from the agency's scientists and others about the accelerating pace of global warming.¶In a ceremony at the agency, acting EPA administrator Andrew Wheeler signed a proposal to dismantle a 2015 rule that any new coal power plants include cutting-edge techniques to capture the carbon dioxide from their smokestacks. Wheeler called the Obama rules ""excessive burdens"" for the coal industry.¶More in Climate Change¶""This administration cares about action and results, not talks and wishful thinking,"" Wheeler said.¶Asked about the harm that coal plant emission do people and the environment, Wheeler responded, ""Having cheap electricity helps human health.""¶Janet McCabe, an EPA air official under the Obama administration, and others challenged that. MaCabe in a statement cited the conclusion of the EPA's own staff earlier this year that pending rollbacks on existing coal plants would cause thousands of early deaths from the fine soot and dangerous particles and gases.¶The EPA was ""turning its back on its responsibility to protect human health,"" McCabe said Thursday.¶Environmentalists, scientists and lawmakers were scathing, saying the Trump administration was undermining what they said should be urgent efforts to slow climate change.¶The EPA and 12 other federal agencies late last month warned that climate change caused by burning coal, oil and gas already was worsening natural disasters in the United States. It would cause hundreds of billions of dollars in damage each year by the end of the century, the government's National Climate Assessment said.¶""This proposal is another illegal attempt by the Trump administration to prop up an industry already buckling under the powerful force of the free market,"" Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat and member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said in a statement.¶""Did the EPA even read the National Climate Assessment?"" Whitehouse asked.¶It's unclear whether the new policy boost will overcome market forces that are making U.S. coal plants ever more unprofitable.¶Competition from cleaner, cheaper natural gas and other rival forms of energy has driven down coal use in the United States to its lowest level since 1979, the Energy Information Administration said this week. This year will see the second-greatest number of U.S. closings of coal-fired power plants on record.¶Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said the EPA's action Thursday was ""targeting another regulation that would have made it nearly impossible to build any new plants.""¶Citing that and other Obama administration moves to tamp down emissions from coal-fired power plants in the national electrical grid, McConnell called the proposal ""a crucial step toward undoing the damage and putting coal back on a level playing field.""¶Other Trump administration initiatives rolling aback climate change efforts would undo an Obama plan intended to shift the national electrical grid away from coal and toward cleaner-burning solar and wind power, and would relax pending tougher mileage standards for cars and light trucks.¶Jay Duffy, a lawyer with the Clean Air Task Force environmental nonprofit, called the level-playing field argument of the administration and its supporters ""laughable.""¶""In every rulemaking, they're placing their thumbs on the scale to prop up coal, at the expense of public health and the environment,"" Duffy said.¶Speaking alongside Wheeler at a news conference, Michelle Bloodworth of the coal industry group America's Power contended the new rollback could throw a lifeline to domestic coal-fired power producers.¶""It does appear that this proposal would make it feasible for new coal plants"" to be built, Bloodworth said.",0

    ","¶The world hit another carbon dioxide emissions milestone in 2018, with an estimated 2.7 percent increase in emissions since last year, according to a report published Wednesday in Environmental Research Letters, a scientific journal. This follows an increase of 1.6 percent in 2017 from 2016.¶The Global Carbon Project, an organization that produced the report, estimates that global CO2 emissions from fossil fuel sources will hit a record high of more than 37 billion tons this year.¶Just two years ago, there was cause for cautious optimism. From 2014 to 2016, world emissions seemed to be stabilizing.¶More in Climate Change¶""We thought, perhaps hoped, emissions had peaked a few years ago,"" Rob Jackson, a professor at Stanford's School of Earth, Energy & Environmental Sciences and leader of the Global Carbon Project, said in a news release. ""After two years of renewed growth, that was wishful thinking.""¶The Global Carbon Project report estimates that CO2 emissions in the U.S. alone ticked up 2.5 percent since last year partly due to extreme heat, as well as cold and the use of oil associated with it. U.S. emissions make up 15 percent of the global output.¶The U.S., however, is not the biggest emitter. With a population four times greater than the U.S., that distinction goes to China, producing 27 percent of global emissions. Their contribution also grew 4.5 percent in 2018 compared to last year due to continued construction and economic growth.¶The published findings come on the heels of a U.N. Emissions Gap Report released last week. The ""emissions gap"" is the difference between fossil fuel emissions reduction pledges made by the nearly 200 countries that signed the 2015 Paris Agreement and where the actual emissions trajectory stands today. Emissions act as a heat-trapping greenhouse gas blanket, warming the globe.¶The U.N. report illustrates a widening chasm between reality and the international community's stated goal of limiting global warming to ""well below the 2 degrees Celsius,"" or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit. That temperature increase is measured from 1850.¶The U.N. report highlights the disconnect between need and action, concluding that nations must triple their efforts to stay below 2 degrees Celsius. To stay below a more ambitious goal of less than 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming, we'd need five times as much effort.¶According to NASA, atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide are the highest they've been in 2 to 3 million years. For the past 800,000 years, CO2 levels have stayed near or below 280 parts per million. Just in the last 150 years, levels have jumped 45 percent due mainly to the burning of fossil fuels.¶800,000 years of CO2 in one graph 📈 pic.twitter.com/RbgW9ZGeHg¶Meanwhile, Earth continues to shatter warming records. A few days ago, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), an intergovernmental organization, put out a statement saying the 20 warmest years on record have all been in the past 22 years, with the top four in the past four years.¶Since the 1800s, the world has warmed close to 2 degrees Fahrenheit. Climate scientists conclude that nearly 100 percent of the warming is due to humans.¶""It is worth repeating once again that we are the first generation to fully understand climate change and the last generation to be able to do something about it,"" said World Meteorological Organization Secretary-General Petteri Taalas.¶In the last decade, from 2007 to 2017, there has been some reason for optimism in the U.S., as emissions decreased by 13.5 percent over that period, according to Jackson, the Stanford professor. The decrease was due to progress in energy efficiency and gains in sustainable energy. The U.S. also has the greatest potential to reduce energy consumption with efficiency, since the U.S. has the highest rate of energy use per person — two times that of Europe.¶But at a time when the world's scientists are shouting desperate warnings, Americans' habits still seem to be going in the opposite direction.¶""We're driving more miles in bigger cars, changes that are outpacing improvements in vehicle fuel efficiency,"" Jackson said. ""Overall, U.S. oil use is on track to rise by more than 1 percent this year compared to 2017.""¶John Furlow, deputy director at the International Research Institute of Climate and Society at Columbia University, is frustrated by the U.S. abandonment of the Paris Agreement and lack of U.S. leadership on climate. Still, he holds out hope that the U.S. will be able to meet some its Paris commitments through mobilization of state, local and private action. He worries ""it will not have the same impact as a concerted, coordinated national effort from a superpower.""¶With a global population expected to spike to over 11 billion in 2100, stopping the emissions bulldozer is a Herculean task. A business-as-usual approach to climate change concerns Arturo Garcia-Costas, Environment Program Officer at New York Community Trust. He urges game-changing action.¶""The time for minor tweaks to our civilization has passed,"" he said. ""We need to take bold steps and deploy new technologies that will transform the systems we depend upon to move, feed and protect our families from a changing world.""¶That's what the world is working on right now at COP24 in Katowice, Poland —  an annual U.N. climate meeting with delegates from nearly all nations. Famous nature documentarian Sir David Attenborough opened the conference with a dire warning.¶""Right now, we are facing a man-made disaster of global scale, our greatest threat in thousands of years,"" he said.

The U.N. chief chided countries, particularly those most responsible for greenhouse gas emissions, for failing to do enough to meet the goals of the Paris climate accord.¶A recently released National Climate Assessment warns the world is heading toward chaos by the end of the 21st century.

It also found infrastructure in parts of the U.S. is nearing the end of its life expectancy. Even new facilities are not built to withstand climate changes.¶But Poland's President Andrzej Duda says the coal-reliant nation has no plans to totally remove this fossil fuel, which it has in abundance, from its energy mix. Duda said there's ""no plan today to fully give up on coal"" as Poland's supplies can run for another 200 years. ¶The country still relies on coal for 80 percent of its energy. Duda said Poland has cut its carbon gas emission by 30 percent in the past three decades, while maintaining substantial economic growth. He said coal was Poland's ""strategic fossil fuel"" guaranteeing its energy security and sovereignty and ""it would be hard not to use it.""¶Famed naturalist Sir David Attenborough issued a stark warning, saying human civilization may collapse unless the world takes action.

Yet even the emergence of a genuine low-carbon economy likely won't stop the world from overheating, some experts indicate. ¶Energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie predicts in a report that the world will continue to shift away from fossil fuels and toward clean energy, such as the use of electric vehicles. The good news is that such trends will slow the rate of global warming. Now for the bad: Global temperatures would still rise more than 2 degrees Celsius in the decades ahead -- a threshold scientists say could cause irreparable damage to the planet. ¶""[P]athways towards even lower emissions (1.5 degrees) are out of reach unless we make immediate and drastic changes to our way of life,"" Wood Mac finds, echoing the conclusions of last month's United Nations report on climate change. ¶Here's what that low-carbon future could look like in the energy analysts' eyes: Demand for oil peaks in 2031, then starts to decline. The number of combustion-engine cars on the road crests a few years later;  by 2040, only electric cars are sold in Europe and the U.S. By then, wind and solar power provide 40 percent of the world's power.¶More in Climate Change¶Many of these changes are already well underway:¶Less certain is how that low-carbon economy will take shape, and how fast. One big unknown is how much of it will be powered by natural gas. The lower-emission fossil  fuel has displaced coal in many parts of the U.S., thanks to the  fracking boom, and demand for it is set to keep growing until 2040, Wood Mac predicts. ¶But a longer-term reliance on natural gas could elevate global temperatures higher above the 2 degree Celsius mark than if it were completely supplanted by cleaner energy sources, previous research shows.

He's a disrupter, credited for reviving Canada's apple industry. ¶Barthomeuf started three decades ago when he invented ice cider, an alcoholic apple drink akin to dessert wine. It takes advantage of something Canada has in abundance: the cold. Instead of picking apples in the fall, he waits until winter when the apple's sugar peaks. ¶Weather is a key ingredient. It may also be this delicacy's downfall. Barthomeuf said that because of global warming, he's not sure they will be able to make ice cider in just 15 years from now.  ¶Barthomeuf  was inspired by a popular drink called ice wine, which is made from frozen grapes. What started with one apple tree has grown to hundreds at his vineyard, Clos Saragnat, where tourists flock for tastings. ¶ Once the apples reach minus 10 degrees Celsius, the apples are pressed immediately. That allows frozen water to remain with the leftover pulp, so only the concentrated sugary nectar is extracted. ¶During the fermentation process, about half of the high sugar content turns to alcohol, allowing the cider to keep its sweet taste despite a 10 percent alcohol content.  ¶ Ice cider was once a hard sell, said Barthomeuf's partner Louise Dupuis. ¶""In the '70s, big companies started to do cider but the cider was very bad. Even for health. So the government decided to take this out of the market and the people, they just kept the idea that cider was a very bad thing to have,"" Dupuis said. ""We said, 'Okay, it's apple wine.'""¶ With his newfound success, Canada approved Barthomeuf to sell ice cider. Other Quebecers later joined in. The ice cider movement spread south to Vermont where in 2007, Eleanor Leger's basement hobby of making the drink flourished into a company.¶ ""We visited 26 restaurants, a couple stores, and all but one of them bought and then they rebought. We were sold out and they wanted more,"" Leger said. ""And that was when we sort of looked at each other and said, 'Oh, maybe this is not a hobby.'""¶Leger founded Eden Specialty Ciders and a year later became the first American ice cider maker approved by U.S. regulators.¶ ""It was critical because our whole intention when we started in 2007 was to make ice cider primarily, not hard cider … and if we didn't get an approval for a label to say 'ice cider' then we weren't going to do anything commercially with it,"" Leger said. ¶Unlike Barthomeuf in Canada, Leger, like most American ice cider makers, picks the apples in the fall, not winter. She later freezes its juice to make ice cider. ¶Leger is considered America's top ice cider maker and in 2016 collaborated with the country's largest hard cider company: Angry Orchard. ¶ Ryan Burk is head cider maker at Angry Orchard, which is now making its own ice cider.¶ ""There's so many ways that cider can be its own thing and then within that very different from each other by style,"" Burk said. ¶ But it's not cheap. Each bottle requires up to a 100 apples, and that's just one of the challenges to making this sweet treat. ¶ ""We'll see what this winter brings but you know for us, last year it didn't get cold enough to freeze, thaw, freeze, thaw – the process that we need to make great ice cider,"" Burk said.

Among those who spoke out was former Vice President Al Gore, who became the face of the climate debate with the 2006 documentary ""An Inconvenient Truth.""¶""Unbelievably deadly and tragic wildfires rage in the west, hurricanes batter our coasts — and the Trump administration chooses the Friday after Thanksgiving to try and bury this critical U.S. assessment of the climate crisis,"" Gore said in a statement Friday. ""The President may try to hide the truth, but his own scientists and experts have made it as stark and clear as possible.""  ¶The National Climate Assessment, which is mandated by law, was written by outside scientists and officials from 13 federal agencies. It says Earth's climate is now changing faster than ever, primarily as a result of human activities. It also warns that extreme weather and climate-related events, like wildfires and hurricanes, are worsening in the U.S.   ¶My statement on the National Climate Assessment released today: https://t.co/fltD5DOmoy pic.twitter.com/PLpGCnaUc0¶Releasing information on a Friday afternoon or around a holiday is widely seen as a way to minimize the amount of attention it might get.¶More in Climate Change¶The report was long scheduled for release in December, but the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced on Wednesday -- the eve of the Thanksgiving holiday -- that it would be released on Black Friday, widely regarded as the beginning of the Christmas shopping season. It was unclear why the date was moved up.¶""It's an absolute disgrace to bury the truth about climate impacts in a year that saw hundreds of Americans die during devastating climate-fueled megafires, hurricanes, floods, and algal blooms,"" National Wildlife Federation president and CEO Collin O'Mara said in a statement.¶It’s beyond disgraceful to bury the truth about climate impacts in a year where many Americans died during climate-fueled megafires, hurricanes, floods & algal blooms¶RT to urge news outlets to give the National Climate Assessmnt the attention it deserveshttps://t.co/2Hx32Pw8Sf¶Study co-author Andrew Light, an international policy expert at the World Resources Institute, told The Associated Press that releasing the report on Black Friday ""is a transparent attempt by the Trump Administration to bury this report and continue the campaign of not only denying but suppressing the best of climate science.""¶Deputy weather editor Angela Fritz of The Washington Post, David Doniger, senior climate policy director at the Natural Resources Defense Council, and environmental social scientist Philip Loring were also critical of the report's timing.¶The report is the second volume of the Fourth National Climate Assessment or NCA4, which NOAA said is designed to be ""an authoritative assessment of the impacts of climate change on the U.S. and its territories, and was written to help decision-makers, utility and resource managers, public health officials, emergency planners, and other stakeholders better understand the effects of climate change on the United States."" ¶Volume I of the assessment, which concluded that it was ""extremely likely"" that climate change has been caused by humans, was released last November.¶The newly released report frequently contradicts President Donald Trump.

Controversial spraying method aims to curb global warming,"

    ","¶A fleet of 100 planes making 4,000 worldwide missions per year could help save the world from climate change. Also, it may be relatively cheap. That's the conclusion of a new peer-reviewed study in Environmental Research Letters.¶It's the stuff of science fiction. Planes spraying tiny sulphate particulates into the lower stratosphere, around 60,000 feet up. The idea is to help shield the Earth from just enough sunlight to help keep temperatures low.¶The researchers examined how practical and costly a hypothetical solar geoengineering project would be beginning 15 years from now. The aim would be to half the temperature increase caused by heat-trapping greenhouse gases.¶More in Climate Change¶This method would mimic what large volcanoes do. In 1991, Mount Pinatubo erupted in the Philippines. It was the second largest eruption of the 20th century, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS).¶In total, the eruption injected 20 million tons of sulfur dioxide aerosols into the stratosphere. USGS said the Earth's lower atmosphere temperature dropped by approximately 1-degree Fahrenheit. The effect only lasted a couple of years because the sulfates eventually fell to Earth.¶Although controversial, some think that trying to mimic the impacts of a volcano eruption is a viable way to control global warming. This proposed type of climate geoengineering is called stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI). Theoretically if done at scale — and sustained — the impact can be large. The 1-degree temperature drop which accompanied Mount Pinatubo's eruption is equal to about half of the human-caused warming Earth has experienced since the Industrial Revolution began.¶Dr. Gernot Wagner from Harvard University is an author of the paper. He said their study shows this type of geoengineering ""... would be technically possible strictly from an engineering perspective. It would also be remarkably inexpensive, at an average of around $2 to 2.5 billion per year over the first 15 years.""¶But to reach that point, the study said an entirely new aircraft needs to be developed. Partly because missions would need to be conducted at nearly double the cruising altitude of commercial airplanes. The study's co-author, Wake Smith explained, ""No existing aircraft has the combination of altitude and payload capabilities required.""¶So, the team investigated what it would cost to develop an aircraft they dub the SAI Lofter (SAIL). They say its fuselage would have a stubby design and the wing area —  as well as the thrust — would need to be twice as large. In total, the team estimates the development cost for the airframe to be $2 billion and $350 million to modify existing engines.¶In their hypothetical plan, the fleet would start with eight planes in the first year and rise to just under 100 within 15 years. In year one, there would be 4,000 missions, increasing to just over 60,000 per year by year 15. As you can see, this would need to be a sustained and escalating effort.¶As one may imagine, a concept like this comes with a lot of controversy. Like treating a fever with aspirin, this type of engineering only treats the symptoms, it does not fix the root cause of the warming: Escalating levels of heat trapping greenhouse gases produced by the burning of fossil fuels.¶The American Meteorological Society (AMS) expressed concerns that the possibility of seemingly quick and inexpensive fixes will distract the public and policymakers from addressing the underlying problems and developing adaptation strategies. And if for whatever reason the aerosol missions stopped, within a few years the temperatures would shoot up at breakneck pace. A pace that would likely be too fast for humanity to adjust.¶The AMS official policy statement regarding this type of geoengineering begins with a warning, ""Reflecting sunlight would likely reduce Earth's average temperature but could also change global circulation patterns with potentially serious consequences such as changing storm tracks and precipitation patterns.""¶In other words, the atmosphere is complex. Any band-aid fix is bound to have unintended consequences and possibly cause a new set of problems. The AMS goes on to say results of reflecting sunlight ""would almost certainly not be the same for all nations and peoples, thus raising legal, ethical, diplomatic and national security concerns."" One region may become a desert, while others become flooded out.¶And if we learn to control SAI to tailor a favorable result, there's the concern it may be used for the disproportionate benefit of one nation over another. In a 2017 study in the publication Nature Communications, the authors warn their work ""... reemphasizes the perils of unilateral geoengineering, which might prove attractive to individual actors due to a greater controllability of local climate responses, but with inherent additional risk elsewhere.""¶But perhaps the greatest reason to be skeptical of aerosol solar sunlight management is that it's not a silver bullet. As carbon dioxide continues to increase, the oceans are becoming increasingly acidic. According to NOAA, ocean acidification can cascade through the ocean food chain, reducing the ability of shell fish and reef-building corals to produce their skeletons. Injecting aerosols into the stratosphere simply limits sunshine, it does not tackle the underlying carbon dioxide build up. The ocean would continue to acidify.¶Despite the potential drawbacks, the AMS does recognize — even with aggressive mitigation — we can't avoid some dangerous consequences of climate change already baked into the system. Plus, the scale of human adaptation is limited. Therefore, they urge caution and continued research.¶The AMS policy statement closes with: ""Geoengineering will not substitute for either aggressive mitigation or proactive adaptation, but it could contribute to a comprehensive risk management strategy to slow climate change and alleviate some of its negative impacts. The potential to help society cope with climate change and the risks of adverse consequences imply a need for adequate research, appropriate regulation and transparent deliberation.""",0

    ","¶In the not-too-distant future, disasters won't come one at a time. Instead, according to new research, we can expect a cascade of catastrophes, some gradual, others abrupt, all compounding as climate change takes a greater toll.¶""Facing these climatic changes will be like getting into a fight with Mike Tyson, Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Jackie Chan — all at the same time."" That is how Camillo Mora, the lead author of the study released Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change, describes the numerous impacts that are expected to hit us in the coming years. He adds, ""I think we are way above our heads.""¶In total, the researchers identified 467 distinct ways in which society is already being impacted by increasing climate extremes, and then laid out how these threats are likely to compound on top of each other in the decades ahead. If something isn't done to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions, they say that instead of dealing with a single major hazard at a time, people worldwide could be forced to cope with three to six at once.¶More in Climate Change¶To reach that conclusion, the team of 23 scientists reviewed more than 3,000 scientific peer-reviewed scientific papers. They examined the impact on human health, food supplies, water, the economy, infrastructure, and security from multiple factors including rising temperatures, drought, heat waves, wildfires, precipitation, floods, powerful storms, sea level rise and changes in land cover and ocean chemistry.¶The University of Hawaii at Manoa, where several of the scientists are based, called the work ""one of the most comprehensive assessments yet of how humanity is being impacted by the simultaneous occurrence of multiple climate hazards strengthened by increasing greenhouse gas emissions.""¶While most studies focus on one or two threats from climate change, this paper aggregates the impacts and shows how the threats are not isolated, but rather compound on top of each other. ¶""If we only consider the most direct threats from climate change, for example heat waves or severe storms, we inevitably will be blindsided by even larger threats that, in combination, can have even broader societal impacts."" says co-author Jonathan Patz, professor and director of the University of Wisconsin's Global Health Institute.¶According to Mora, ""The notion of these hazards happening simultaneously is not something far into the future, this is already here.""¶While all regions of the globe face compounding threats, California and Florida are two prime examples close to home. ¶In humid areas like Florida, climate change is feeding more heat waves, heavier downpours, stronger hurricanes and sea level rise leading to more heat-related health issues, wind and water damage to infrastructure, water quality issues, increased algae blooms and economic loss from damage and decreased production.¶In drier areas like California, the combination of heat, drought and wildfires threaten lives and health, water resources, food production and infrastructure. In recent years, an increase in heat and drought have helped fuel some of the largest fires in recent history.¶Perhaps the most obvious health impacts of the California fires are the direct effects of breathing in tiny smoke particulates in the air. Extended exposure can cause increases in lung and heart disease as these particulates end up one's respiratory and circulatory systems.¶Dr. Madeleine Thomson studies health and climate at the International Research Institute for Climate and Society at Columbia University. She says that while the direct impacts of climate change phenomena on health are obvious, the indirect effects may have even bigger implications for society. ¶""Take, for example, the Californian fires,"" says Thomson. ""The health risks from smoke inhalation are widespread and could have long term impacts — but loss of homes and livelihoods could have greater impact on the health of individuals in a society where access to health care is so dependent on work-based health insurance.""¶It's easy to see how climate change is a compounding problem. Heat leads to drought which helps fuel bigger fires. Fires lead to disease directly through smoke inhalation but also through loss of shelter and livelihood, which leads to loss of insurance and/or inability to pay for medical care. The more this type of compounding or domino effect occurs, the greater the cumulative harm to society. ¶As heat-trapping greenhouse gases continue to rise, the threats will be multiplied in the decades to come. Mora and his team developed an interactive tool to map worldwide risks from a changing climate based on varying degrees of future greenhouse gas concentrations.¶The research project showed that ""…projected exposure to multiple climate hazards will be very similar between rich and poor countries, but variations in adaptive capacity will probably result in different types of impacts. For example, higher economic loss for developed nations and higher loss of life for developing countries.""¶While some of these impacts already appear unavoidable, other longer term and more extreme consequences could still be avoided if action is taken to substantially reduce greenhouse gases, scientists say.¶Michael Mann is a Distinguished Professor of Atmospheric Science at Penn State University and one of the global leaders in climate change science. He was not involved in the study, but in his view, ""This new research provides rigorous, quantitative support for a point we have emphasized for some time: the costs of inaction greatly outweigh the costs of taking action on climate change.""¶Although the worst-case scenarios in the research are alarming, Mann insists the future is still very much in our hands: ""We can an still reduce future damage and suffering if we act quickly and dramatically to reduce carbon emissions.""",0

    ","¶By now fire season in California should be wrapping up. Instead there are more than a dozen fires burning across California currently — a few of which are historically destructive like the Camp Fire and Woolsey Fire.¶But why are such volatile wildfires persisting past typical fire season, into mid-November? There are many answers, involving both current weather and longer term climate shifts.¶Right now a combination of dry ground, low relatively humidity and gusty winds from the mountains are making conditions ripe for fires to spread out of control. Gusts on Sunday morning were clocked over 50 mph in parts of north Central California.¶Some strong wind gusts being recorded this morning as northerly winds increase. Gusts of 40 to 50+ mph are being measured in the mountains, locally up to 37 mph in the Valley. #cawx pic.twitter.com/eHg457kOxS¶But there is good news for the northern half of the state. Winds are forecast to slow down making the fires easier to fight.¶More in Climate Change¶The opposite is true, however, for Southern California, where a high wind warning is in effect for parts of the area near the ""Woolsey Fire."" Winds will easily gust over 50 mph, with some isolated gusts near hurricane force. This makes fighting fires nearly impossible and makes the likelihood of fires spreading out of control even greater. These strong wind gusts will remain an issue at least through Tuesday, with some indication the winds will start to cooperate more by midweek.¶Recently, it's been very dry in the Golden State. Over the past 30 days, most of California has seen little if any rain.¶If Northern California had received anywhere near the typical amount of autumn precipitation this year (around 4-5 in. of rain near #CampFire point of origin), explosive fire behavior & stunning tragedy in #Paradise would almost certainly not have occurred. (1/n) #CAfire #CAwx pic.twitter.com/2LBKjSVBMF¶While normal values of rain are only a couple of inches the first half of autumn, any lack of rain at the very end of fire season, even an inch or two, exacerbates an already grave fire threat. The ground is parched and the brush is like a tinder box.¶In the longer term, a more elaborate story emerges: One of population increases and climate changes.¶California's population has nearly doubled since the 1970s, from around 20 million to nearly 40 million today. As a result, people are encroaching on once sparsely populated areas more vulnerable to fires. Across the country the number of homes on the wildland-urban interface has increased dramatically. A recent study in the Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences illustrates the encroachment issue: ""Within the perimeter of recent wildfires (1990-2015), there were 286,000 houses in 2010, compared with 177,000 in 1990."" High populations mean a higher propensity for fires to be started in those forested areas. This is the direct human element.¶But there is another human element which appears more subtle, yet has substantial real world consequences: That is a changing climate. Since the 1970s, fire season has increased by three to four months. Some have said that California does not have a fire season anymore. It's all year round. Probably the most astonishing fact is that large fires have tripled since the 1970s.¶Since the 1970s the number of large fires has Tripled! The reasons are numerous including both climate change & human encroachment on vulnerable land. The climate has warmed, leading to less snow pack, more evaporation, more prevalent droughts and drier ground! @_ClimateMatters pic.twitter.com/J3Et4gdg60¶Over the past few decades temperatures have warmed in the American West. That increases evaporation from plants, trees and soil. At the same time snow pack has decreased and rain is less reliable. Combine all those changing climate factors and you end up with long periods of very dry vegetation. The end result are fires that burn faster, longer and larger.¶The proof of that can be found in just the last several years. Looking at records back to 1930, four out of five of California's largest wildfires have burned in just the past six years. ¶UPDATE: 15 of California's 20 largest Wildfires have burned since the year 2000. #CampFire #HillFire #WoolseyFire pic.twitter.com/XfO4AQioIB¶So is there any relief in sight? The answer is: Not in the immediate future. Over the next 10 days little, if any, significant rain will fall in the West.¶For the upcoming winter, there is a weak to moderate El Niño forecast. This may be good news for Southern California. But the emphasis is on the word ""may."" As is typical of El Niño winters, NOAA is predicting slightly above normal rain, but only in the very southern tip of the state. However, the news on temperatures is not as favorable. NOAA forecasts a greater likelihood of above normal temperatures for all of the western U.S.¶Looking decades ahead into the more distant future, climate change is forecast to make conditions even more challenging in California. Our best science tells us that the climate will continue to get warmer and drier in most of the state. ¶All the evidence points to dangerous wildfires, like the ones currently burning in California, being a new reality of life in the western U.S. Smart land use, planning and development will be necessary to minimize the damage. In the long run, a global effort to fight global warming would also help to stem the destruction. But even if we start now, greenhouse gases lingering in our atmosphere mean trends like warming and drying are now baked in for decades to come.",0
3 reports sound alarm on warming oceans,"

    ","¶The climate science printing press has been working overtime the past two weeks spitting out study after study. Even for a discipline used to eye-opening research, the recent revelations have been particularly alarming, and for scientists like myself, they deserve a big neon sign on Broadway. ¶In climate circles, what really sounded the sirens recently were three separate reports that show the oceans are warming at a staggering rate. ¶One study published in the scientific journal Nature concludes that the oceans are absorbing 60 percent more heat than previous estimates from the U.N.'s International Panel on Climate Change. The study calculates that over the past 25 years, the oceans gained energy equivalent to more than 5 billion Hiroshima-sized atomic bombs. ¶More in Climate Change¶""What makes the result robust is that it actually agrees with the top of the range estimates based on temperature, which is indeed 60 percent higher than what IPCC published,"" said the lead author of the study, Laure Resplandy of Princeton University.¶It should be noted that the methods used in the study are novel, prompting some caution from the scientific community. Experts at Climate Feedback, a global network of scientists, reviewed an article written on the paper. They said the ""the study's conclusions (and implications) require additional investigation.""¶Dr. Kevin Trenberth of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) in Boulder, Colorado, has researched extensively on ocean heat. He was not involved in the study and has questions about some of its assertions, but said ""the results are quite compatible with our estimates for the most part. They have implications because the planet is clearly warming at faster rates than previously appreciated.""¶Any previously unaccounted for heat in the oceans is significant. One unit of water holds four times the amount of heat that one unit of air holds. You can think of the oceans as our climate control, sucking up heat and keeping our daily air temperatures moderated. In fact, more than 90 percent of heat trapped by greenhouse gases is eventually stored in our oceans, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). That stored ocean heat is called ocean heat content (OHC).¶That leads us to a lesser-circulated report from Zeke Hausfather of Carbon Brief, a U.K.-based website covering issues related to climate. In his report on the website, Hausfather said ocean heat content just set a new record in 2018, and the year is not yet over. This is not surprising. New OHC records are set every year because the heat keeps accumulating.¶Insane increases in Ocean Heat Content. The best way to measure year to year warming. Human-emitted greenhouse gases trap extra heat in the atmosphere. While some of this warms the Earth’s surface, upwards of 90% goes into the oceans.” https://t.co/1aVQXb6Uit Nice work @hausfath pic.twitter.com/0aucn3fp7i¶That makes the ocean a better gauge in measuring global warming trends than the atmosphere, which warms and cools more erratically. There is a very stable overall trend in the oceans.¶But where does all the heat go? Some of it stays in the upper layer of the oceans, making it the heat that comes back to haunt us. Trenberth said we experience the extra ocean heat when it powers stronger hurricanes, melts ice shelves, raises sea levels and helps fuel El Nino.  ¶The rest of the heat is dispersed throughout the ocean depths, some sinking to the bottom. ¶And that leads us to the final report. For three decades, researchers have been sailing around the world on repeated cruises looking for this stored heat. New research published by NOAA shows that a portion of the heat is being stored in the oceans deepest layers, 6,000 to 20,000 feet down.¶The agency concludes, ""human-caused climate change has reached one of the most remote corners of the oceans circulatory system.""  ¶Research cruises reveal global warming reaching the deep Southern Ocean  https://t.co/wwncUfZEoa via @NOAAClimate (cc: @SOCCOMProject @MBARI_News) pic.twitter.com/srf7F4PTyj¶It's now clear that the influence of man pervades every nook and cranny of this planet, even the most isolated.

Supreme Court declines to stop climate change lawsuit filed by young activists,"

    ","¶WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court on Friday declined for now to stop a lawsuit filed by young activists who say the government isn't doing enough to prevent climate change. But the high court told the Trump administration that the government can still petition a lower court to dismiss the case as the government had asked the high court to do. ¶Trial in the case had been scheduled to begin earlier this week in Eugene, Oregon, but the Supreme Court temporarily halted the trial earlier this month. On Friday evening, the high court declined to extend the temporary halt to the case. The court said in a three-page, unsigned order that ordinarily the request the government made to the justices for the case to be dismissed has to be made to a lower court first. The high court said ""adequate relief may be available"" from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit. That court has previously declined requests to dismiss the case at earlier stages. ¶The Supreme Court also didn't rule out bringing the case back to the justices after the appeals court rules.  Justice Clarence Thomas and Justice Neil Gorsuch said they would have extended the halt to the case. ¶More in Climate Change¶One of the lawyers for the young people bringing the case, Julia Olson, said in a statement Friday night that they have asked for an immediate status conference to get the case ""back on track for trial in the next week."" ¶The case against the government was brought by 21 young people, ages 11 to 22, who argue that government officials have known for more than 50 years that carbon pollution from fossil fuels was causing climate change and that policies on oil and gas deprive them of life, liberty and property. ¶The young people also say the government has failed to protect natural resources as a ""public trust"" for future generations. The lawsuit wants a court to order the government to take action to quickly phase out carbon dioxide emissions to a certain level by 2100 and develop a national climate recovery plan. ¶The federal government under the Obama and Trump administrations has tried repeatedly to get the case dismissed since it was filed in 2015 but have so far been unsuccessful. Trump administration lawyers had argued that the lawsuit is an attempt to ""redirect federal environmental and energy policies through the courts rather than through the political process, by asserting a new and unsupported fundamental due process right to certain climate conditions."" A Justice Department spokeswoman, Kerri Kupec, declined comment on the Supreme Court's action Friday.¶Watch special election coverage live on CBSN on fuboTV. Start a free trial    ",0

If that is true, it has major implications for the world."" ¶The Earth's oceans absorb excess heat that is trapped by greenhouse gases, which impacts everything from coral reefs to the intensity of hurricanes. ¶""As this heat is absorbed, it raises ocean temperatures and accelerates the retreat of glaciers and ice sheets, both of which cause sea level rise,"" says a report published in August by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

            Invasive species may spread with help from climate change - CBS News
    ",CBS News,"October 28, 2018, 7:00 AM","¶Watch the CBSN Originals documentary, ""Burmese Python Invasion: Fighting Invasive Species,"" in the video player above. ¶Think about climate change and you may picture melting ice caps and stranded polar bears. But you should also picture a reef-destroying lionfish, voracious Burmese python, or disease-spreading Asian tiger mosquito. As seasonal cycles shift and ecosystems are thrown off balance, those invasive species — and many others — could infiltrate a broader range of territories with devastating consequences to our health, vital habitats and industries.¶A species is considered invasive when it moves into an ecosystem that has not evolved to control it. Once a species gains a foothold in territory without its natural predators, it multiplies and eventually takes over. This is not a new phenomenon. According to the Convention on Biodiversity, 40 percent of all species that have gone extinct over the last 400 years have met that fate at least in part due to invasive species. ¶However, climate change has already started to exacerbate the situation. A 2017 study found that at least a third of new introductions of invasive species in the last 200 years have occurred since 1970.¶In the last three to five decades, the U.S. has suffered the impact of several invasive species. Burmese pythons have wreaked havoc in the Florida Everglades, reducing some native species by 99 percent since 1997. ¶Lionfish have invaded reefs in the Bahamas, wiping out up 95 percent of native marine life in some areas. The beautiful but destructive fish has also spread through the Gulf of Mexico and nearly the entire length of North America's Eastern Seaboard, the third largest reef system in the world.  ¶Asian carp, meanwhile, have effectively taken over the Mississippi River basin and are decimating local fishing industries. These insatiable giants were first imported in the 1970s to remove algae from ponds, but they were displaced by flooding and spilled out into the waterways, where they now crowd out favorites like catfish, shrimp and buffalo fish.¶Richard Durrett, a lifelong Louisiana-based commercial fisherman, says that for the last decade he's been struggling to stay afloat. ¶""I mean, when I was a younger guy we had probably 30, 32 local fishermen. We're down to seven now,"" he said. ¶""It's a big threat,"" said Philippe Parola, a local chef and businessman who took us out on the water. ""Not only here — we in Louisiana here — but they're all the way to Canada in the entire Mississippi basin. They multiply. They spawn like three million eggs per year."" ¶And because they didn't evolve here, there's no local predator to keep their numbers in check. Efforts to contain the problem include an underwater electric barrier built to keep them from entering the Great Lakes, where a $7 billion fishing industry is at risk.¶Until now, many invasive species have been limited in their spread because of environmental factors like temperature and humidity. But the prospect of climate change threatens to open up new territory for foreign flora and fauna to take over. ¶Burmese pythons, for example, have thrived and multiplied in South Florida, where conditions are somewhat similar to their native Southeast Asia. But in 2012, a Burmese python was spotted as far north as southern Georgia. Experts fear that climate change could eventually enable these enormous snakes to migrate even farther north. ¶It's not just large or exotic animals that people are concerned about. An invasive species can be any kind of living organism, including insects, plants, fungi, even microorganisms like bacteria — raising alarm about the increased possibility of global pandemics that could sicken millions of people or decimate wholesale food supplies like livestock and produce. ¶Invasive plants alone already cost $30 billion per year in eradication efforts, a number that's likely to rise as climate conditions continue to shift. The growing season in the United States is already about two weeks longer than it was a century ago, allowing invasive plants to bloom earlier, sapping nutrients out of the soil and stealing an outsized share of the sunlight as they dwarf native species. ¶While dealing with the impact of invasive species typically falls under the purview of local or regional authorities, combating climate change requires a worldwide effort. Virtually every nation in the world came together to sign the Paris climate agreement in 2015 aiming to curtail greenhouse gases and keep the average global temperature from climbing 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. But in June 2017, President Trump announced that the United States was pulling out of the accord. ",0

Earlier this year, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio sued Exxon and other oil companies for contributing to climate change, but the suit was dismissed.¶An Exxon spokesperson said there was no evidence to support the claims in the suit.¶""These  baseless allegations are a product of closed-door lobbying by special  interests, political opportunism and the attorney general's inability to  admit that a three-year investigation  has uncovered no wrongdoing,"" spokesperson Scott Silvestri said in an email.

"""Tornado Alley"" may be shifting to the densely-populated Southeast, study shows","

    ","¶The part of the country famous for its ""Tornado Alley"" may be in jeopardy of losing that distinction. A new study says the tornado threat zone may be spreading eastward, to the densely populated southeastern U.S., and that could lead to a ""threefold increase"" in disaster potential. One of the study's authors says climate change could be behind the shift, as drier air creeps into the Southeast.¶Such a shift would be good news the southern and western Plains states, but a threat to others. More tornadoes in a more vulnerable area is a recipe for disaster.¶The study, conducted by two severe-weather researchers, Harold Brooks of NOAA's National Severe Storms Laboratory in Oklahoma and Dr. Victor Gensini of Northern Illinois University, noted ""significant increasing trends (of tornadoes) in portions of Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas, Missouri and Illinois.""¶More in Climate Change¶The increased risk of disaster is due to a combination of factors, but greater vulnerability is apparently the biggest.¶In part, that vulnerability stems from the mid-South being more densely populated, meaning more people are exposed. In addition, there are more trees in the region and that, combined with wetter, ""rain-wrapped"" storms make the tornadoes harder to see.¶Tornadoes also happen more often at night in these areas.¶But potentially the most dangerous factor for the Southeast is the large number of weak-framed homes there. According to Gensini, half of tornado fatalities occur in weak-framed homes.¶Researchers say the shift eastward is being caused by the creeping of drier, desert air farther eastward in the Plains states. In Tornado Alley, the boundary between dry, desert air and warm, moist Gulf of Mexico air is famously called the Dry Line. That's where much of the severe weather originates. ¶But a recent study by Columbia University substantiates the movement of the so called ""100th meridian"" (100 degrees longitude) eastward over the past 100 years. Since severe weather forms in moist air, the eastward shift in tornadoes makes sense.¶Gensini told CBS News ""it's not a big jump to say that climate change is causing this shift east. The hypothesis and computer simulations support what we are observing and what we expect in the future."" ¶Climate change is projected to make the desert Southwest even drier. And this drier air will continue to move farther into Tornado Alley. At the same time, climate models predict more moisture and severe weather in the Gulf States.¶Gensini said that although ""as a scientist, you never want to say never,"" there is ""no supporting evidence"" that the cause for the shift is natural. ¶Storm chasers are noticing the shift, as well. ""Following it for the last 12 years, we have noticed more chasers having to chase further into rugged terrain east of the normal Tornado Alley,"" said Kory Hartman, owner of Severe Studios Storm Chasers. ""It seems to stay colder and drier in the spring, so you don't see as many early season outbreaks in Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas.""¶To address the question of whether ""this eastward shift is just a result of more people observing tornadoes,"" Brooks and Gensini examined the frequency of U.S. tornadoes and found it has remained relatively constant since the beginning of reliable record-keeping 40 years ago. That diminishes a possible link to reporting or data-recording errors.¶Although the study focuses on the increasing threat of tornado outbreaks east of the Mississippi, the study notes the southern Plains states still remain the Tornado Alley bulls-eye.",0

            Climate Diaries: Flying with NASA's Operation IceBridge - The hottest climate science in the world's coldest place - CBS News
    ",CBS News,"October 15, 2018, 8:57 AM","¶It can seem like flying across the surface of a distant, frozen planet, which you might expect from NASA. But this flight is a lot closer to home – just 1,500 feet above the most remote place on Earth: Antarctica, where the frozen wastes are becoming less frozen all the time. As NASA scientist John Sonntag says, they're not here for the view. ""It's because humanity, the nation and the race, basically, we need to know what's happening to the climate, and specifically to sea level,"" said Sonntag.¶And a lot of what's happening to sea level starts at the poles, where that ice is either liberated or sequestered … melted or frozen. ¶NASA's ""Operation IceBridge"" flies planes to Antarctica from South America to study how fast that continent's ice is melting.¶For a decade this time of year, NASA has been flying to Antarctica out of Punta Arenas, Chile, in a 50-year old DC8 jammed with high-tech equipment and highly-trained scientists: The world's hottest climate science in the world's coldest place. ¶Down below, it may look like just snow and ice, but this plane can see a lot more than the eye can see. It's got lasers and radars and cameras and even a gravity sensor, the most expensive thing on board, that can map the sea bed. ¶""I like to think about what we do, in a very simplified manner, is just taking a yardstick to the ice year after year,"" Sonntag said. ¶And that yardstick is not only finding less ice; it's finding that the ice melting is speeding up.¶Research stations on the ground can see the ice loss on a local scale. But you've got to get up in the air, says Joe MacGregor, the mission's chief scientist, to get the big picture.¶""Presently, the Antarctic ice sheet is discharging more than two Olympic-sized swimming pools worth of ice into the ocean every second,"" MacGregor said.  ¶At that rate, Antarctica alone could cause as much as six inches of sea-level rise this century. ""That's of clear concern to coastal communities, not just in the United States, but coastal countries around the world,"" MacGregor said.¶Why has the melting increased?  This flight flew over one area that seems to reveal part of the secret. Warming seas since the 1970s have turned what was once a thick, solid sheet of ice attached to the coast, the Wordie Ice Shelf, into a collection of icebergs linked by a thin film of ice.  ¶And that has allowed the massive Fleming Glacier behind it (which the ice sheet used to block) to flow into the ocean at at least twice as quickly.¶Correspondent Mark Philips asked, ""There's an ice shelf, it disintegrates, then what happens?""¶""Then what happens is the cork is out of the bottle, and the ice can accelerate for a while,"" MacGregor replied. ¶What used to seem so frozen and so permanent is now fluid and changing … fast.",0
Climate change provided high octane fuel for Hurricane Michael,"

    ","¶Sometimes connecting climate change to a specific weather event is difficult. With Hurricane Michael, it's not. ¶The science is easy: Earth's waters are getting warmer due to an increasing global temperature, and warmer waters fuel hurricanes. ¶Water temperatures in the far northern Gulf of Mexico were 3 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit  higher than normal for this time of year. Instead of water temperatures being near 80, they were in the mid-80s as Michael  moved over the Gulf and approached the Florida coast.¶More in Climate Change¶That's a huge difference. Even a small temperature bump in the ocean causes a tremendous addition of energetic heat and water vapor to a storm, meaning higher wind speeds and more storm surge. All other things being equal, a storm hovering above 85-degree water will become much stronger than a storm hovering above 80-degree water.¶Since the mid-1900s, Tropical Atlantic water temperatures have increased by 1 to 2 degrees Fahrenheit, and more in some spots. ¶To climate scientists, the link between warming waters -- and a warming planet -- and greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide is as clear as day. Carbon dioxide acts like a blanket, and as more of it is produced by humans through the burning of fossil fuels, the blanket gets thicker. Since 1850, carbon dioxide concentrations have increased 30 percent.¶According to Kevin Trenberth of the National Center For Atmospheric Research in Colorado, ocean heat has been accumulating due to global warming. In fact, the latest United Nations Inter Governmental Panel on Climate Change report said 93 percent of the excess heat produced by human-caused global warming is now stored in our oceans. ¶The water is not only warmer. It also stays warmer for longer. Water temperatures in the northern Gulf of Mexico should have cooled off more by now. They haven't.  ¶As a result, Michael -- a powerful Category 4 storm -- shattered late-season records. According to Colorado State University hurricane expert Philip Klotzbach, Hurricane Michael is the strongest storm on record to make U.S. landfall in October. It was also the strongest landfall on record for the Florida Panhandle. ¶Table of 10 strongest continental US landfalling #hurricanes on record as ranked by minimum sea level pressure at landfall.  #Michael ranks 3rd with a landfall pressure of 919 hPa. pic.twitter.com/JB8o1HREqO¶A satellite loop of Hurricane Michael shows the storm core becoming better organized and intensifying as it approached the northern Gulf Coast. That's not a common sight, especially late in the hurricane season. ¶I don't think this #GOES16 loop needs much of an explanation.. #Micheal pic.twitter.com/HD9NUzTRhT¶Between Monday and Wednesday, Michael's winds jumped 80 mph in 48 hours -- something called ""rapid intensification."" That occurs when a storm's winds increase by 35 mph in 24 hours. Michael exceeded that criteria. ¶Research shows that rapid intensification will become more common in the future. In a  2016 paper, leading climate scientist Kerry Emanuel of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said, ""the incidence of storms that intensify rapidly just before landfall could increase substantially by the end of this century.""¶Just two weeks ago, scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton, New Jersey, published a study using a state-of-the-art hurricane climate model. They found that rising sea surface temperatures due to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions will likely lead to a greater number of major hurricanes in the future. That is a consistent finding in most hurricane climate research. ¶""The chance of a category 4 or 5 is higher now than it was in the past,"" said Adam Sobel, a professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Science at Columbia University. ""And the likelihood for rapid intensification is increasing as well. Both of these were true for Hurricane Michael.""",0

    ","¶Exxon Mobil, the largest oil company in the U.S., is putting $1 million toward a lobbying campaign to back a carbon tax, throwing dollars into a political fight that has had Washington lawmakers at an impasse.¶Exxon has previously said it supports a carbon tax, as have competitors BP and Royal Dutch Shell, but this marks the first time an oil company in the U.S. has put money behind its pro-climate words, according to reports.¶The funds will go to Americans for Carbon Dividends, a group formed this summer to lobby for a carbon tax plan that was originally developed by eminent Republicans James Baker III and George Shultz. The utility Exelon, solar company FirstSolar and the American Wind Energy Association have also donated to the group.¶More in Climate Change¶The Exxon announcement comes amid a week of climate-change news. On Monday, two Americans shared the Nobel prize in economics for their works explaining the economics of climate change and technological innovation. And a United Nations science panel warned of ""life-or-death"" consequences if the world does not eliminate fossil-fuel technologies in the next decade. ¶The support of the oil industry is vital to the success of any climate legislation in Washington, experts note, because of Republican lawmakers' longstanding opposition to any carbon taxes. The Republican-controlled Congress has downplayed previous alarms about global warming, while President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris agreement on climate change last year.¶This summer, a Republican congressman from Florida introduced a carbon tax proposal the same month that House of Representatives passed a resolution condemning carbon taxes as harmful to the economy. There are signs the political ground could shift, however.¶Exxon has long come under criticism for its contribution to carbon emissions and its role in past campaigns to deny or cover up climate science. But in recent years, and as other developed nations slowly shift their carbon policies, oil companies have come around. Support for a carbon tax would also protect the oil giants from lawsuits that blame them for climate change, the Associated Press noted.¶Exxon's commitment of $1 million is equivalent to the revenue it makes every two minutes, Bloomberg reported. ¶An Exxon spokesman told the news outlet, ""we've been supportive of a revenue-neutral price on carbon for a decade"" -- meaning a tax that does not actually raise government revenues. ""Applying a uniform cost across the economy is consistent with our principles on how to manage the risk of climate change,"" the spokesman added.¶Meanwhile, some environmental advocates are calling for Exxon—and U.S. regulators—to go even further.¶""The frightening U.N. climate change report that just came out makes it clear that we need to eliminate fossil fuel usage as quickly as possible, or risk irreparable harm to the planet and everything on it,"" Tony Dutzik, associate director and senior policy analyst at the Frontier Group, told MoneyWatch in an email.

    ","¶WASHINGTON -- Preventing an extra single degree of heat could make a life-or-death difference in the next few decades for multitudes of people and ecosystems on this fast-warming planet, an international panel of scientists reported Sunday. But they provide little hope the world will rise to the challenge.¶The Nobel Prize-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued its gloomy report at a meeting in Incheon, South Korea.¶In the 728-page document, the U.N. organization detailed how Earth's weather, health and ecosystems would be in better shape if the world's leaders could somehow limit future human-caused warming to just 0.9 degrees Fahrenheit (a half degree Celsius) from now, instead of the globally agreed-upon goal of 1.8 degrees F (1 degree C). Among other things:¶""For some people this is a life-or-death situation without a doubt,"" said Cornell University climate scientist Natalie Mahowald, a lead author on the report.¶More in Climate Change¶Limiting warming to 0.9 degrees from now means the world can keep ""a semblance"" of the ecosystems we have. Adding another 0.9 degrees on top of that - the looser global goal - essentially means a different and more challenging Earth for people and species, said another of the report's lead authors, Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, director of the Global Change Institute at the University of Queensland, Australia.¶But meeting the more ambitious goal of slightly less warming would require immediate, draconian cuts in emissions of heat-trapping gases and dramatic changes in the energy field. While the U.N. panel says technically that's possible, it saw little chance of the needed adjustments happening.¶In 2010, international negotiators adopted a goal of limiting warming to 2 degrees C (3.6 degrees F) since pre-industrial times. It's called the 2-degree goal. In 2015, when the nations of the world agreed to the historic Paris climate agreement, they set dual goals: 2 degrees C and a more demanding target of 1.5 degrees C from pre-industrial times. The 1.5 was at the urging of vulnerable countries that called 2 degrees a death sentence.¶The world has already warmed 1 degree C since pre-industrial times, so the talk is really about the difference of another half-degree C or 0.9 degrees F from now.¶""There is no definitive way to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 above pre-industrial levels,"" the U.N.-requested report said. More than 90 scientists wrote the report, which is based on more than 6,000 peer reviews.¶""Global warming is likely to reach 1.5 degrees C between 2030 and 2052 if it continues to increase at the current rate,"" the report states.¶Deep in the report, scientists say less than 2 percent of 529 of their calculated possible future scenarios kept warming below the 1.5 goal without the temperature going above that and somehow coming back down in the future.¶The pledges nations made in the Paris agreement in 2015 are ""clearly insufficient to limit warming to 1.5 in any way,"" one of the study's lead authors, Joerj Roeglj of the Imperial College in London, said.¶""I just don't see the possibility of doing the one and a half"" and even 2 degrees looks unlikely, said Appalachian State University environmental scientist Gregg Marland, who isn't part of the U.N. panel but has tracked global emissions for decades for the U.S. Energy Department. He likened the report to an academic exercise wondering what would happen if a frog had wings.¶Yet report authors said they remain optimistic.¶Limiting warming to the lower goal is ""not impossible but will require unprecedented changes,"" U.N. panel chief Hoesung Lee said in a news conference in which scientists repeatedly declined to spell out just how feasible that goal is. They said it is up to governments to decide whether those unprecedented changes are acted upon.¶""We have a monumental task in front of us, but it is not impossible,"" Mahowald said earlier. ""This is our chance to decide what the world is going to look like.""¶To limit warming to the lower temperature goal, the world needs ""rapid and far-reaching"" changes in energy systems, land use, city and industrial design, transportation and building use, the report said. Annual carbon dioxide pollution levels that are still rising now would have to drop by about half by 2030 and then be near zero by 2050. Emissions of other greenhouse gases, such as methane, also will have to drop. Switching away rapidly from fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas to do this could be three to four times more expensive than the less ambitious goal, but it would clean the air of other pollutants. And that would have the side benefit of avoiding more than 100 million premature deaths through this century, the report said.¶""Climate-related risks to health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security and economic growth are projected to increase with global warming"" the report said, adding that the world's poor are more likely to get hit hardest.¶Princeton University climate scientist Michael Oppenheimer said extreme weather, especially heat waves, will be deadlier if the lower goal is passed.¶Meeting the tougher-to-reach goal ""could result in around 420 million fewer people being frequently exposed to extreme heat waves, and about 65 million fewer people being exposed to exceptional heat waves,"" the report said. The deadly heat waves that hit India and Pakistan in 2015 will become practically yearly events if the world reaches the hotter of the two goals, the report said.¶Coral and other ecosystems are also at risk. The report said warmer water coral reefs ""will largely disappear.""¶The outcome will determine whether ""my grandchildren would get to see beautiful coral reefs,"" Princeton's Oppenheimer said.¶For scientists there is a bit of ""wishful thinking"" that the report will spur governments and people to act quickly and strongly, one of the panel's leaders, German biologist Hans-Otto Portner said. ""If action is not taken it will take the planet into an unprecedented climate future.""",0
"Florence was the nation's second-rainiest storm in 70 years, meteorologist calculates","

    ","¶WASHINGTON -- Hurricane Florence was the nation's second-rainiest storm in 70 years, a top rainfall meteorologist calculated. Only last year's Hurricane Harvey rained more over a 14,000 square-mile area during a four-day time period, said Ken Kunkel, a meteorologist at the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration and North Carolina State University. ¶Scientists said climate change likely boosted rainfall totals for both storms. ¶Kunkel's preliminary analysis found more than 17.5 inches fell on average over five weather stations in the 14,000 square miles of the eastern Carolinas stretching from Fayetteville, North Carolina, to Florence, South Carolina. The amount is second to Harvey's 25.6 inches over the Gulf Coast, including the Houston area.¶More in Hurricane Florence¶""That's a lot of water,"" Kunkel said. ¶The third-rainiest storm was in March 2016 in northern Louisiana. The three rainiest and four of the top seven have all occurred in the last three years -- which Kunkel said is no coincidence. ¶Kunkel, who specializes in analyzing rain data from thousands of weather stations, based his work on rainfall since 1949 when recording became more widespread across the continental United States. Kunkel examined rainfall over a compact area -- 14,000 square miles, a figure based on latitude and longitude squares -- and larger areas such as 20,000, 30,000 and 80,000 square miles. ¶Florence's unusual amount was most noticeable on the smallest scale. ¶When the scientist looked at a bigger area, 20,000 square miles, Florence fell to seventh place behind Harvey, 1998's Hurricane Georges, the two Louisiana rainstorms, a 1962 northern California downpour and a 1994 Texas drenching. ¶The analysis has not been published or peer reviewed yet, but will be, Kunkel said. ¶It is ""not surprising -- but still terrifying -- that the two top ranked soakers happened over the past two years,"" said Pennsylvania State University climate scientist Michael Mann, who wasn't part of Kunkel's research but praised it. He said warmer oceans, more moisture and slower moving storms due in various ways to climate change make storms dump more rain. ¶The Carolina coast this week is still feeling the impact of Florence as flooding creates a slow-moving disaster. Rivers swollen by the relentless rains are still flooding homes and businesses in their paths as the water makes its way to the sea. ¶In one part of Conway, South Carolina, on Tuesday, some homes were surrounded by six feet of floodwater, CBS affiliate WBTW reported. ""These are all great people who pretty much lost everything,"" said Bob Joncas, whose home is in a Conway neighborhood.¶The Waccamaw River, which flows through the city and floods at 11 feet, was expected to crest on Wednesday at 21.7 feet. On Friday, it surpassed the previous record high of 17.9 feet set in 2016 by Hurricane Matthew.",0
Hurricane Florence crippled electricity and coal -- solar and wind were back the next day,"

    ","¶Nearly two weeks after Hurricane Florence swamped North and South Carolina, thousands of residents who get power from coal-fired utilities remain without electricity. ¶Yet solar installations, which provide less than 5 percent of North Carolina's energy, were up and running the day after the storm, according to electricity news outlet GTM. And while half of Duke Energy's customers were without power at some point, according to CleanTechnica, the utility's solar farms sustained no damage.¶Traditional energy providers have fared less well. A dam breach at the L.V. Sutton Power Station,  a retired coal-fired power plant near Wilmington, North Carolina, has sent coal ash flowing into a nearby river. Another plant near Goldsboro has three flooded ash basins, according to the Associated Press, while in South Carolina, floodwaters are reportedly threatening pits that contain ash, an industrial waste from burning coal. ¶More in Climate Change¶The lesson, according to environmentalists: Utilities' vulnerability to major storms underscores the urgency of shifting to energy that it is not only clean and renewable, but also more resilient.¶The cool thing about solar and wind energy farms is that when a hurricane hits them they don't spill toxic coal ash into drinking water, potentially sickening or killing countless people.¶""If the federal government doesn’t take action and doesn’t move in the right direction, we will not only be equally unprepared the next time a major storm hits, we’ll likely be less prepared."" —SELC's Geoff Gisler on #HurricaneFlorence response https://t.co/7O2eshwI0K @politico pic.twitter.com/3wcLIS0kjH¶The push comes in response to the Trump administration's move last year to prop up coal and nuclear plants under the argument that because they can store their fuel on-site, they can provide constant power and thus serve national security purposes. But Florence's shutting down of one nuclear plant and breaches of old coal ash ponds show that no source of power is immune, environmentalists say.  ¶The vast majority of power failures that happen during storms occur because transmission lines or substations get damaged -- not because fuel runs out. Above-ground lines, vulnerable to wind, rain and hail, can even fail during a thunderstorm, let alone a hurricane.¶A 2017 study by Rhodium Group, which examined all power outages between 2012 and 2016, found that essentially none were due to a lack of fuel to generate power. This scenario is repeating itself in Florence's aftermath, energy analysts said.  ¶The extreme flooding from Florence was another reason that power took time to come back, despite facilities like wind and solar farms remaining unscathed.¶""No electric company is going to power their lines when they're underwater,"" said Chris Burgess, projects director at the Rocky Mountain Institute. ""It's dangerous because you have transformers underwater, people's meters underwater, underground switchgear. The utility just needs time for the water to go down,"" he said.¶To Burgess, Florence -- and last year's hurricanes, in particular Maria -- make the case for ""distributed power,"" such as rooftop solar panels. ¶In Puerto Rico, although Maria took out the power grid, locations that had their own solar installations, including a farm and a community center, were able to stay open.¶""Solar is resilient -- there are a ton of cases where, as long as the roof stays attached, the solar array stays attached as well. That's the real takeaway,"" he said. Given its elevation, a rooftop solar installation has a better chance of survival than power lines or transformers closer to the ground.¶It's precisely after a storm that customer interest in solar spikes, several energy companies that operate in North and South Carolina said. ¶""Storm readiness and disaster preparedness, particularly in the Southeast, are major factors for people in going solar,"" said Tyson Grinstead, Southeast director of policy for Sunrun, a company that leases rooftop solar panels. ""As we see more and more storms, we're seeing more and more customers come to us and see what their options are to provide for themselves.""¶In Florida, Sunrun has had success with systems that include solar panels and a storage battery, Grinstead said. A battery acts much like a generator and can keep critical appliances running during a power outage. ¶Sunrun, which is the largest leased solar panel provider in South Carolina, reported no effects from Florence in that state. (The company doesn't operate in North Carolina.) NC Solar Now, the largest solar provider in North Carolina, also reported no issues during Florence. Yes Solar Solutions, which has close to 3,000 megawatts of solar installed in North Carolina, received several inquiries during the storm from customers wanting to install solar systems, GTM reported. Only six of the company's 800 customers reported problems after Florence. ¶""A hurricane can be either really good news for wind generation or too much of a good thing,"" said Wade Schauer, a research director at Wood Mackenzie Power and Renewables. North Carolina's only wind farm, the Amazon facility near Elizabeth, powered through the storm, even generating electricity through part of it. ¶""The wind farm experienced no damage and no noticeable water or drainage issues,"" said Paul Copleman, a spokesperson for Avangrid Renewables, which owns and runs the farm. The result would have been different if Florence had hit the farm directly, he noted -- the facility is in the northeastern part of the state, and Florence turned south along the coast. ¶A U.S. wind farm experienced a hurricane directly last year, when Hurricane Harvey shut down several wind facilities on the Gulf Coast of Texas. But they powered back up within days, The Wall Street Journal reported, while several refineries shut down and coal-fired power plants flooded.¶Hurricane-force winds do have the power to take apart wind turbines, as happened in China in 2013, but newer turbines are very wind-resistant, with one model designed to operate in a typhoon.¶""Major manufacturers are basically designing typhoon-rated wind turbines, for really, really heavy winds,"" said Burgess, pointing to examples in the North Sea. ""Anything installed in the last couple of years, they are very, very resistant to wind and extremely resistant to flooding,"" he said. ¶The need for more storm-resistant equipment is clear: More and more wind farms are being built near the coasts at the same time that storms become stronger and more frequent. ¶Still, because wind farms connect to a grid, they won't protect against the outages caused by transmissions breakdowns. That's another vote for battery power, Burgess said.¶""When transmission lines are down, it doesn't matter how many power plants you have,"" he said. ""What's more important at that moment is that your critical facilities -- hospitals, shelters, ATMs -- they have local power.""",0

Updated on:  September 14, 2018 / 5:02 PM
      / CBS News
    ","¶Climate change could be playing a role in slowing down storms like Hurricane Florence, resulting in more rainfall and flooding when they hit. According to meteorologist Jeff Berardelli, climate change appears to be affecting areas of high pressure in the atmosphere, which can slow down storms, while rising water temperatures can make them more intense. ¶""Air temperatures are higher, they can actually hold more water vapor, they drop more rain,"" Berardelli said. ""The estimates for Harvey last year from a bunch of scientific studies were anywhere from 15 percent to as much as — believe it or not — somewhere around 35 percent extra rain because of climate change."" ¶Asked about the possible impact on Florence, he acknowledged ""it's tough to know exactly."" But he explained, ""Climate change seems to be affecting the amount of blocking of areas of high pressure. So it looks like probably Florence is slowing down as a consequence, to some degree at least, from climate change. There is evidence to support that storm systems — hurricanes — are slowing down in the coastal plain due to climate change."" ¶More in Hurricane Florence¶Another factor, Berardelli said, is that with rising sea levels, storm surges increase. A powerful 10-foot storm surge left around 150 people stranded and waiting to be rescued in New Bern, North Carolina, Friday morning. ¶Florence's winds weakened to tropical storm strength Friday afternoon, but its torrential rain and storm surge remain life-threatening. More than 16 inches have already fallen in North Carolina, and the rainfall is far from over.¶""The record in North Carolina for the most rain ever produced by a tropical system is 24 inches. That is likely to be shattered,"" Berardelli said. ""That is a lot of rain and all that rain runs off into the rivers and we've been talking about this — there is elevation as you get further west into North Carolina. All that water that piles up in the hills and mountains, drains down into the river valley, so we're talking flash flooding.""¶More than 1 million people are under mandatory and voluntary evacuation orders due to Florence and more than 10 million people live in places under storm watches or warnings.

    ","¶North Carolina could find itself more vulnerable to damage from storms like Hurricane Florence due to a state law passed six years ago that banned using recent climate science to plan for the consequences of rising sea levels.¶Climate scientists had warned for years that North Carolina's low-lying coast left it open to intensifying floods and hurricanes that could cost the state billions of dollars in damage, declining property values and lost recreation and tourism near the end of the 21st century. Climate scientists have also projected that rises in sea levels will make coastal storms more damaging, since more water will flood land.¶But in 2012, state lawmakers responded by saying these studies could not be used for forecasts, arguing that the science wasn't solid enough to justify laws that could change property values. A Republican-led legislature pushed a bill that said projections for rising sea levels could only be based on historical data, rather than newer studies predicting problems for the future.¶More in Climate Change¶Republican State Rep. Pat McElraft, who sponsored the bill, said at the time that studies of rising sea levels ""used one model, the most extreme in the world.""¶""They need to use some science that we can all trust when we start making laws in North Carolina that affect property values on the coast,"" she said during a floor debate about the bill.¶Climate scientists and environmental groups immediately pushed back on the bill, warning that it would hold back any attempts to be proactive about climate change on North Carolina's coast. The North Carolina Coastal Federation, a nonprofit that helps protects the coast, said the bill ""undercuts"" years of work from the state's emergency managers ""to help prepare the state for hurricanes.""¶The bill even became the butt of a joke by comedian Stephen Colbert, a South Carolina native, who said in a 2012 episode of  ""The Colbert Report"" that it was like trying to ""predict the weather based on the last two weeks of fair weather.""¶""If your science gives you a result you don't like, pass a law saying the result is illegal. Problem solved,"" Colbert said.¶Then-Gov. Bev Perdue, a Democrat, neither signed nor vetoed the bill, which allowed it to become law. ¶Six years later, North Carolina is one of several Southern states bracing for Florence, which is expected to hit especially hard on the coast starting Thursday. The National Weather Service in Newport and Morehead City, along North Carolina's coast, said Florence could bring unprecedented levels of rainfall and flooding. ¶A retired Duke University coastal geologist wrote an op-ed for Raleigh's daily newspaper last week warning that the state had only set itself up for disaster.¶""We must take the long view and respond now to the rising sea in a planned fashion,"" Orrin H.

      / CBS/AP
    ","¶ROME -- The number of hungry people in the world is growing again, in large part due to climate change that is wreaking havoc on crop production in much of the developing world, the United Nations said Tuesday. Major U.N. agencies said in an annual report Tuesday that the number of hungry people facing chronic food deprivation increased to 821 million in 2017 from 804 million in 2016, reversing recent downward trends. ¶That accounts for one in every 9 people.¶""Hunger has been on the rise over the past three years, returning to levels from a decade ago,"" said a news release Tuesday on the report. ""This reversal in progress sends a clear warning that more must be done and urgently if the Sustainable Development Goal of Zero Hunger is to be achieved by 2030.""¶More in Climate Change¶South America and Africa showed the worst increase. ¶""This message today should frighten the world,"" said David Beasley, head of the World Food Program. Beasley, a Trump administration nominee, acknowledged that climate change as well as conflict were fueling the rise in malnutrition globally. ¶""Climate impact is real,"" he said, though he demurred when asked whether the cause was man-made. ¶Analysis in the report found that climate variability -- extreme droughts and floods -- are already undermining production of wheat, rice and maize in tropical and temperate regions, and that the trend is expected to worsen as temperatures increase and become more extreme. ¶The report called for policies to target groups most vulnerable to malnutrition, including infants, children, adolescent girls and women. It called for greater efforts to promote policies that help communities adapt to climate change and build resilience. ¶Poor progress has been made in reducing child stunting, the report says, with nearly 151 million children aged under five too short for their age due to malnutrition in 2017, compared to 165 million in 2012. Globally, Africa and Asia accounted for 39 percent and 55 percent of all stunted children, respectively.¶Beasley said if the world is failing today with a population at 7.5 billion and all the wealth and technology that is available, ""wait until people 30 years from now -- when we have 10 billion people, when people in London, in Washington, D.C., and Chicago and Paris -- when they don't have enough to eat."" ¶At the same time as hunger is increasing globally, rates of adult obesity are on the rise, most significantly in North America. Both undernutrition and obesity can exist in the same household, the report said, since poor access to affordable, nutritious food can increase risks for obesity. ¶Svetlana Axelrod, assistant director general for the World Health Organization, said breastfeeding can help early on to prevent obesity. The report found that rates of exclusive breastfeeding are 1.5 times higher in Africa and Asia than in North America, where only a quarter of infants under 6 months are exclusively fed by breast milk. ¶""Women should breastfeed as long as they can,"" she said. ¶Earlier this year, the U.S. faced criticism for opposing a WHO resolution to encourage breastfeeding, with critics accusing the Trump administration of embracing the interests of infant formula manufacturers. President Donald Trump said the administration opposed the resolution because it called for limits on promoting infant formula, not because it objected to breastfeeding.",0

    ","¶CHOUILLY, France — Winemaker Jean-Pierre Vazart has more than a dozen weather apps on his phone. And he's still stressed out.¶Pickers in France's northern Champagne region are scrambling to bring in yet another early harvest. Temperatures have risen 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.16 F) in 30 years. The creeping effects of climate change in, including chaotic weather, are becoming the new normal.¶For now, winemakers say they are benefiting from the warmer temperatures, with ripe grapes begging to be picked. But Vazart, 50, is worried a sudden hailstorm could devastate his succulent white grapes before the end of his 12-day harvest period, which began Monday. Rainstorms and hail compromised last year's less abundant Champagne harvest.¶More in Climate Change¶""The stress is with you ... until the last day,"" said Vazart from Chouilly, near Epernay, the epicenter of the Champagne region, which counts some 15,000 winegrowers.¶It's the fifth time in 15 years that the harvest — traditionally a September ritual that can run into October — has started so early, according to Comite Champagne, which groups all industry players.¶To counter the effects of global warming, scientists are planting the seeds of a small revolution in Champagne country: inseminating flowering grapes with pollen from lab plants to try to develop more weather-resistant varieties. If successful, the process would add to the seven authorized Champagne grape varieties — with Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and Meunier mainly used — to create the crisp, bubbly Champagne with its perfect mellow notes.¶Creating new grape varieties might once have been unthinkable in a land where each step of the Champagne-making process is rigidly codified. But grapes of the future — with new names but the taste of Champagne's ""terroir"" — are already being tested in three experimental vineyards. The projects, which began in 2014, may produce one or two new grape varieties, according to Arnaud Descotes, technical and environmental director of Comite Champagne.¶He stressed that results won't be known for at least a decade, and the grapes would be rejected if blind taste tests fail to ensure the bubbly is not corrupted.¶The Champagne region calls itself a pioneer of sustainable development, saying it's the first in the winegrowing world to measure its carbon footprint, which it said it reduced by 7 percent from 2003 to 2013. Officials are looking to lower greenhouse gases by 25 percent in 2025. Reducing the weight of the famously heavy Champagne bottles by 65 grams was among crucial measures.¶The region isn't unique in its experimental drive. Elsewhere in France, researchers are also seeking ways to create heat-friendly grapes and protect the country's wine industry, both a multibillion dollar export market and part of the national identity. And winemakers from South Africa to California say they are seeing the effects of climate change on their crop.¶In a taste-and-tell bid to show the effects of global warming on the famed wines of Bordeaux, in southwest France, a noted oenologue, biologist and winegrower created ""2050,"" his wine of the future. Pascal Chatonnet assembled standard varieties used in Bordeaux wines but from the French Mediterranean region of Languedoc-Roussillon and the North African nation of Tunisia.¶Tasted by the publication Science et Avenir, it was deemed drinkable but different, with tastes of red fruit but ""very ripe, a bit cooked, with a final short, chocolatey note."" Not Bordeaux.¶For Vazart, optimism is essential.¶""If we believed only the bad news, we'd change jobs now,"" he said.",0

Big oil asks government to protect its Texas facilities from climate change,"
","
August 22, 2018 / 3:04 PM
      / AP
    ","¶PORT ARTHUR, Texas -- As the nation plans new defenses against the more powerful storms and higher tides expected from climate change, one project stands out: an ambitious proposal to build a nearly 60-mile ""spine"" of concrete seawalls, earthen barriers, floating gates and steel levees on the Texas Gulf Coast. ¶Like other oceanfront projects, this one would protect homes, delicate ecosystems and vital infrastructure, but it also has another priority: to shield some of the crown jewels of the petroleum industry, which is blamed for contributing to global warming and now wants the federal government to build safeguards against the consequences of it. ¶The plan is focused on a stretch of coastline that runs from the Louisiana border to industrial enclaves south of Houston that are home to one of the world's largest concentrations of petrochemical facilities, including most of Texas' 30 refineries, which represent 30 percent of the nation's refining capacity. ¶More in Climate Change¶Texas is seeking at least $12 billion for the full coastal spine, with nearly all of it coming from public funds. Last month, the government fast-tracked an initial $3.9 billion for three separate, smaller storm barrier projects that would specifically protect oil facilities. ¶That followed Hurricane Harvey, which roared ashore last Aug. 25 and swamped Houston and parts of the coast, temporarily knocking out a quarter of the area's oil refining capacity and causing average gasoline prices to jump 28 cents a gallon nationwide. Many Republicans argue that the Texas oil projects belong at the top of Washington's spending list. ¶""Our overall economy, not only in Texas but in the entire country, is so much at risk from a high storm surge,"" said Matt Sebesta, a Republican who as Brazoria County judge oversees a swath of Gulf Coast. ¶But the idea of taxpayers around the country paying to protect refineries worth billions, and in a state where top politicians still dispute climate change's validity, doesn't sit well with some. ¶""The oil and gas industry is getting a free ride,"" said Brandt Mannchen, a member of the Sierra Club's executive committee in Houston. ""You don't hear the industry making a peep about paying for any of this and why should they? There's all this push like, 'Please Senator Cornyn, Please Senator Cruz, we need money for this and that.'"" ¶Normally outspoken critics of federal spending, Texas Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz both backed using taxpayer funds to fortify the oil facilities' protections and the Texas coast. Cruz called it ""a tremendous step forward."" ¶Federal, state and local money is also bolstering defenses elsewhere, including on New York's Staten Island, around Atlantic City, New Jersey, and in other communities hammered by Superstorm Sandy in 2012. ¶Construction in Texas could begin in several months on the three sections of storm barrier. While plans are still being finalized, some dirt levees will be raised to about 17 feet high, and 6 miles of 19-foot-tall floodwalls would be built or strengthened around Port Arthur, a Texas-Louisiana border locale of pungent chemical smells and towering knots of steel pipes. ¶The town of 55,000 includes the Saudi-controlled Motiva oil refinery, the nation's largest, as well as refineries owned by oil giants Valero Energy Corp. and Total S.A. There are also almost a dozen petrochemical facilities. ¶""You're looking at a lot of people, a lot of homes, but really a lot of industry,"" said Steve Sherrill, an Army Corps of Engineers resident engineer in Port Arthur, as he peered over a Gulf tributary lined with chunks of granite and metal gates, much of which is set to be reinforced. ¶The second barrier project features around 25 miles of new levees and seawalls in nearby Orange County, where Chevron, DuPont and other companies have facilities. The third would extend and heighten seawalls around Freeport, home to a Phillips 66 export terminal for liquefied natural gas and nearby refinery, as well as several chemical facilities. ¶The proposals approved for funding originally called for building more protections along larger swaths of the Texas coast, but they were scaled back and now deliberately focus on refineries. ¶""That was one of the main reasons we looked at some of those areas,"" said Tony Williams, environmental review coordinator for the Texas Land Commissioner's Office. ¶Oil and chemical companies also pushed for more protection for surrounding communities to shield their workforces, but ""not every property can be protected,"" said Sheri Willey, deputy chief of project management for the Army Corps of Engineers' upper Texas district. ¶""Our regulations tell us what benefits we need to include, and they have to be national economic benefits,"" Willey said. ¶Once work is complete on the three sections, they could eventually be integrated into a larger coastal spine system. In some places along Texas' 370-mile Gulf Coast, 18 feet is lost annually to erosion, threatening to suck more wetlands, roads and buildings into rising seas. ¶Protecting a wide expanse will be expensive. After Harvey, a special Texas commission prepared a report seeking $61 billion from Congress to ""future proof"" the state against such natural disasters, without mentioning climate change, which scientists say will cause heavier rains and stronger storms. ¶Texas has not tapped its own rainy day fund of around $11 billion. According to federal rules, 35 percent of funds spent by the Army Corps of Engineers must be matched by local jurisdictions, and the GOP-controlled state Legislature could help cover such costs. But such spending may be tough for many conservatives to swallow. ¶Texas ""should be funding things like this itself,"" said Chris Edwards, an economist at the libertarian Cato Institute. ""Texans are proud of their conservatism, but, unfortunately, when decisions get made in Washington, that frugality goes out the door."" ¶State officials counter that protecting the oil facilities is a matter of national security. ¶""The effects of the next devastating storm could be felt nationwide,"" Rep. Randy Weber, a fiercely conservative Republican from suburban Houston who has nonetheless authored legislation backing the coastal spine. ¶Major oil companies did not return messages seeking comment on funding for the projects. But Suzanne Lemieux, midstream group manager for the American Petroleum Institute, said the industry already pays into programs such as the federal Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund and the Waterways Trust Fund, only to see Congress divert that money elsewhere. ¶""Do we want to pay again, when we've already paid a tax without it getting used?

            Rising ocean water temperatures increase risk of Pacific hurricanes - CBS News

Last week, two hurricanes barreled through the Pacific, and there are new concerns that rising seawater temperatures could bring them closer to California.¶Irma, Harvey and Katrina are among the hurricanes that have ravaged the East Coast and the Gulf of Mexico. But in California, hurricanes are virtually unheard of.¶""I can't imagine that type of devastation hitting the shores here,"" said Jerry Cook, one San Diego resident.¶Hurricanes that form in the eastern Pacific Ocean usually don't make it past Baja, California.

"Number of ""marine heat waves"" roughly doubled between 1982 and 2016, study finds","

      / AP
    ","¶WASHINGTON -- Even the oceans are breaking temperature records in this summer of heat waves. Off the San Diego coast, scientists earlier this month recorded all-time high seawater temperatures since daily measurements began in 1916. ¶""Just like we have heat waves on land, we also have heat waves in the ocean,"" said Art Miller of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.  ¶Between 1982 and 2016, the number of ""marine heat waves"" roughly doubled, and likely will become more common and intense as the planet warms, a study released Wednesday found. Prolonged periods of extreme heat in the oceans can damage kelp forests and coral reefs, and harm fish and other marine life. ¶More in Climate Change¶""This trend will only further accelerate with global warming,"" said Thomas Frolicher, a climate scientist at the University of Bern in Switzerland, who led the research. ¶His team defined marine heat waves as extreme events in which sea-surface temperatures exceeded the 99th percentile of measurements for a given location. Because oceans both absorb and release heat more slowly than air, most marine heat waves last for at least several days -- and some for several weeks, said Frolicher. ¶""We knew that average temperatures were rising. What we haven't focused on before is that the rise in the average comes at you in clumps of very hot days -- a shock of several days or weeks of very high temperatures,"" said Michael Oppenheimer, a Princeton University climate scientist who was not involved in the study. ¶Many sea critters have evolved to survive within a fairly narrow band of temperatures compared to creatures on land, and even incremental warming can be disruptive. ¶Some free-swimming sea animals like bat rays or lobsters may shift their routines. But stationary organisms like coral reefs and kelp forests ""are in real peril,"" said Michael Burrows, an ecologist at the Scottish Marine Institute, who was not part of the research. ¶In 2016 and 2017, persistent high ocean temperatures off eastern Australia killed off as much as half of the shallow water corals of the Great Barrier Reef -- with significant consequences for other creatures dependent upon the reef. ¶""One in every four fish in the ocean lives in or around coral reefs,"" said Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, a marine biologist at the University of Queensland. ""So much of the ocean's biodiversity depends upon a fairly small amount of the ocean floor."" ¶The latest study in Nature relied on satellite data and other records of sea-surface temperatures including from ships and buoys. It didn't include the recent record-breaking measurements off Scripps Pier in San Diego -- which reached 79.5 degrees Fahrenheit on August 9. But Frolicher and Miller said the event was an example of a marine heat wave. ¶Miller said he knew something was odd when he spotted a school of bat rays, which typically only congregate in pockets of warm water, swimming just off the pier earlier this month. ¶Changes in ocean circulation associated with warmer surface waters will likely mean decreased production of phytoplankton, the tiny organisms that form the basis of the marine food web, he said. ¶Marine biologists nicknamed a patch of persistent high temperatures in the Pacific Ocean between 2013 and 2016 ""the Blob."" During that period, decreased phytoplankton production led to a cascading lack of food for many species, causing thousands of California sea lion pups to starve, said Miller, who had no role in the Nature study. ¶""We've repeatedly set new heat records. It's not surprising, but it is shocking,"" he said. ",0

Australia's most populous state now entirely in drought,"

    ","¶CANBERRA, Australia -- Australia's most populous state was declared entirely in drought on Wednesday and struggling farmers were given new authority to shoot kangaroos that compete with livestock for sparse pasture during the most intense dry spell in more than 50 years.  ¶Much of Australia's southeast is struggling with drought. But the drought conditions in the Australian state of New South Wales this year have been the driest and most widespread since 1965. ¶BBC News reports that New South Wales produces about twenty-five percent of Australia's agricultural output. Primary Industries Minister Niall Blair said farmers were enduring one of the driest Southern Hemisphere winters on record. Farm reservoirs have dried up and crops are failing.¶More in Climate Change¶""There isn't a person in the state that isn't hoping to see some rain for our farmers and regional communities,"" Blair said in a statement. ¶The federal and state governments have provided A$576m -- $430 million -- in emergency funding, according to the BBC. But it's not enough for many farmers. ¶With dry conditions forecast to continue for the next three months, farmers had to decide whether to continue the expensive and laborious task of hand-feeding cattle and sheep or sell their livestock. ¶The state government on Wednesday also lifted the number of kangaroos that farmers are allowed to shoot and reduced bureaucratic red tape facing land holders applying for permission to shoot. ¶The requirement to tag dead kangaroos to keep a tally of the number shot across the state had been dispensed with. ¶""Many farmers are taking livestock off their paddocks, only to then see kangaroos move in and take whatever is left,"" Blair said. ¶""If we don't manage this situation, we will start to see tens of thousands of kangaroos starving and suffering, ultimately leading to a major animal welfare crisis,"" he added. ¶But Ray Borda, president of the Kangaroo Industries Association of Australia, which represents commercial shooters who hunt kangaroos for meat and leather, raised animal welfare concerns about the regulation changes. ¶""Anybody on the land that will make a phone call to the Department of Environment can get permission to shoot almost whatever they want to shoot and it's unaudited and unchecked and that's our concern -- animal welfare,"" Borda told Australian Broadcasting Corp. ¶The government would have been better off subsidizing professional shooters to reduce kangaroo numbers more humanely, he said. ¶""We see this as probably the worst possible outcome for the kangaroo, but I've got to emphasize we do understand the plight that farmers are in,"" Borda said.¶While scientists are hesitant to attribute any individual weather event to rising carbon emissions, a main contributor to global warming, Australia's government has its eye on climate change when it comes to the availability of water resources in the region.¶""Australia's rainfall varies greatly from one year to the next and from one decade to the next, and is strongly influenced by large scale phenomena such as El Niño and La Niña,"" Australia's Department of the Environment and Energy says on its website. ""Despite this large natural variability, underlying longer-term trends are evident in some regions, and these are likely to be climate change related.""¶The department says southern Australia has seen ""significant drying,"" particularly from April to October. Between 1996 and 2015, rainfalls for Australia's southeast fell by about 11 percent since records started being kept in 1900. ¶The department says the recent drop in rainfall across southern Australia is associated with a trend in the region toward high atmospheric pressure -- a trend linked to shifting weather patterns. ¶""A recent attribution study shows extremely high pressures as seen across southeast Australia in August 2014 are more likely to occur in the future due to climate change,"" it says.¶The current drought on the continent extends beyond North South Wales, with over half of the neighboring state of Queensland also in drought, the BBC reported.  ¶""I don't know many people in rural New South Wales that ... don't think the climate is getting drier and rainfall is becoming more volatile,"" Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said in June.

""But if we continue to burn fossil fuels and put carbon pollution into the atmosphere, we are going to continue to warm the surface of the Earth. We're going to get worse and worse droughts and heat waves and superstorms and floods and wildfires.""¶Mann added that ""it's up to us"" whether to do something about it. Speaking on PBS NewsHour, he said that if we reduce carbon emissions and move away from the burning of fossil fuels, we can prevent these changes from continuing to worsen.¶More in Climate Change¶Carbon emissions are a primary driver of climate change, which amplifies the threat of wildfires by creating ideal settings for them to burn, explains Climate Nexus. Climate change is affecting conditions in both our summers and winters in ways that contribute to wildfires.¶""Dry periods become more extreme. Wet periods become more extreme,"" LeRoy Westerling, a professor of management at the University of California, Merced, who has studied how climate affects wildfires, told CBS News last year.¶""Climate change is kind of turning up the dial on everything,"" he said.¶More precipitation in the winter means that more vegetation can grow in the spring. That vegetation can then dry out in the heat and fuel the flames if a blaze ignites.¶""Warmer temperatures and drier conditions increase the chances of a fire starting and encourage it to spread,"" says Climate Nexus, a communications group that focuses on climate change and clean energy. ""These conditions also contribute to the spread of the mountain pine beetle and other insects that can weaken or kill trees, building up the fuels in a forest.""¶As of Tuesday, large fires were burning across 14 U.S. states, where over 1.5 million acres have burned, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. In California, a pair of blazes known as the Mendocino Complex Fire grew this week into the largest wildfire in the state's history.¶Wildfires aren't the only extreme weather-related events seen in recent weeks. Heavy rains have inundated parts of the U.S. East Coast, and heat waves around the world have set multiple temperature records.¶A group of leading climate scientists warned in an article published this week in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that the Earth is at risk of being driven into ""hothouse"" state from which it cannot recover.¶""Our study suggests that human-induced global warming of 2°C may trigger other Earth system processes, often called 'feedbacks', that can drive further warming — even if we stop emitting greenhouse gases,"" lead author Will Steffen, from the Australian National University and Stockholm Resilience Centre, said in a news release. Once that threshold is crossed, the ""Hothouse Earth"" would reach temperatures never seen in human history.¶The impact on human societies ""would likely be massive, sometimes abrupt, and undoubtedly disruptive,"" the authors write.¶Mann, the Penn State climate scientist, said ""we're walking out onto a minefield.""¶""As we continue to move forward onto that minefield, as we continue to burn fossil fuels, we're likely to encounter more and more extreme and damaging and irreversible impacts on our climate,"" he said on PBS NewsHour.¶But he said it's not too late for changes to be made.¶""The only sensible thing to do is to stop walking forward on to that minefield,"" he said. ""And we can do it. We can move away from the burning of fossil fuels. The Paris agreement has set a course for us that, if we follow, and if we improve on that agreement in the years ahead, we can prevent the worst impacts of climate change from occurring.""¶Stefan Becket contributed to this report.",0

            Why the endangered green sea turtle is losing its male population - CBS News

The turtles nearly vanished 40 years ago in Florida, but a coordinated effort by conservationists, government agencies and volunteers brought the animals back from the brink. Now, the males of the species seem to be disappearing, CBS News' Mark Strassmann reports.¶In a beachfront ritual that dates back more than 100 million years, CBS News came upon a 300-pound green sea turtle covering her beach nest, burying maybe 100 eggs or more. ¶Biologist Jeanette Wyneken directs Florida Atlantic University's marine lab, and has studied Florida's sea turtle population since 2002. She's alarmed by what she doesn't see in her tanks of hatchlings.¶""We're seeing fewer and fewer and fewer years where we find males, so seven out of the last ten years, we have not found any males,"" she said. ""Not a single one.""¶It's not genetics that determine a sea turtle's sex, it's the temperature of the sand. The tipping point is roughly 85 degrees for a species that's predominantly female. ¶""If it's too warm you don't get boys. If it's too cool, you don't get girls. So it's the hot chicks and the cool dudes,"" Wyneken said.¶She says the nests are getting warmer because of the weather and climate change.¶As Florida's beaches get hotter, species are showing signs of shutting down -- sea turtles, and possibly alligators, another reptile whose eggs skew female and whose sex is determined by nest temperatures.¶On a rooftop at the University of North Florida, biologist Adam Rosenblatt has built 20 nests, of 20 alligator eggs each. Plastic will artificially warm the nests by five-point-five degrees, which is how much hotter north Florida's expected to be by the end of the century. ¶""If it's happening in sea turtles, my thought was it could be happening in alligators as well and it could throw off that balance between males and females,"" Rosenblatt said.¶Back in Wyneken's lab, she uses a mini-camera to determine their sex after they reach six weeks old. ¶""So I have to wait until they're big enough for me to sort of – look under their skirts,"" Wyneken said.¶Monday night, her team released hundreds of hatchlings into the sea, to the admiration of dozens of turtle fans. She knows the odds are already long for this prehistoric species, more so now that climate change is in play.¶""There's some resilience in there that we scientists may not have discovered and then there's a part of us that says, 'Things are changing so fast compared to what's happened in the past, that resilience may not be enough,'"" Wyneken said.¶Sea turtles don't reach sexual maturity until they're at least 25 years old, so the impact of disappearing male hatchlings may not be known for another generation.",0

    ","¶For the second year in a row, July in California's Death Valley National Park snagged the award for the ""hottest month ever."" Congratulations to this national treasure that is truly an unstoppable inferno.¶The finding was first reported in Forbes magazine Tuesday, in an article by Brian Brettschneider, a climate scientist at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks. The World Meteorological Organization has yet to confirm Brettschneider's assessment, but considering the data, that group will likely agree.¶While many of us sweated out (and probably complained about) temperatures of over 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32.2 degrees Celsius) last month across much of the U.S., Death Valley's Furnace Creek weather station recorded an average temperature of 108.1 degrees F (42.2 degrees C), according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's temperature database, xmACIS2. To add to the misery, a whopping 21 days in July saw maximum temperatures of 120 degrees F (48.9 degrees C) or higher in Death Valley. While unusual, that stretch of days is, surprisingly, not a record for this area; 29 days in July 1917 reached temperatures of 120 degrees F (48.9 degrees C) or higher.¶Death Valley is no stranger to extreme weather, thanks to the area's below-sea-level elevation and the Sierra Nevada mountain range, which prevents rain from reaching the region. In fact, the all-time hottest temperature ever measured on Earth came on July 10, 1913, when Death Valley hit a sizzling 134 degrees F (56.7 degrees C).¶More in Climate Change¶But now, for the first time, Death Valley has broken the record for hottest monthly temperature anywhere in the world two years in a row. Last July, the average temperature was 107.4 degrees F (41.9 degrees C). Brettschneider predicts that this is a pattern and said record temperatures will routinely surpass these marks in coming years.¶So, is this a result of climate change, or is it simply natural variability in an already-extreme landscape?¶""I think it's a little bit of both,"" said Marshall Shepherd, a climate scientist at the University of Georgia. ""Extreme heat is one of the things that we can pin down to climate change with a high degree of certainty,"" Shepherd told Live Science. But natural variability is still happening within this warming trend, he said.¶Shepherd compared the situation to a baseball player who has a natural ability for hitting lots of home runs, ""but then you add in steroids and you give him a boost."" In other words, climate change is like a super-effective steroid for Death Valley's natural ability to turn into a scorching-hot furnace every summer.¶What's more, said Shepherd, when considering Death Valley's blistering heat in the context of record-high temperatures around the world this year, ""it's clear to me that we cannot write off extreme heat events as natural chance anymore.""¶This article originally appeared on Live Science.",0

    ","¶WASHINGTON -- The dirt on the ground is making climate change worse, a new study finds. Plants capture massive amounts of carbon, pumping it into the soil, where usually it stays for hundreds or thousands of years.¶Observations from across the globe show that as temperatures have warmed, bacteria and fungi in the soil are becoming more active. These turbo-charged microbes are feeding on dead leaves and plants, releasing more heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the air, according to a study in Wednesday's journal Nature.¶Scientists call it a vicious cycle of warming. Burning of coal, oil and natural gas heats the air and soil, which worsens warming.¶More in Climate Change¶This uncontrolled cycle speeds up and amplifies climate change, said Jerry Melillo of the Marine Biological Laboratory in Massachusetts, who wasn't part of the study.¶Researchers found a significant increase in the amount of carbon since the 1990s coming out of microbes when compared to other releases of carbon. They analyzed sensor readings, soil measurements, plant growth data and satellite observations in what's the most comprehensive study yet of the  climate change impacts of soil.¶""The world really is showing an effect here,"" said lead researcher Ben Bond-Lamberty of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. ""It's a fingerprint of climate change.""¶Overall, soil releases about nine times more carbon than human-caused activities, but that's part of a natural cycle when the amount of carbon released into the air is about equal to the carbon taken out by oceans and plants. Fossil fuel emissions knock the atmosphere out of balance by putting more in than comes out. Heated soil releases more carbon, further putting the cycle out of whack, Bond-Lamberty said.¶Scientists said as the world continues to warm, the soil will release yet more carbon that it has been holding.¶If something isn't done, ""we are really in trouble,"" said Rattan Lal of Ohio State University, who wasn't part of the study. He added that proper soil conservation techniques -- such as avoiding plowing, off-season cover crop and leaving crop residue on the ground -- can help keep more of the carbon in the soil.",0
Earth's largest colony of king penguins falls by nearly 90 percent,"
","
July 31, 2018 / 12:23 PM
      / AFP
    ","¶The planet's largest colony of king penguins has declined by nearly 90 percent in three decades, alarmed researchers said Monday.¶The last time scientists set foot on France's remote Ile aux Cochons, roughly halfway between the tip of Africa and Antarctica, the island was blanketed by two million of the flightless birds, which stand about three feet tall. But recent satellite images and photos taken from helicopters show the population has collapsed, with barely 200,000 remaining, according to a study published in Antarctic Science.¶King penguins are homebodies. While adults will set to sea for days at a time foraging for food, the species does not migrate. Why the colony on Ile aux Cochon has been so decimated remains a mystery.¶More in Climate Change¶""It is completely unexpected, and particularly significant since this colony represented nearly one third of the king penguins in the world,"" said lead author Henri Weimerskirch, an ecologist at the Centre for Biological Studies in Chize, France, who first set eyes on the colony in 1982.¶Climate change may play a role. In 1997, a particularly strong El Nino weather event warmed the southern Indian Ocean, temporarily pushing the fish and squid on which king penguins depend south, beyond their foraging range.¶""This resulted in population decline and poor breeding success"" for all the king penguin colonies in the region, Weimerskirch said.¶El Ninos are cyclical events that occur every two to seven years. But they can be amplified by global warming, which itself produces many of the same results, albeit on a longer timescale.¶Indeed, Weimerskirch and colleagues showed in an earlier study that climate change, on its current trajectory, will likely make the Iles Crozet, the archipelago that contains Ile aux Cochon, unviable for king penguins by mid-century. Migration is not an option because there are no other suitable islands within range.¶Other factors may be contributing to the decline of the Ile aux Cochon colony, including overcrowding.¶""The larger the population, the fiercer the competition between individuals,"" noted a statement from France's National Centre for Scientific Research, which funded the study.¶""The repercussions of lack of food are thus amplified and can trigger an unprecedented rapid and drastic drop in numbers.""¶But this so-called ""density-dependent effect"" can also be made worse by climate change, the study notes.¶Another possible culprit is avian cholera, which has affected seabirds on nearby Marion and Amsterdam Islands, including some king penguins. But until Weimerskirch and other researchers return to Ile aux Cochons, hopefully, he said, in early 2019, they won't know for sure. It is also possible that invasive species such as rats, mice or cats, have found their way onto the island.¶King penguins are the second-largest penguin species after the emperor. They do not make a nest, but rather lay one egg at a time and carry it around on their feet covered with a flap of abdominal skin, called a brood patch. Parents take turns incubating the egg, switching every couple of weeks over a two-month period.¶There are two sub-species of kings. Aptenodytes patagonica patagonicus inhabits the Falklands and South Georgia Island, while Aptenodytes patagonica halli resides in the southernmost reaches of Indian Ocean and South Pacific.",0

""We find that global warming has increased the odds of record-setting hot events over more than 80 percent of the planet, and has increased the odds of record-setting wet events at around half of the planet."" ¶Climate change is making the world warmer because of the build-up of heat-trapping gases from the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil and other human activities. And experts say the jet stream -- which dictates weather in the Northern Hemisphere -- is again behaving strangely. ¶""An unusually sharply kinked jet stream has been stuck in place for weeks now,"" said Jeff Masters, director of the private Weather Underground. He said that allows the heat to stay in place over three areas where the kinks are: Europe, Japan and the western United States. ¶The same jet stream pattern caused the 2003 European heat wave, the 2010 Russian heat wave and fires, the 2011 Texas and Oklahoma drought and the 2016 Canadian wildfires, Pennsylvania State University climate scientist Michael Mann said, pointing to past studies by him and others. He said in an email that these extremes are ""becoming more common because of human-caused climate change and in particular, the amplified warming in the Arctic."" ¶Climate scientists have long said they can't directly link single weather events, like a heat wave, to human-caused climate change without extensive study. In the past decade they have used observations, statistics and computer simulations to calculate if global warming increases the chances of the events. ¶A study by European scientists Friday found that the ongoing European heat wave is twice as likely because of human-caused global warming, though those conclusions have not yet been confirmed by outside scientists. The World Weather Attribution team said they compared three-day heat measurements and forecasts for the Netherlands, Denmark and Ireland with historical records going back to the early 1900s. ¶""The world is becoming warmer and so heat waves like this are becoming more common,"" said Friederike Otto, a member of the team and deputy director of the Environmental Change Institute at the University of Oxford. ¶Erich Fischer, an expert on weather extremes at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich who wasn't part of the analysis said the authors used well-established methods to make their conclusions. ¶Georgia Tech climate scientist Kim Cobb said the link between climate change and fires isn't as strong as it is with heat waves, but it is becoming clearer. ¶In the United States on Friday, there were 89 active large fires consuming nearly 900,000 acres, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. The Carr Fire in Northern California has burned hundreds of homes and is threatening thousands of other structures. The blaze began Monday as a small wildfire and erupted into a living hellscape, CBS News' Carter Evans reported from the city of Redding. ¶""It's like a war zone,"" one woman said. ""It's just like a bomb just hit each house and just exploded.""¶So far this year, fires have burned 4.15 million acres, which is nearly 14 percent higher than average over the past 10 years.   ¶In Greece, a devastating fire this month -- with at least 83 fatalities -- is the deadliest fire in Europe since 1900, according to the International Disaster Database run by the Centre for the Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters in Brussels, Belgium. ¶CBS News correspondent Seth Doane met 74-year-old Maria Nikolaou as she tried to start cleaning up on Wednesday in Greece. The fast-moving wildfire tore through her neighborhood. Her car was gutted, and in minutes her whole neighborhood was consumed.¶""Trees were falling everywhere, I was so scared,"" she said. ¶The first major science study to connect greenhouse gases to stronger and longer heat waves was in 2004. It was titled ""More intense, more frequent and longer lasting heat waves in the 21st century."" ¶Study author Gerald Meehl of the National Center for Atmospheric Research said Friday that now it ""reads like a prediction of what has been happening and will continue to happen as long as average temperatures continue to rise with ever-increasing emissions of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels. It's no mystery.""",0

"Who is Andrew Wheeler, Scott Pruitt's replacement at the EPA?","
","
July 5, 2018 / 5:01 PM
      / CBS/AP
    ","¶WASHINGTON -- Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt resigned Thursday amid a number of scandals. President Trump said on Twitter he accepted Pruitt's resignation and announced that Pruitt's deputy at the EPA, Andrew Wheeler, will serve as acting administrator starting Monday. ¶Wheeler, a former coal industry lobbyist, was confirmed as Pruitt's No. 2 in April despite complaints from Democrats that Wheeler helped lead a fight by the coal industry to block regulations that protect Americans' health and begin to address climate change.  ¶In April, Jeff Turrentine, the Culture & Politics columnist at The National Resources Defense Council's magazine onEarth, wrote: ""If you're hoping Wheeler could represent some sort of departure from Pruitt's (literal) scorched-earth agenda, he wouldn't.""  ¶I have accepted the resignation of Scott Pruitt as the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Within the Agency Scott has done an outstanding job, and I will always be thankful to him for this. The Senate confirmed Deputy at EPA, Andrew Wheeler, will...¶...on Monday assume duties as the acting Administrator of the EPA. I have no doubt that Andy will continue on with our great and lasting EPA agenda. We have made tremendous progress and the future of the EPA is very bright!¶Until his nomination by President Trump last fall, Wheeler worked as a lobbyist with a client list that included Murray Energy, one of the nation's largest coal mining companies. He accompanied Murray CEO Robert ""Bob"" Murray during a series of closed-door meetings to lobby the Trump administration to kill environmental regulations affecting coal mines. ¶More in Climate Change¶""Andrew Wheeler's coal credentials are without equal. He is, without question, a member of the coal industry's Hall of Fame,"" Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., said in April. ¶""Sadly, I am concerned that Andrew Wheeler's background means that he will never understand that saving coal is not the job of the EPA,"" Markey added. ""It is the EPA's job to regulate coal to protect public health and the environment."" ¶Republicans earlier this year countered that Wheeler, 53, was well-qualified to lead the agency, having worked at the EPA early in his career and serving as Republican staff chief of the Senate Environment Committee before becoming a lobbyist nine years ago. ¶Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, chairman of the Senate environment panel, had said Wheeler demonstrated his commitment to sound environmental policies and has ""exemplified excellence in his professional endeavors,"" both in government and in the private sector. ¶During his confirmation hearing to become the No. 2 at the EPA, senators asked Wheeler about the meeting with the Trump administration on behalf of Murray Energy during a hearing last November. Wheeler acknowledged he attended but said he couldn't remember any details. ¶Photos later emerged that showed Wheeler sitting at the table during an undisclosed meeting where Murray handed Energy Secretary Rick Perry a four-page ""action plan"" to revive the nation's struggling coal industry. The Trump administration later carried out several of the recommended actions. ¶Like Pruitt, Wheeler has expressed public skepticism about the consensus of climate scientists that the continued burning of fossil fuels is the primary cause of global warming.

How wineries from Oregon to France are adapting to climate change,"
","
June 28, 2018 / 12:04 PM
      / AP
    ","¶DALLAS, Ore. -- When an Oregon valley famed for its wine heats up under the afternoon sun, Pacific Ocean winds rush through a dip in the mountains, cooling the grapes in Jeff Havlin's vineyards. The Van Duzer Corridor, the lowest point in Oregon's Coast Range, has become a go-to place for wineries and vineyards hedging their bets against climate change. Winemakers and vineyard owners in a 95-square-mile section of the corridor have applied to become the newest American Viticultural Area, with the wind its predominant feature. ¶""When the temperature drops, you need a jacket in August,"" said Havlin, who on a recent afternoon was driving a utility vehicle through his vineyards. ¶From South Africa's drought-stricken vineyards, to France's noble chateaus, to sunny vineyards in Australia and California , growers and winemakers say they are seeing the effects of climate change as temperatures rise, with swings in weather patterns becoming more severe. ¶More in Climate Change¶So they are taking action -- moving to cooler zones, planting varieties that do better in the heat, and shading their grapes with more leaf canopy. ¶As areas once ideal for certain grapes become less viable, causing earlier harvests and diminished wine quality as grapes ripen faster, once-iffy sites like the Van Duzer Corridor are coming into their own. ¶Northern California's Petaluma Gap, which like the Van Duzer Corridor sucks in ocean breezes, was designated one of America's newest viticultural areas in December. Receiving an American Viticulture Area designation allows winemakers to emphasize the unique characteristics of their wine, determined by climate, geography, soil and other factors. ¶""Even though we have those heat waves just like Napa and Sonoma, we still have the cool breeze in the afternoon and the cooler temperatures at night and the fog in the morning,"" said Ria D'Aversa, director of ranch operations at McEvoy Ranch, a Petaluma Gap vineyard. ¶The area's slogan: ""From wind to wine."" ¶California winemaker Ehren Jordan said: ""People would have looked at you like you had three heads if, 30 years ago, you told someone you were going to grow wine grapes there."" ¶His Failla winery, based in the Napa Valley, recently bought 80 acres in the Van Duzer Corridor and opened a winery nearby. The corridor now has a half-dozen wineries and at least 17 commercial vineyards, with more on the way. ¶Grapevines can tolerate heat and drought, and dry farming is traditionally practiced in parts of Europe. But the past four years have been the planet's hottest on record, and more warming is expected. Even minor weather variations that occur vintage to vintage can change the grapes' sugar, acid and tannin content, affecting the wine's taste and characteristics. ¶Familia Torres, a major wine producer based in Spain with wineries in California and Chile, bought land 4,000 feet high in the Pyrenees foothills as an investment in cooler climates. ¶Average temperatures at the company's vineyards have risen 1 degree Celsius (1.8 Fahrenheit) over 40 years, with the result that harvests are now about 10 days earlier than 20 years ago, company president Miguel A. Torres said in an email. ¶Torres called climate change a ""very serious worldwide problem"" for winemakers and said that, beyond changing viticulture practices, they should also try to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. ¶Severe drought in South Africa's Western Cape caused a 15 percent drop in the grape harvest, officials announced in May, saying wine prices will likely go up as a consequence. A predicted long-term drying trend has serious implications for South Africa's wine industry, said Wanda Augustyn of VinPro, which represents the nation's wine producers and stakeholders. ¶""In the longer term, producers will have to look at quality, drought-resistant vines which produce more flavor, acidity and intensity, but have lower water needs,"" Augustyn said. ¶Winemakers are starting to set up in Brittany, France's northwesternmost region, which previously was undesirable because of Atlantic wind, rain and lack of sunshine. ¶These days, vineyards are even planted as far north as Sweden. ¶Greg Jones, one of the world's authorities on climate change and wines, will be there this summer as a keynote speaker at the VitiNord wine conference, which will examine cooler-climate wine production. Sixteen cool climate regions warmed by 2.52 degrees Fahrenheit (1.4 Celsius) from the late 1800s through 2015, Jones noted at an earlier conference. ¶""If things keep going the way they're going, then we have some real challenges,"" Jones said. ""If you're growing grapes in a given environment today with what we have going on out there, you should be trying other varieties in small numbers to see how they perform."" ¶While the warming trend is pushing some hotter wine regions out of optimum temperature range, it has made places like Oregon more suitable, particularly for pinot noir, a finicky, thin-skinned grape. ¶When the pinot noir pioneers arrived in Oregon from California in the 1960s, they had to contend with shorter growing seasons, more frost, winter freezes and more rain during harvest time, Jones said. They adjusted their farming techniques, and the climate became milder. ¶Now, ""we're in the sweet spot,"" Jones said in his office in Linfield College in McMinnville, Oregon, where he is director of wine education and a professor of environmental studies. ¶But eventually, if the trend continues, that perfect intersection between the weather and the grape clones being used today will fade. ¶Willamette Valley Vineyards, just south of Salem, Oregon, is already preparing for that. The winery began growing grapes in the cooler Eola-Amity Hills, northwest of Salem, in 2007. It is also grafting different root stocks onto vines to produce pinot noir and chardonnay clones that perform better in longer, hotter growing seasons and that go deeper into the soil, making them more drought-resistant. ¶""When you plant, you won't get your first crop for four years, and your first wines in six years. And you won't know if it's a really great site for maybe 20 years,"" said winery director Christine Collier Clair. ""So when planting, you shouldn't be thinking about what's good for me now. You need to look pretty far out."" ¶As she spoke, customers enjoyed glasses of wine on a deck with a view of vineyards budding in the spring sunshine, the forested mountains of the Coast Range beyond. ¶""It's our goal to keep this winery going for centuries to come,"" Clair said. ""We've been on this property for 37 years, and we want to be a winery that has sustained, just like some of the French chateaus have been there since the 1600s."" ",0
Judge rules Big Oil can't be sued for climate change costs,"
","
June 26, 2018 / 9:08 AM
      / AP
    ","¶SAN FRANCISCO - A U.S. judge who held a hearing about climate change that received widespread attention ruled Monday that Congress and the president were best suited to address the contribution of fossil fuels to global warming. So he threw out lawsuits that sought to hold big oil companies liable for the Earth's changing environment.¶Noting that the world has also benefited significantly from oil and other fossil fuel, Judge William Alsup said questions about how to balance the ""worldwide positives of the energy"" against its role in global warming ""demand the expertise of our environmental agencies, our diplomats, our Executive, and at least the Senate.¶""The problem deserves a solution on a more vast scale than can be supplied by a district judge or jury in a public nuisance case,"" he said.¶More in Climate Change¶Alsup's ruling came in lawsuits brought by San Francisco and neighboring Oakland that accused Chevron (CVX), Exxon Mobil (XOM), ConocoPhillips (COP), BP (BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A) of long knowing that fossil fuels posed serious risks to the environment, but still promoting them as environmentally responsible.¶The lawsuits said the companies created a public nuisance and should pay for sea walls and other infrastructure to protect against the effects of climate change -- construction that could cost billions of dollars.¶The Oakland city attorney's offices did not immediately have comment. John Cote, a spokesman for the San Francisco city attorney's office, said the office was reviewing the ruling and would decide its next steps ""shortly,"" but the lawsuit had ""forced a public court proceeding on climate science.""¶""We're pleased that the court recognized that the science of global warming is no longer in dispute,"" he said.¶New York City, several California counties and at least one other California city filed similar suits.¶In their defense, the companies said federal law controlled fossil fuel production, and Congress encouraged oil and gas development. The harm the cities claimed was ""speculative"" and part of a complex chain of events that included billions of oil and gas users and ""environmental phenomena occurring worldwide over many decades,"" they said in court documents.¶National Association of Manufacturers President and CEO Jay Timmons applauded the ruling in a statement. ""From the moment these baseless lawsuits were filed, we have argued that the courtroom was not the proper venue to address this global challenge,"" said Timmons.¶Alsup brought in the world's leading experts on climate change at an unusual hearing in March that he said was intended to educate him about the science behind the Earth's warming.¶The nearly five-hour hearing covered topics including the history of climate change research, carbon dioxide's role as a greenhouse gas, melting ice caps, rising sea levels and extreme weather.¶In Monday's ruling, the judge said he accepted the ""vast scientific consensus"" that the combustion of fossil fuels has contributed to global warming and rising sea levels. But he questioned whether it would be fair to ""ignore our own responsibility in the use of fossil fuels and place the blame for global warming on those who supplied what we demanded.""",0

            The governor who's castigating the president on climate change - CBS News
    ",,,"¶Our country is divided between red states and blue states, a division that has intensified since the election of President Donald Trump and some of the blue states are intensifying their resistance to the president. Most prominently, California, the country's bluest and most populous state, led by Governor Jerry Brown. Brown has been governor of California twice - the first time, 40 years ago. He criticizes the president on taxes. California is suing the Trump administration over health care, immigration, and air quality, but nothing raises more righteous passion in Jerry Brown than the issue of climate change. As we first reported last fall, he castigates the president for denying the science and aggravating a problem Governor Brown says is causing California to burn.¶California suffered its most destructive fire season on record last year. Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency in December as raging wildfires, whipped by fierce Santa Ana winds and fueled by bone-dry brush, laid waste to tens-of-thousands of acres in Southern California. The smoke plume that shrouded the Los Angeles area could be seen from space. The fires that ravaged California's famed wine country in October were the deadliest the state has ever seen. Whole neighborhoods were incinerated. Dozens of people were killed.¶Governor Jerry Brown: The fire season used to be a few months in the summer, now it's almost year-long. These fires are unprecedented. We've never seen anything like it. Scientists are telling us, ""This is the kind of stuff that's gonna happen."" And we gotta deal with it.¶It's going to happen, he says, based on science that predicts extreme swings in weather patterns. Last year, Southern California experienced record heat in October and November, creating the perfect conditions for this.¶Governor Jerry Brown: Nature is not a political game. Nature is the ground on which we stand, it's the air which we breathe. The truth of the case is that there's too much carbon being emitted, that heat-trapping gases are building up, the planet is warming and all hell is breaking loose.¶Bill Whitaker: President Trump has famously called climate change -- a hoax. When he pulled out of the Paris Climate Accord he said this wasn't a good deal for the United States. ¶Governor Jerry Brown: That's a preposterous idea not even a shred of truth in that statement. So I'd say to Mr. Trump, take a deeper look now is not the time to undo what every country in the world is committed to.¶Bill Whitaker: Are you fearful?¶Governor Jerry Brown: Oh yeah, you should, anyone who isn't is not looking at the facts. I don't think President Trump has a fear of the Lord, the fear of the wrath of God, which leads one to more humility. And this is such a reckless disregard for the truth and for the existential consequences that can be unleashed.¶If he sounds like a Jesuit seminarian, it's because he was one, years ago. Now, he's a climate missionary, traveling the world, preaching the gospel of renewable energy -- at the Vatican; in China, where President Xi Jinping discussed collaborating with California on cutting greenhouse gases. Brown went to the global climate summit in Bonn, Germany last fall. He and former New York City mayor, Michael Bloomberg led a delegation of mayors and legislators representing 40% of the U.S. economy. While the official U.S. delegation, sent by the White House, showed up to promote coal; Brown went to tell the world President Trump doesn't speak for all Americans.¶Governor Jerry Brown: California is not waiting for Trump. We're not waiting for all the deniers. ¶He's already weaning California off fossil fuels. To give us a glimpse of the future, Brown took us to a 62-acre solar farm near Sacramento on the site of a decommissioned nuclear power plant.¶Bill Whitaker: You wanna have 50% of California's electricity generated by renewable sources by--¶Governor Jerry Brown: By 2030.¶Bill Whitaker: --2030. And you--¶Governor Jerry Brown: And I think--¶Bill Whitaker: --think you're gonna beat that?¶Governor Jerry Brown: Yes, no question about it.¶With the federal government standing down on climate action, California is blazing its own trail.    ¶Bill Whitaker: What can you, the governor of one state in the United States, do to fill in the void?¶Governor Jerry Brown: As governor of California we have a cap and trade system which is a very efficient way to reducing greenhouse gases. We have zero-emission vehicle mandate. We have efficiency standards for our buildings, for our appliances. So California is showing that dealing with climate is good for the economy, not bad.¶California is booming. Under Brown, it has grown from the 9th largest economy in the world to the 5th. It's now bigger than the U.K. with a budget surplus of more than $8 billion. ¶Bill Whitaker: When you first came into office this time. California faced more than $50 billion in debt and deficits. There were headlines that California was going to be the first ""failed state."" ¶Governor Jerry Brown: The fact is we cut the budget, we raised taxes and the economy roared back. ¶Bill Whitaker: You cut the budget. You raised taxes. These days that sounds like a prescription for political suicide?¶Governor Jerry Brown: You gotta pay some taxes. You have to invest. We need to invest in the technology of tomorrow or somebody else will. And that somebody is China, India and other countries. You're not gonna poor mouth yourself to the future and roads cost money, that's called taxes. R&D cost money, colleges cost money -- schools, childcare, all of that. We're a rich country and we can handle it. ¶But California's economic success has come at a cost. Housing prices are through the roof. So are the ranks of the homeless. A quarter of the country's homeless live in California. ¶Governor Jerry Brown: This is not paradise. We have a lot of problems. But California is the engine of America, and I like to remind my fellow citizens when you kinda look askance at this state, you're looking at one of the, not the only one, but a major contributor to the well-being of the whole country. ¶California is vital to the national economy. That's why Brown is so angered by the tax overhaul law that was pushed by House and Senate Republicans. They call it a tax cut, but Brown says by eliminating deductions for state and local taxes it actually increases the tax burden on high tax blue states like California. He and other blue state governors say the bill is retaliation against Trump's opponents. Brown called it evil and divisive. ¶Bill Whitaker: Do you think the Republicans are intentionally trying to punish the blue states that didn't vote for President Trump?  ¶Governor Jerry Brown: I know this. The Republicans have this cult. Just like they believe there's no climate problem, they believe that cutting corporate taxes without any money to pay for it, they think it's magic, it'll make everything wonderful. Very irresponsible. Very dangerous.¶But California Republicans say Brown's tax hikes are irresponsible. In Trump's America, Jerry Brown's California seems far out on the frontier. California doesn't look like the rest of the country: Minorities are now the majority of the population. It doesn't act like the rest of the country: The state voted to legalize recreational marijuana; It will soon offer a third gender choice on drivers' licenses. Hillary Clinton trounced President Trump here by more than 4 million votes.¶Bill Whitaker: It seems that California is way out of step with the rest of the country.¶Governor Jerry Brown: I'd say we're more in tune with the future than many parts of the rest of the country. ¶Bill Whitaker: You think the country is going to look more like California in the future?¶Governor Jerry Brown: I think it will. I was asking myself, ""Why did Democrats in Ohio and Wisconsin and Michigan, Pennsylvania, why'd they vote for Trump?"" Not a lot of 'em did, but enough to give him those states' electoral votes. ¶Bill Whitaker: And your answer?¶Governor Jerry Brown: There's more confidence here; there's less fear. People are looking to the future. They're not scared, they're not going inward, they're not scapegoating, they're not blaming Mexican immigrants. They're not blaming the stranger. Just the opposite. It's is a place that's alive. It's dynamic. It's a culture that's on the move, not pulling up the drawbridge out of fear and and economic insecurity. ¶Jerry Brown is California's 39th and oldest governor. When he first held the office in 1975 he had a full head of hair. His father, Pat Brown had been governor eight years before.  When you look at all the staid portraits of his predecessors in the capitol rotunda, it's obvious Jerry Brown is not like the others. Not many politicians spent four years in the seminary as Brown did in the 1950s. Or dated a rock star. He went out with Linda Rondstadt in the 70s.   ¶Governor Jerry Brown: I've seen a lotta different things. I've worked with Mother Theresa. I've spent six months doing Zen meditation in Kamakura, Japan and I've run for President three times. I've done very incompatible things.¶Bill Whitaker: People who like you will say that that's evidence of intellectual flexibility. People who don't like you say that that's evidence of your being flighty.¶Governor Jerry Brown: Well, I'm not gonna -- that's that psycho babble.¶Whatever you call it, his far-out politics his first time in office earned him the moniker Governor Moonbeam. We found him to be down to earth. He's California casual at the office. His dog Colusa has the run of the place.¶Bill Whitaker: Are you better at being governor this time?¶Governor Jerry Brown: Yeah, it's a different experience. 79 is not 36. Different ball game in every way. So I would say I know more, I understand more. ¶Bill Whitaker: What have you learned about yourself in those intervening years?¶Governor Jerry Brown: There's something you lose with age, your physical prowess -- but mental acuity and -- just life experience is very important. So, I enjoy the job a lot more.¶It's hard to see why. His liberal policies make him a punching bag for conservatives and he's not universally loved by liberals. He's a political maverick. He's rolling back state union pensions. He refuses to curb oil production until there's a viable alternative. A majority of Californians like what he's doing. But he's been doing this for almost 50 years and he says it's time to hang up his political spurs. When he leaves office in January 2019, he swears he's going to leave elective politics behind. ¶Bill Whitaker: I think you're gonna miss this. ¶Governor Jerry Brown: No I won't.  ¶Bill Whitaker: You don't think so?¶Governor Jerry Brown: Next year I'll be 80, okay? And what do I want to do with my life? That's my question.¶Bill Whitaker: What do you want to do?¶Governor Jerry Brown: Well, I want to spend time with my wife.¶A go it alone bachelor nearly all of his adult life, Jerry Brown now has a partner to share his life -- Anne Gust Brown, a former executive at The Gap. They married in 2005.  Their plan is to retire to a ranch, in a golden valley north of Sacramento. They're building their dream ranch house - with solar panels, of course. It's off the grid and way off the beaten path. ¶The governor and Colusa, showed us around.  ¶Bill Whitaker: This is beautiful governor. This is pretty steep.¶Governor Jerry Brown: Oh you haven't seen nothing yet.  ¶He told us he's going out at his peak, stepping away from the fray on land his great-grandfather settled in the 1860s. He said he intends to be a modest rancher. He's going to unplug and unwind.  ¶Bill Whitaker: Do ya think this man sitting next to you is going to be content puttering around the ranch?¶Governor Jerry Brown: I wouldn't call it ""puttering."" I don't ""putter.""¶Anne Gust Brown: He sure doesn't putter. No--¶Bill Whitaker: Running- - as he said, running a modest ranch.¶Anne Gust Brown: We both wonder about it. 'Cause we've been running a hundred miles an hour and now we're gonna be in a place that's almost the opposite of that and we'll see.¶Governor Jerry Brown: Yeah we're on the frontier, as it were.¶Bill Whitaker: And you're going to like that?¶Governor Jerry Brown: Well I like being on the frontier. That's for sure.¶Produced by Marc Lieberman and Ali Rawaf. Associate Producer, LaCrai Mitchell.",0

            Expedition Antarctica: A father and son's journey to save the planet - CBS News
    ",CBS News,"June 22, 2018, 12:00 AM","¶Thirty-two years ago, Robert Swan made history as the first person to walk to both poles. Even as a young man, these grueling expeditions took a harsh toll on his body. Passing directly beneath the hole in the ozone layer, Swan's face became badly burned and his eyes even changed color. But the Arctic explorer now says that all of that physical duress pales in comparison to the agony of watching his son go through the same experience 32 years later.¶This past winter, after years of preparation, Robert Swan set out to trek the 600 miles to the South Pole again -- this time, with his 24-year-old son Barney by his side. And this time, with an additional challenge built in: they would survive exclusively off of renewable energy.¶It was a ""swan song"" with a very important goal. If the father-son team could get by on renewable energy in the harshest environment on Earth, then people in the comfort of their own homes could do it, too.¶""At the age of 61, it's not really something that people should do,"" Swan told CBSN Originals of his decision to undertake the difficult journey across Antarctica a second time. ""But Barney convinced me that together as father and son, together as the millennial generation and the older generation, we need to join together because this can't be a bunch of young people thinking one thing and a bunch of old people thinking another. We've got to join together because we are in a survival situation on planet Earth.""¶The success of the expedition necessitated the pioneering of new equipment that would use renewable energy to melt snow and ice into hot water on the move in the Antarctic. So, while Robert had previously used jet fuel to cook his food and keep warm in the -40-degree temperatures, this time he and his son used biofuels derived from wood chips to do the job. They used solar panels, provided by NASA, that plugged into their sleds to melt ice and snow into drinkable water.¶""We're attempting to do something that no other expedition has tried yet in the hope to really show that these technologies can work, not only in our own nations, in our own homes, but in the world's most hostile place,"" Barney explains in the CBSN Originals documentary, ""Expedition Antarctica,"" as he and his father are preparing to set off on their unprecedented journey. ¶While the energy sources sustaining them were different, Antarctica's climate was as unforgiving as ever. And once again, the combination of subzero temperatures and strenuous physical activity began taking a harsh toll on Robert's body.¶""His legs, his inner thigh, everywhere in between, it was like repellant,"" Barney recalled to CBS News. ""We're talking like bits of flesh falling off him. He was decaying. And to think that all it takes is that one degree too far and you could die; I was literally watching my father on the slow road to death.""¶Robert finally realized that in order for the expedition to succeed he would have to bow out. The team had to keep up its pace or risk running out of food and fuel; slowing down or waiting until he recovered weren't options. So he made arrangements for a helicopter to transport him back to base camp, and he made the excruciating decision to leave Barney behind to finish what they'd started.¶""It was the worst moment of my life for the simple reason that I knew what lay ahead,"" Robert recalled through tears in an interview at Davos. ""I felt a failure as an expedition leader. I felt a failure for my son. I felt absolutely appalling, but I knew that this expedition wasn't about Robert Swan. This expedition was about inspiring people on energy use. It was about doing the right thing and the right thing for me to do was to put myself second and the expedition first. I just had to, for once in my life, realize my limitations. And I went back to the base camp and had the worst week of my life, dealing with the word failure. And I had to listen to what was happening with my son's feet. His toes were turning black. ... And I was sitting there thinking, 'I should be there.'""¶Barney, however, didn't see his father's decision as a failure. On the contrary, the 24-year-old, whose toe was turning black due to the brutal negative-40-degree temperatures and repeated banging on his boots, was overcome with pride for his dad.¶""I don't think I've ever been as proud of my dad,"" an emotional Barney told CBS News. ""It takes courage to tell your team you don't have it in you, and that's what he did today.""¶Barney, more determined than ever, continued on toward the south geographic pole. And when he was 60 miles from the goal, Robert choppered back in to join him, so that together, they could complete their mission.¶""It was a moment where I let go of so many things in life because he'd done it,"" Robert recalled, looking lovingly at his son. ""Those stupid words like 'failure' and everything else disappeared because there he was in my arms."" ¶Now, father and son have both inked their names in the history books. They've risked their lives to send a dramatic message to the rest of the world about the feasibility of climate solutions. And they've proven that a passion for adventure, innovation and discovery just may be something that's passed along, from generation to generation.¶""The last thing I said to Barney as I got on that plane,"" says an emotional Robert Swan, ""[was] just remember whose son you are. And my blood's in your blood. And you can bloody do this.' And to do it, he had to go through hell and he's still going through hell, but we did it.""¶Listen to Robert & Barney Swan detail their journey across Antarctica in the Global Goalscast.",0
"Corals, blueberry bushes and polar bears: Signs of global warming are all around","

    ","¶GOTHIC, Colo. -- David Inouye is an accidental climate scientist. More than 40 years ago, the University of Maryland biologist started studying when wildflowers, birds, bees and butterflies first appeared each spring on this mountain. ¶These days, plants and animals are arriving at Rocky Mountain Biological Lab a week or two earlier than they were 30 years ago. The robins that used to arrive in early April now show up in mid-March. Marmots end their winter slumber ever earlier. ¶""If the climate weren't changing, we wouldn't see these kind of changes happen,"" Inouye said while standing on a bed of wildflowers that are popping up on the first day of May as marmots snoop around nearby. ¶More in Climate Change¶It's been 30 years since much of the world learned that global warming had arrived. On June 23, 1988, NASA scientist James Hansen testified before Congress, explaining that heat-trapping gases spewed by the burning of fossil fuels were pushing temperatures higher. ¶But it turns out climate isn't the only thing that's changing: Nature itself is, too. That's the picture painted by interviews with more than 50 scientists and an Associated Press analysis of data on plants, animals, pollen, ice, sea level and more. ¶You don't need a thermometer or a rain gauge to notice climate change, and you don't need to be a scientist to see it. ¶Evidence is in the blueberry bushes in Henry David Thoreau's Walden Pond, the dwindling population of polar bears of the Arctic and the dying corals worldwide. Scientists have documented 28,800 cases of plants and animals ""responding consistently to temperature changes,"" a 2008 study in the journal Nature said. ¶""Nature is extremely sensitive to temperature and nature is reacting to the warmer temperatures,"" said Boston University biologist Richard Primack. ""The dramatic change is happening right in front of us."" ¶In the 1850s, Thoreau charted when Walden Pond's highbush blueberry first flowered. At the time, it happened around May 16, on average. In the past 10 years, it's averaged April 23. Primack started tracking blueberries there in the 2000s, so he can't specifically say how much of the earlier blooming was due to warming temperatures in the last 30 years, but he figures about a third of it is. ¶In 1983, mail carrier John Latimer started keeping track of when the birds, chipmunks and butterflies emerge, when the trees and plants bloomed and when they changed colors and dropped leaves in northernmost Minnesota. Spring is coming earlier, he found. But it's not consistent; there are some really late years interspersed, creating a roller-coaster effect. ¶Starting about 30 years ago, the growing season in general around the Northern Hemisphere ""rather abruptly changed to a new normal,"" with earlier springs and later falls, said Mark Schwartz, a University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee geographer. In the Lower 48 states, 2012 was the earliest growing season on record until it was edged out by 2017, he said. ¶In the U.S., fall's first frost is happening about nine days on average later since 30 years ago, while the last frost of spring is happening almost four days earlier, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. ¶That means the growing season in between is nearly two weeks longer. And some of the stuff that's growing is making us sneeze and suffer. ¶High ragweed days across America swelled from 1990 to 2016, according to a study by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Lewis Ziska. In Kansas City, the number of high pollen days jumped from 58 to 81. ¶""Allergies and asthma are on the rise. Climate change isn't the only reason, but it contributes,"" said Dr. Howard Frumkin, former environmental health chief at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and now at the Wellcome Trust in London. Frumkin said ragweed and poison ivy trigger more powerful allergic reactions with higher carbon dioxide levels. ¶Some of the hardest-hit places on Earth are underwater. Coral reefs are sensitive to warmer water, and there isn't a reef on this planet that has gone unscathed by global warming, said Mark Eakin, coordinator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's coral reef watch. ¶""If you look at coral reefs around the world, they've suffered a great deal of damage,"" Eakin said. ""Many of them are shadows of what they've been before 1998."" ¶There had been no global mass bleaching of coral -- when they go white because of heat stress and frequently die -- until 1998. Another hit in 2010 and then from 2014 to 2017 was the biggest global mass bleaching of them all, devastating the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, Eakin said. ¶Melting ice has made polar bears the poster animal of climate change. Studies show that their survival rates, reproduction rates and body weight are going down in most parts of the Arctic, said Steven Amstrup, formerly U.S. Geological Survey's top polar bear researcher and now chief scientist at Polar Bear International. In parts of Alaska, Amstrup found a 40 percent population drop since the mid-1990s. ¶When Amstrup first started studying polar bears in Alaska he was tracking the resurgence of the animals from widespread hunting in the 1950s and 1960s. But starting in the late 1990s they started losing their habitat and ""we weren't seeing as many big old bears."" ¶Ornithologist George Divoky, on his 47th summer in Cooper Island, Alaska, to study shore birds, is another accidental climate scientist. ¶""In 1988, things started getting strange,"" Divoky said. In the years that followed, seabirds like the black guillemot started arriving earlier, laying eggs earlier and not surviving as well, he said, blaming warming. ¶In 1989, Divoky counted 220 pairs of birds. Last year, there were 85 pairs, and two-thirds of the chicks died. ¶""I was just studying birds,"" Divoky said. ""I don't take any pride in that I may be documenting the end of an Arctic seabird colony."" ¶Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech, has heard non-scientists accusing the government or researchers of manipulating temperature data to show warming. There's no cooking the books, she said; nature is broadcasting a clear signal about climate change. ¶""If you don't trust the thermometers, throw them out,"" Hayhoe said. ""All we have to do is look at what's happening in nature."" ",0
"30 years after warning, global warming ""is in our living room""","
","
June 19, 2018 / 11:42 AM
      / AP
    ","¶SALIDA, Colo. -- We were warned. On June 23, 1988, a sultry day in Washington, James Hansen told Congress and the world that global warming wasn't approaching -- it had already arrived. The testimony of the top NASA scientist, said Rice University historian Douglas Brinkley, was ""the opening salvo of the age of climate change."" ¶Thirty years later, it's clear that Hansen and other doomsayers were right. But the change has been so sweeping that it is easy to lose sight of effects large and small -- some obvious, others less conspicuous. ¶Earth is noticeably hotter, the weather stormier and more extreme. Polar regions have lost billions of tons of ice; sea levels have been raised by trillions of gallons of water. Far more wildfires rage. ¶Over 30 years -- the time period climate scientists often use in their studies in order to minimize natural weather variations -- the world's annual temperature has warmed nearly 1 degree (0.54 degrees Celsius), according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. And the temperature in the United States has gone up even more -- nearly 1.6 degrees. ¶""The biggest change over the last 30 years, which is most of my life, is that we're no longer thinking just about the future,"" said Kathie Dello, a climate scientist at Oregon State University in Corvallis. ""Climate change is here, it's now and it's hitting us hard from all sides."" ¶More in Climate Change¶Warming hasn't been just global, it's been all too local. According to an Associated Press statistical analysis of 30 years of weather, ice, fire, ocean, biological and other data, every single one of the 344 climate divisions in the Lower 48 states -- NOAA groupings of counties with similar weather -- has warmed significantly, as has each of 188 cities examined. ¶The effects have been felt in cities from Atlantic City, New Jersey, where the yearly average temperature rose 2.9 degrees in the past 30 years, to Yakima, Washington, where the thermometer jumped a tad more. In the middle, Des Moines, Iowa, warmed by 3.3 degrees since 1988. ¶South central Colorado, the climate division just outside Salida, has warmed 2.3 degrees on average since 1988, among the warmest divisions in the contiguous United States. ¶When she was a little girl 30 years ago, winery marketing chief Jessica Shook used to cross country ski from her Salida doorstep in winter. It was that cold and there was that much snow. Now, she has to drive about 50 miles for snow that's not on mountain tops, she said. ¶""T-shirt weather in January, that never used to happen when I was a child,"" Shook said. When Buel Mattix bought his heating and cooling system company 15 years ago in Salida, he had maybe four air conditioning jobs a year. Now he's got a waiting list of 10 to 15 air conditioning jobs long and may not get to all of them. ¶And then there's the effect on wildfires. Veteran Salida firefighter Mike Sugaski used to think a fire of 10,000 acres was big. Now he fights fires 10 times as large. ¶""You kind of keep saying 'How can they get much worse?' But they do,"" said Sugaski, who was riding his mountain bike on what usually are ski trails in January this year. ¶In fact, wildfires in the United States now consume more than twice the acreage they did 30 years ago. ¶The statistics tracking climate change since 1988 are almost numbing. North America and Europe have warmed 1.89 degrees -- more than any other continent. The Northern Hemisphere has warmed more than the Southern, the land faster than the ocean. Across the United States, temperature increases were most evident at night and in summer and fall. Heat rose at a higher rate in the North than the South. ¶Since 1988, daily heat records have been broken more than 2.3 million times at weather stations across the nation, half a million times more than cold records were broken. ¶Doreen Pollack fled Chicago cold for Phoenix more than two decades ago, but in the past 30 years night time summer heat has increased almost 3.3 degrees there. She said when the power goes out, it gets unbearable, adding: ""Be careful what you ask for."" ¶The AP interviewed more than 50 scientists who confirmed the depth and spread of warming. ¶Clara Deser, climate analysis chief at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said that when dealing with 30-year time periods in smaller regions than continents or the globe as a whole, it would be unwise to say all the warming is man-made. Her studies show that in some places in North America -- though not most -- natural weather variability could account for as much as half of local warming. ¶But when you look at the globe as a whole, especially since 1970, nearly all the warming is man-made, said Zeke Hausfather of the independent science group Berkeley Earth. Without extra carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, he said, the Earth would be slightly cooling from a weakening sun. Numerous scientific studies and government reports calculate that greenhouse gases in the big picture account for more than 90 percent of post-industrial Earth's warming. ¶""It would take centuries to a millennium to accomplish that kind of change with natural causes. This, in that context, is a dizzying pace,"" said Kim Cobb, a climate scientist at Georgia Tech in Atlanta. ¶Since the 1800s scientists have demonstrated that certain gases in Earth's atmosphere trap heat from the sun like a blanket. Human activities such as burning of coal, oil and gasoline are releasing more of those gases into the atmosphere, especially carbon dioxide. U.S. and international science reports say that more than 90 percent of the warming that has happened since 1950 is man-made. ¶Others cautioned that what might seem to be small increases in temperature should not be taken lightly. ¶""One or two degrees may not sound like much, but raising your thermostat by just that amount will make a noticeable effect on your comfort,"" said Deke Arndt, NOAA's climate monitoring chief in Asheville, North Carolina, which has warmed nearly 1.8 degrees in 30 years. ¶Arndt said average temperatures don't tell the entire story: ""It's the extremes that these changes bring."" ¶The nation's extreme weather -- flood-inducing downpours, extended droughts, heat waves and bitter cold and snow -- has doubled in 30 years, according to a federal index. ¶The Northeast's extreme rainfall has more than doubled. Brockton, Massachusetts, had only one day with at least four inches of rain from 1957 to 1988, but a dozen of them in the 30 years since, according to NOAA records. Ellicott City, Maryland, just had its second thousand-year flood in little less than two years. ¶And the summer's named Atlantic storms? On average, the first one now forms nearly a month earlier than it did in 1988, according to University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy. ¶The 14 costliest hurricanes in American history, adjusted for inflation, have hit since 1988, reflecting both growing coastal development and a span that included the most intense Atlantic storms on record. ¶""The collective damage done by Atlantic hurricanes in 2017 was well more than half of the entire budget of our Department of Defense,"" said MIT's Kerry Emanuel. ¶Climate scientists point to the Arctic as the place where climate change is most noticeable with dramatic sea ice loss, a melting Greenland ice sheet, receding glaciers and thawing permafrost. The Arctic has warmed twice as fast as the rest of the world. ¶Alaska's annual average temperature has warmed 2.4 degrees since 1988 and 5.4 degrees in the winter.  Since 1988, Utqiagvik (oot-GAR'-vik), Alaska, formerly known as Barrow, has warmed more than 6 degrees yearly and more than 9 degrees in winter.¶""The temperature change is noticeable. Our ground is thawing,"" said Mike Aamodt, 73, the city's former acting mayor. He had to move his own cabins at least four times because of coastal erosion and thawing ground due to global warming. ""We live the climate change."" ¶The amount of Arctic sea ice in September, when it shrinks the most, fell by nearly one third since 1988. It is disappearing 50 years faster than scientists predicted, said Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University. ¶""There is a new Arctic now because the Arctic ocean is now navigable"" at times in the summer, said Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center. ¶The vast majority of glaciers around the world have shrunk. A NASA satellite that measures shifts in gravity calculated that Earth's glaciers lost 279 billion tons of ice -- nearly 67 trillion gallons of water -- from 2002 to 2017.  In 1986, the Begich Boggs visitor center at Alaska's Chugach National Forest opened to highlight the Portage glacier. But the glacier keeps shrinking. ¶""You absolutely cannot see it from the visitor center and you haven't in the last 15 or so years,"" said climatologist Brian Brettschneider of the University of Alaska Fairbanks. ¶Ice sheets in Greenland and West Antarctica have also shriveled, melting about 455 billion tons of ice into water, according to the NASA satellite.  That's enough to cover the state of Georgia in water nearly 9 feet deep. ¶And it is enough -- coupled with all the other melting ice -- to raise the level of the seas. Overall, NASA satellites have shown three inches of sea level rise (75 millimeters) in just the past 25 years. ¶With more than 70 percent of the Earth covered by oceans, a 3-inch increase means about 6,500 cubic miles (27,150 cubic km) of extra water. That's enough to cover the entire United States with water about 9 feet deep. ¶It's a fitting metaphor for climate change, say scientists: We're in deep, and getting deeper. ¶""Thirty years ago, we may have seen this coming as a train in the distance,"" NOAA's Arndt said. ""The train is in our living room now.""",0
"Rate of Antarctica's ice melting has tripled since 2012, study finds","
","
June 13, 2018 / 5:26 PM
      / CBS News
    ","¶NEW YORK -- The rate at which ice is melting on Antarctica has tripled in recent years, according to a study published Wednesday in Nature, a scientific journal. Coastal communities along the U.S. could feel the impact of a continued increase as melting ice adds to sea level rise, say experts.¶The study shows that from 1992 through 2011, the continent lost ice at a rate of nearly 84 billion tons of ice a year -- accounting for a 0.2 mm per year contribution to sea level rise. Then the melting accelerated significantly, and since 2012 the rate has jumped to more than 241 billion tons a year -- adding 0.6 mm per year to sea level rise.¶""To see a threefold increase just since 2012 -- that's disturbing to me,"" said Brenda Ekwurzel, director of climate science for the Climate and Energy Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists.¶More in Climate Change¶Overall between 1992 and 2017, Antarctica's ice sheet lost 3 trillion tons of ice -- enough water to cover Texas to a depth of nearly 13 feet, scientists calculated. That loss made global oceans rise about three-tenths of an inch, or 7.6 millimeters.¶When you add the melting seen on Antarctica to other sources of land-based ice melt, ""every millimeter per year counts,"" William Sweet, an oceanographer with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), told CBS News.¶There are ""many, many communities where sea level at high tide is really reaching the brim and spilling into the streets more often that it did just decades ago,"" he said. ""So, every incremental increase in sea level rise really has impacts in terms of flooding.""¶""With continued rise of what this type of study is pointing to, which is that the rise may substantially increase by the end of the century compared to historical rates, areas like Norfolk, Charleston, Miami, a lot of the southeast United States that's very flat, low terrain, particularly stand to really feel the effects of melting in Antarctica,"" he said.¶Greenland's dwindling ice sheet, as well as melting mountain glaciers elsewhere and the fact that warmer water expands, are also contributing to rising seas.¶It's possible, however, that Antarctica alone can add about half a foot to sea level rise by the end of the century, said Andrew Shepherd, the lead author of the study and a professor of earth observation at the University of Leeds in England.¶Part of West Antarctica, where most of the recent melting occurred, ""is in a state of collapse,"" said co-author Ian Joughin of the University of Washington.¶Shepherd said the ice on West Antarctica can be melted by very small changes in ocean temperature.¶Warmer water is mostly causing the melt on our planet's southern-most continent. The water nibbles at the floating edges of ice sheets from below. Warming of the southern ocean is connected to shifting winds, which are connected to global warming from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, Shepherd said.   ¶While Shepherd cautioned that this is not a formal study that determines human fingerprints on climate events, he said ""there are no other plausible signals to be driving this other than climate change."" ¶The study is the second of assessments planned every several years by a team of scientists working with NASA and the European Space Agency. Their mission is to produce the most comprehensive look at what's happening to the world's vulnerable ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland. ¶Outside experts praised the work as authoritative. Unlike single-measurement studies, this team looked at ice loss in 24 different ways using 10 to 15 satellites, as well as ground and air measurements and computer simulations, Shepherd said.¶Ekwurzel at the Union of Concerned Scientists said the study's findings mean ""we have to go back and tell coastal planners that it may be worse than scientists thought before.""¶""The costs for coastal resilience may have just gone up,"" she said.¶She also said that in light of the study, it is ""very clear that now is absolutely not the time to back away from the science infrastructure that allows us to have information, so the coastal communities can plan with the best available information about what's happening down in Antarctica.""¶""The fate of Antarctica, the fate of Greenland, is the fate of Miami,"" she said.¶CBS News' Sarah Lynch and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",0
World Oceans Day: 8 things you can do to make a difference,"

    ","¶The barrage of threats facing our oceans today might seem like an overwhelming tsunami of problems. Plastics are harming marine life. Carbon pollution is warming the oceans and increasing their acidity. Waters are being overfished. ¶But there's hope, according to experts and activists, who say there are a slew of steps you can take to help make a difference.¶""Things are bad but we're at a state where we can definitely make a change,"" said Samantha Mackiewicz, director of World Oceans Day. ¶More in Climate Change¶World Oceans Day takes place every year on June 8 to celebrate Earth's waters and highlight the challenges they face. This year, the focus is on plastic pollution, which is permeating our oceans.¶""What we're asking people to do this year is to eliminate or reduce their use of single-use plastics — so that's bags, bottles, straws — in honor of World Oceans Day,"" said Mackiewicz. ¶""The hope is that if someone can take that action for one day, hopefully they could carry that behavior over beyond World Oceans Day and into the rest of the year,"" she said.¶Here's a look at how you can curb your plastic use — and other actions experts suggest — to have a positive impact on our oceans' health as we mark World Oceans Day. ¶""Invest in a zippered fabric bag and request that your cleaned items be returned in it instead of sheathed in plastic,"" says the Natural Resources Defense Council, a New York City-based non-profit organization.¶There are likely dozens of other ways you could cut down on single-use plastics, which are things like Ziploc bags, disposable coffee-cup lids and plastic wrap. Try using your own on-the-go mug when you hit up a coffee shop, carrying a reusable water bottle at all times, including while traveling, and bringing your own utensils to work to avoid relying on plastic cutlery. ¶Experts and activists also suggest using cloth bags instead of disposable ones for groceries, buying in bulk to cut back on packaging, and boycotting products with microbeads, which are tiny orbs of plastic that can be found in products like facial scrubs and toothpaste. They slip through water treatment plants and can be eaten by marine animals.¶All of those small steps could have a cumulative effect of cutting down on the colossal amounts of plastic that are ending up in our oceans. Just days ago, nearly 20 pounds of plastic bags and other plastic trash were pulled from the stomach of a pilot whale that died in Thailand, according to officials.¶One study has found that tossed plastic trash could outweigh fish by 2050 if we don't make changes.¶Plastic breaks down over time and turns into little pieces that don't go away ""but become almost part of the food chain,"" said Whitley Saumweber, an ocean policy consultant in Washington, D.C.¶""These small pieces of plastic are everywhere in the ocean and are being consumed by everything from the smallest plankton all the way up to whales,"" he said. ¶""Talk to your friends and family about why the ocean is important and why you take steps to help it, and challenge them to do the same,"" said Mackiewicz, the director of World Oceans Day.¶Others suggest carrying that conversation into public places. ¶""If you're at a restaurant and you ask not to have a plastic straw, then they're going to start thinking, 'Hmm, that's interesting. I wonder why they did that,'"" said Kallan Benson, a 14-year-old oceans activist from Maryland who won the National Aquarium's Promise for the Planet award this year.¶Benson said the extent to which plastics have permeated our lives and penetrated our environment is ""scary."" ¶""As a youth, I know that someday this environment is going to be my responsibility and I'm going to be getting it with all these problems already,"" she said. ""How am I going to clean that up? How are we going to create a livable future for the rest of the generations on this planet?""¶Mackiewicz said a good way to make a difference is to organize a garbage cleanup now. Whether it's an inland cleanup or one near the coast, plan one in your community, she said.¶""No matter how far you live from the ocean, the ocean impacts you,"" she said. ""Everything leads to the ocean, every river. ... So, no matter if you're cleaning inland or on the shore, you're helping the ocean overall.""¶One of the biggest issues related to human impact on the oceans is overfishing, said Saumweber. ""We've also got a real problem with illegal fishing,"" he said.¶Such practices have left many marine species severely depleted, with some on the brink of extinction, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC).¶""The simplest thing to do is buy sustainably,"" said Saumweber. ¶And that doesn't only apply when at the grocery store. ""Dine discriminately,"" said Sarah Chasis, senior attorney and director of NRDC's Oceans program.¶They recommend using the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch guide, which provides information to help consumers make choices that have less impact on the environment. ¶Saumweber said a key thing to do when looking to support sustainability ""is just buy American.""¶""We've got the best-managed fisheries in the world here in the States,"" he said. ""By and large, if you're buying an American fish product, you're buying a well-managed fishery.""¶Another component of this is to fish responsibly, said experts. That includes making sure you know the local rules, having a proper fishing license, and practicing catch and release. ¶""We are at risk of depleting our ocean fisheries worldwide and so care has to be given in how we use those resources,"" said Chasis.¶Opting for public transportation over driving your car can impact your microclimate, said Lisa Emelia Svensson, director for Ocean at U.N. Environment, the environmental agency of the United Nations.¶An action like this can reduce your carbon footprint, and multiplied by the efforts of millions of others around the world, that may help slow global warming and ocean acidification — a change in ocean chemistry which threatens marine life.¶Bill Mook, who works in the oyster industry, says he has felt the impacts of acidity firsthand. He said his wake-up call came in 2009 when his oyster farm started having trouble producing oysters. ¶The challenge was growing oyster larvae, which mature into oysters that we can eventually eat. They are very sensitive to changes in the acidity level of the water. ¶""We realized that we were having a pH problem, an acidification problem, and started buffering our water, which is the equivalent of putting Tums in the water, essentially,"" said Mook, who is a Maine-based leader of the Shellfish Growers Climate Coalition and owner of Mook Sea Farm.¶""What was surprising was that when we started doing that, it was literally like turning a light switch on and off — or on, I should say. And all of a sudden, each of the larval cohorts returned to their normal biology,"" he said.¶While that basically solved the problem for his oyster farm, the major global challenge of ocean acidification remains. ¶""In the past 200 years alone, ocean water has become 30 percent more acidic — faster than any known change in ocean chemistry in the last 50 million years,"" says the Smithsonian Institution's Ocean Portal, which is part of its Ocean Initiative.¶The oceans soak up about a quarter of the carbon dioxide produced by the burning of fossil fuels, which changes their fundamental chemistry.¶Aside from walking, biking or the taking the bus instead of driving, experts and activists say you can also cut your daily emissions by finding ways to conserve energy.   ¶""Energy conservation is a huge, huge benefit to people,"" said Mook. ""And I can show you in my own business how over the years we have adopted technology that has dramatically allowed us to produce more and more oyster seed, for example, in our hatchery with less energy input, and I think that applies to small businesses all over the country, as well as to homes.""¶Activists and experts stress the importance of communicating with decision-makers.¶Individuals can have an impact on the health of our oceans by supporting policies that reduce carbon emissions, said Saumweber, who served as associate director for ocean and coastal policy in the White House Council on Environmental Quality in the Obama administration. He urged people to work to make sure their elected representatives support keeping high standards for fuel emissions, embrace alternative energy strategies and support subsidies for solar and wind power.¶There is also concern about ""threatened rollbacks to strong conservation laws that are on the books now,"" such as the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Magnuson–Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, said NRDC's Chasis. ¶The Trump administration has also proposed to open up huge areas of America's coast to offshore oil and gas drilling. ¶""We all saw what happened with the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and how damaging that was to coastal communities and fisheries and the health of the Gulf Coast ecosystem,"" said Chasis.¶She urged people to send a message to Congress and the Trump administration through a form on the NRDC's website. ""This is a time for people to raise their voices,"" she said.¶Mackiewicz, with World Oceans Day, suggests starting local. ¶Contacting local leaders ""is definitely the first step"" in impacting government policy, as well as seeing what you can change in your local communities, she added.¶Experts say recycling is an obvious action to take. ¶Check on what can be recycled in your community, and make sure you're separating out your plastic — and that it's eligible for recycling, said Chasis. ¶""I know it sounds a little trite, like 'reduce, reuse, recycle,' but it's really true, and it's something we've gotta change and we've gotta embrace,"" said Saumweber.¶While the U.S. is not the biggest driver of plastic pollution — China tops that list — ""it doesn't mean we can't lead by example and it's not important for us as some of the world's major consumers to make sure that we're having an impact on the world through our actions,"" he said.¶That's what Kallan Benson, the 14-year-old oceans activist, would say to someone who asks what single action they could take to make a difference. The idea is that the more someone thinks about plastics and plastics pollution, the environment and the consequences of our actions, the more likely they are to act on it. ¶""When we go to the grocery story, we're more likely to bring our own bags instead of getting plastics bags. We're more likely to go out and talk to our legislators about the Styrofoam ban just because we're constantly thinking about it,"" she said.¶""Being more aware is the biggest thing you can do,"" she added.",0
"High-tide flooding in the U.S. is twice what it was 30 years ago, NOAA says","

    ","¶ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. -- High-tide flooding is happening across the United States at twice the rate it was just 30 years ago, according to a new report, which predicts records for such flooding will continue to be broken for decades as sea levels rise. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Wednesday that high-tide flooding, sometimes called sunny-day or ""nuisance flooding,"" tied or set records last year in more than a quarter of the 98 places the agency monitors around the country. ¶The report found Sabine Pass, Texas, had 23 days of high-tide flooding last year. The area is part of Port Arthur, where most houses now stand on stilts after the community was hit repeatedly by destructive hurricanes. Atlantic City, New Jersey, and Boston had 22 each. Cities in other parts of the country experienced fewer tidal floods, but many of those cities still saw records set. ¶""Though year-to-year and regional variability exist, the underlying trend is quite clear: Due to sea level rise, the national average frequency of high tide flooding is double what it was 30 years ago,"" the report said. ¶More in Climate Change¶Ben Horton, a Rutgers University researcher who was not involved in the study, called it ""a warning, a shot across the bow."" ¶""Across the whole of the U.S. coastline, we are in dire need of action,"" he said. ¶In addition to the conclusions of the report, Horton said it is just as significant that ""this is a federally funded sea-level assessment funded by the Trump Administration, and it shows that the problems on our coasts are getting worse and will get worse."" The Republican president has derided climate change as a hoax. ¶NOAA said the top five cities that saw the highest number of flood days across the U.S. and broke records during the 2017 meteorological year, which is May 2017-April 2018,  include Boston; Atlantic City, New Jersey; Sandy Hook, New Jersey; Sabine Pass, Texas; and Galveston, Texas. ¶""These cities faced the brunt of an active nor'easter and hurricane seasons and sea level rise, which has made these and other less extreme events more impactful,"" NOAA said.¶Record high-tide flooding around the country included 20 days at Sandy Hook, New Jersey; 18 at Galveston Pier in Texas; 17 at Wachapreague, Virginia; 15 at the battery neighborhood of New York City; 14 at Bay St. Louis-Waveland in Mississippi; and 13 in Providence, Rhode Island and San Diego. ¶As sea levels rise, coastal communities around the U.S. are experiencing flooding that closes roads or inconveniences daily activities on an increasing basis. Two of the three main entrances to Atlantic City, the east coast gambling resort, are often flooded by tides, with one or both lanes having to be shut down for hours at a time. ¶""What used to be uncommon is now becoming fairly common,"" said William Sweet, a NOAA oceanographer and co-author of the report. ¶He said global sea levels are rising at a rate of about 3 millimeters a year, or about an inch every eight years. Horton and other Rutgers researchers project that by 2050, seas off New Jersey will rise by an additional 1.4 feet.¶The report found tidal flooding was at record levels last year along parts of the southeast Atlantic and eastern Gulf coasts. ¶Anticipated weather conditions this year and next may result in even higher than expected flood frequencies along the east and west coasts.",0

May warmed to a record average 65.4 degrees in the Lower 48 states, breaking the high of 64.7 set in 1934, according to federal weather figures. ¶May was 5.2 degrees above the 20th century's average for the month. ¶Weather stations in the nation broke or tied nearly 8,600 daily heat records in May, the NOAA reported. It hit 100 in Minneapolis on May 28, the earliest the city has seen triple digits. ¶More in Climate Change¶""The warmth was coast-to-coast,"" said climate scientist Jake Crouch at NOAA's Centers for Environmental Information. ¶What made May seem even warmer was that April was unusually cool for much of the United States, he said. Wisconsin had its coldest April followed by its second warmest May. ¶The United Kingdom, Germany and other places also set May heat records, but overall global figures for the month are still being tabulated, Crouch said. ¶It was especially warm at night in the U.S. during May. The overnight low temperature averaged 52.5 degrees nationwide. That broke the record by 2 degrees which ""is unheard of"" at this time of year, he said. ¶Partly to blame is the overall warming trend from man-made climate change, Crouch said. April was cool because the jet stream brought polar air south, but it shifted out of that pattern in May. Then, a tropical system and subtropical storm Alberto brought warm moisture to the eastern part of the country, while the West was quite dry. That allowed temperatures to heat up. ¶""Nature is dealing cards from a very different deck now compared to the 20th century,"" Pennsylvania State University climate scientist David Titley said in an email. ¶U.S. temperature reports go back to 1895. With the new May record, six of the U.S. monthly record highs have been set since 2006. ¶The NOAA reported other significant climate events for May, including record rainfall that triggered mudslides and floods in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast.¶San Juan, Puerto Rico, was also cooler -- and drier -- than what's typical, with it seeing the coolest May since 2011.",0

            Michael Bloomberg pledges $70 million for American Cities Climate Challenge - CBS News
    ",CBS News,"June 1, 2018, 9:34 AM","¶One year ago, President Trump announced the U.S. would exit the Paris climate agreement. Former New York City mayor and billionaire Michael Bloomberg is working to bypass Mr. Trump's opposition to the agreement, launching a new effort today to help the U.S. achieve the goals adopted by the Obama administration.¶The centerpiece is a $70 million American Cities Climate Challenge, a program that will select 20 U.S. cities and help them speed up their efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The program aims to push the U.S. toward meeting the goal it set in the Paris talks of cutting greenhouse gases by 26 percent, from 2005 levels, by 2025.¶Bloomberg, who co-wrote the bestselling book ""Climate of Hope"" with Carl Pope, acknowledged he jokes about how Mr. Trump's opposition has helped spur more action on climate change and other issues.¶""It's easy to raise money for sensible gun regulations and the background checks and for climate change things because he's come out, and I've joked that I want him to do more,"" Bloomberg said Friday on ""CBS This Morning. ¶But his actual hope, Bloomberg said, is that the president – whom he believes is ""getting bad advice"" – will change his mind.¶""We've watched him. He can change his mind. He changes it frequently. Hopefully he'll come around and do something that makes some sense. Not doing anything about climate change really just makes no sense whatsoever and it jeopardizes all of us,"" Bloomberg said. ¶He said children and adults have greater risk of health issues, including asthma attacks and stomach cancer, without clean air or water. ¶""So if you don't worry about the future, just worry about you and your family today and you'd do the same thing,"" Bloomberg urged. ¶Bloomberg said the private sector is key to making progress on the issue of climate change. ¶""The federal government doesn't have a lot to do with climate change... President Obama did get a law passed. Donald Trump said stop the law. He didn't; it's been tied up in the courts and never put into place. So the federal government's not involved,"" Bloomberg said. ""The state governments, only a little. It's city governments and the private sector. Mostly the private sector."" ¶He also said corporations are under pressure from investors, employees and customers to be more ""climate friendly."" ¶Bloomberg said he's worried about what's happening in the world. ¶""Nobody knows where it's going. Scientists have theories about it, but the direction is horrendous. It was 122.4 degrees in Pakistan two weeks ago. It was over freezing in the North Pole. Seventeen out of the 18 warmest years on record since have been since the year 2001. Something is going on and it just makes no sense to continue in the direction we're going,"" Bloomberg said.  ¶So he's taking ""prophylactic actions now"" with a focus on what cities can do. ¶""Cut back greenhouse gasses, increase the fuel efficiency of cars, things like that. Generate solar and wind power, which is cheaper now than fossil fuel power. It's good economics, it creates jobs and it protects us from what might happen in the future,"" Bloomberg said. ",0
Can this bird adapt to a warmer climate? Read the genes to find out,"

      / The Conversation
    ","¶Rachael Bay is a Postdoctoral Fellow of Environment and Sustainability at the University of California, Los Angeles¶Many animals have adaptations that help them cope with specific environments or lifestyles. Antarctic fish produce antifreeze proteins that prevent their blood from freezing in subzero temperatures. Some desert rodents survive without ever drinking a single drop of water. Humans living at high altitudes have special adaptations to cope with the low oxygen concentrations.¶These special adaptations are encoded in the genome and passed down from generation to generation. This information can help scientists project into the future as well: Reading an animals' genes may help us anticipate if, and how, an organism might adapt to rapid changes in their environment, like those brought on by climate change. Understanding climate vulnerability at the level of an animal's DNA could reveal which populations and species are more at risk, allowing us to match conservation efforts with at-risk species and expected climate scenarios. ¶I worked with a group of biologists associated with the Bird Genoscape Project who are concerned with the impact of a changing climate. We decided to investigate this question using yellow warblers. ¶More in Climate Change¶These migratory birds are found throughout most of Canada and the U.S. during the summer, inhabiting environments that range from the hot, dry Central Valley of California to the cool damp Pacific Northwest. If you live in North America, there are probably yellow warblers close by. ¶A genomic study like this one is a game of large numbers. First, we needed lots of samples from across the continent. Luckily, we got lots of help. Bird monitoring stations collected samples of yellow warbler blood for us, museums sent us samples, and other scientists dug up DNA they had in their freezers from past studies. When all was said and done, we had a large collection of both blood and feather samples from live birds as well as tissue samples from museum birds.¶Once we had DNA from all these samples – about 250 birds from over 20 locations across the U.S. and Canada – we sequenced the genomes for each yellow warbler. This resulted in about 350 billion DNA base pairs – chemical units of DNA that make up the genetic code. Using computer algorithms, we compared these 250 genomes and investigated which parts of the genome were different in birds from different climate regions.¶We didn't really know which parts of the genome, if any, would show signs of climate adaptation – so we didn't choose to examine any particular gene. Instead, we looked at many random regions of the genome, over 100,000 in total. We compared variation at each of these genomic regions with different environmental parameters related to temperature, precipitation and vegetation measurements at the locations the birds were sampled. ¶We found that of these environmental variables, precipitation was the most strongly correlated with genetic variation. When we examined these regions of the yellow warbler genome across all of our samples, we found that some genes looked different in birds from rainy regions when compared with the same genes in birds living in arid zones.¶In other words, the same gene in yellow warblers from the driest places in the country had a slightly different DNA sequence than in birds from very wet places. This suggests there is an ideal genetic variant that is matched to the environment – these birds had adapted to their local climates.¶But if birds are adapted to their current climate, what will happen in the coming years as the climate changes? ¶Many regions of the U.S. are predicted to get warmer and drier over the next century. Because we now had an idea of which genetic variants are ideal for each climate, we could calculate how much the genome sequences of yellow warbler populations would have to change over the next 50 years to match the genetic profile of yellow warblers adapted to future conditions. We can estimate, for example, how much birds will need to adapt to warmer temperatures in the future based on the genomic profile of yellow warblers now living in warmer parts of country. ¶We used an algorithm that combined data from all 100,000 genomic regions with publicly available data on 25 different climate variables, both for present and projected future climates. When the numbers were crunched, we estimated a score that reflected how much DNA of a population would need to change for that population to adapt to future climate change. We called this the ""genomic vulnerability"" of different yellow warbler populations.¶Some regions, like the Rocky Mountains, showed very high levels of genomic vulnerability, suggesting yellow warblers in these areas would need many changes in their genomes to keep up with climate change. Meanwhile, warblers from other regions, like the Midwest, had low genomic vulnerability – these birds were less at risk. Differences in genomic vulnerability across the range are due variation in projected climate change patterns; some regions are expected to get hotter and drier while other regions might actually become wetter and cooler.¶Perhaps our most startling finding emerged when we compared genomic vulnerability to changes in yellow warbler populations over the past 50 years. In areas like parts of California and the Rocky Mountains, which had the highest genomic vulnerability, yellow warbler populations have already declined. This could mean that climate change has already affected these populations, and those effects are likely to become even more severe over the next century.¶Although we found genetic differences between birds inhabiting different climates, we still don't have a good idea of what these genetic differences mean. Maybe birds from drier areas are adapted to take advantage of different food sources from those that live in wetter regions. Maybe birds time their migration to match different types of vegetation in different regions. Only follow-up studies will be able to tell us how birds are adapting to different climates.¶Yellow warblers are clearly not the only species being affected by climate change.  Through the Bird Genoscape Project, we are working on creating maps of genomic vulnerability in a number of North American birds. We also hope that this framework will be used for other types of wildlife as well, not just birds.¶This article was originally published on The Conversation.",0

Pumping groundwater for agriculture significantly contributed to freshwater depletion around the world during the period studied, which could explain a decline in freshwater that was observed in Saudi Arabia, for example. ¶Levels of groundwater are also impacted by drought cycles and persistent rain, according to NASA.",0
Federal judge scraps Oakland's coal shipment ban in scathing ruling,"

    ","¶SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge in California on Tuesday struck down the city of Oakland's ban on coal shipments at a proposed cargo terminal, siding with a developer who wants to use the site to transport Utah coal to Asia. In a scathing ruling, U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria in San Francisco said the information the city relied on to conclude that coal operations would pose a substantial health or safety danger to the public was ""riddled with inaccuracies"" and ""faulty analyses, to the point that no reliable conclusion about health or safety dangers could be drawn from it."" ¶The decision cheered coal proponents while opponents said they would continue to fight for cleaner air. Oakland is reviewing its options and may appeal, said Justin Berton, a spokesman for Mayor Libby Schaaf. ¶The issue over coal has rocked then San Francisco Bay Area city that is environmentally friendly but also economically depressed in spots. ¶City leaders approved construction of a rail and marine terminal in 2013 as part of a larger makeover of an Army base that was shuttered in 1999. The $250 million project in west Oakland is expected to bring thousands of jobs to a historically African-American neighborhood that is among the poorest and most polluted in the region. ¶More in Climate Change¶Oakland officials said coal was never mentioned as a possibility but lawyers for developers said city officials always knew there would be a mix of goods, including coal. ¶Concerned about pollution caused by coal dust, the city moved in 2016 to ban shipments of coal and petroleum coke, a solid derived from oil refining. The decision came after Utah lawmakers approved a $53 million investment to help ship the state's coal through Oakland to Asia. ¶Utah Sen. David Hinkins, a Republican who represents coal-producing counties, applauded the decision on Tuesday. ""It would be good for my little depressed area,"" he said. ¶Many Utah mines are now shipping through Mexico to reach markets in Japan and Korea, as the U.S. market wanes, but a California shipping point would be closer and less expensive, he said. ¶Utah's $53 million would still be on the table, pending a committee approval, he said. ¶The government-watchdog group Alliance for a Better Utah, meanwhile, said they were disappointed in the ruling, and said the public money would be better spent on local water systems or fire trucks rather than the port. ¶In a statement, Schaaf vowed to continue the fight. Alex Katz, chief of staff to Oakland's city attorney, said they will discuss options with the City Council. ¶One of the developers of the project is Phil Tagami, a close friend of California Gov. and former Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown. The governor's environmental efforts have made him a global leader in the fight against climate change, but he hasn't spoken out publicly against the project. ¶Chhabria agreed with attorneys for developers that the city relied on a flawed analysis to justify its ban. As an example, he said the city failed to factor in covers on the coal-carrying rail cars in its emissions estimates for the project. ¶It also had no meaningful assessment of how emissions would affect air quality in Oakland, he said. ¶The city's opposition to coal operations appeared to stem largely from concerns about global warming, but it was ""facially ridiculous to suggest that this one operation resulting in the consumption of coal in other countries will, in the grand scheme of things, pose a substantial global warming-related danger to people in Oakland,"" the judge said.",0

""We looked at the trade between different countries and also at greenhouse gas emissions data to come up with a comprehensive figure for the global carbon footprint for tourism.""¶Researchers found that between 2009 and 2013, global tourism was behind 8 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, which are the most significant driver of climate change.¶""Transport, shopping and food are significant contributors,"" said an abstract of the study, which was published this week in Nature Climate Change, a peer-reviewed journal. ""We project that, due to its high carbon intensity and continuing growth, tourism will constitute a growing part of the world's greenhouse gas emissions.""¶A majority of the carbon footprint comes from -- and takes place in -- high-income countries. ¶Overall, the U.S. is behind most tourism-generated emissions, followed by China, Germany and India. ""The majority of these carbon footprints are caused by domestic travel; business travel could not be distinguished from tourism,"" according to the news release on the study.¶Small islands, meanwhile, draw a ""disproportionate share"" of carbon emissions due to international travel, according to the release. Tourism accounts for 30-80 percent of emissions in countries like Cyprus, the Maldives and the Seychelles.¶Manfred Lenzen, who leads the Integrated Sustainability Analysis group and co-authored the study, said researchers found that  ""per-capita carbon footprint increases strongly with increased affluence and does not appear to satiate as incomes grow."" ¶Malik said that wealthier people tend to spend more on higher carbon transportation, food and other tourism-related activities.¶""If you have visitors from high income countries then they typically spend heavily on air travel, on shopping and hospitality where they go to,"" he said, according to the BBC.

Among the unresolved issues are how to ensure transparent monitoring of what countries do to cut global emissions and the methods used take stock of what countries have achieved. Advocates also want governments at the two-week talks to explicitly acknowledge that current national pledges won't be enough to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius by 2100, and therefore raise their ambitions. ¶More in Climate Change¶The talks are part of preparations for December's global climate summit in Katowice, Poland, when the so-called Paris rulebook must be formally approved.   ¶While President Donald Trump announced last year that the U.S. will pull out of the Paris accord, the rest of the world remains committed to the deal. ¶The study published this week found that all 197 countries, nations and territories that have signed or ratified the Paris Agreement have at least one policy or law on climate change or ""the transition to a low-carbon economy."" Of the 1,500 climate laws and policies in place around the world today, 106 of them were introduced since the Paris Agreement was reached in December 2015, and 28 of those specifically reference it.¶The report notes, however, that ""further analyses will be required to determine if these new laws and policies are consistent with the Paris Agreement and countries' nationally determined contributions.""¶""Alignment between national and international goals will be pivotal to meeting the Paris targets,"" it says.",0

Assistant Attorney General Seth Beausang asked the court to dismiss the case, citing the Alaska Supreme Court's dismissal of a similar climate change case in 2014 setting precedent. ¶""The court said that weighing all those interests was a policy decision entrusted to the political branches, and not to the courts,"" Beausang said. ¶The 2014 case and the current one were both filed with help from an Oregon-based nonprofit, Our Children's Trust, which has filed legal actions on behalf of young people across the country demanding action on climate change. ¶More in Climate Change¶The plaintiffs said that in the years since the 2014 Supreme Court ruling, Alaska has implemented a de facto climate policy by continuing to encourage activities like oil and gas production. ¶""The state's climate and energy policy is causing catastrophic harm to Alaska's climate system and endangering plaintiff's lives and liberties and their very futures,"" Our Children's Trust attorney Andrew Welle said. ""These claims are squarely within the authority of the court."" ¶Attorneys for both sides said they expect a ruling within the next six months. ",0

    ","¶UNITED NATIONS -- You may want to put on a gas mask after you read the latest report from the World Health Organization (WHO) on urban air pollution. The WHO says nine out of ten people are subjected to high levels of pollutants from the air they breathe.¶Outdoor and household air pollution, the report says, kill seven million people every year from ""exposure to fine particles in polluted air that penetrate deep into the lungs and cardiovascular system, causing diseases including stroke, heart disease, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and respiratory infections, including pneumonia.""¶The data show a staggering proportion of deaths from seemingly unrelated diseases actually have air pollution to blame; 24 percent of all adult deaths from heart disease, 25 percent from stroke, 43 percent from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and 29 percent of lung cancer deaths.¶Much of the deadly pollution is not caused by the factors most familiar to the Western world, like vehicles and industry, but by pollutants much closer to home.¶""It is unacceptable that over three billion people -- most of them women and children -- are still breathing deadly smoke every day from using polluting stoves and fuels in their homes,"" says WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. He says urgent action is needed.¶More in Climate Change¶Climate experts say the Paris Climate accord and alleviating the health risk from pollution go hand-in-hand.¶""By addressing air pollution, we are going to be curbing the same emissions that cause climate change,"" Dan Shepard, an information officer with the United Nations Department of Public Information, tells CBS News. ""The Paris Agreement lets countries create their own plans to address pollution, to address emissions and to build a healthier and more prosperous world.""¶Most of the deaths from pollution, the report says, are in low and middle-income countries, but analysts point out that those who travel to those countries for business or tourism can also be affected.¶One of the findings is that air pollution is the lowest in high-income countries, but in high-income countries in Europe, for example, air pollution still lowers average life expectancy by anywhere from two months to two years.¶The report bases its findings on the world's most comprehensive database on outdoor air pollution. The WHO's database collates information on 4,300 cities in 108 different countries.¶The report isn't all bad news; it highlights the efforts of some major cities to cut pollution.¶Thirteen cities are commended for plans to reduce outdoor pollution, including pledges to procure zero-emission public buses starting in 2025, including London, Paris, Los Angeles, Copenhagen, Barcelona, Quito, Vancouver, Mexico City, Milan, Rome, Seattle, Auckland and Cape Town. It also notes that Paris, Mexico City, Rome, and Copenhagen have committed to preventing diesel vehicles from their respective city centers. ¶Even China, with its record levels of pollution, is lauded for rolling out electric bus fleets in some cities. Los Angeles is investing in alternatives to cars. Barcelona is restricting traffic and giving cycle traffic a preference, and Tokyo has ""pollution police"" to ensure that its strict regulations on automobile emissions are upheld.¶The WHO has scheduled a meeting of world leaders at its Geneva headquarters for October 30 – November 1. It will be the first Global Conference on Air Pollution and Health to focus on both pollution and climate change.   ¶Dr. Tedros says he sees progress: ""We are seeing more and more governments increasing commitments to monitor and reduce air pollution,"" with significant action in the transport, housing and energy sectors.",0

    ","¶SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California and 16 other states sued the Trump administration Tuesday over its plans to scrap standards on vehicle greenhouse gas emissions, which help set gas mileage rules. The suit takes aim at a plan by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to roll back and revise emissions standards for vehicles manufactured between 2022 and 2025. Those standards would have translated to vehicles getting 36 miles of real-world driving per gallon by 2025 -- about 10 miles over the existing standard. ¶""Pollutants coming out of vehicle, out of tailpipes, does permanent lung damage to children living well-traveled roads and freeways. The only way we're going to overcome that is by reducing emissions,"" California Gov. Jerry Brown said as he announced the lawsuit alongside state Attorney General Xavier Becerra. ¶Brown said in a statement that the states joining the lawsuit represent 140 million people ""who simply want cleaner and more efficient cars.""¶More in Climate Change¶""This phalanx of states will defend the nation's clean car standards to boost gas mileage and curb toxic air pollution,"" he said.¶The states joining today’s lawsuit represent 140 million people who simply want cleaner and more efficient cars. This phalanx of states will defend the nation’s clean car standards to boost gas mileage and curb toxic air pollution. 🌎https://t.co/6t4sHygNT5¶Becerra said: ""Enough is enough.""¶""We're not looking to pick a fight with the Trump Administration, but when the stakes are this high for our families' health and our economic prosperity, we have a responsibility to do what is necessary to defend them,"" he said in a statement.¶EPA administrator Scott Pruitt has said the standards are not appropriate and need revision. They were set in 2012 when California and the Obama administration agreed to a single nationwide fuel economy standard. ¶Pruitt outlined his reasoning for the change in an April 13 posting to the Federal Register. He argued assumptions about gas prices and vehicle technology used by the Obama administration to set the standards were too optimistic. The standards, he said, would hurt automakers and consumers who can't afford or don't want to buy more fuel-efficient vehicles. ¶California officials say the standards are achievable and the EPA's effort to roll them back is not based on any new research. They argue the plan violates the Clean Air Act and didn't follow the agency's own regulations. ¶California has a unique waiver that allows it to set its own tailpipe emissions standards for vehicles, which it has used to combat smog and more recently global warming. Thirteen other states and the District of Columbia have adopted the California standards as their own. ¶Automakers have argued that the current requirements would have cost the industry billions of dollars and raised vehicle prices due to the cost of developing the necessary technology. ¶California has now sued the Trump administration more than 30 times on topics including immigration and health care policy. Brown, who has made fighting climate change a core of his policy and political platform, said the state's fights with Washington over climate are the most essential. ¶""If we follow the Pruitt-Trump path, we follow our way off the path to disaster,"" he said. ¶The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Joining California are Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Virginia and the District of Columbia.",0

    ",CBS News,"April 22, 2018, 10:57 AM","¶Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a billionaire philanthropist, announced a new development in his work to combat climate change, on this Sunday's broadcast of ""Face the Nation.""¶What follows is a transcript of the interview that aired Sunday, April 22, 2018.¶BLOOMBERG: America made a commitment and as an American if the government's not going to do it we all have responsibility. I'm able to do it. So, yes, I'm going to send them a check for the monies that America had promised to the organization as though they got it from the federal government.¶BRENNAN: Four and a half million dollars this year. Will you do the same next or--¶BLOOMBERG: We'll figure out-- hopefully by then President Trump will have changed his view which would be great.¶BRENNAN: President Trump has been a huge critic of this Paris Climate Change Accord but--¶BLOOMBERG: He has been. But that doesn't mean he can't listen to others and change his mind. A person that doesn't change their mind isn't very smart. A person that listens to facts--¶BRENNAN: He changes his mind.¶BLOOMBERG: And he's been known to change his mind. That is true. But he should change his mind and say look there really is a problem here. America is part of the problem. America is a big part of the solution and we should go in and help the world stop a potential disaster.¶BRENNAN: One of the criticisms of this agreement, the Paris Climate Change Accords, is it's non-binding. It's basically not enforceable and none of the developed nations who are part of it have actually met the benchmarks they set for themselves.¶BLOOMBERG: But that does--¶BRENNAN: Aren't you concerned that you're throwing some, some good money after bad?¶BLOOMBERG: Look it's dangerous to keep doing what we're doing. If everybody would do the right thing, yes, it would be better. But if some people or some countries do the right thing we all benefit from that.¶BRENNAN: But the criticism is that industrialized nations aren't living up to those pledges.¶BLOOMBERG: I can't speak for other nations. All I know is that America I believe will meet its commitment by 2025 to reduce greenhouse gases by an agreed amount and if we do it hopefully other countries will do it as well.¶BRENNAN: Do you feel like you're filling a leadership gap? For the United States?¶BLOOMBERG: Well I think that this is what the American public when you poll them say they want to do. We've got companies and states and individuals all agreeing to step in, report to the United Nations what our progress is the way all the other countries are going to do it, commit-- fulfill our commitment to fund part of it. It's not a lot of money. But America made that commitment and most importantly to do the things that will keep temperatures from going up and really potentially changing our life for the worst.¶BRENNAN: After the election the president gave you his personal cell phone number. Why don't you call him?¶BLOOMBERG: Well I think when he watches this program on Sunday morning-- he'll, he'll get my views.¶BRENNAN: How do you assess EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt?¶BLOOMBERG: His policies are not good for the world. To debunk science and walk away from it is just ridiculous. Even if you don't believe it, if there's a possibility that it's right you have to take prophylactic actions to prevent a disaster. And what I do know is that a lot of kids go to the hospital with asthma attacks because we have a lot of junk we put in the air. A lot of people come down with stomach cancers because there's a lot of stuff that goes into the water. A lot of people's houses are being destroyed and they're getting killed in hurricanes and things like that--¶BRENNAN: It sounds like you think he's not doing the job that he should be doing.¶BLOOMBERG: I don't think there's any question about that. He was hired. His job is to protect the environment and he has walked away a hundred percent from that saying, ""The environment doesn't need protection. I'm going to try to protect jobs."" That's not his job.¶BRENNAN: Should he be fired?¶BLOOMBERG: That's up to the president to decide. If he could get Scott Pruitt to change his policies, then he can keep him. But it's-- the issue is that what he's doing is very damaging to your health and your children's health and mine.¶BRENNAN: But he would say and the administration would say that criticisms like yours are just pure politics.¶BLOOMBERG: If there's anybody that's making it a political issue it's this administration. Ninety nine percent of all scientists after peer review say that something is happening in the world. It's changing. Everybody that looks outside their window can see that we have less snow here and more snow there and bigger storms and a whole bunch of things that the oceans are rising and things are changing and you can't deny that.¶BRENNAN: At the DNC in 2016, you called Donald Trump a ""risky, reckless and radical choice"" and the country you said couldn't afford to make that mistake.¶BLOOMBERG: Did I say that?¶BRENNAN: It was a memorable quote. Has he done anything to make you reconsider that? Do you think he's doing a good job?¶BLOOMBERG: I think he, it's, I would give him an incomplete grade. Some of the things that he's done, I don't agree with-- the style of changing your mind every day and leaving your staffs out there to make embarrassing things that you don't back them up. And the turnover in the administration is really dangerous and worrisome and not fair to people. But you know to criticize him doesn't advance anything.¶BRENNAN: His compelling case was that he came from the world of business as you did.¶BLOOMBERG: No he didn't. He was a real estate developer. He was-- he didn't manage large numbers of people. He didn't run big organizations. He was I gather a reasonably successful real estate developer which is just a different occupation. It's not really a business person.¶BRENNAN: And do you see though I mean you're drawing a distinction there. Do you see some management issues then? When you say--¶BLOOMBERG: Oh I don't think there's any question that--¶BRENNAN: The hiring, the firing, the tweeting--¶BLOOMBERG: Management is not something you-- it's like skiing-- you don't read a book on skiing and then go out and ski double black diamonds. Management is something you learn over a period of time and you have to manage larger and larger groups of people and make more and more difficult decisions and live with those decisions as you go. This president does not have experience in running large organizations or facing a lot of the issues that he has to face and the one time I talked to him after he got elected, my advice was to him was get people regardless of their political persuasion who have expertise in each of these areas that you're not an expert on and give them authority to go along with responsibility and then let them do it even when there are things that you don't agree with. And when they make decisions that you don't necessarily agree with or that don't turn out to be the right decisions you have to back them up. If you don't give people the confidence that you're going to have their backs you're not going to get good people and you're not going to keep them.¶BRENNAN: You're an independent. You've been a Democrat, you've been a Republican.¶BLOOMBERG: I know something about partisan politics. I've been them all.¶BRENNAN: So do you see any candidates in any of those parties right now that you see embodying the kind of leadership you want to support and would support in 2020?¶BLOOMBERG: I think if you look back at history it is such a long time from this point in this cycle until the election that I bet you 25 cents the candidate that gets the nomination isn't even mentioned today. ¶BRENNAN: Because you're a numbers guy what are the odds you'd put on you deciding to run?¶BLOOMBERG: Not very high. You know look I've--¶BRENNAN: Not very high, but not zero?¶BLOOMBERG: Well if God said I'd appoint you-- I think it's a great challenge and you'd have to think long and hard, and you know, you're physically able to do it. Can you think-- do you think you can attract the right people? Because it's not going to be you. It's the staff that you're going to build that team that I talked about. But at the moment I'm not running for president. I'm trying to do as good a job as I can. I'm interested in public education and I think the education system our country is going in the wrong direction. We've got to find programs where people can get jobs. We have defense issues around the world. We have potential things that could damage or destroy our country. We've got to build alliances around the world and do those kinds of things. And I think I can as a private citizen help in some of those things and that's what I want to do with my life.¶BRENNAN: It also sounds like a platform.¶MAYOR MICHAEL BLOOMBERG: Well anything you say could be a platform. I don't know that is it. Do I think that the president of United States should do those things? Of course I think the President of the United States should do those things but he's not or she's not the only one that can do those things.",0

Americans remain pessimistic about the environment - CBS News poll,"

    ","¶By Jennifer De Pinto, Fred Backus, Kabir Khanna and Anthony Salvanto  ¶Americans are pessimistic about the future condition of the environment. Few expect the environment to be better for the next generation, and most say it will get worse. These negative views have been relatively consistent for the past decade.¶Independents and Democrats are especially likely to think the condition of the environment will decline. Many Republicans, however, see a static situation in which the environment left to the next generation will be no better or worse than it is today.¶More in CBS News Polls¶But younger Americans are a bit more optimistic about the environment that will be left to them.  One in five Americans under 35 say think the environment will be better, nearly twice the percentage of older Americans who feel the same.¶Most Americans continue to believe that global warming exists, and most believe that it is caused mainly by human activity.  Here, Republicans break markedly with the rest of America.  Republicans are more apt to attribute global warming to natural causes than human activity, and more than a quarter of Republicans do not believe global warming exists at all.¶ Younger Americans are also more likely to believe that global warming is caused by human activity:  nearly two-thirds of those under 35 think so.  In contrast, just 41 percent of seniors 65 and older attribute the cause to human activity, though most do think global warming exists.¶Some have advocated a switch to focusing on more alternative energy sources such as solar and wind as a way to reduce the pace of global warming.  Most Americans think such a move would also produce more jobs for Americans when compared with increasing domestic production of fossil fuels such as oil and gas.  Sixty-one percent of Americans think alternative energy will create more jobs, a seven-point increase from when the question was asked in the fall of 2016.  Thirty percent think focusing on fossil fuels domestically will create more jobs, down eight points since Sept. 2016.¶Here again, we see large divisions both along party and generational lines.  While Democrats and independents think focusing on alternative energy will produce more jobs, Republicans think increasing domestic production of fossil fuels is more likely to do so.  In general, Americans who don't believe global warming is caused by human activity tend to think greater domestic production of fossil fuels will create more jobs than alternative energy.¶Young people are particularly hopeful that a shift to more alternative energy will produce more jobs:  three in four Americans under 35 think so, compared to just half of those 65 and older.¶This poll was conducted by telephone April 11-15, 2018 among a random sample of 1,004 adults nationwide.  Data collection was conducted on behalf of CBS News by SSRS of Media, PA.  Phone numbers were dialed from samples of both standard land-line and cell phones.¶The poll employed a random digit dial methodology. For the landline sample, a respondent was randomly selected from all adults in the household. For the cell sample, interviews were conducted with the person who answered the phone. ¶Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish using live interviewers. The data have been weighted to reflect U.S. Census figures on demographic variables. ¶The error due to sampling for results based on the entire sample could be plus or minus four percentage points. The error for subgroups may be higher and is available by request.

Many were in smog-plagued California.¶However, the report also said that levels of ""dirty"" air pollution are decreasing in the United States, as tailpipes and smokestacks produce cleaner exhaust.¶Twenty of the 25 most polluted cities experienced fewer days in 2016 when particle pollution levels spiked, the report found.¶These results hint at the potentially pernicious effects of efforts by the Trump administration to undermine the Clean Air Act, Nolen said.¶""Air quality would get worse in many places"" if the landmark law is weakened, Nolen said. ""There are a lot of subtle places where the [U.S. Environmental Protection Agency] could weaken and roll back the progress we have made, and we are very concerned about that.""¶The report evaluated the two types of air pollution that dominate in the United States.¶Ozone, or ""smog,"" is a gas molecule that develops when nitrogen oxides or volatile organic compounds react with heat and sunlight.¶""When there's a lot of pollution and it's really hot, the heat cooks the pollution so it magnifies the ozone in the atmosphere,"" explained Dr. Christy Sadreameli, an assistant professor of pediatric pulmonology with Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.¶Particle pollution is a mix of tiny solid and liquid particles contained in dirty exhaust from vehicles and industry. These airborne particles hamper breathing and can increase a person's risk of lung cancer, the report said.¶The cities with the highest levels of ozone year-round are all in California: Los Angeles-Long Beach; Bakersfield, Visalia-Porterville-Hanford; Fresno-Madera; Sacramento-Roseville; San Diego-Carlsbad, and Modesto-Merced, according to the report.¶""California has particularly struggled because of the topography -- the bowl in the middle and the mountains there on the right-hand side of the state,"" Nolen said. ""Pollution that might normally blow into another state gets trapped in California.""¶Same goes for particle pollution, mostly -- Visalia-Porterville-Hanford; Bakersfield; Los Angeles-Long Beach; Fresno-Madera, and Modesto-Merced are all California cities that top the list.¶But the top city for year-round particle pollution might raise some eyebrows. It's Fairbanks, Alaska, where improved air quality monitoring revealed dangerous levels of pollution.¶""Fairbanks uses wood-burning stoves and wood-burning heat sources to keep themselves warm,"" filling the air with particulate matter from wood smoke, Nolen said.¶The U.S. cities with the cleanest air include Bellingham, Wash.; Burlington-South Burlington, Vt.; Casper, Wyo.; Honolulu; Palm Bay-Melbourne-Titusville, Fla., and Wilmington, N.C.¶The American Lung Association report also noted a number of Trump-led efforts that the association said could lead to worse air quality, including:¶""We need to keep the Clean Air Act strong, and attempts to weaken it are definitely going to cause health effects,"" Sadreameli said. ""Peeling back regulations that will increase pollution is very scary to us.""",0
"Global warming is messing up nature's dinner time, study says","
","
April 17, 2018 / 1:17 PM
      / AP
    ","¶WASHINGTON -- Global warming is screwing up nature's intricately timed dinner hour, often making hungry critters and those on the menu show up at much different times, a new study shows. Timing is everything in nature. Bees have to be around and flowers have to bloom at the same time for pollination to work, and hawks need to migrate at the same time as their prey. In many cases, global warming is interfering with that timing, scientists said. ¶A first-of-its-kind global mega analysis on the biological timing of 88 species that rely on another life form shows that on average species are moving out of sync by about six days a decade, although some pairs are actually moving closer together. ¶While other studies have looked at individual pairs of species and how warming temperatures have changed their migration, breeding and other timing, the study in Monday's Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences gives the first global look at a worsening timing problem. ¶These changes in species timing are considerably greater than they were before the 1980s, the study said. ¶More in Climate Change¶""There isn't really any clear indication that it is going to slow down or stop in the near future,"" said study lead author Heather Kharouba, an ecologist at the University of Ottawa. ¶For example, in the Netherlands, the Eurasian sparrow hawk has been late for dinner because its prey, the blue tit, has -- over 16 years -- arrived almost six days earlier than the hawk. ¶It's most noticeable and crucial in Washington state's Lake Washington, where over the past 25 years, plant plankton are now blooming 34 days earlier than the zooplankton that eat them. That's crucial because that's messing with the bottom of the food chain, Kharouba said. ¶In Greenland, the plants are showing up almost three days earlier than the caribou, so more of the baby caribou are dying ""because there wasn't enough food,"" Kharouba said. ¶With warmer temperatures, most species moved their habits earlier, but interdependent species didn't always move at the same rate. It's the relative speed of changes in timing that's key, Kharouba said. ¶Because of the small number of species involved in small areas over different studies, Kharouba's team could not find a statistically significant link between temperature and changes in how species sync together. But what she saw, she said, ""is consistent with climate change."" ¶Scientists not involved in the study praised the work. ¶""It demonstrates that many species interactions from around the world are in a state of rapid flux,"" Boston University biology professor Richard Primack said in an email. ""Prior to this study, studies of changing species interactions focused on one place or one group of species.""",0
"Global warming is slowing Atlantic Ocean circulation, study finds","
","
April 12, 2018 / 9:58 AM
      / AP
    ","¶WASHINGTON -- Global warming is likely slowing the main Atlantic Ocean circulation, which has plunged to its weakest level on record, according to a new study. The slowdown in the circulation -- a crucial part of Earth's climate -- had been predicted by computer models, but researchers said they can now observe it. It could make for more extreme weather across the Northern Hemisphere, especially Europe, and could increase sea level rise along the U.S. East Coast, they said. ¶The slowdown also raises the prospect of a complete circulation shutdown, which would be a dangerous ""tipping point,"" according to a study Wednesday in the journal Nature.¶Such a shutdown was the premise of the scientifically inaccurate 2004 disaster movie ""The Day After Tomorrow."" Study authors said a collapse is at least decades away but would be a catastrophe. ¶More in Climate Change¶""We know somewhere out there is a tipping point where this current system is likely to break down,"" said study co-author Stefan Rahmstorf, a climate scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. ""We still don't know how far away or close to this tipping point we might be. ... This is uncharted territory."" ¶Some other scientists are skeptical, citing a scarcity of data. ¶The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, called AMOC, is a key conveyor belt for ocean water and air, creating weather. Warm salty water moves north from the tropics along the Gulf Stream off the U.S. East Coast to the North Atlantic, where it cools, sinks and heads south. The faster it moves, the more water is turned over from warm surface to cool depths. ¶""This overturning circulation redistributes heat on our planet,"" said study lead author Levke Caesar, a physicist at the Potsdam Institute. ""It brings heat from the tropics to the high latitudes."" ¶The Caesar study and another one published in the same issue of Nature by a different team indicate that the Atlantic's circulation is the weakest it's been in about 1,500 years. And the slowdown is intensifying. ¶Since the middle of the 20th century, the speed at which the ocean moves water in the AMOC has dropped 15 percent, the study found, using cold subpolar water temperatures as an indirect measurement. And it has plummeted in recent years, the study concluded. ¶The Gulf Stream, the warm water current where hurricanes can power up, historically veers away from the United States around the Carolinas or Virginia. The Gulf Stream now hugs closer to coast around New York, and there's a significantly warmer bulge around Maine related to the circulation slowdown, Rahmstorf and Caesar said. The northern U.S. Atlantic coastal waters have warmed faster than most parts of the ocean in recent decades, researchers said. ¶Scientists blame global warming in a couple of ways. ¶Warmer water lessens the amount of cooling and makes it harder for the water to sink and turn over. Ice sheets and glaciers in Greenland are melting and the fresh water is pouring into the area where the water turns over, making it less salty, less dense and therefore less likely to sink. There's also more rain and snow in northern areas and more evaporation in southern areas, altering the flow, Rahmstorf said. ¶""It's a slow change at the moment, but we're changing it,"" Caesar said. ""One danger is in the unknown of what will happen. We should expect changes."" ¶Rahmstorf and Caesar looked at an established cold patch - about 2 million square miles (5.2 million square kilometers), or the size of India and Mexico combined -- as the indirect measurements for the speed of the AMOC, calling it a fingerprint of the ocean circulation. ¶It's clear that the circulation is weakening, said Colorado State hurricane expert Phil Klotzbach, who wasn't part of the studies. Decades ago, that would have meant weaker Atlantic hurricane activity, but that hasn't been happening and it could mean there is a difference in weakening in winter and summer, he said. ¶Andreas Schmittner at Oregon State University, who also wasn't part of the studies, said the Potsdam group's analysis makes sense, adding that as the world emits more greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels, we can expect it to slow further. ¶But MIT's Carl Wunsch said that the paper's ""assertions of weakening are conceivable, but unsupported by any data."" ¶And Kevin Trenberth of the National Center for Atmospheric Research said his recent work faults regular cycles in the atmosphere more than the ocean. He said the Potsdam study doesn't explain year to year variability, while atmospheric cycles do. ¶Rahmstorf said his study averages data over a decade at a time to render year-to-year changes less meaningful. The work shows that it is ocean circulation that drives the changes in atmosphere, not the other way around, he said. ",0
Los Angeles is painting some of its streets white and the reasons why are pretty cool,"

    ","¶In the race to combat climate change, the city of Los Angeles is employing a surprising new tactic -- covering its streets in a grayish-white coating known as CoolSeal. It's sprayed onto the roadway with trucks, then spread across the surface with squeegees. However, its impact extends far beyond the edge of the pavement.¶Los Angeles, like so many other modern cities, is encased in thousands of miles of asphalt. And dark-colored asphalt absorbs between 80 and 95 percent of the sun's rays, heating up not just the streets themselves but the entire surrounding area. So when temperatures in Southern California rise above 100 degrees Fahrenheit, surface temperatures on its asphalt roads can climb to 150. It exacerbates a phenomenon known as the ""urban heat island effect,"" which the EPA says can add up to 22 degrees Fahrenheit to the average air temperature in a city, compared to the surrounding area.¶CoolSeal, which is made by a company called GuardTop, helps to reflect solar rays off asphalt so that less heat is actually absorbed. And according to the Bureau of Street Services, the L.A. streets that have been rendered lighter in color with CoolSeal are 10 to 15 degrees cooler on average than the L.A. streets that have not. That, in turn, keeps the neighborhood from heating up quite as much. Buildings in the area don't need to use quite as much air conditioning, which can curb costs, benefiting residents' wallets and the environment.¶More in Climate Change¶By cooling the ambient air, lighter-colored asphalt can also help prevent heat-related illnesses and deaths. Its higher reflectivity can save on energy needed to illuminate streets and parking lots when the sun starts to set. And according to the EPA, the air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and water quality depletion driven by heat islands can be mitigated by cool pavements as well.¶The innovative sealcoat is admittedly very pricey, with L.A. reportedly footing a $40,000 bill for every mile it ""paints."" But advocates say its benefits may just be priceless.",0

The Pacific island nation of nearly 1 million people avoided a direct hit from the winds, but heavy rains and flooding caused damage to homes, businesses and vehicles on the western side of the main island, Viti Levu. ¶More than 1,000 people remained in evacuation centers this week as the storm moved away. ¶More in Climate Change¶Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama said climate change was causing extreme weather events to become more severe and occur more often. ¶Last November, he chaired a climate summit in Bonn, Germany, and he spoke Tuesday at the launch of a climate change film in the capital, Suva. He said he was trying to deliver the message to the world about confronting the global warming crisis. ¶It is a ""fight for our very survival,"" he said, and that ""we are now at an almost constant level of threat."" He said countries must limit the global temperature increase, as agreed under the Paris climate accord. ¶President Trump decided to withdraw the U.S. from the agreement, which committed to pursing efforts to limit temperature increases. The deal requires countries to set their own targets for reducing emissions by 2020. It also established a $100 billion fund to help vulnerable countries deal with the effects of climate change. ¶A recent report completed by the World Bank and Fiji officials indicated annual losses from extreme weather events could total 6.5 percent of the economy by 2050, Bainimarama said. ¶The Fiji Red Cross Society said it was distributing supplies to villagers in the hard-hit town of Ba. Authorities were also trying to restore power to some areas which had suffered outages. ¶In 2016, Cyclone Winston ripped through Fiji, killing 44 people and destroying thousands of homes. ¶Similar concerns about the threat from rising seas were echoed in the low-lying South Pacific island nation of Kiribati, about 2,100 miles away. CBS News reported last summer that Kiribati residents fear losing their homes and becoming ""climate refugees."" ¶""We have got to understand that climate change is not a national issue it's a global issue, and we need global thinking.

"""Are things pretty dire? Yes"": Reports see a lonelier planet with fewer plants, animals","

      / AP
    ","¶WASHINGTON -- Earth is losing plants, animals and clean water at a dramatic rate, according to four new United Nations scientific reports that provide the most comprehensive and localized look at the state of biodiversity. Scientists meeting in Colombia issued four regional reports Friday on how well animal and plants are doing in the Americas; Europe and Central Asia; Africa; and the Asia-Pacific area. ¶Their conclusion after three years of study: Nowhere is doing well. ¶The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem was about more than just critters, said study team chairman Robert Watson. It is about keeping Earth livable for humans, because we rely on biodiversity for food, clean water and public health, the prominent British and U.S. scientist said. ¶More in Climate Change¶""This is undermining well-being across the planet, threatening us long-term on food and water,"" Watson said in an interview. ¶Scientists pointed to this week's death of the last male northern white rhino in Africa, severe declines in the numbers of elephants, tigers and pangolins, but said those are only the most visible and charismatic of species that are in trouble. ¶What's happening is a side effect of the world getting wealthier and more crowded with people, Watson said. Humans need more food, more clean water, more energy and more land. And the way society has tried to achieve that has cut down on biodiversity, he said. ¶Crucial habitat has been cut apart, alien species have invaded places, chemicals have hurt plants and animals, wetlands and mangroves that clean up pollution are disappearing, and the world's waters are overfished, he said. ¶Man-made climate change is getting worse, and global warming will soon hurt biodiversity as much as all the other problems combined, Watson said. ¶""We keep making choices to borrow from the future to live well today,"" said Jake Rice, Canada's chief government scientist for fisheries and oceans, who co-chaired the Americas report. ¶Duke University conservationist Stuart Pimm, who wasn't part of the study team, said the reports make sense and are based on well-established scientific data: ""Are things pretty dire? Yes."" ¶Among the regional findings: ¶If current trends continue, by the year 2050 the Americas will have 15 percent fewer plants and animals than now. That means there will be 40 percent fewer plants and animals in the Americas than in the early 1700s. ¶Nearly a quarter of the species that were fully measured are now threatened, Rice said. ¶And when all of ""nature's contributions"" are taken into account, nearly two-thirds are declining and more than one-fifth are ""decreasing strongly,"" Rice said. ¶If trends continue, there will be no ""exploitable fish stocks"" for commercial fishing by 2048. Around that same, the region will lose 45 percent of its biodiversity and about 90 percent of its crucial corals, if nothing changes, said Asia co-chair Sonali Seneratna Sellamuttu, a senior researcher at the International Water Management Institute. ¶""All major ecosystems are threatened in the region,"" she said. ¶Even though it is the region that Watson said may be doing the best, 28 percent of the species that only live in Europe are now threatened. In the last decade, 42 percent of the land plant and animal species have declined, said Europe co-chair Mark Rounsevell of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany. ¶Wetlands have been cut in half since 1970. ¶Africa could lose half of some bird and mammal species by 2100. And more than 60 percent of the continent's people depend on natural resources for their livelihoods, said report co-chair Luthando Dziba of South African National Parks. ¶Already more than 20 percent of Africa's species are threatened, endangered or extinct. ¶While scientists said government and society needs to change its ways, individuals can use less energy, less water and eat less red meat, Watson said. ¶""A balanced diet can really help,"" he said. There are ""lots of individual things you can do."" ¶The outlook is bleak if society doesn't change, but it still can, Watson said. ¶""Some species are threatened with extinctions. Others, just pure numbers will go down,"" Watson said. ""It will be a lonelier place relative to our natural world. It's a moral issue. Do we humans have right to make them go extinct.""",0
Report: Coal not declining fast enough to meet goals of the Paris climate accord,"
","
March 22, 2018 / 12:08 PM
      / AP
    ","¶BILLINGS, Mont. -- Declines in coal power plant construction in China, India and the U.S. are projected to push the heavily-polluting fuel over the edge -- but not fast enough to meet international climate change goals, environmental groups said Wednesday. Coal's dominance as the fuel of choice for generating electricity has been slipping as cheap natural gas and renewable energy sources challenge its decades-long reign. ¶A joint report by the groups CoalSwarm, Sierra Club and Greenpeace projects that by 2022, retirements of older, more polluting coal plants will outpace new plant construction for the first time in the modern era. The findings are in line with data from the International Energy Agency, which recently declared coal was in a ""decade of stagnation"" with demand declining at a level last seen in the early 1990s. ¶Having fewer coal-fired plants would bolster international efforts to move away from the cheap and widely available fuel. Coal accounted for about 70 percent of worldwide power sector emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide in 2016, according to the International Energy Agency estimates. ¶More in Climate Change¶Yet the authors of Wednesday's report and independent analysts agree the pace of decline is still too slow to meet the goals of the Paris climate accord. The 2015 agreement was intended to fend off the worst effects of climate change by holding global temperature increases to no more than 2 degrees centigrade (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). ¶""There is no way that we see right now that you can hold to a two-degree centigrade limit like scientists want us to if coal is in the mix,"" said Andy Roberts, global coal research director for the consulting firm Wood Mackenzie. ""The wild card in all that is the research dollars being spent in renewable energy...That could be a game changer."" ¶In the U.S., President Donald Trump's vociferous promotion of coal has had at best a modest impact on the industry. Wednesday's report noted that the U.S. currently has no new coal plants under construction. ¶In India and China, coal project cancellations have been growing as the world's two most populous nations struggle to clear polluted skies that have had dramatic negative health impacts. ¶Combined, they've shelved more than 500 gigawatts of coal projects that were once on the drawing board -- equivalent to more than 1,000 coal-burning power units, according to CoalSwarm director Ted Nace. ¶Still, there are pockets of expected growth, according to Roberts and other observers, with new plants expected to go up in southeast Asia, Turkey and Pakistan. ¶In China -- by far the world's largest coal consumer -- the amount of coal that was mined increased about 3 percent in 2017 to reverse a dramatic drop the previous year, according to government figures. That reflects the stance by China's leaders that coal will remain a key piece of its ongoing economic expansion, even as the communist nation has become the world leader in renewable energy development. ¶Pointing to China's example, industry representatives stress that coal remains essential to balancing the global energy budget into the foreseeable future. Potential increases in India and southeast Asia ""will be the driving force of demand for coal in the decades to come,"" said Benjamin Sporton, chief executive of the World Coal Association. ¶""To put in some context, even with the cancellation of some proposed plants, planned capacity additions in India are still more than three times greater than Germany, a major coal user,"" Sporton said in a statement released by the London-based organization in response to Wednesday's report. ¶The group did not directly dispute the claim that coal's growth in the power sector will peak by 2022. ¶Meanwhile, finding money to build coal plants is getting harder, Roberts said. That's driven in part by some major investors such as pension funds and multinational insurance companies that have pledged to stay away from coal projects because of their air pollution and climate impacts. ¶The head of Storebrand Asset Management, Norway's largest private asset manager with more than $90 billion under management, Jan Erik Saugestad said coal investors ""are living on borrowed time"" as institutional money instead pours into solar and wind projects. Storebrand began divesting from coal in 2013. ",0
Fight mounts to save coral reefs in the Seychelles,"

    ","¶BEAU VALLON, Seychelles -- Beneath the crystal-clear waters of the Indian Ocean island nation of the Seychelles, a fight is growing to save the coral reefs that shelter a range of creatures -- from tiny invertebrates to the sprawling octopus -- from climate change. The fragile reefs act both as a protective barrier for coastlines and an attraction for the tourists who keep the country's economy going. But the reefs are also one of the first victims of rising ocean temperatures. ¶The Seychelles in some areas lost up to 90 percent of its coral reefs in 1998 in an environmental event known as bleaching, where coral in warming waters expel the colorful algae that live within their skeletons and, without their nutrients, starve. Another bleaching event occurred in 2016 after the reefs had partly recovered, said David Rowat, chairman of the Marine Conservation Society Seychelles. ¶With further threats including overfishing and pollution, coral reefs around the world will reach their tipping point before the end of the century, disappearing more quickly than they can restore themselves, according to a study published in the journal Science last month. ¶More in Climate Change¶The Seychelles government this year announced a pioneering deal where it swapped part of its sovereign debt for investment in marine protection areas. ¶Already, conservationists have launched a number of coral reef restoration projects around the nation's 115 islands. In one, more than 50,000 coral fragments have been nurtured and transplanted by a local charity, Nature Seychelles, in what the organization calls the world's largest coral restoration program. ¶The Marine Conservation Society has both land- and ocean-based coral nursery sites. ¶On a recent afternoon, an employee at one site in Beau Vallon painstakingly cleaned a nursery tank with a toothbrush. She and project leader Chloe Pozas spent the morning transferring tiny coral fragments, once collected from the sea floor, from the tanks to an underwater ""rope nursery,"" or improvised skeleton. ¶""When the corals are going to reach a suitable size, when they are big enough, they are going to be outplanted back on the reef,"" Pozas said. ¶About 2,800 kilometers -- 1,700 miles -- away off the island of Curieuse, the Seychelles National Park Authority has been moving corals grown in another rope nursery. ¶Divers delicately transfer the tiny corals to a degraded reef in a national marine park, then attach them using non-toxic epoxy resin. ¶After the 2016 bleaching event, experts noticed that some corals were more resilient than others. Those ""super corals"" were chosen for regrowth and transplanting. ¶""Restoration is really only a tool to try to help the reef to recover faster, especially because coral bleaching is projected to happen annually by 2050,"" Pozas said. ¶The Seychelles government is working with Nature Seychelles to secure funding for a proposal to upscale coral farming efforts to a larger operation using new methods. The aim is to commercialize part of the operation so that it can financially sustain reef restoration well into the future, according to Nature Seychelles. ¶Those whose livelihoods rely on tourism are watching the efforts with interest. ¶""Obviously we have divers and snorklers and if we can continue to have healthy reefs and lots of fish, we got happy divers, they do lots of dives, the dive center makes more business, the government gets more tax money and everybody is happy,"" said Glynis Rowat, who has managed one of the oldest diving centers in Beau Vallon for over 30 years.",0

I've been on inhalers, been put on nose sprays and then I've been getting these shots on top of it,"" she told CBS News.¶Experts say symptoms for allergy sufferers like Ehrman might only get worse over time, because rising temperatures from climate change and more carbon dioxide in the air are causing many pollen-producing plants to bloom earlier – and last longer – thus prolonging allergy season.¶Dr. Joseph Shapiro, an allergist and immunologist in Los Angeles, says his office is now flooded with patients year round.¶""New patient visits are coming in at different times of year that I did not use to see,"" he said.¶According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 50 million Americans suffer from allergies each year. While allergies are more common in children, they can occur for the first time at any age. ¶With allergy seasons growing longer and more intense, experts say many people are developing seasonal allergies for the first time well into their adulthood.¶Shapiro said many of his patients' symptoms are more severe than in the past, and he expects the trend to continue, as well.¶""A recent study showed that pollen counts are likely to double by the year 2040, so in a little more than 20 years we're going to see a significant increase,"" he said.¶Allergists say early spring is the critical time to start your seasonal allergy medications. Often people wait until the season is well underway to take their medications, but by then their symptoms are already severe. ¶Ehrman recently started on allergy shots and thinks they may be doing the trick.¶""We've been doing about three a week,"" she said.¶These injections contain some or all of the allergens causing a patient's problems. Gradually, the injections get stronger, and over time, symptoms lessen. Talk to your doctor about possible allergy treatments that are right for you.",0

More than two billion people are compelled to drink unsafe water, and more than 4.5 billion people do not have safely managed sanitation services.¶""The ecosystems on which life itself is based – our food security, energy sustainability, public health, jobs, cities – are all at risk because of how water is managed today,"" World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim said.¶More in Climate Change¶""The world can no longer afford to take water for granted,"" he said.¶The wars of the 21st century may be fought over water, some scientists and policymakers argue, and the demand for fresh drinking water to drink and grow food has surged, ""60 Minutes"" correspondent Lesley Stahl reported in 2014, and the problem has only gotten worse.¶While presenting the new report, Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the Netherlands said, ""We must work to tackle global water crises now. There is no other option.""¶""The innovative solutions of today's creative minds can safeguard the future of generations to come,"" Rutte said.¶But, that said, freshwater shortages are increasing.¶""The problems of water are many, like more intense droughts caused by climate change, such as the one that parts of East Africa is experiencing now,"" Dan Shepard, an information officer with the U.N.

Get used to nor'easters -- Arctic warming may mean more severe winters in the Northeast,"

    ","¶As average temperatures rise across the planet, the frozen Arctic is heating up faster than anywhere else.¶With that warmth comes a surprising twist: Unusually warm Arctic winter temperatures are linked to bitter cold and snow in other parts of the Northern Hemisphere, such as the northeastern U.S., parts of northern Europe and northern Asia, according to an analysis of 66 years' worth of climate data.  ¶And the relationship between Arctic warmth and severe winter weather was strongest in in the northeastern U.S. -- in fact, a temperature spike in the Arctic meant that the U.S. Northeast was two to four times more likely than usual to experience a bout of extreme winter weather, the scientists reported in a new study. [The 10 Worst Blizzards in U.S. History]¶More in Climate Change¶Past climate projections predicted that, in a warming world, winters would be the seasons to heat up the fastest -- and yet recent winters in the Northern Hemisphere were more severe than scientists anticipated, said Judah Cohen, the study's lead author and director of seasonal forecasting at Atmospheric and Environmental Research, an organization that assesses risks from weather events and climate change.¶To understand what might be driving these unusual episodes, Cohen and his colleagues looked at pulses of warmth in the Arctic during winter months, to see how they lined up against weather anomalies elsewhere in the globe.¶""When the Arctic pulse is warm, you tend to get an increase in occurrences of extreme winter weather across the midlatitudes, including the eastern U.S., northern Europe and northern Asia,"" Cohen told Live Science.¶The relationship between spiking Arctic warmth and pockets of cold to the south was ""really, really strong"" -- and it was strongest in the eastern U.S., Cohen said.¶Since 1990, the eastern U.S. has been visited by winter storms so severe that they earned highly dramatic nicknames, such as ""Snowzilla,"" ""Snowmaggeddon"" and ""Snowpocalypse."" The increase in incidences of extreme storms with heavy snowfall corresponded with periods of excessive Arctic warmth, the study authors wrote.¶How does this relationship work? As the scientists' observations reflected only the comparison of weather patterns over time -- and not what was driving them -- the researchers could not conclude that a warmer Arctic was directly responsible for harsh winter storms in the U.S., they reported in the study.¶But answers may lie in another atmospheric disturbance linked to a warming Arctic, Cohen said.¶According to the study, data from past decades showed that fall snow cover in Siberia increased as the Arctic warmed, which cooled northeastern Eurasia. Meanwhile, melting sea ice fueled warmer temperatures in northwestern Eurasia.¶These air-temperature changes close to the surface led to similar changes higher up in the atmosphere. This, in turn, affected the jet stream -- a conveyor belt of wind that carries warm air and moisture around the globe -- by increasing its ""waviness,"" making jetstream waves dive farther south and stretch farther to the north. In turn, this extra amplification can alter the movement of cold air masses near the pole, otherwise known as the polar vortex, Cohen explained.¶And this disturbance of the polar vortex could end up shaping conditions that worsen winter weather in the U.S.¶""The cold air that's normally confined to the Arctic, it's kind of dammed in by the polar vortex itself -- because winds normally blow from west to east inside the polar vortex, so it acts as barrier, keeps the cold air to the north and the mild air to the south,"" Cohen said. ""When it breaks down, the cold air that's penned up in the Arctic spills to lower latitudes, and that's when you get those episodes of severe winter weather.""¶Arctic scientists like to say that ""what happens in the Arctic doesn't stay in the Arctic,"" but the interconnectivity between Earth's dynamic atmospheric systems is no laughing matter, Cohen said. The complexity of these systems is reflected in emerging disruptions that are likely the products of climate change, though there is still much to be learned about how climate change could shape weather patterns around the world, the study authors reported.  ¶""I'd argue that our expectations for climate change were overly simplistic,"" Cohen said. ""It was kind of expected that if you warm the Arctic, the only thing that's going to lead to is just milder temperatures everywhere -- and that's not a complete picture.""¶The findings were published online today (March 13) in the journal Nature Communications.¶Original article on Live Science.",0
"""Crazy, crazy stuff"": Arctic has its warmest winter on record","
","
March 7, 2018 / 3:12 PM
      / AP
    ","¶WASHINGTON -- Winter at the top of the world wimped out this year. The Arctic just finished its warmest winter on record. And sea ice hit record lows for this time of year, with plenty of open water where ocean water normally freezes into thick sheets of ice, new U.S. weather data show. ¶ Scientists say what's happening is unprecedented, part of a global warming-driven vicious cycle that likely plays a role in strong, icy storms in Europe and the U.S. Northeast.  ¶""It's just crazy, crazy stuff,"" said Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado, who has been studying the Arctic since 1982. ""These heat waves, I've never seen anything like this.""¶More in Climate Change¶It's been so unusually warm that the land weather station closest to the North Pole -- at the tip of Greenland -- spent more than 60 hours above freezing in February. Before this year, scientists had seen the temperature there rise above freezing in February only twice before, and only ever so briefly. Last month's record-hot temperatures at Cape Morris Jesup have been more like those in May, said Ruth Mottram, a climate scientist at the Danish Meteorological Institute.¶But it's more than that one place. Across the Arctic Circle in Barrow, Alaska, February was 18 degrees (10 degrees Celsius) warmer than normal and the entire winter averaged 14 degrees (7.8 degrees Celsius) above normal. Of nearly three dozen different Arctic weather stations, 15 of them were at least 10 degrees (5.6 degrees Celsius) above normal for the winter, according to data from climatologist Brian Brettschneider of the International Arctic Research Center at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.¶Meteorologists consider December, January and February to be winter, and Arctic weather stations averaged 8.8 degrees (4.9 degrees Celsius) warmer than normal for the season that just ended. The air above the Chukchi and Bering seas near Alaska averaged about 20 degrees (11 degrees Celsius) warmer than normal for February, the data center reported.¶""The extended warmth really has kind of staggered all of us,"" Mottram said.¶In February, Arctic sea ice covered 5.4 million square miles (13.9 million square kilometers), about 62,000 square miles (160,000 square kilometers) smaller than last year's record low, the ice data center said Tuesday. The difference is an area about the size of the state of Georgia. Sea ice coverage in February also was 521,000 square miles (1.4 million square kilometers) below the 30-year normal - an area nearly twice the size of Texas.¶Sea ice is frozen ocean water that -- in contrast to icebergs and glaciers -- forms, grows and melts on the ocean. It is still growing, but ""whatever we grow now is going to be thin stuff"" that easily melts in the summer, Serreze said.¶Near Greenland, warm air moved north up over a section of the Atlantic that usually has sea ice, Mottram said. Something similar was happening in the Pacific with open water on the normally iced up Bering Sea, said data center senior scientist Walt Meier. To be happening on opposite sides of the Arctic at the same time is unusual, Meier said.  ¶While some natural weather fronts were involved, ""climate change is the overriding thing,"" Meier said. ""When you have warmer temperatures you are going to melt more ice and it's going to grow more slowly.""¶In the winter, sea ice ""acts as a lid to keep the warmth of the water at bay"" but when there is less sea ice, more heat goes into the air, Brettschneider said. ""You end up with a vicious cycle of warm air preventing sea ice formation and lack of sea ice allowing warmth to escape into the air.""¶One scientific theory is that this is changing weather further south and plays a role with extreme events, especially in winter.¶The theory is still debated but gaining acceptance. It suggests that reduced sea ice, especially in the winter, reduces the difference in atmospheric pressure between the Arctic and mid-latitudes, weakening the jet stream. The jet stream is the usually fast-moving west-east current of air that affects daily weather and moves storm fronts along. A weaker jet stream often means strange weather, leaving storms stuck in place for days on end, said one of the theory's leading proponents, Rutgers University's Jennifer Francis. She points to recent U.S. nor'easters and freak snowstorms in Europe.¶""This is what we've been talking about; it couldn't be more classic,"" Francis said. ""If you look at the whole picture, the whole jet stream around the northern hemisphere, it's had these very large excursions north and south and that's led to all of the wacky weather.""¶""The underlying disease that's causing this is getting worse,"" Francis said, referring to heat-trapping gases from the burning of coal, oil and gas. ""These are just the symptoms.""",0
Huge penguin colony discovered on remote Antarctic islands,"

    ","¶A thriving hotspot of some 1.5 million Adelie penguins has been discovered on the remote Danger Islands in the east Antarctic, surprised scientists announced Friday. Just 100 miles away in the west Antarctic, the same species is in decline due to sea ice melt blamed on global warming, they said.¶The first complete census revealed that the Danger Islands host more than 750,000 breeding pairs of Adelie penguins, more than the rest of the Antarctic Peninsula region combined, the team reported in the journal Scientific Reports.¶It included the third and fourth-largest Adelie penguin colonies in the world.¶More in Climate Change¶The find ""is certainly surprising and it has real consequences for how we manage this region,"" study co-author Heather Lynch of Stony Brook University told AFP.¶The islands, which lie at the tip of Antarctica nearest South America, have rarely been visited, and the new discovery was thanks to Earth-monitoring satellites, the team from America, Britain and France, said.¶""This is called the Danger Islands for a reason,"" explained Lynch.¶""The area is covered by heavy sea ice most of the year, and even in the height of summer it is difficult to get into this region to do surveys.""¶Evidence of the previously-unknown penguin colony first emerged in data from the Landsat Earth-monitoring satellites run by NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey.¶Lynch and her team ""then went and looked at higher resolution commercial imagery to confirm the guano staining that our algorithms had picked up in the Landsat imagery,"" she said.¶When the Landsat data originally suggested the presence of hundreds of thousands of penguins on the islands, she thought it ""was a mistake"". ¶""We were surprised to find so many penguins on these islands, especially because some of these islands were not known to have penguins.""¶Then followed a field expedition for a headcount.¶""We were... very lucky to have a window of time where the sea ice moved out and we could get a yacht in,"" said Lynch.¶The Danger Islands, said the team, has felt the ravages of climate change less than western Antarctic zones, and knew very little human activity.¶But it may need protection from overfishing nevertheless. Krill, an Adelie staple, is caught in the area.¶""The most important implication of this work is related to the design of Marine Protected Areas in the region,"" said Lynch.¶""Now that we know this tiny island group is so important, it can be considered for further protection from fishing.""",0

Northern cities are projected to experience the biggest rise in flooding. Most cities in Europe are also expected to experience more frequent droughts and river flooding in what researchers called a ""high impact"" scenario.¶More in Climate Change¶""The research highlights the urgent need to design and adapt our cities to cope with these future conditions,"" Richard Dawson, co-author and lead investigator of the study, said in a statement. He pointed to already worsening conditions in some cities, like flooding in Paris, and warned that scenarios like the ongoing drought in Cape Town, South Africa may soon be familiar to Europeans.¶In trying to forecast how cities across Europe will be affected, the researchers predict that flooding will worsen the most in Dublin, Ireland; Helsinki, Finland; Riga, Latvia; Vilnius, Lithuania; and Zagreb, Croatia. Heatwaves are likely to become longer and hotter in Athens, Greece; Nicosia, Cyprus; Prague, Czech Republic; Rome, Italy; Sofia, Bulgaria; Stockholm, Sweden; Valletta, Malta; and Vienna, Austria.

"Climate scientists mull Category 6 storm classification, report says","

    ","¶A powerful storm that lashed the Caribbean before it barreled into Florida in September prompted the National Weather Service to issue a warning amid false reports of a Category 6 storm: ""Keep your eyes out for fake forecasts."" At least one meteorologist sought to set the record straight: ""There is no such thing as ... a Category 6 or higher hurricane,"" he posted on Facebook.¶The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, which is used to estimate potential property damage, rates hurricanes on a scale of 1 to 5 based on a storm's wind speed, according to the National Hurricane Center. The scale tops out at Category 5 for any hurricane with sustained winds of 157 mph or higher. But that September storm, Hurricane Irma, hit 185 mph, breaking the Atlantic Ocean record, and other parts of the world have seen even worse.¶Now, the mounting intensity and lifespan of tropical cyclones has sparked the question among climate scientists: is a new classification needed? Should there actually be a Category 6 storm? ¶More in Climate Change¶Climate scientists meeting in New Zealand have floated the idea, The Guardian reports. ¶""Since the scale is now used as much in a scientific context as it is a damage assessment context, it makes sense to introduce a category six to describe the unprecedented strength 200 mph storms we've seen over the past few years both globally [Patricia] and here in the southern hemisphere [Winston],"" said climatologist Michael Mann, director of Penn State University's Earth System Science Center.¶""Scientifically, [six] would be a better description of the strength of 200 mph (320km/h) storms, and it would also better communicate the well-established finding now that climate change is making the strongest storms even stronger,"" he said.¶James Shaw, New Zealand's climate change minister, said the only reason 2016's Winston -- the strongest cyclone ever recorded in the Southern Hemisphere -- wasn't a Category 6 was because there is no such category. ""But we might need one in the future,"" Shaw said at the conference in New Zealand, The Guardian reported.¶However, Chris Brandolino, the principal scientist at the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research in New Zealand, said, ""if we are seriously to consider this it requires a holistic approach, looking at the whole scale, not just adding a category.""¶""Maybe the whole scale gets rejigged to reflect the times,"" Brandolino said.",0
Could California drought restrictions slash water rights? Some think so,"
","
February 21, 2018 / 12:02 PM
      / AP
    ","¶SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- A proposal to make California's drought-era water restrictions permanent could allow the state to chip away at long-held water rights in an unprecedented power grab, representatives from water districts and other users told regulators Tuesday. Members of the state Water Resources Control Board delayed a decision about whether to bring back what had been temporary water bans from California's drought, spanning 2013 to 2017. The plan is part of an effort to make water conservation a way of life, with climate change expected to lead to longer, more severe droughts. ¶It comes after U.S. officials declared that nearly half the state, all of it in the south, is back in drought just months after emerging from it. ¶Officials from several irrigation and water agencies said the restrictions are reasonable, but not the plan to impose them under the state Constitution's prohibition on the ""waste or unreasonable use"" of water. That would create a slippery slope of allowing the board to repeatedly chip away at California's historic protection of water rights for landowners, they said. ¶More in Climate Change¶""Erratic individuals can occupy great positions of power in government, and you had better believe they will occupy your chair someday,"" said Jackson Minasian, an attorney for Stanford Vina Ranch Irrigation Co. ""Their view of what is 'waste and unreasonable use' will be radically different than yours."" ¶Some water users also said permanent mandates would be too rigid in a sprawling state with needs that vary by region. ¶The restrictions, punishable by a $500 fine, include prohibitions on watering lawns so much that the water flows into the street, using a hose to wash down sidewalks or using a hose without an automatic shut-off nozzle to wash cars. A final decision is now expected by April 17. ¶Hotels would have to ask guests if they really need their towels and sheets washed each day. Running an ornamental fountain without a recirculating system would be barred, as would watering outside within 48 hours of a good rain. Another measure would give cities and counties until 2025 to stop watering ordinary street medians. ¶Restaurants would be allowed to serve water only on request if the governor declares a drought emergency. ¶Water officials expect neighbors to be responsible for detecting and reporting most of the wasteful water use, and they have no plans to add more enforcement officers if the permanent restrictions are adopted. ¶Generally, first-time offenders would get warnings, while repeat offenders risk fines. ¶Environmental groups urged officials to crack down more aggressively on wasteful water use rather than rely on policies that encourage neighbors to develop good practices. ¶Water board chairwoman Felicia Marcus said the restrictions are hardly a long-term solution to California's drought problems but ""the least we should do."" ¶""We're not in an emergency right now, but shame on us if we just bury our heads in the sand ... allow people to go out and waste water by washing down the driveway with a hose when a broom would do,"" she said. ¶The plan also includes legislation that would create customized water-use limits for urban water districts, which would risk state enforcement if they fell short. Lawmakers also are considering whether to allow districts to enforce drought regulations, a power now reserved for the state. ¶Gov. Jerry Brown lifted California's emergency drought status a year ago, after a wet winter. Strict 25 percent conservation orders for cities and towns and other restrictions then were phased out. ¶Some climate scientists say the drought never fully ended in parts of Southern California. The Los Angeles area has received just a fourth of normal rainfall so far this rainy season. ¶In the Northern Sierra Nevada, the winter so far has been the third-driest on record for the year's wettest three months -- December, January and February -- produced very little rainfall, said John Leahigh of the California Department of Water Resources. ¶The water content of the Sierra snowpack, which feeds water supplies, is about 20 percent of normal for this time of year, he said. ¶Most of California's reservoirs are at or slightly above their historical average for this time of year, but experts expect that to fall when water is released in the spring and summer and not enough melting snow can replenish it. ¶""This is a very ugly picture in terms of the water supply management,"" Leahigh said.",0
"""It's a big deal"": Melting ice sheets are accelerating sea level rise","

    ","¶WASHINGTON -- Melting ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica are speeding up the already fast pace of sea level rise, new satellite research shows. At the current rate, the world's oceans on average will be at least 2 feet -- 61 centimeters -- higher by the end of the century compared to today, according to researchers who published in Monday's Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences. ¶Sea level rise is caused by warming of the ocean and melting from glaciers and ice sheets. The research, based on 25 years of satellite data, shows that pace has quickened, mainly from the melting of massive ice sheets. It confirms scientists' computer simulations and is in line with predictions from the United Nations, which releases regular climate change reports. ¶""It's a big deal"" because the projected sea level rise is a conservative estimate and it is likely to be higher, said lead author Steve Nerem of the University of Colorado. ¶Outside scientists said even small changes in sea levels can lead to flooding and erosion. ¶More in Climate Change¶""Any flooding concerns that coastal communities have for 2100 may occur over the next few decades,"" Oregon State University coastal flooding expert Katy Serafin said in an email. ¶Of the 3 inches -- 7.5 centimeters -- of sea level rise in the past quarter century, about 55 percent is from warmer water expanding, and the rest is from melting ice. But the process is accelerating, and more than three-quarters of that acceleration since 1993 is due to melting ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, the study shows. ¶Like weather and climate, there are two factors in sea level rise: year-to-year small rises and falls that are caused by natural events and larger long-term rising trends that are linked to man-made climate change. Nerem's team removed the natural effects of the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo volcano eruption that temporarily chilled Earth and the temperature variations linked to El Nino and La Nina, and found the accelerating trend. ¶Sea level rise, more than temperature, is a better gauge of climate change in action, said Anny Cazenave, director of Earth Science at the International Space Science Institute in France, who edited the study. Cazenave is one of the pioneers of space-based sea level research. ¶Global sea levels were stable for about 3,000 years until the 20th century when they rose and then accelerated due to global warming caused by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, said climate scientist Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute in Germany, who wasn't part of the study. ¶Two feet of sea level rise by the end of the century ""would have big effects on places like Miami and New Orleans, but I don't still view that as catastrophic"" because those cities can survive -- at great expense -- that amount of rising seas under normal situations, Nerem said. But when a storm hits like 2012's Superstorm Sandy, sea level rise on top of storm surge can lead to record-setting damages, researchers said. ¶Some scientists at the American Geophysical Union meeting last year said Antarctica may be melting faster than predicted by Monday's study. Greenland has caused three times more sea level rise than Antarctica so far, but ice melt on the southern continent is responsible for more of the acceleration. ¶""Antarctica seems less stable than we thought a few years ago,"" Rutgers climate scientist Robert Kopp said.",0

    ","¶When the mercury's rising in your thermometer, it may also be rising in the ocean.¶According to a new study published Feb. 5 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, there may be more than 15 million gallons (58 million liters) of mercury buried in the permafrost of the Northern Hemisphere — roughly twice as much mercury as can be found in the rest of Earth's soils, ocean and atmosphere combined. And if global temperatures continue to rise, all that mercury could come pouring out.¶In geology, permafrost is defined as any soil that has been frozen for more than two years. In the Northern Hemisphere, permafrost accounts for about 8.8 million square miles (22.79 million square kilometers) of land — or roughly 24 percent of exposed Earth, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. Over time, naturally occurring compounds in the atmosphere, such as mercury and carbon dioxide, can bind with organic material in the soil and be frozen into permafrost, potentially remaining trapped underground for thousands of years before it thaws, the new paper said. [5 Deadly Diseases Emerging From Global Warming]¶More in Climate Change¶In the study, researchers drilled 13 permafrost soil cores from various sites in Alaska between 2004 and 2012. Then, they measured the total amounts of mercury and carbon in each sample, which proved consistent with thousands of other soil cores taken from other sites around the world, the paper said. Using the mercury contents of their 13 cores as a springboard, the researchers estimated the total amount of mercury sealed away below North American permafrost to be roughly 793 gigagrams — or more than 15 million gallons.¶""There would be no environmental problem if everything remained frozen, but we know the Earth is getting warmer,"" study author Paul Schuster, a hydrologist at the U.S. Geological Survey in Boulder, Colorado, said in a statement. ""This discovery is a game-changer.""¶Researchers have already observed climate-change-induced permafrost thawing, and there is likely more on the way: According to a 2013 study, the Northern Hemisphere will lose anywhere from 30 to 99 percent of its permafrost by 2100, assuming current human greenhouse-gas emissions continue unabated.¶Previous studies have attempted to account for the billions of tons of carbon dioxide, methane and even ""zombie pathogens"" that could be loosed into the air and the oceans by melting permafrost. The environmental impact of a large-scale mercury leak, however, remains an unpredictable problem.¶One major concern is that this trapped mercury could seep into nearby waterways and transform into methylmercury, a toxin that can cause motor impairment and birth defects in animals, Edda Mutter, science director for the Yukon River Inter-Tribal Watershed Council, said in a statement. Such contamination could travel swiftly up the food chain from microorganisms to humans, said Mutter, who was not involved in the new study.¶""Rural communities in Alaska and other northern areas have a subsistence lifestyle, making them vulnerable to methylmercury contaminating their food supply,"" Mutter added.¶The researchers are currently working on a follow-up study modeling the release of permafrost due to climate change, according to the statement.¶Originally published on Live Science.",0

The global trade in seaweed harvested for carrageenan was worth $1 billion in 2015, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and Zanzibar is one of the world's top producers.¶When the first commercial farms were set up on the archipelago in the late 1980s, they were in the shallow waters by the beach, where conditions for growth were optimal. For cultural reasons, the shallows in Zanzibar were considered women's spaces. The deep sea, however, where men would go to fish, was a no-go zone for women. The slow pace of seaweed farming also lessened its appeal for men, who were used to receiving a daily paycheck.¶""There was even some funny joke that if they find the men there growing seaweed they say, 'Look (at) that guy, that is a women's activity, not for (a) man,'"" said Makame Salim, who works for a local seaweed export company. ¶Seaweed farming, therefore, fell to women, who had previously depended entirely on their husbands for financial support. As Zanzibar's industry grew, so did the profits for its female farmers. Within a decade, rural Zanzibari women were taking home significant sums of money and had become breadwinners in their families.¶""I thank god for the earnings from seaweed,"" farmer Maryam Mwazi told CBS News.¶""I don't depend on anyone, including my husband. Whatever I want, I can do it,"" she said.¶In 2001, crops began to fail. The most valuable species of seaweed, Cottonii, was suddenly struggling to grow, and algae blooms choked plants that did manage to thrive. Zanzibar's production of Cottonii began to drop radically; by 2015, it had fallen by a massive 94 percent.¶Water temperatures in the Indian Ocean were rising, turning the previously hospitable shallow growing areas into Cottonii dead zones. In the late 1990's, the average surface sea temperature (SST) in the shallow water was 86 degrees Fahrenheit, perfect for seaweed cultivation. In 2013, temperatures in the farms were recorded as high as 100 degrees Fahrenheit.¶""Climate change is not only an environmental issue, it's an economic issue,"" said Dr. Islam Salum, of Zanzibar's Ministry of Agriculture. ""We have to approach it very carefully and make sure we can adapt.""¶What the plants needed to grow were cooler waters, which Zanzibar had – further from shore. One challenge facing deep water farming was physical; stronger currents would break up the plants before they had a chance to develop.  But another challenge was to the farmers themselves. Many of the female farmers can't swim.¶ ""Now there's a shift,"" said Dr. Islam, ""from woman dominated farming, to men.""¶Dr. Msuya began looking for a solution to save Zanzibar's struggling seaweed industry -- and women's place in it.¶A technology used in Brazil offered hope. Rather than the pegs and ropes used in shallow waters, the Brazilians use tubular nets to surround the plants in stronger currents, so they don't break off or float away.¶Adapting the nets to incorporate local materials, Dr, Msuya began working with female seaweed farmers in the small village of Muungoni, one of the only locations on Zanzibar's main island that still had enough Cottonii left after the die offs to run her experiment.¶The women were given net-making lessons, life jackets, access to a small boat, and a male helper to drive it and dive into the sea to plant and gather the crops. Over two years, the pilot project produced good yields, and women, like Maryam Mwazi, have continued to profit from seaweed. ¶Dr. Msuya hopes to continue to develop her deep water farming technique so it can be rolled out across the entire Western Indian Ocean. ¶""We have the women losing their crop, losing their income,"" she told CBS News. ""I really feel I am fighting for gender equality.""¶Ali Sultan contributed to this report.",0
"Even without El Niño, Earth's temperatures continue to rise","

    ","¶WASHINGTON -- Earth last year wasn't quite as hot as 2016's record-shattering mark, but it ranked second or third, depending on who was counting.¶Either way, scientists say it showed a clear signal of man-made global warming because it was the hottest year they've seen without an El Niño boosting temperatures naturally.¶The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the United Kingdom's meteorological office on Thursday announced that 2017 was the third hottest year on record. At the same time, NASA and researchers from a nonprofit in Berkeley, California, called it the second.¶More in Climate Change¶The agencies slightly differ because of how much they count an overheating Arctic, where there are gaps in the data.¶The global average temperature in 2017 was 58.51 degrees (14.7 degrees Celsius), which is 1.51 degrees (0.84 Celsius) above the 20th century average and just behind 2016 and 2015, NOAA said.  Other agencies' figures were close but not quite the same.¶Earlier, European forecasters called 2017 the second hottest year, while the Japanese Meteorological Agency called it the third hottest. Two other scientific groups that use satellite, not ground, measurements split on 2017 being second or third hottest. With four teams calling it the second hottest year and four teams calling it third, the United Nations' World Meteorological Organization termed 2017 a tie for second with 2015.¶However, experts say it doesn't really matter which year is hottest, instead, it's important to look at long-term trends. ¶""Seventeen of the 18 warmest years on record have all been during this century,"" said Petteri Taalas, World Meteorological Organization Secretary-General. ""The degree of warming during the past three years has been exceptional.""¶""Arctic warmth has been especially pronounced and this will have profound and long-lasting repercussions on sea levels, and on weather patterns in other parts of the world.""¶During an El Niño year -- when a warming of the central Pacific changes weather worldwide -- the globe's annual temperature can spike, naturally, by a tenth or two of a degree, scientists said. There was a strong El Niño during 2015 and 2016.¶But 2017 finished with a La Nina, the cousin of El Niño  that lowers temperatures. Had there been no man-made warming, 2017 would have been average or slightly cooler than normal, said National Center for Atmospheric Research climate scientist Ben Sanderson.¶On the other hand, NASA calculated if the temperature contributions of El Niño  and El Niña were removed from the global data through the years, 2017 would go down as the hottest year on record, NASA chief climate scientist Gavin Schmidt said.¶Carbon pollution is like putting the Earth on an escalator of rising temperatures, with natural variation such as El Niño or the cooling effect of volcanoes like hopping up or down a step or two on that escalator, scientists said. Not every year will be warmer than the last because of natural variations, but the trend over years will be rising temperatures, they said.¶The observed warming has been predicted within a few tenths of a degree in computer simulations going back to the 1970s and 1980s, several scientists said.¶It has been 33 years since the last month that the globe was cooler than normal, according to NOAA.¶Northern Illinois University climate scientist Victor Gensini has never lived through a month or year that wasn't hotter than normal.¶""I look at pictures of the great winters of the late '70s from my parents and wonder if I'll ever experience anything like that in my lifetime,"" said Gensini, who's 31.",0

            EPA chief Scott Pruitt: Industry is necessary partner - CBS News
    ",CBS News,"January 17, 2018, 5:18 PM","¶Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt told CBS News that a partnership with ""industry"" is necessary in order for the agency to protect the environment.¶""This paradigm that says we have to choose industry over the environment or the environment over industry is the old way of thinking,"" Pruitt told CBS News' chief White House correspondent Major Garrett in an interview Wednesday.¶""Now that serves political ends but it doesn't serve the environment because I will tell you this: to achieve what we want to achieve in environmental protection, environmental stewardship, we need the partnership of industry,"" he added.¶Pruitt, who has been accused by critics of being too cozy with special interest groups and executives and advocates of the fossil fuel industry, defended these relationships as necessary for environmental stewardship. The former Oklahoma Attorney General, cited his experience as a prosecutor, and called it ""wrong-headed"" to assume that all industries are bad actors.¶""We should be about stewardship and we should be about partnership,"" Pruitt said. ""Now, I will tell you as a former attorney general, I've led a grand jury. I've prosecuted bad actors. And I will tell you, if we have companies, industries, citizens who violate the law, we are going to prosecute them and we are going to hold them accountable. But we should not start from the premise that all people are that way or that all industries are that way. That is just simply wrong-headed. And it doesn't achieve good outcomes.""¶Pruitt has also come under fire for appointing executives from the coal, gas and chemical industries to senior staff positions at the EPA. He has swiftly sought to reverse, delay and block more regulations than any other administrator in the history of the agency, including the Obama-era Clean Power Plan and Clean Water Rule. ¶""We had many regulations that this agency had adopted historical that had created confusion, and did not serve advancing protection of the environment,"" Pruitt argued. ¶Pruitt confirmed reports that he has eased the EPA's safety review process for assessing the risk of new chemicals being produced by manufacturers to the environmental and humans under the Toxic Substances Control Act. He told CBS News that the agency will no longer require manufacturers to sign consent orders that restrict the use of potentially hazardous chemicals in the future. Pruitt claimed that the EPA's new approach is ""absolutely"" safer than the old approach. ¶""What I've said about consent orders and consent decrees is that we shouldn't regulate through litigation,"" Pruitt argued. ""If there are industries or companies out there that don't do what the law requires, we're going to issue consent orders and enforcement actions against them, and already have, to hold them accountable."" ¶""From our perspective, when I speak to clarity in regulations, I believe most companies, most states, most citizens want to comply with the law,"" Pruitt added. ¶In December, a federal appeals court ordered the EPA to revise the antiquated lead paint hazard standards after the Trump administration had requested a six year delay to review the rule. Pruitt would not say whether or not the EPA planned to appeal the ruling or take it to the Supreme Court, and deferred the decision to the Justice Department. The rule has not been updated in nearly 17 years. ¶""The legal process is something that Justice will be the decider upon the procedural approach to that,"" Pruitt said. ""But I can tell you this: it's important for this agency to get that rule and get it done.""¶""Indeed the EPA itself has acknowledge that 'lead poisoning is the number one environmental health threat to children ages 6 and younger, and that the current standards are insufficient,"" the ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reads.  ¶Pruitt added that he wanted to ""declare a war on lead"" and also eradicate lead from drinking water within 10 years, primarily through an infrastructure package. ¶Addressing some controversial staff appointments that have presented a conflict of interest, like Nancy Beck -- a former senior director in the American Chemistry Council who is now deputy assistant administrator in the office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Protection at the EPA -- Pruitt said he rejected the premise that ""we can't be both about stewardship and also economic development and growth."" ¶Pruitt has also appointed other staffers who have publicly questioned sound scientific data, like Michael Honeycutt, chairman of the EPA's Science Advisory Board who once said in an interview that lowering the ozone ""might have a negative health benefit."" Pruitt dismissed his comments. ¶""Ozone is something that we most definitely have to regulate,"" he said. ""It's a very important thing to regulate.""",0
Is warming in the Arctic behind this year’s crazy winter weather?,"

    ","¶Jennifer Francis is a research professor at Rutgers University.¶Damage from extreme weather events during 2017 racked up the biggest-ever bills for the U.S. Most of these events involved conditions that align intuitively with global warming: heat records, drought, wildfires, coastal flooding, hurricane damage and heavy rainfall.¶Paradoxical, though, are possible ties between climate change and the recent spate of frigid weeks in eastern North America. A very new and ""hot topic"" in climate change research is the notion that rapid warming and wholesale melting of the Arctic may be playing a role in causing persistent cold spells. ¶More in Climate Change¶It doesn't take a stretch of the imagination to suppose that losing half the Arctic sea-ice cover in only 30 years might be wreaking havoc with the weather, but exactly how is not yet clear. As a research atmospheric scientist, I study how warming in the Arctic is affecting temperature regions around the world. Can we say changes to the Arctic driven by global warming have had a role in the freakish winter weather North America has experienced?¶Weird and destructive weather was in the news almost constantly during 2017, and 2018 seems to be following the same script. Most U.S. Easterners shivered their way through the end of 2017 into the New Year, while Westerners longed for rain to dampen parched soils and extinguish wildfires. Blizzards have plagued the Eastern Seaboard – notably the ""bomb cyclone"" storm on Jan. 4, 2018 – while California's Sierra Nevada stand nearly bare of snow. ¶This story is becoming a familiar one, as similar conditions have played out in four of the past five winters. Some politicians in Washington D.C., including President Trump, have used the unusual cold to question global warming. But if they looked at the big picture, they'd see that eastern cold spells are a relative fluke in the Northern Hemisphere as a whole and that most areas are warmer than normal.¶A warm, dry western North America occurring in combination with a cold, snowy east is not unusual, but the prevalence and persistence of this pattern in recent years have piqued the interests of climate researchers. ¶The jet stream – a fast, upper-level river of wind that encircles the Northern Hemisphere – plays a critical role. When the jet stream swoops far north and south in a big wave, extreme conditions can result. During the past few weeks, a big swing northward, forming what's called a ""ridge"" of persistent atmospheric pressure, persisted off the West Coast along with a deep southward dip, or a ""trough,"" over the East. ¶New terms have been coined to describe these stubborn features: ""The North American Winter Temperature Dipole,"" the ""Ridiculously Resilient Ridge"" over the West, and the ""Terribly Tenacious Trough"" in the East. ¶Regardless what it's called, this dipole pattern – abnormally high temperatures over much of the West along with chilly conditions in the East – has dominated North American weather in four of the past five winters. January 2017 was a stark exception, when a strong El Niño flipped the ridge-trough pattern, dumping record-breaking rain and snowpack on California while the east enjoyed a mild month. ¶Two other important features are conspicuous in the dipole temperature pattern: extremely warm temperatures in the Arctic near Alaska and warm ocean temperatures in the eastern Pacific. Several new studies point to these ""ingredients"" as key to the recent years with a persistent dipole.¶What role does warming – specifically the warming ocean and air temperatures in the Arctic – play in this warm-West/cool-East weather pattern? The explanation goes like this. ¶Pacific Ocean temperatures fluctuate naturally owing to short-lived phenomena such as El Niño/La Niña and longer, decades-length patterns. Scientists have long recognized that those variations affect weather patterns across North America and beyond.¶The new twist in this story is that the Arctic has been warming at at least double the pace of the rest of the globe, meaning that the difference in temperature between the Arctic and areas farther south has been shrinking. This matters because the north/south temperature difference is one of the main drivers of the jet stream. The jet stream creates the high- and low-pressure systems that dictate our blue skies and storminess while also steering them. Anything that affects the jet stream will also affect our weather.¶When ocean temperatures off the West Coast of North America are warmer than normal, as they have been most of the time since winter 2013, the jet stream tends to form a ridge of high pressure along the West Coast, causing storms to be diverted away from California and leaving much of the West high and dry. ¶If these warm ocean temperatures occur in combination with abnormally warm conditions near Alaska, the extra heat from the Arctic can intensify the ridge, causing it to reach farther northward, become more persistent, and pump even more heat into the region near Alaska. And in recent years, Alaska has experienced periods of record warm temperatures, owing in part to reduced sea ice.¶My colleagues and I have called this combination of natural and climate change-related effects ""It Takes Two to Tango,"" a concept that may help explain the Ridiculously Resilient Ridge observed frequently since 2013. Several new studies support this human-caused boost of a natural pattern, though controversy still exists regarding the mechanisms linking rapid Arctic warming with weather patterns farther south in the mid-latitudes.¶In response to the strengthened western ridge of atmospheric pressure, the winds of the jet stream usually also form a deeper, stronger trough downstream. Deep troughs act like an open refrigerator door, allowing frigid Arctic air to plunge southward, bringing misery to areas ill-prepared to handle it. Snowstorms in Texas, ice storms in Georgia and chilly snowbirds in Florida can all be blamed on the Terribly Tenacious Trough of December 2017 and January 2018. ¶Adding icing on the cake is the tendency for so-called ""nor'easters,"" such as the ""bomb cyclone"" that struck on Jan. 4, to form along the East Coast when the trough's southwest winds align along the Atlantic Seaboard. The resulting intense contrast in temperature between the cold land and Gulf Stream-warmed ocean provides the fuel for these ferocious storms.¶The big question is whether climate change will make dipole patterns – along with their attendant tendencies to produce extreme weather – more common in the future. The answer is yes and no. ¶It is widely expected that global warming will produce fewer low-temperature records, a tendency already observed. But it may also be true that cold spells will become more persistent as dipole patterns intensify, a tendency that also seems to be occurring.¶It's hard to nail down whether this weather pattern – overall warmer winters in  North America but longer cold snaps – will persist. Understanding the mechanisms behind these complex interactions between natural influences and human-caused changes is challenging.¶Nevertheless, research is moving forward rapidly as creative new metrics are developed. Our best tools for looking into the future are sophisticated computer programs, but they, too, struggle to simulate these complicated behaviors of the climate system. Given the importance of predicting extreme weather and its impacts on many aspects of our lives, researchers must continue to unravel connections between climate change and weather to help us prepare for the likely ongoing tantrums by Mother Nature.¶This article was originally published on The Conversation.",0
Climate change turned 99.8% of these sea turtle babies female,"

    ","¶The climate is changing, and so are the turtles.¶A study published Monday in the journal Current Biology about green sea turtles that nest along island beaches near Australia's Great Barrier Reef found that turtles born in areas most heated by climate change are 99.8 percent female. Turtles born farther south, along a cooler beach, are only about 65 percent female.¶The result isn't surprising if you know a bit about turtle biology, but it is alarming. Sea turtles, like these green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas), don't have genetically determined sexes, the way mammals do. Instead, the researchers wrote, ""In sea turtles, cooler temperatures produce more male hatchlings while warmer temperatures produce more females.""¶An egg in hot sand is more likely to produce a female turtle, and an egg in cool sand is more likely to produce a male. [In Photos: Tagging Baby Sea Turtles]¶The pivot temperature where a population will turn out 50 percent females and 50 percent males is based on genetics and varies with species and even individual nesting groups, the researchers wrote. Turtles  seem to target their breeding periods to times when the sand is slightly warmer than their pivot temperatures, resulting in populations moderately skewed female. But shift the temperature of that period just a few degrees and the resulting baby turtles will be not just a bit female — instead, hardly a male will appear in the whole group.¶More in Climate Change¶Due to climate change, Raine Island — the site of the key breeding ground in this study — has warmed significantly since the 1990s, the researchers wrote, likely accounting for the hard female skew.¶So, the researchers developed a new technique: Studying the turtles' hormones.Proving that the increasing temperatures actually changed the turtle population proved challenging, though. Turtles don't wear signs of their sex as obviously as humans; researchers can't tell just by looking between their legs. And the easiest method — cutting them open — isn't really an ethical way to approach an endangered turtle population.¶A genetic test won't offer any insight into a given turtle's sex, since sea turtles don't carry their sexes in their genetic code. But the researchers found that if they brought blood plasma samples back to their lab, they could use hormonal differences to distinguish male and female turtles.¶It's not clear yet, the researcher wrote, how exactly the wild female swing will impact the sea turtles' future. Males breed far more often than females, but researchers don't know to what extent the handful remaining can make up for all their missing brothers. It's also possible, the researchers wrote, that females will seek out mates in cooler climates to the south.¶""Our study highlights the need for immediate management strategies aimed at lowering incubation temperatures at key rookeries,"" the researchers wrote, ""to boost the ability of local turtle populations to adapt to the changing environment and avoid a population collapse — or even extinction.""¶Originally published on Live Science.",0

    ","¶WASHINGTON -- With three devastating hurricanes, extreme wildfires, hail, flooding, tornadoes and drought, the United States tallied a record high bill last year for weather-related disasters: $306 billion. The U.S. had 16 disasters last year with damage exceeding a billion dollars each, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reported Monday. ¶That ties 2011 for the number of billion-dollar disasters, but the total cost blew past the previous record of $215 billion in 2005.¶Costs are adjusted for inflation and NOAA keeps track of billion-dollar weather disasters going back to 1980. Three of the five most expensive hurricanes in U.S. history hit last year.¶More in Climate Change¶NOAA said the 16 billion-dollar disasters included eight severe storms, three tropical cyclones, two flooding events, one wildfire event, one drought and one freeze event. These events resulted in the deaths of 362 people and had significant economic effects on the areas they affected, the NOAA said.¶Hurricane Harvey cost $125 billion, second only to 2005's Katrina, while Hurricane Maria, which slammed Puerto Rico, cost $90 billion, ranking third, the NOAA said. Irma was a $50 billion storm, the fifth most expensive hurricane in U.S. history. ¶Western wildfires fanned by hot, dry conditions racked up $18 billion in damage, triple the previous U.S. wildfire record, according to the NOAA.¶""While we have to be careful about knee-jerk cause-effect discussions, the National Academy of Science and recent peer-reviewed literature continue to show that some of today's extremes have climate change fingerprints on them,"" said University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd, a past president of the American Meteorological Society.¶NOAA announced its figures at the society's annual conference in Austin, Texas.¶The weather agency also said that 2017 was the third hottest year in U.S. records for the Lower 48 states, with an annual temperature average of 54.6 degrees Fahrenheit, or 12.6 degrees Celsius -- 2.6 degrees higher than the 20th century average. Only 2012 and 2016 were warmer.

    ","¶WASHINGTON -- Anchorage, Alaska, was warmer Tuesday than Jacksonville, Florida. The weather in the U.S. is that upside down. ¶That's because the Arctic's deeply frigid weather escaped its regular atmospheric jail that traps the worst cold. It then meandered south to the central and eastern United States. And this has been happening more often in recent times, scientists say. ¶Super cold air is normally locked up in the Arctic in the polar vortex, which is a gigantic circular weather pattern around the North Pole. A strong polar vortex keeps that cold air hemmed in. ¶More in Climate Change¶""Then when it weakens, it causes like a dam to burst,"" and the cold air heads south, said Judah Cohen, a winter storm expert for Atmospheric Environmental Research, a commercial firm outside Boston. ¶""This is not record-breaking for Canada or Alaska or northern Siberia, it's just misplaced,"" said Cohen, who had forecast a colder than normal winter for much of the U.S. ¶Yes, but more for how long -- about 10 days --  the cold has lasted, than how cold it has been. On Tuesday, Boston tied its seven-day record for the most consecutive days at or below 20 degrees that was set exactly 100 years ago. ¶More than 1,600 daily records for cold were tied or broken in the last week of December, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). For Greg Carbin of the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center, the most meaningful statistics are how last week's average temperature was the second coldest in more than a century of record-keeping for Minneapolis, Chicago, Detroit and Kansas City, third coldest in Pittsburgh and fifth coldest in New York City. ¶While the United States has been in the deep freeze, the rest of the globe has been toastier than normal. The globe as a whole was 0.9 degrees warmer than normal Tuesday and the Arctic was more than 6 degrees warmer than normal, according to the University of Maine Climate Change Institute's analysis. ¶""If you look at the temperature map for the climate as a whole right now, the entire rest of the planet is warmer than the historical average with the exception of the Eastern United States and Canada, and the last three years -- 2014, 2015 and 2016 -- have been consecutively the warmest years on record,"" atmospheric scientist and Columbia University professor Adam Sobel told CBS News last week.¶A brutal winter storm dumped snow, sleet and freezing rain from normally balmy Florida up the Southeast seaboard Wednesday, delivering a white coating that some cities hadn't seen in decades. Cars spun out of control on icy overpasses from Texas to Georgia. Forecasters warned that conditions could worsen, especially in the Northeast. ¶In the southern U.S., a wind chill advisory was in effect Wednesday from Orlando down to Boca Raton as a ""bomb cyclone"" storm was expected to swirl up the East Coast, said CBS News weather producer David Parkinson. He said when a storm system ""loses 24 millibars of pressure, which is to say it gets that much stronger, in under 24 hours, you have what's called a 'weather bomb,' and so that's where you get the term 'bombogenesis' – that's where we talk about storms 'bombing out.'""¶""Much sort of like a Sandy or a hurricane or something like that, it gets really strong really quickly, and when that happens you have these bursts of intense snow,"" he said.¶If the storm moves just 25 miles in one direction or the other when it gets to the Northeast, that could be the difference between four and eight inches of snow, Parkinson said.¶There is a blizzard concern along the coast – in Cape Ann, Mass., and along the state's southern coast. Winds are expected to be 40-70 mph.¶""We're not going to have ridiculous snow totals that we've never seen before … But what we are gonna have is a lot of wind, a lot of low visibility and what I suspect will be a lot of traffic accidents,"" Parkinson said.¶Forecasters warned of frost bite and hypothermia in Chicago, where wind chills of minus 35 degrees were predicted. According to CBS Chicago, many homeowners are already facing the consequences of frozen or broken pipes due to bone-chilling temperatures. ¶This is an area of hot debate and research among scientists and probably is a mix of human-caused climate change and natural variability, said Furtado. Climate change hasn't made the polar vortex more extreme, but it probably is making it move more, which makes the weather seem more extreme, he said. ¶A recent study by Potsdam Institute climate scientist Marlene Kretschmer found the polar vortex has weakened and meandered more often since 1990, but that study focused more on Europe. Ongoing research shows that there seems to be a similar connection for more frequent Arctic cold snaps like what the U.S. is now experiencing, Kretschmer said. ¶Don't confuse weather -- which is a few days or weeks in one region -- with climate, which is over years and decades and global. Weather is like a person's mood, which changes frequently, while climate is like someone's personality, which is more long-term, Furtado said. ¶""A few cold days doesn't disprove climate change,"" Furtado said. ""That's just silly. Just like a couple down days on the stock market doesn't mean the economy is going into the trash.""",0

This is a very tired and often debunked assertion,"" atmospheric scientist and Columbia University professor Adam Sobel told CBS News.¶Mr. Trump has repeatedly expressed skepticism about climate change science, calling global warming a ""hoax"" created by the Chinese to damage American industry.¶More in Climate Change¶He announced earlier this year his intention to pull out of the landmark Paris climate agreement aimed at curbing greenhouse gas production. The accord set goals for slowing the rate of climate change by reducing the emissions that contribute to melting Arctic ice, increasing sea levels and changing weather patterns across the globe.¶The U.N.'s weather and climate agency said last month that 2017 was on track to become the hottest year on record aside from those impacted by the El Niño phenomenon, which can contribute to higher temperatures.¶Last year set a record for Earth's average global temperature.¶Mr. Trump is spending the holidays at his golf club in Florida.",0
"""Climate gentrification"" could add value to elevation in real estate","

    ","¶Homes at higher elevations in Miami are gaining value at a faster clip than those closer to sea level. It's an accelerating trend, and it has residents and real estate agents -- in Miami and other coastal communities -- asking whether ""climate gentrification"" has arrived.¶The term, which only recently entered the lexicon, describes the role of climate change in recalibrating land values, a phenomenon that ultimately could displace low-income and minority residents in a similar fashion as urban gentrification. As sea levels rise and flooding persists, the thinking goes in the case of Miami, waterfront property will lose some of its luster and higher-situated neighborhoods like Little Haiti and Little Havana will become more attractive.¶The professor who was first to publish research using the phrase ""climate gentrification"" isn't convinced that's the main culprit in Miami. At least not yet. Jesse M. Keenan, a researcher on urban development and climate adaptation at Harvard's Graduate School of Design, tracked the rate of price appreciation since 1971 for more than 250,000 residential properties in Miami-Dade County, and compared those figures to elevation. Keenan found that properties at high elevations have long appreciated faster in Miami, mostly because of nonclimate factors.¶More in Climate Change¶However, since 2000, the correlation between elevation and price appreciation has grown stronger, which Keenan, in an interview with CBS MoneyWatch, suggested may be ""early signaling"" of preference for properties at higher elevations and a reaction to persistent nuisance flooding in lower areas.¶His prediction: Over the next 10 years, climate change will become a more significant factor in the real estate market for many cities. He expects a ""slow burn"" toward a tipping point -- similar to the foreclosure crisis -- when all of a sudden values drop precipitously for high-risk properties.¶""This is real,"" Keenan said. ""There are actual people spending lots of money thinking about how to make money from climate change. We have to come to terms with this sooner than later.""¶Keenan tracks at least three ""pathways"" to climate gentrification, and the variations stem in part from the ""location, location, location"" mantra of real estate. The three scenarios:¶What's at stake? ""People's lives, their livelihoods and their culture,"" said Mustafa Santiago Ali, senior vice president of climate, environmental justice and community revitalization for the Hip Hop Caucus, a nonprofit that connects the Hip Hop community to civic life.¶Ali, who previously spent 24 years in various roles at the Environmental Protection Agency, said it's fairly easy to predict who the winners will be as climate gentrification takes hold -- led both by one-time events such as hurricanes and the more gradual process of sea-level rise. The answer, of course, is wealthier people.¶""Who has the resources? Who has the access?"" Ali asked in an interview with MoneyWatch. ""Who has the education to understand what's coming and navigate that?""¶One key to ensuring a more equitable outcome is making sure communities are heard, are involved in development, including ""adaptation"" measures to accommodate climate change, and have avenues to take advantage of rising property values, Ali said. In fact, climate will be a focus area of a new initiative of the Hip Hop Caucus set for launch in spring that targets vulnerable communities.¶In Miami, residents of some inland coastal neighborhoods that sit at comparatively high elevations, including Little Haiti, worry that rising property values fueled by sea-level increases could price them out, as PRI reported last week.¶Developers have proposed three new projects in the Little Haiti neighborhood that could push immigrants and people of color out, activist Valencia Gunder told PRI. ""In Miami, historically because of racism, redlining and segregation, all of the brown and black people were forced to live in the center of the city, which also happens to be the high elevated areas,"" she told PRI. ""So, they pushed us here because they didn't want us on the beach.""¶For some buyers these days, the beach looks like a better place to visit than to live. And it's not just coastal areas that could face consequences of ""climate gentrification."" Coastal residents are likely to flock to inland cities in droves -- with Austin, Texas; Orlando, Florida; and Atlanta likely to gain the most new residents, according to a study by Mathew Hauer published by the journal Nature in April.¶The study, which considers a sea-level rise of about six feet by the year 2100, forecasts a migration of as many as 13 million people (double the total of the Great Migration), with more than 2.5 million fleeing the region that includes Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach. New Orleans would lose about 500,000 people, the study predicts, and the New York City area would lose 50,000 people.¶That doesn't mean coastal areas would empty out. History shows people will always want to live near the water, noted Joel Myers, founder and president of commercial weather service AccuWeather Inc.¶Sea levels have been rising for thousands of years, he added, and even as that rise accelerates, the other side of the coin is there's less waterfront land available to purchase.

    ","¶You may have heard the expression: It's not the heat, it's the humidity. Researchers seem to agree, and are now warning that humidity is likely to increase the threat to human health from climate change-related temperature hikes in certain parts of the world.¶Those areas include the southeastern United States, the Amazon, western and central Africa, southern areas of the Mideast and Arabian peninsula, northern India and eastern China, the study authors said.¶At times, the combination of heat and high humidity in these regions could make it impossible for people to work or, in some cases, even survive, the researchers suggested. Along with harming health, these conditions could cause economic damage.¶More in Climate Change¶""The conditions we're talking about basically never occur now -- people in most places have never experienced them,"" lead author Ethan Coffel, a graduate student at Columbia University's Earth Observatory, said in a university news release.¶""But they're projected to occur close to the end of the century,"" Coffel added.¶Using global climate models, the researchers mapped current and projected future ""wet bulb"" temperatures, which reflect the combined effects of heat and humidity. ¶Lab experiments have shown a wet-bulb reading of 89.6 degrees Fahrenheit is the threshold beyond which many people would have trouble carrying out normal activities outside. This level is rarely reached anywhere today, the study authors said. But the investigators project that by the 2070s or 2080s, the mark could be reached one or two days a year in the U.S. southeast, and three to five days in parts of South America, Africa, India and China.¶According to background information in the report: ""Human health impacts depend on both temperature and humidity. The human body is efficient at shedding heat through evaporative cooling [sweating], even in high air temperatures, if moisture levels are low.¶""However, in hot and humid conditions, the efficiency of evaporative cooling slows and the body may become unable to maintain a stable core temperature,"" the study authors wrote. This can cause heat stress, which can lead to heat stroke, heat exhaustion, heat cramps or heat rashes.¶Study co-author Alex deSherbinin, of Columbia's Center for International Earth Science Information Network, added that ""it's not just about the heat, or the number of people. It's about how many people are poor, how many are old, who has to go outside to work, who has air conditioning."" ¶The study was published Dec. 22 in the journal Environmental Research Letters.",0
"327 toxic Superfund sites in climate change, flooding bulls-eyes: AP","

      / AP
    ","¶TAPRON SPRING, Fla. -- Anthony Stansbury propped his rusty bike against a live oak tree and cast his fishing line into the rushing waters of Florida's Anclote River.¶When he bought a house down the street last year, Stansbury says he wasn't told that his slice of paradise had a hidden problem. The neighborhood is adjacent to the Stauffer Chemical Co. Superfund site, a former chemical manufacturing plant that is on the list of the nation's most polluted places. That 130-acre lot on the river's edge is also located in a flood zone.¶""Me and my kids fish here a couple times a week. Everyone who lives on this coast right here, they fish on this water daily,"" said the 39-year-old father of three.¶More in Climate Change¶Stansbury is among nearly 2 million people in the U.S. who live within a mile of 327 Superfund sites in areas prone to flooding or vulnerable to sea-level rise caused by climate change, according to an Associated Press analysis of flood zone maps, census data and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency records.¶This year's historic hurricane season exposed a little-known public health threat: Highly polluted sites that can be inundated by floodwaters, potentially spreading toxic contamination.¶In Houston, more than a dozen Superfund sites were flooded by Hurricane Harvey, with breaches reported at two. In the Southeast and Puerto Rico, Superfund sites were battered by driving rains and winds from Irma and Maria.¶The vulnerable sites highlighted by the AP's review are scattered across the nation, but Florida, New Jersey and California have the most, and the most people living near them. They are in largely low-income, heavily minority neighborhoods, the data show.¶Many of the 327 sites have had at least some work done to help mitigate the threat to public health, including fencing them off and covering them in plastic sheeting to help keep out rain water.¶The Obama administration assessed some of these at-risk places and planned to gird them from harsher weather and rising seas. EPA's 2014 Climate Adaptation Plan said prolonged flooding at low-lying Superfund sites could cause extensive erosion, carrying away contaminants as waters recede.¶President Trump, however, has called climate change a hoax, and his administration has worked to remove references from federal reports and websites linking carbon emissions to the warming planet.¶""Site managers had started reviewing climate and environmental trends for each Superfund site, including the potential for flooding,"" said Phyllis Anderson, who worked for 30 years as an EPA attorney and associate director of the division that manages Superfund cleanups until her retirement in 2013. ""The current administration appears to be trying to erase these efforts in their climate change denials, which is a shame.""¶EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has said he intends to focus on cleaning up Superfund sites, and he appointed a task force that developed a list of sites considered the highest priority. The Stauffer site in Florida is not on it.¶Like Mr. Trump, Pruitt rejects the consensus of climate scientists that man-made carbon emissions are driving global warming.  His task force's 34-page report makes no mention of the flood risk to Superfund sites from stronger storms or rising seas, but eight of the 21 sites on EPA's priority list are in areas of flood risk.¶Despite EPA's announced emphasis on expediting cleanups, the Trump administration's proposed spending plan for the current 2018 fiscal year seeks to slash Superfund program funding by nearly one-third. Congress has not yet approved new spending plans for the fiscal year, which began Oct. 1.¶Pruitt's office declined to comment this week on the key findings of AP's analysis or why the agency appears to no longer recognize an increasing flood risk to toxic sites posed by the changing climate.¶However, Jahan Wilcox, an EPA spokesman, said, ""Despite fear-mongering from the Associated Press, not a single dollar has actually been eliminated, as Congress still hasn't passed a budget.""¶Many flood-prone Superfund sites identified through AP's analysis are located in low-lying, densely populated urban areas. In New Jersey, several polluted sites have more than 50,000 people living within one mile.¶In Hoboken, across the Hudson River from New York City, the site of a former manufacturing plant for mercury vapor lamps sits within a mile of almost 100,000 residents, including 7,000 children under 5.¶The Martin Aaron Inc. Superfund site is in the heart of Camden's Waterfront South, a low-income neighborhood of crumbling row houses and industrial facilities stretching along the Delaware River.¶The 2.5-acre lot, which takes up most of a city block, has been home to a succession of factories dating back to 1886 that included a leather tannery. The air around the fenced site hangs heavy with the nose-stinging odor of solvents. Testing found that soil and groundwater under the site contained a witch's brew of highly toxic chemicals, including PCBs and pesticides.¶Earlier this month, workers used heavy machinery to remove contaminated soil and to pump polluted water from deep underground. Long range plans approved by EPA call for eventually covering the land and restricting its future use.¶Just around the corner, Mark Skinner and his niece Cherise Skinner pushed her 1-year-old son in a stroller in front of their rented row house. Mark Skinner shrugged when asked about the work at the former industrial site.¶""It's really contaminated, there's a lot of stuff in the ground, but I don't know what all it is,"" said Skinner, 53, who works at a nearby scrap metal yard and has lived in Waterfront South since he was a teenager.¶Foul-smelling water filled the streets there during Superstorm Sandy in 2012, flooding many basements, long-time residents said.  Census data show about 17,250 people live within a mile of the Martin Aaron site - 65 percent are black and 36 percent are Latino.¶Across the nation, more than 800,000 homes are located near flood-prone toxic sites. Houses are at risk of contamination if intense flooding brings water into them, and many more people could be affected if the contamination seeps into the ground, finding its way into drinking water.¶Mustafa Ali, who resigned in March as EPA's senior adviser and assistant associate administrator for environmental justice, said it's no accident that many of the nation's most polluted sites are also located in some of the poorest neighborhoods.¶""We place the things that are most dangerous in sacrifice zones, which in many instances are communities of color where we haven't placed as much value on their lives,"" said Ali, who worked at EPA for 24 years.¶The Stauffer site in Florida is a scrubby green field along the Anclote River, ringed on its other three sides by chain-link fences with ""No Trespassing"" signs. Testing showed the 130-acre lot's soils were contaminated with radium, the long-banned pesticide DDT, arsenic, lead and other pollutants that over the years have fouled the area's groundwater and the river.¶Environmental regulators say the site now poses no threat to people or the environment because the current owner, the pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, paid to treat contaminated soils, and cover the pollution with a ""cap"" of clean earth and grass. Still, residential development and use of groundwater on the site are prohibited because of the legacy pollution.¶Covering  toxic waste is often a cheaper option than completely removing the pollutants, but the installations are not always as long-lasting as the chemicals buried beneath them, said Jeff Cunningham, a civil engineering professor at the University of South Florida.¶""As a long-term strategy, capping only works if the contaminants degrade to safe levels before the capping system eventually fails. What if it takes centuries for some of these contaminants to degrade to safe levels?"" Cunningham said.¶Damage to a protective cap from storm-fueled flooding has already occurred at least once this year.¶In October, the EPA said dioxins from the San Jacinto River Waste Pits Superfund site near Houston were released after the cap was damaged by Harvey-related flooding. Tests afterward measured the toxins at 2,300 times the level that would normally trigger a new cleanup. Pruitt has since ordered an accelerated cleanup of the site.¶Seventy-six-year-old Tony Leisner has lived near Florida's Stauffer chemical site all his life. He told the AP he is seeing damage to docks and riverside properties from the ever-rising waters in the neighborhood, and is concerned about what more flooding could mean for the Superfund lot. Although monitoring wells do test local groundwater for contamination from the site, some in Leisner's neighborhood said they're fearful enough to drink only bottled water.¶The Anclote River is listed as an ""impaired waterway"" because it fails to meet state clean water criteria, though how much of that is due to the Stauffer site's legacy is unclear. The state has issued a warning about eating bass out of the river, but there are no signs at the popular fishing spot warning anglers even though tests show heightened levels of mercury in fish.¶Leisner said barrels of chemicals at the Stauffer site self-ignited while crews were working. He said he's disappointed neither the company nor EPA removed the pollutants, especially since rising waters are already threatening the neighborhood.¶""Burying things rarely helps. And if you've got a chemical that is that toxic ... I think you need to find a way to reuse, recycle and remove (it), to a place where it's not going to contaminate groundwater,"" he said.",0

NOAA said 2017 tied 2011 as having the most billion-dollar disasters. ¶The total cost of natural disasters in 2017 is estimated to be about $25 billion.

Research shows global warming made Harvey's deluge 3 times more likely,"

      / CBS/AP
    ","¶NEW ORLEANS -- Global warming's fingerprints were all over the record rainfall from Hurricane Harvey this year, confirming what scientists suspected, according to new research. While scientists say man-made climate change didn't trigger Harvey, new studies calculate that a warmer, wetter world made it at least three times more likely that the stalled storm over Houston would flood the fourth most populous U.S. city.¶Researchers also said global warming often goosed aspects of two other destructive hurricanes this year, Irma and Maria. Dozens of people died in the wrath of both hurricanes as it devastated Puerto Rico, Florida and parts of the northeastern Caribbean. Thousands were subsequently left without power. ¶Findings were discussed Wednesday at the American Geophysical Union meeting in New Orleans. ¶More in Climate Change¶The Harvey studies used a combination of established and new techniques. An international team used computer simulations and decades of past observations to estimate the odds for the record rainfall that came with Harvey over a period of three days in August with and without global warming. By comparing those two, they concluded global warming tripled the likelihood for the deluge, which reached more than 50 inches in one location. ¶Based on Houston's weather history, researchers said a storm like Harvey would occur about once every 9,000 years. ¶""Did climate change make this event more likely than in the past? Yes,"" said Karin van der Wiel of the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute. ¶Another study by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory used computer simulations to analyze Harvey's downpours over a week and calculated that global warming increased rainfall by nearly 20 percent. ¶Kevin Trenberth of the National Center for Atmospheric Research linked Harvey's downpours to the heat content in the ocean. Most of the heat trapped by greenhouse gases gets absorbed by oceans and that energy serves as fuel for hurricanes and other storms. The ocean heat content was record high in the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere before Harvey hit. If it had been lower, there would have been much less rain, he said. ¶Changes in the jet stream — the rivers of air that steer weather — led to Harvey's stalling over Houston, where it dumped record-breaking rainfall, said Kerry Emanuel of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who presented two studies. ¶While Emanuel wouldn't directly blame climate change for Harvey's devastation, he said destructive hurricanes will be more likely in a warmer world. ¶""I think this is a window into the future. I think nature is giving us a foretaste of the future,"" Emanuel said in an interview. ",0
"Sea ice melting at fastest pace in 1,500 years, Arctic Report Card finds","

      / AP
    ","¶NEW ORLEANS -- Permafrost in the Arctic is thawing at a faster clip, according to a new report released Tuesday. ¶Water is also warming and sea ice is melting at the fastest pace in 1,500 years at the top of the world. ¶The annual report released Tuesday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) showed slightly less warming in many measurements than a record hot 2016. But scientists remain concerned because the far northern region is warming twice as fast as the rest of the globe and has reached a level of warming that's unprecedented in modern times. ¶More in Climate Change¶""2017 continued to show us we are on this deepening trend where the Arctic is a very different place than it was even a decade ago,"" said Jeremy Mathis, head of NOAA's Arctic research program and co-author of the 93-page report. ¶Findings were discussed at the American Geophysical Union meeting in New Orleans. ¶""What happens in the Arctic doesn't stay in the Arctic; it affects the rest of the planet,"" said acting NOAA chief Timothy Gallaudet. ""The Arctic has huge influence on the world at large."" ¶Permafrost is the permanently frozen layer below the Earth's surface in frigid areas. Records show the frozen ground that many buildings, roads and pipelines are built on reached record warm temperatures last year nearing and sometimes exceeding the thawing point. That could make them vulnerable when the ground melts and shifts, the report said. Unlike other readings, permafrost data tend to lag a year. ¶Preliminary reports from the U.S. and Canada in 2017 showed permafrost temperatures are ""again the warmest for all sites"" measured in North America, said study co-author Vladimir Romanovsky, a professor at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks. ¶Arctic sea ice usually shrinks in September and this year it was only the eighth lowest on record for the melting season. But scientists said they were most concerned about what happens in the winter -- especially March -- when sea ice is supposed to be building to its highest levels. ¶Arctic winter sea ice maximum levels in 2017 were the smallest they've ever been for the season when ice normally grows. It was the third straight year of record low winter sea ice recovery. Records go back to 1979. ¶About 79 percent of the Arctic sea ice is thin and only a year old. In 1985, 45 percent of the sea ice in the Arctic was thick, older ice, said NOAA Arctic scientist Emily Osborne. ¶New research looking into the Arctic's past using ice cores, fossils, corals and shells as stand-ins for temperature measurements show that Arctic ocean temperatures are rising and sea ice levels are falling at rates not seen in the 1,500 years. And those dramatic changes coincide with the large increase in carbon dioxide levels in the air from the burning of oil, gas and coal, the report said. ¶This isn't just a concern for the few people who live north of the Arctic Circle. Changes in the Arctic can alter fish supply. And more ice-free Arctic summers can lead to countries competing to exploit new areas for resources. Research also shows changes in Arctic sea ice and temperature can alter the jet stream, which is a major factor in U.S. weather. ¶This is probably partly responsible for the current unusual weather in the United States that brought destructive wildfires to California and a sharp cold snap to the South and East, according to NOAA scientist James Overland and private meteorologist expert Judah Cohen. ¶""The Arctic has traditionally been the refrigerator to the planet, but the door of the refrigerator has been left open,"" Mathis said. ¶Outside scientists praised the report card. ¶""Overall, the new data fit with the long-term trends, showing the clear evidence of warming causing major changes,"" in the Arctic, said Pennsylvania State University ice scientist Richard Alley.",0

            Emmanuel Macron interview with Jeff Glor -- full transcript - CBS News
    ",CBS News,"December 12, 2017, 5:57 PM","¶JEFF GLOR: I was struck by something you said, that ""This battle is, shouldn't be defensive."" What does that mean?¶PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: Hello. And thanks very much for this appointment. First of all, let me start by saying a few words for your country and and for what happened today in the U.S., because it seems that we had a terrorist attack or an attempt at least. I believe there is -- I mean, nobody died it seems at this stage, but I wanted to convey my feelings and all my solidarity to your people and your president. Switching from ... the news of the day to our news of the day, which is about climate change, indeed, I'm interested in the fact that what people want today is to choose the future. And not to be in a certain we're the victim of different changes.¶When we speak about climate change, you're a victim of something ... which is happening with deep roots where you don't have -- anything to deal with. And people just want to choose a life. That's very much important. And I think one of the key elements of the collective battle we have today, in order to fight against climate change is to provide people the ability to choose a life. To have a better life by behaving differently, by innovating, by creating new type of companies and startups, new type of activities.¶And -- and this change will mean destroying all jobs ... I would quote, ""activities,"" but by creating new ones. And it's very much important for political leaders just to change our mindset ... and not to say, ""If you want to fight against climate change, it's automatically bad news for your people and your economy."" It's totally different. It could be bringing a lot of good news, if you just help people to change and allow them to choose a life.¶GLOR: President Trump says, ""It's bad news because it's bad for the American workers, bad for American people."" Do you think that's fair?¶MACRON: I disagree with that. I disagree with that. First of all, because it's bad for everybody, because we know now the consequences of climate change. I mean, it's bad for everybody. It's bad for you today due to the consequences in terms of hurricanes in terms of [floods], in terms of direct consequences on the Arctic region. Because today you have islands which starts disappearing. So you have current negative consequences in dealing directly with workers in the rest of the world.¶What does it mean ... what it wants to say expressing this -- this point, it's bad for American workers, is just to say, ""I will have to close old plants, coal activities and all this stuff."" I mean, it's true. You will have to switch from a model to another one. But I mean, it's understandable not to deal with reality and what we know.¶So I think our responsibility as leaders today, as political leaders is to push our economic leaders to change their investment behavior, to decide new things, and to help workers to change their jobs. And I think the mistake that -- that you're making, I mean, that your president decided to make is exactly the mistake we made in France and in Europe -- I mean, the first phase of globalization.¶Which was to resist to the change in order to protect the old jobs. What we have to protect is people, not jobs. If you want to protect people, you retrain them. You help them in order to change their jobs to new ones much more adaptive and consistent with our commitments and our collective interests.¶GLOR: But you think there has to be pain before progress?¶MACRON: I mean, I think that you'll have billions and billions all over the globe. I mean, today we're full of liquidity in money. And what you have to do is to convince big money to change the mindset and reinvest in these new activities to accelerate this change and create new jobs.¶GLOR: So that's the other part of it. You think that most of the money has to come from the private sector, not just the public sector?¶MACRON: I mean, both, but when, you know, when you speak about public money, you speak about taxpayer's money. And -- and I'm very [unintelligible] with that. If I commit myself with money, I do so. And we will commit tomorrow at the One Planet Summit to increase, for instance, our financing in terms of conditions. That's one thing.¶But on top of the public financing by governments, which is very much important -- and that's an important point, you have to convince banks, insurance, ... will fund ... and I mean a lot of people in the private sector to invest and to commit themselves for large tickets on this green activities and this green economy. And it's feasible. Why? First of all, because it makes sense. And a lot of people just want to invest in something which makes sense. Second, because it's more on more with good returns.¶When you look at solar energy, when you look at also wind energy, you have very good returns now. I mean, it's in price, so which means that they can invest and have pretty good return. Third, because you can help to develop a lot of countries and a lot of regions. And when you look at the total cost of our inability to deal with climate change and access to energy in Sahel, in Sahara, in a lot of regions, the total cost of our lack of action or our mistakes is much higher than the one, the, I mean, the money we have to invest right now.¶GLOR: Why do you think the president pulled outta this?¶MACRON: I think it took-- I mean, I do respect your president. First of all, he was elected by you guys. And as the president of the American people. And second, he took a commitment during his campaign. I [have had a] lot of discussion with him. We have a very good personal relationship.¶GLOR: Tell me about that.¶MACRON: No, but we have direct discussions and each time I take a decision or he takes a decision, we have a direct phone call. And I do respect him. And I think he has a very strong view in terms of security. And we are very strong allies and we work very closely together in Middle East and in order to fight against terrorism.¶But we didn't agree on two to three issues, and the very first one was on climate. And what it told me is that I took a commitment vis-à-vis my voters. And I told them it was not good for the U.S. and especially the U.S. workers. I tried to convince them. I do believe that on the mid- to long-run it's not true. And I do believe it's important to have on board the U.S. government.¶But I do respect [Mr. Trump], and I do respect his decision. So, I'm not saying, he doesn't understand and doesn't share the analysis. But just he took a political commitment. In the meanwhile, we are gathering a lot of your cities with the C40 funded by Mike Bloomberg. We are gathering a lot of regions and a lot of American states with the R20 and a lot of initiatives. And we are gathering the private sector with a lot of investors and the U.S. investors.¶And when I add all these commitments, I match the ... commitments ... after Paris agreement. And it was very much important for me to show that the U.S. is here. It's not because of the decision of the president that the U.S. stops its efforts.¶GLOR: This $2.3 billion. How do you make that up?¶MACRON:  For the U.S. part?¶GLOR: Uh-huh.¶MACRON: Cities, states, private sector. I want to change the-- the rule of the green (unintelligible), because today it's just a law to-- to governments to contribute. I want your private sectors, your cities and your states to contribute to this fund as well, so you can match it with-- I mean the rest of the U.S., which is not the federal government.¶And it's totally feasible, because I want to see how your private sector, how your cities, and especially the C-40, how a lot of your states-- and Governor Brown, for instance, made-- a great job, are deeply committed to fight against climate change. So at the end of the day, the U.S. is here.¶GLOR: How much has the withdrawal affected your efforts?¶MACRON: I think the withdrawal, to be totally fair with you, created a huge momentum to me to create a counter-momentum. I launched the same day of the announcement of the-- President Trump's decision to leave-- Paris Agreement, I took an initiative called Make Our Planet Great Again.¶This initiative is delivering. Now, we just-- we just decided to-- grant a series of some loans, and commitments to dozens of-- researchers coming from the youth, mainly (unintelligible) for India, from Canada and so on, because they answer to this call.¶Second, it creates a huge mobilization of a lot of countries saying, ""I do confirm."" And you had, right at-- the U.S. announcement, an acceleration of the ratification process in a lot of countries. And third, it allows us to take a leadership of a deep, private commitment, and the One Planet Summit, organized in Paris the 12th of December-- is for me this momentum to gather all this initiative.¶We will announce 12 big initiatives. For instance, one on Caribbean with a big commitment on Caribbean organization. And it does concern, by the way, the U.S. With a deep commitment on Africa, with new financing. With-- which is brand new. A deep commitment from the Sovereign Fund. So we have a lot of very strong initiatives around the seven.¶GLOR: So just so I'm understanding: You say you're in better shape now because of this withdrawal. That the president--¶MACRON: I think today--¶GLOR: --did you a favor?¶MACRON: We have a momentum, because I think we have two phenomenon. So withdraw of the U.S., which for me is a mistake, that equates an impulse for a lot of others to say, ""OK, we have to react and do something, because it's impossible to leave this all to-- a sort of dismantling of the Paris Agreement.""¶Second, a deep wakeup call for the private sectors and some of us to say, ""Wow, so we have to react."" Otherwise, that it will become a little bit shaky. But in the same time, the Chinese commitment to remain in Paris Agreement and be more and more dedicated to climate ch-- and-- and-- and all of the (unintelligible) the relevant answers to climate change, the deep commitment of some others created a pretty good momentum.¶But today, to be totally direct with you, today we are not at a rendezvous. Today we have, honestly, a big issue in general, but it's not directly due to the U.S. decision. We are not delivering in line with the Paris Agreement. And-- and the increase of the average temperature is plus 3.5 degrees instead of plus 1.5 degrees, which was the initial commitment.¶So we have-- on top of it, and beyond the U.S. decision, we have to accelerate. We have to commitment ourselves. We have to make big change in our product-- I mean our way to produce, our way to organize ourselves, our way to invest. And-- and I just want to pass this (unintelligible) to your people, which is say, just think one second that if we decide not to decide, if we decide not to move and not change our way to produce, to invest, to behave, de facto we decide, you decide to condemn billions of people in the coming decades.¶That's a big decision. And we will-- I mean we-- all of us will be judged for that. All-- all of us. So we have to react-- right now, because we know, it's-- it will be impossible in 20, 30 years to explain, ""Ah, we are sorry. We were not aware that we had to change."" No. We do know that if we don't change, if we don't react, we will be responsible for billions of victims.¶I don't want to be a leader in such a situation, so let's act right now. Let's invest on green technologies. Let's change our business model. Let's behave differently. Let's move differently. Let's take all the cars. Let's change our mindset, our way to proceed, precisely because that's our responsibility.¶GLOR: He says he's open to renegotiation.¶MACRON: You know, you have more than 190 countries as negotiators. I-- I'm not ready to renegotiate with so many people, I'm sorry, around the table. I mean (unintelligible) negotiated. There is-- a classical Latin formula in international rules say-- saying, ""pacta sunt servanda"", when you sign a treaty, you have to respect it.¶The U.S. is a great government, is a great country. The U.S. did sign the Paris Agreement. It's extremely aggressive to decide on its own just to leave, and no way to push the others to renegotiate because one decided to leave the-- the floor. I'm sorry to say that. It doesn't fly. So sorry, but I think it's a big responsibility in front of history, and I'm-- I-- I'm pretty sure that my friend President Trump will change his mind in the coming months or years. I do hope.¶GLOR: You think he'll change his mind?¶MACRON: Yes, I mean my-- I'm not ready to renegotiate, but I'm-- I'm ready to welcome him if he decides to come back.¶GLOR: How often do you speak to President Trump?¶MACRON: Look. As often as we need. For instance, during the past weeks, we had probably three to four phone calls together. It's very easy, as soon as he asks for a call, I call him back and exactly the same on his side. We have very fluent and open discussions.¶GLOR: And you would characterize that relationship as friendly?¶MACRON: Yes, very direct.¶GLOR: You talked about Jerusalem?¶MACRON: Yes, exactly.¶GLOR: Before.¶MACRON: Yes.¶GLOR: And he said what?¶MACRON: He said that probably he will announce the fact that he wanted to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and transfer the [embassy] ... I mean, all this, the American services -- in Jerusalem.¶GLOR: And you told him what?¶MACRON: I told him, I thought it was a mistake. I told him I thought that the issue is not this one. I told him that it's not compliant with these international rules. Because we decided internationally that it's not the case. Why? Because we work and we've worked all together on the recognition of two states, Israel and Palestine -- with borders recognized by the international community. And that such a unilateral decision is not compliant with our international discussions and our international rules and will not facilitate a peace process. Because that's a unilateral decision, and that's pretty much humiliating for the Palestinian side.¶GLOR: Was that was that a calm conversation? Was that a confrontational conversation?¶MACRON: I think it's always an open and direct discussion. You can agree to disagree. Which is the case between us on some issues. I mean, he told me the rationale of his decision, which was to create a new momentum to pushing to change the whole system, because he considers, which is true that the old negotiation is blocked for this and has been blocked for decades.¶And he wanted to create a momentum of strong reaction due to this announcement. I told him that for me, it's not the right announcement to create a new momentum and new process at this moment. But at the end of the day, you decide for your own. And he decided for the U.S. I decided for France, which is normal.¶GLOR: In your estimation, does it jeopardize the peace process?¶MACRON: I think, I mean, first of all, I do call for peace and calm. And you saw some reactions and very aggressive reactions first of all against Israel. And I'm a strong ally of Israel. And we're very much concerned by peace and security for Israel. So I have this call for peace and calm. Because I don't want that the potential consequences of this announcement could be to jeopardize the security of Israel because of the reaction of some people in the region.¶Second, I am very careful about the reaction in the whole region. In Lebanon, in Israel, in Palestine, in Jordan, in all the different countries, where you have a lot of Palestinian refugees and where this obviously, the situation is very sensitive. So my first obsession I would see and my first concern is to preserve peace and calm in the whole region.¶And I think if we have any victims or big trouble, it could jeopardize for a long, pretty long time any peace process or any initiative. Second, I think we have to discuss with all the parties and try to find a way out. But obviously, the reaction of the Palestinians will not be very positive. They are not in a good mood to progress towards any peace process.¶GLOR: You've inserted yourself into a lot of these conflicts in a rather fast fashion. What do you see as your role in Europe and the globe as a whole?¶MACRON: Look, I think our role is largely to try to build peace. And to preserve a (unintelligible) approach. When you look at the situation today, you have some rogue states. You have a lot of destabilization in the whole planet in different regions, a lot of tensions.¶What we learn from the past is that you cannot make peace against people by interfering and-- and just launching a war and trying to change a regime without any political solution. So my role is first to avoid any war and try to-- to frame the discussion in order to create peace and have a comprehensive peace process and preserve (unintelligible ) and especially in this Middle East region. That's what I tried to do in Lebanon, for instance, by negotiating both with M.B.S., with the Lebanese government. And I, at the end of the day, we found a pretty good solution for everybody by preserving the stability of-- the leb-- Lebanese government, by preserving the integrity of Lebanon, and by putting more neutrality from all the Lebanese parties towards the other conflicts of the region. That's typically for me the role that we can play in the region and more broadly.¶The second role we have to play, and that's the very close decision we have with the U.S., is to fight against terrorism and the roots of terrorism. And that's our place in the international coalition in Syria and Iraq and alongside with the U.S. And that's our role in Sahel, in Sahara, because I have 4,500 people on the ground in this region fighting against the terrorists and helping the African governments to fight against the terrorists.¶GLOR: How concerned are you about terrorism in Africa?¶MACRON: I'm very much concerned-- I'm very much concerned because you have a very-- very strong push coming from the jihadists in the whole region. You have Boko Haram in Nigeria and the-- Lake Chad region. You have in Sahel and Sahara now all these new movements coagula-- I mean, they are coagulating and they're very much active from Mali South of Algeria till Libya. And you have a lot of destabilization both in Libya and Somalia. And we have to be very careful.¶So we need first a very deft action to dismantle these groups, to dismantle these terrorists and all the-- all the traffics directly linked to terrorists. Human trafficking, drugs, and arms trafficking. And second, you have a big issue in terms of stability and political stability. We have to fix the situation in Libya.¶That's one of our top priorites, because as long as you don't have a stable government in Libya, it's very hard to fix the situation. And third, you need development. You need education. You need more investment to develop those countries, because the jihadists and all these terrorist groups manage to progress when precisely you have poverty, you have no hope, and you have such a situation.¶And by the way, climate change is directly linked to the situation. For instance, in the Lake Chad region, you have a lot of poverty due to climate change. And the fact that you have, for instance, fishermen, and their jobs were killed by the shrinking of the lake.¶GLOR: Are you more concerned about climate or terrorism?¶MACRON: Look, it'sm I mean, obviously security is my very first and-- my-- my top priority. On the-- on the very short run, I have nothing more important than fighting against terrorism, killing these terrorist groups and-- and-- suppressing those activities, and fighting against all the different tools of the terrorists, i.e., the silencing of these terrorist groups (papers noise) and the related activities of these terrorists.¶Climate change is very important and climate is-- is-- is a deep commitment. But it's totally different. But as I told you, both of them are inter-correlated. Because in some regions if you don't manage basically to deal with the consequences of climate change, you increase the place of terrorist-- potential terrorist activities.¶GLOR: These-- the smaller scale attacks like the one that happened in New York City today, they've happened in France as well, how do you prevent those?¶MACRON:  You prevent them by increasing your intelligence. Your-- by increasing your cooperation with-- with all the regions where they can come from, for-- both in Europe, in Middle East, and Africa. So we includes a lot of our cooperation exchange of information and so on.¶Second, by increasing your intelligence on your own country. Why? Because you have a lot of un-- under (unintelligible)-- terrorism now. You have a lot of people who had grew up-- grown up-- in your country, educated in your country, and suddenly becoming terrorists. Because of the influence of-- the propaganda on internet, and because of their life, and something-- something suddenly happens.¶It's impossible to go to some-- I mean zero risk. That's impossible, because it's just-- one, people in the street which (snapping) suddenly can totally change his mind and become crazy. And he has a lot of (unintelligible) and (unintelligible) activities. But you have-- you can reduce if you invest on more intelligence, more interception to prevent this-- this type of behavior.¶You can prevent them if you are-- if we are much more-- aggressive, I would say, in-- in order to reduce the propaganda of the jihadists and the terrorists on the net. That's why we need more commitment coming from the-- the internet players, and that's one of the (unintelligible) we want to-- to increase in Europe in the case, and I think that the U.S. do need the same.¶And you need the counter-propaganda. And more than that, you have to help your people to find a place in your society, because it's very rare to have wealthy people becoming suddenly terrorists. I mean most of the time, we speak about people without any hope, without any perspective in the society, will suddenly decide for any reason to become a terrorist or a jihadist. So on the mid-run (?), on top of that, if you want to prevent this kind of-- behavior, you have as well to better take care of your people, and-- and help them to find a place in your society.",0

    ","¶PARIS -- More than 50 world leaders are joining bankers, energy magnates and others Tuesday in Paris for a summit that President Emmanuel Macron hopes will give new momentum to the fight against global warming -- despite U.S. President Donald Trump's rejection of the Paris climate accord.¶Sean Penn, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bill Gates, Michael Bloomberg and Elon Musk are among prominent figures joining the world leaders at the summit, where participants are expected to announce billions of dollars' worth of projects to help poor countries and industries reduce emissions.¶Speaking to CBS Evening News anchor Jeff Glor the day before the summit kicked off, Macron said he believed Mr. Trump's rejection of the Paris accord had conversely given his own movement ""huge momentum.""¶More in Climate Change¶""Today we have a momentum, because I think we have two phenomenon; so withdraw of the U.S., which for me is a mistake, that equates an impulse for a lot of others to say, 'Okay, we have to react and do something,'"" Macron told Glor in Paris. ""If we decide not to move and not change our way to produce, to invest, to behave, we will be responsible for billions of victims. I don't want to be a leader in such a situation, so let's act right now.""¶Activists kept up the pressure with a protest in the shadow of the domed Pantheon monument on Tuesday, calling for an end to all investment in oil, gas and resource mining.¶That wasn't far from the message from top officials opening the summit: They agreed that the global financial system isn't shifting fast enough away from carbon emissions and toward energy and business projects that don't aggravate climate change.¶""Financial pledges need to flow faster through more streamlined system and make a difference on the ground,"" said Fiji's Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama, whose island nation is among those on the front lines of the rising sea levels and extreme storms worsened by human-made emissions.¶""We are all in the same canoe,"" rich countries and poor, he said.¶Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono described ways Japan is investing in climate monitoring technology and hydrogen energy, but said ""we have to do more and better.""¶Some 3,100 security personnel are fanned out around Paris for Tuesday's event, including extra patrol boats along the Seine River. Macron will accompany the visiting leaders to the summit site on a river island by boat.¶Macron, who's also using the event to raise his international profile, did not invite Mr. Trump. ¶The White House took issue on Tuesday with the description of that non-invite, however, with an administration official telling CBS News the French had asked the White House who to invite, and that it was decided an official from the U.S. Embassy in Paris would attend. The official stressed that the option for Mr. Trump to attend was there, but they decided to send someone else. CBS News has sought clarification from the French government on how any invites to U.S. officials were extended.¶On Monday, Macron awarded 18 climate scientists -- most of them based in the U.S. -- multimillion-euro grants to relocate to France for the rest of Trump's term.¶Mr. Trump has expressed skepticism about global warming and said the Paris accord would hurt U.S. business. He's said he wants the terms of the agreement renegotiated, a notion Macron firmly dismissed on Monday in his interview with CBS News.¶""You have more than 190 countries as negotiators.

It's extremely aggressive to decide on its own just to leave, and no way to push the others to renegotiate because one decided to leave the floor,"" Macron said. ""I'm sorry to say that. It doesn't fly."" He said he would, however, happily welcome Mr. Trump back into the agreement should he reconsider his position.¶The ""Make Our Planet Great Again"" grants -- a nod to Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" campaign slogan -- are part of Macron's efforts to counter Mr. Trump on the climate change front. Macron announced a contest for the projects in June, hours after Mr. Trump declared he would withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate accord.¶The summit, co-hosted by the U.N., World Bank and Macron, is being held on the second anniversary of the Paris climate accord, ratified by 170 countries.¶Germany's Angela Merkel, who was once labeled the 'climate chancellor' for her efforts to curb global warming, has faced domestic criticism for failing to attend the summit.¶Annalena Baerbock, a spokeswoman on climate issues for the opposition Green party, said Tuesday that Macron appeared to be overtaking Merkel as Europe's leading lobbyist on climate issues.¶""I think that's not a good sign,"" Baerbock told public broadcaster Deutschlandfunk.  She said Germany had lost international credibility on the issue by allowing its carbon emissions to stagnate over the past decade and refusing to join a recent international declaration on ending the use of coal, one of the most polluting fossil fuels.¶Baerbock said Europe's biggest economy also could have sent a signal on climate financing - a major topic in Paris - by declaring that civil servants' pensions wouldn't be invested in fossil fuels companies anymore, as some countries have already done.¶Macron hosted leading world philanthropists Tuesday morning to encourage more climate-related investment.",0

            The governor who's castigating the president on climate change - CBS News
    ",,,"¶Our country is divided between red states and blue states, a division that has intensified since the election of President Donald Trump. And some of the blue states are intensifying their resistance to the president. Most prominently, California, the country's bluest and most populous state, led by Governor Jerry Brown. Brown has been governor of California twice -- the first time, 40 years ago. He criticizes the president on taxes. California is suing the Trump administration over health care, immigration, and air quality, but nothing raises more righteous passion in Jerry Brown than the issue of climate change. He castigates the president for denying the science and aggravating a problem Governor Brown says is causing California to burn.¶This is the most destructive fire season on record in California. Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency this past week as raging wildfires, whipped by fierce Santa Ana winds and fueled by bone-dry brush, laid waste to tens-of-thousands of acres in Southern California. The smoke plume that shrouded the Los Angeles area could be seen from space. The fires that ravaged California's famed wine country in October were the deadliest the state has ever seen. Whole neighborhoods were incinerated. Dozens of people were killed.¶Governor Jerry Brown: The fire season used to be a few months in the summer, now it's almost year-long. These fires are unprecedented. We've never seen anything like it. Scientists are telling us, ""This is the kind of stuff that's gonna happen."" And we gotta deal with it.¶It's going to happen, he says, based on science that predicts extreme swings in weather patterns. This year, Southern California experienced record heat in October and November, creating the perfect conditions for this.¶Governor Jerry Brown: Nature is not a political game. Nature is the ground on which we stand, it's the air which we breathe. The truth of the case is that there's too much carbon being emitted, that heat-trapping gases are building up, the planet is warming and all hell is breaking loose.¶Bill Whitaker: President Trump has famously called climate change -- a hoax. When he pulled out of the Paris Climate Accord he said this wasn't a good deal for the United States. ¶Governor Jerry Brown: That's a preposterous idea not even a shred of truth in that statement. So I'd say to Mr. Trump, take a deeper look now is not the time to undo what every country in the world is committed to.¶Bill Whitaker: Are you fearful?¶Governor Jerry Brown: Oh yeah, you should, anyone who isn't is not looking at the facts. I don't think President Trump has a fear of the Lord, the fear of the wrath of God, which leads one to more humility. And this is such a reckless disregard for the truth and for the existential consequences that can be unleashed.¶If he sounds like a Jesuit seminarian, it's because he was one, years ago. Now, he's a climate missionary, traveling the world, preaching the gospel of renewable energy -- at the Vatican; in China, where President Xi Jinping discussed collaborating with California on cutting greenhouse gases. Brown went to the global climate summit in Bonn, Germany last month. He and former New York City mayor, Michael Bloomberg led a delegation of mayors and legislators representing 40% of the U.S. economy. While the official U.S. delegation, sent by the White House, showed up to promote coal; Brown went to tell the world President Trump doesn't speak for all Americans.¶Governor Jerry Brown: California is not waiting for Trump. We're not waiting for all the deniers. ¶He's already weaning California off fossil fuels. To give us a glimpse of the future, Brown took us to a 62-acre solar farm near Sacramento on the site of a decommissioned nuclear power plant.¶Bill Whitaker: You wanna have 50% of California's electricity generated by renewable sources by--¶Governor Jerry Brown: By 2030.¶Bill Whitaker: --2030. And you--¶Governor Jerry Brown: And I think--¶Bill Whitaker: --think you're gonna beat that?¶Governor Jerry Brown: Yes, no question about it.¶With the federal government standing down on climate action, California is blazing its own trail.    ¶Bill Whitaker: What can you, the governor of one state in the United States, do to fill in the void?¶Governor Jerry Brown: As governor of California we have a cap and trade system which is a very efficient way to reducing greenhouse gases. We have zero-emission vehicle mandate. We have efficiency standards for our buildings, for our appliances. So California is showing that dealing with climate is good for the economy, not bad.¶California is booming. Under Brown, it has grown from the 9th largest economy in the world to the 6th. It's now bigger than France with a budget surplus of more than $7 billion. ¶Bill Whitaker: When you first came into office this time. California faced more than $50 billion in debt and deficits. There were headlines that California was going to be the first ""failed state."" ¶Governor Jerry Brown: The fact is we cut the budget, we raised taxes and the economy roared back. ¶Bill Whitaker: You cut the budget. You raised taxes. These days that sounds like a prescription for political suicide?¶Governor Jerry Brown: You gotta pay some taxes. You have to invest. We need to invest in the technology of tomorrow or somebody else will. And that somebody is China, India and other countries. You're not gonna poor mouth yourself to the future and roads cost money, that's called taxes. R&D cost money, colleges cost money -- schools, childcare, all of that. We're a rich country and we can handle it. ¶But California's economic success has come at a cost. Housing prices are through the roof. So are the ranks of the homeless. A quarter of the country's homeless live in California. ¶Governor Jerry Brown: This is not paradise. We have a lot of problems. But California is the engine of America, and I like to remind my fellow citizens when you kinda look askance at this state, you're looking at one of the, not the only one, but a major contributor to the well-being of the whole country. ¶California is vital to the national economy. That's why Brown is so angered by the new tax overhaul legislation being pushed by House and Senate Republicans. They call it a tax cut, but Brown says by eliminating deductions for state and local taxes it would actually increase the tax burden on high tax blue states like California. He and other blue state governors say the bill is retaliation against Trump's opponents. Brown called it evil and divisive. ¶Bill Whitaker: Do you think the Republicans are intentionally trying to punish the blue states that didn't vote for President Trump?  ¶Governor Jerry Brown: I know this. The Republicans have this cult. Just like they believe there's no climate problem, they believe that cutting corporate taxes without any money to pay for it, they think it's magic, it'll make everything wonderful. Very irresponsible. Very dangerous.¶But California Republicans say Brown's tax hikes are irresponsible. In Trump's America, Jerry Brown's California seems far out on the frontier. California doesn't look like the rest of the country: Minorities now are the majority of the population. It doesn't act like the rest of the country: The state voted to legalize recreational marijuana starting in January; will soon offer a third gender choice on drivers' licenses. Hillary Clinton trounced President Trump here by more than 4 million votes.¶Bill Whitaker: It seems that California is way out of step with the rest of the country.¶Governor Jerry Brown: I'd say we're more in tune with the future than many parts of the rest of the country. ¶Bill Whitaker: You think the country is going to look more like California in the future?¶Governor Jerry Brown: I think it will. I was asking myself, ""Why did Democrats in Ohio and Wisconsin and Michigan, Pennsylvania, why'd they vote for Trump?"" Not a lot of 'em did, but enough to give him those states' electoral votes. ¶Bill Whitaker: And your answer?¶Governor Jerry Brown: There's more confidence here; there's less fear. People are looking to the future. They're not scared, they're not going inward, they're not scapegoating, they're not blaming Mexican immigrants. They're not blaming the stranger. Just the opposite. It's is a place that's alive. It's dynamic. It's a culture that's on the move, not pulling up the drawbridge out of fear and and economic insecurity. ¶Jerry Brown is California's 39th and oldest governor. When he first held the office in 1975 he had a full head of hair. His father, Pat Brown had been governor eight years before.  When you look at all the staid portraits of his predecessors in the capitol rotunda, it's obvious Jerry Brown is not like the others. Not many politicians spent four years in the seminary as Brown did in the 1950s. Or dated a rock star. He went out with Linda Rondstadt in the 70s.   ¶Governor Jerry Brown: I've seen a lotta different things. I've worked with Mother Theresa. I've spent six months doing Zen meditation in Kamakura, Japan and I've run for President three times. I've done very incompatible things.¶Bill Whitaker: People who like you will say that that's evidence of intellectual flexibility. People who don't like you say that that's evidence of your being flighty.¶Governor Jerry Brown: Well, I'm not gonna -- that's that psycho babble.¶Whatever you call it, his far-out politics his first time in office earned him the moniker Governor Moonbeam. We found him to be down to earth. He's California casual at the office. His dog Colusa has the run of the place.¶Bill Whitaker: Are you better at being governor this time?¶Governor Jerry Brown: Yeah, it's a different experience. 79 is not 36. Different ball game in every way. So I would say I know more, I understand more. ¶Bill Whitaker: What have you learned about yourself in those intervening years?¶Governor Jerry Brown: There's something you lose with age, your physical prowess -- but mental acuity and -- just life experience is very important. So, I enjoy the job a lot more.¶It's hard to see why. His liberal policies make him a punching bag for conservatives and he's not universally loved by liberals. He's a political maverick. He's rolling back state union pensions. He refuses to curb oil production until there's a viable alternative. A majority of Californians like what he's doing. But he's been doing this for almost 50 years and he says it's time to hang up his political spurs. When he leaves office in January 2019, he swears he's going to leave elective politics behind. ¶Bill Whitaker: I think you're gonna miss this. ¶Governor Jerry Brown: No I won't.  ¶Bill Whitaker: You don't think so?¶Governor Jerry Brown: Next year I'll be 80, okay? And what do I want to do with my life? That's my question.¶Bill Whitaker: What do you want to do?¶Governor Jerry Brown: Well, I want to spend time with my wife.¶A go it alone bachelor nearly all of his adult life, Jerry Brown now has a partner to share his life -- Anne Gust Brown, a former executive at The Gap. They married in 2005.  Their plan is to retire to a ranch, in a golden valley north of Sacramento. They're building their dream ranch house - with solar panels, of course. It's off the grid and way off the beaten path. ¶The governor and Colusa, showed us around.  ¶Bill Whitaker: This is beautiful governor. This is pretty steep.¶Governor Jerry Brown: Oh you haven't seen nothing yet.  ¶He told us he's going out at his peak, stepping away from the fray on land his great-grandfather settled in the 1860s. He said he intends to be a modest rancher. He's going to unplug and unwind.  ¶Bill Whitaker: Do ya think this man sitting next to you is going to be content puttering around the ranch?¶Governor Jerry Brown: I wouldn't call it ""puttering."" I don't ""putter.""¶Anne Gust Brown: He sure doesn't putter. No--¶Bill Whitaker: Running- - as he said, running a modest ranch.¶Anne Gust Brown: We both wonder about it. 'Cause we've been running a hundred miles an hour and now we're gonna be in a place that's almost the opposite of that and we'll see.¶Governor Jerry Brown: Yeah we're on the frontier, as it were.¶Bill Whitaker: And you're going to like that?¶Governor Jerry Brown: Well I like being on the frontier. That's for sure.¶Produced by Marc Lieberman and Ali Rawaf. Associate Producer, LaCrai Mitchell.",0

    ","¶MINNEAPOLIS -- If you feel like winters ""aren't what they used to be around here,"" you're right, CBS Minnesota reports.¶New analysis released Thursday by research institute Climate Central shows that, since 1970, average wintertime temperatures in Minnesota and Wisconsin are warming faster than almost any other area of the United States.¶The U.S. city that experienced the most warming was Burlington, Vermont, where average winter temperatures have risen 7°F in the last 47 years.¶More in Climate Change¶Winters in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area and the southern Minnesota city of Mankato have warmed 6°F during that period, the second- and third-largest increase among U.S. cities.  ¶Fargo, North Dakota has warmed 5.9°F, and Duluth has warmed 5.8°F in the winter during that time.¶Climate Central also noted that, in general, winter is the fastest-warming season for most of the country. Furthermore, the dramatic winter warming in northern states follows a general rule of climate change that cold areas and seasons warm faster, according to this independent study.¶In the northeast for example, New York City has seen an increase of 3.2°F over the last 47 years, Washington D.C. has seen a 2.2°F increase and Portland, Maine, has seen a 4.7°F increase since 1970.¶In Austin, Texas, there has been a 4.1°F increase during the winter months.¶To arrive at their conclusion, scientists at Climate Central analyzed average temperatures during the months of December, January and February, using publicly available data from the National Center for Environmental Information (NCEI).

    ","¶Sea-level rise this century may threaten Jamestown in Virginia, the first permanent English settlement in the Americas; the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, which launches all of NASA's human spaceflight missions; and the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse in North Carolina, the tallest brick lighthouse in the United States, a new study finds. ¶These iconic locales are some of the more than 13,000 archaeological and historical sites on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the southeastern United States that rising sea levels will endanger this century, researchers in the new study said. ¶Global warming may lead sea levels to rise by about 3.3 feet (1 meter) in the next century and by 16.4 feet (5 m) or more in the centuries afterward, according to research from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and others. These rising sea levels could have severe effects, as more than 40 percent of all people worldwide currently live within a 60-mile (100 kilometers) distance from a coastline, many in low-lying areas vulnerable to sea-level rise, according to reports from the United Nations and others. ¶More in Climate Change¶Archaeologists in the new study wanted to see what effect rising sea levels might have on archaeological and historical sites. For example, in 1999, the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse was relocated about 2,900 feet (885 m) to protect it from the encroaching sea. ¶The researchers analyzed data from the Digital Index of North American Archaeology (DINAA), which collects archaeological and historical data sets developed over the past century from multiple sources. ¶""DINAA allows us to examine where people were living in North America over the entire 15,000-year record of human settlement,"" said study lead author David Anderson, an archaeologist at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. ¶If projected trends continue, there could be a 3.3-foot (1 m) rise in sea level by 2100, submerging thousands of recorded archaeological and historical sites in the southeastern United States alone, the scientists predicted. ¶""We will lose much of the record of the last several thousand years of human occupation in coastal areas, where a great deal of history and settlement has occurred,"" Anderson told Live Science. ¶The study found that only relatively minor increases in seal level, on the order of 1 to 3 m (3 to 10 feet), were necessary to threaten these iconic places. Other important cultural landmarks at risk include Charleston, South Carolina, and St. Augustine, Florida, the oldest continuously occupied European settlement in the Americas. In addition, at archaeological sites where indigenous inhabitants, early settlers, and enslaved and later freed peoples once lived, rising seas pose a risk of damage or disappearance. ¶The 13,000 or so sites identified by the study are only a tiny fraction of the ones known to science, ""much less [those] thoroughly examined by archaeologists,"" Anderson said. Many other sites that archaeologists have not yet had a chance to explore will also be lost, the researchers added. ¶Furthermore, the researchers found that more than 32,000 archaeological sites -- including more than 2,400 sites on the National Register of Historic Places -- will get lost if a 16.4-foot (5 m) or higher seal-level rise occurs, the researchers found. ¶""What was surprising was the vast numbers of archaeological sites that are threatened when the data are examined collectively,"" Anderson said. ""When you develop tools showing how much will be lost at regional and continental scales, it shows the scale of the challenge and the need to start seriously planning for it."" ¶In the future, more states can participate in DINAA so that informed decisions can be made ""about what to try to save, and how,"" Anderson said. ¶This isn't the first time scientists have suggested that climate change could threaten important U.S. landmarks. In 2014, a study found that rising sea levels pose a risk to cultural landmarks such as the Statue of Liberty. Scientists detailed the findings of the new study online today in the journal PLOS ONE. ¶Originally published on Live Science. ",0
How rocket launch emissions and space junk affect Earth's atmosphere,"

    ","¶Nobody knows the extent to which rocket launches and re-entering space debris affect Earth's atmosphere — but such ignorance could be remedied soon.¶The issue of rocket emissions — which deliver gases and particles directly into the middle and upper atmosphere — will be included in a forthcoming United Nations 2018 Quadrennial Global Ozone Assessment that delves into the substances responsible for ozone depletion.¶""The 2018 assessment is really the first one to have a substantial section on rocket emissions, not just a passing thought,"" said Martin Ross, a lead author of the relevant section in the upcoming report. [The World's Tallest Rockets: How They Stack Up]¶More in Climate Change¶""The climate impact of rockets has not really been seriously addressed as yet,"" Ross, a senior project engineer for civil and commercial launch projects at The Aerospace Corporation in El Segundo, California, told Space.com. ""But with respect to ozone, we now understand that the climate and ozone impacts of rocket exhaust are completely intertwined.""¶Rocket soot accumulates in the upper stratosphere, where the particles absorb sunlight, Ross said. This accumulation heats the upper stratosphere, changing chemical reaction rates and likely leading to ozone loss, he added. ¶In flagging the issue, Ross said he hopes the scientific community becomes interested enough to start running atmospheric models of the phenomenon — especially because the pace of rocket launches is expected to ramp up significantly in the coming decades.¶""I think we're at about that point,"" Ross said. ¶A key study focus is the climate impact of major rocket-engine emissions: carbon dioxide, water, black carbon and alumina particles discharged by solid rocket-booster motors. ¶A recent finding, Ross said, is that alumina particles, previously thought to cool the Earth by scattering solar flux back to space, actually warm the planet, by absorbing outgoing terrestrial, long-wave radiation. However, fully appreciating the microphysics of alumina and other rocket emissions introduced into the atmosphere requires more research, he added.¶For example, the interactions between Earth's atmosphere and exhaust from methane-fueled rocket engines have not been modeled, ""so we really don't know"" the effects these rockets have, Ross said.¶There's no yardstick by which to assess how significant the impacts of rocket exhaust may be, he added. ¶""The notion of what is the metric by which rocket exhaust is to be judged … that is a completely open question,"" Ross said. ""Then, compare that metric to the expected growth in launch rates. That really needs to be done. Just saying the ozone loss is too big — that's not an acceptable metric."" ¶There has been a lot of buzz recently about spaceflight companies shooting for frequent ""airline-like operations,"" but scientists, engineers and policy makers generally are not ""putting two and two together with respect to the emissions that are implied by that idea,"" Ross said.¶Space hardware falling back to Earth can affect the atmosphere as well, so re-entering orbital debris should also be studied, Ross said.¶""Vaporize"" may mean ""disappear"" in most people's minds, but that's assuredly not the case with re-entering space junk, Ross said. Such debris, he said, generates ""re-entry smoke particles"" (RSPs) of unknown composition and reactivity. Scientific models suggest that at least 50 percent of a given debris object will end up as RSPs during re-entry.  ¶""In that crucial 20 seconds of re-entry, you go from heating to melting to vaporization and then back into dust. How does that happen? What is that composition? We don't know at all. We need to get away from this idea that vaporization equals disappearance,"" Ross said. ""Vaporization equals dust production. That process isn't well-understood at all. Again, we need to know the microphysics of these recondensed particles.""¶The plunge into Earth's atmosphere of derelict satellites, rocket stages and other space flotsam is a common occurrence. For spacecraft re-entries, that process is ""basically burning computers,"" Ross said.¶During re-entry, big chunks of aluminum and other materials are subjected to intense heating. The chemical kinetics of the particles that are produced in this way have not been examined, Ross said. Some particles are very reactive, so small amounts of them could have a significant effect on atmospheric chemistry, he added.¶""So far, nobody has deemed it important enough to study, and I believe it is,"" Ross said.¶Leonard David is author of ""Mars: Our Future on the Red Planet,"" published by National Geographic.

            Endangered coffee crops in Uganda threaten families' livelihood - CBS News

But because of the damage being done to the planet by the primary dark liquid -- oil -- along with other fossil fuels, coffee is in trouble.  And so are the farmers who grow it.   ¶Uganda coffee farmer Anthony Khabala said this year's harvest was ""not so good."" ¶Up here in the mountains of eastern Uganda, coffee is the most important thing they grow.¶Anthony and Vincent Khabala's family have been growing coffee on their farm about 4,000 feet up the slopes of Mount Elgon for generations.  Lately, though, they've been having problems they've never had before.  ¶It turns out coffee is as fussy as the people who drink it. It likes the right altitude, the right temperature and the right amounts of rain and sunshine in the right order. It's the Goldilocks of crops that likes things just right.¶Not enough rain and too much sunshine produces bad fruit.¶""Too much sunshine produces bad fruits,"" Anthony confirmed.  Another farmer.  Another farm.  Another problem.¶This fine white powder is produced by the stem-borer beetle, which Sam Massa says is just one of the pests and diseases that have come up from the valleys as the weather has warmed. ¶""Ten years back, it was not here,"" Massa said. ""Most of the farms have been destroyed completely, totally by this stem borer.""¶Coffee yields have been dropping and prices are up by as much as 30 percent in some areas since 2015. More than just the consumer's morning pick-me-up is threatened. ¶The farmers are caffeine-dependant for another reason: From picking the berries to processing them to drying and sorting the beans and getting them to market -- this is a family business. A family business where every member of the family contributes and where the cash from selling the coffee provides the only income to pay for schools for the kids and for medical care.  ¶There is actually an imbalance in the coffee world, the retail is controlled by the big brands -- the big distributers. But the production comes from little family, almost vegetable-patch sized, farms like this.  If production fails here, the big boys can go somewhere else,  these people can't go anywhere.  ¶For the people who consume coffee, it's about a drink.  ¶For the people who produce it, and depend on it, it's about life.

Scientists say the islands could be uninhabitable within decades, and in recent years, some leaders there have begun planning for a worst-case scenario that could involve relocating the population to other countries. ¶However, in a video presentation to the international climate conference in Bonn, Germany, last week, the president of Kiribati appeared to be turning away from such a plan.¶""Climate change is indeed a serious problem,"" President H.E Taneti Maamau said in the video.""But we don't believe that Kiribati will sink like the Titanic ship. Our country, our beautiful lands, are created by the hands of God.""   ¶Instead, Maamau says the government's 20-year plan is to build up Kiribati and develop ""a resilient and updated capacity.""¶More in Climate Change¶""We can't do it alone,"" he said. ""We need the cooperation and the hands of our developing partners and those who are ready to assist and join us on this ambitious journey.""¶Later in the video, far from discussing abandoning the islands, a narrator instead proclaims the goal of promoting tourism by attracting foreign investors to develop ""5-star eco-friendly resorts that would promote world-class diving, fishing and surfing experiences"" on currently uninhabited islands. ¶It says the nation's 20-year plan ""has an ambitious aim to transform Kiribati into the Dubai or Singapore of the Pacific."" ¶Kiribati (pronounced ""kir-ah-bahss"" by locals), is made up of a string of 33 small islands located halfway between Hawaii and Australia. It is home to 100,000 people and has has an average elevation of just 6 feet above sea level. Extremely high tides, known as ""King Tides,"" have inundated homes, contaminated drinking water and killed off crops. ¶Government officials say they are working on a plan to raise the level of a large area of currently uninhabitable land to make it habitable.¶CBS News correspondent Seth Doane traveled to Kiribati over the summer to report for ""CBSN: On Assignment."" During his visit, Doane learned of the challenges locals are facing as climate change threatens their way of life. Some have already lost their homes.¶Several residents told Doane they would want to leave the country, but the U.N. does not recognize climate change as grounds for refugee status. ¶Others said they hold the U.S. accountable for the impacts they are experiencing thousands of miles away. The U.S. accounts for over a quarter of the world's carbon emissions to date. ¶Maamau's predecessor, former President Anote Tong, said he hopes his people find a way to leave before they are forced to evacuate. ¶""I don't like our people to be categorized as refugees. ... Having lost a home, the last thing I would push to see them lose is their dignity,"" he said in Doane's report. ¶Inside Climate News reports that in 2014, Tong purchased 6,000 acres of land in Fiji for Kiribati's permanent resettlement. He hoped to develop a model of planned retreat in the face of climate change.¶Tong called on countries worldwide to take responsibility for saving his fragile nation. ""We have got to understand that climate change is not a national issue it's a global issue, and we need global thinking. We need global leadership that is what is lacking at the moment,"" he said.",0

    ","¶ESSEN, Germany — On a dreary November morning, a small party of visitors from around the world boards a boat for an hour-long ride around what was once one of the most polluted waters in the Ruhr valley.¶Lake Baldeney has become a symbol for the efforts Germany is making to revive its western industrial heartland, and the gleaming white vessel is meant to showcase where the journey is heading: toward a cleaner, sustainable future.¶The boat is the first in the world to be fitted with an electric engine powered by a fuel cell containing methanol — a form of alcohol that inevitably prompts ""booze cruise"" jokes among passengers. What makes the boat really stand out, though, is the fact that the methanol is produced using a chemical process which draws carbon out of the air.¶More in Climate Change¶The technology, though still relatively new, is being touted by some as a weapon in the fight against man-made climate change, caused to a large degree by carbon emissions from fossil fuel use.¶Levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere have steadily increased since the industrial revolution, contributing to the greenhouse effect that is spurring global warming.¶The U.N.'s panel of scientific advisers on climate change has predicted that unless carbon emissions peak within the coming years, average temperatures around the world will rise by more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) with potentially catastrophic results.¶The boat is one of three prototypes designed to show that carbon converted to methanol — in this case with power from a nearby hydroelectric plants — can serve as an eco-friendly fuel of the future. The others are a car than can run for 310 miles on methanol and a house capable of producing and storing all the electricity it needs to be self-sufficient.¶Similar projects are springing up around the world and several were showcased on the sidelines of the global climate meeting in Bonn, Germany, while delegates were hammering out rules needed to implement the landmark Paris climate accord. The 2015 agreement, since denounced by President Donald Trump but backed by every other government on the planet, set a goal of keeping global warming significantly below 2 degrees Celsius, but didn't lay down many of the practical details needed to ensure the treaty works.¶Among the pioneers that have been getting the most attention is Swiss company call Climeworks, which operates a site near Zurich that draws carbon dioxide from the air and pumps it to a nearby plant nursery. While the saplings would naturally absorb CO2, Climeworks is effectively providing them with fertilizer and speeding up the removal of carbon at the same time.¶Daniel Egger, the company's head of sales, said the operation should break even within two years and can be scaled up easily. Climeworks is also experimenting with a different type of carbon capture at a site in Iceland, where CO2 is harvested from the air and pumped deep underground. There, it bonds with limestone to form a solid that stays safely out of the atmosphere.¶Analysts such as Andrew Jones say such systems can at best make a small contribution to achieving the Paris goals.¶""If your basement is flooding, your top priority is to turn off the faucets, not reach for the mops and buckets,"" said Jones, who is co-director of Climate Interactive, a think tank that uses computer models to simulate solutions to global warming.¶Jones said that removing 10 billion tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year, as some models suggest will be necessary, would require the energy equivalent of 1,200 new nuclear plants, or more than all of the wind and solar power forecast by the International Energy Agency to be available by 2040. ¶""While we should study these machines, the world runs the risk of being distracted by the fantasy of large-scale carbon dioxide removal when the priority should be a war-scale effort at preventing greenhouse gas emissions in the first place,"" he said.¶Doing so, however, would mean ending all use of fossil fuels by the year 2050 at the latest, a plan that few governments and businesses are willing to get behind.¶To most, the notion of going ""carbon neutral"" by the middle of the century will require a broad mix of measures, from reducing emissions to recapturing some and even using technologies that haven't been invented yet.¶A half-hour drive from Lake Baldeney lies one of Europe's oldest steelworks. The site in Duisburg, next to the Rhine river, was founded in 1891 and to this day a vast mesh of pipes, railways and chimneys covers the four-square-mile site.¶It is operated by Thyssenkrupp, a company that once made cannons for the German kaiser but is now struggling to compete against cheaper rivals from India and China. One solution, according to its chief technology officer, Reinhold E. Achatz, has been relentless innovation. Recently, that has included devising a way to utilize the carbon dioxide released in the steelmaking process and turning it into fuel, fertilizer or plastic.¶A new facility scheduled to open in April will cut down 10 million tons of CO2 emissions a year, Achatz said. Replicated across steel plants worldwide, the process could save 50 times as much while providing a raw material that would cut down on the need for oil.¶""Carbon dioxide isn't a waste,"" Achatz said. ""It's a resource.""",0
Pope Francis denounces climate change deniers,"

    ","¶BONN, Germany -- Pope Francis denounced those who deny global warming and urged negotiators at climate talks in Germany to avoid falling prey to such ""perverse attitudes"" and instead accelerate efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions.¶Francis issued a message Thursday to the Bonn meeting, which is working to implement the 2015 Paris accord aimed at capping global emissions.¶In the message, Francis called climate change ""one of the most worrisome phenomena that humanity is facing,"" and urged negotiators to ignore special interests and political or economic pressures and instead engage in an honest dialogue about the future of the planet.¶More in Climate Change¶He denounced that such efforts are often frustrated by those who deny climate change, are indifferent to it, or think it can only be solved by technical solutions.¶Also Thursday, the top American representative at the talks told other delegates the United States is still committed to reducing greenhouse gas even though the Trump administration still plans to pull out of the Paris accord.¶Britain and Canada, meanwhile, announced a new alliance aimed at encouraging countries to phase out the use of coal to curb climate change. Among others, the Global Alliance to Power Past Coal also includes Finland, France, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand and several U.S. states and Canadian provinces.¶In closing remarks to the conference, the U.S. State Department's Judith Garber said ""we remain open to the possibility of rejoining (the Paris climate deal) at a later date under terms more favorable to the American people.""¶Despite U.S. skepticism over the Paris accord, ""the United States will continue to be a leader in clean energy and innovation, and we understand the need for transforming energy systems,"" said Garber, the acting assistant secretary of state for oceans and international environmental and scientific affairs.¶""We remain collectively committed to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions through, among other things, increased innovation on sustainable energy and energy efficiency, and working towards low greenhouse gas emissions energy systems,"" she said.¶The talks are expected to end Friday.¶While coal-fueled power stations are considered one of the biggest sources of carbon dioxide that's heating up the Earth's atmosphere, countries such as Indonesia, Vietnam and the United States are planning to expand their use of coal in the coming years. Even Germany and Poland, hosts of climate talks this year and next, are holding onto coal for the foreseeable future.¶Garber did not mention the use of coal, but said as countries strive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, each ""will need to determine the appropriate energy mix based on its particular circumstances, taking into account the need for energy security, promotion of economic growth and environmental protection.""¶""In that context, we want to support the cleanest, most efficient power generation, regardless of source,"" she added.¶In a private initiative announced Thursday, Storebrand, a Norwegian investment fund that manages assets worth over $80 billion, said it would pull investments from 10 companies over their involvement in the coal sector.¶Chief executive, Jan Erik Saugestad, said the decision is meant as a warning to utility companies to ""clean up"" their energy sources ""or lose customers and investors.""¶The companies affected include German energy company RWE, Poland's PGE and Eskom Holdings of South Africa.¶Storebrand said it hopes the much larger Norwegian Sovereign Wealth fund, which holds $1 trillion generated from the country's sale of oil, will follow its divestment decision.",0
Toxic algae becoming severe threat nationwide,"

    ","¶MONROE, Mich. -- Competing in a bass fishing tournament two years ago, Todd Steele cast his rod from his 21-foot motorboat - unaware that he was being poisoned. ¶A thick, green scum coated western Lake Erie. And Steele, a semipro angler, was sickened by it. ¶Driving home to Port Huron, Michigan, he felt lightheaded, nauseous. By the next morning he was too dizzy to stand, his overheated body covered with painful hives. Hospital tests blamed toxic algae, a rising threat to U.S. waters. ¶More in Climate Change¶""It attacked my immune system and shut down my body's ability to sweat,"" Steele said. ""If I wasn't a healthy 51-year-old and had some type of medical condition, it could have killed me."" ¶He recovered, but Lake Erie hasn't. Nor have other waterways choked with algae that's sickening people, killing animals and hammering the economy. The scourge is escalating from occasional nuisance to severe, widespread hazard, overwhelming government efforts to curb a leading cause: fertilizer runoff from farms. ¶Pungent, sometimes toxic blobs are fouling waterways from the Great Lakes to Chesapeake Bay, from the Snake River in Idaho to New York's Finger Lakes and reservoirs in California's Central Valley. ¶Last year, Florida's governor declared a state of emergency and beaches were closed when algae blooms spread from Lake Okeechobee to nearby estuaries. More than 100 people fell ill after swimming in Utah's largest freshwater lake. Pets and livestock have died after drinking algae-laced water, including 32 cattle on an Oregon ranch in July. Oxygen-starved ""dead zones"" caused by algae decay have increased 30-fold since 1960, causing massive fish kills. This summer's zone in the Gulf of Mexico was the biggest on record. ¶Tourism and recreation have suffered. An international water skiing festival in Milwaukee was canceled in August; scores of swimming areas were closed nationwide. ¶Algae are essential to food chains, but these tiny plants and bacteria sometimes multiply out of control. Within the past decade, outbreaks have been reported in every state, a trend likely to accelerate as climate change boosts water temperatures. ¶""It's a big, pervasive threat that we as a society are not doing nearly enough to solve,"" said Don Scavia, a University of Michigan environmental scientist. ""If we increase the amount of toxic algae in our drinking water supply, it's going to put people's health at risk. Even if it's not toxic, people don't want to go near it. They don't want to fish in it or swim in it. That means loss of jobs and tax revenue."" ¶Many monster blooms are triggered by an overload of agricultural fertilizers in warm, calm waters, scientists say. Chemicals and manure intended to nourish crops are washing into lakes, streams and oceans, providing an endless buffet for algae. ¶Government agencies have spent billions of dollars and produced countless studies on the problem. But an Associated Press investigation found little to show for their efforts: ¶- Levels of algae-feeding nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus are climbing in many lakes and streams. ¶- A small minority of farms participate in federal programs that promote practices to reduce fertilizer runoff. When more farmers want to sign up, there often isn't enough money. ¶- Despite years of research and testing, it's debatable how well these measures work. ¶The AP's findings underscore what many experts consider a fatal flaw in government policy: Instead of ordering agriculture to stem the flood of nutrients, regulators seek voluntary cooperation, an approach not afforded other big polluters. ¶Farmers are asked to take steps such as planting ""cover crops"" to reduce off-season erosion, or installing more efficient irrigation systems — often with taxpayers helping foot the bill. ¶The U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service, part of the Department of Agriculture, says it has spent more than $29 billion on voluntary, incentive-based programs since 2009 to make some 500,000 operations more environmentally friendly. ¶Jimmy Bramblett, deputy chief for programs, told AP the efforts had produced ""tremendous"" results but acknowledged only about 6 percent of the nation's roughly 2 million farms are enrolled at any time. ¶In response to a Freedom of Information Act request, the agency provided data about its biggest spending initiative, the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), which contracts with farmers to use pollution-prevention measures and pays up to 75 percent of their costs. ¶An AP analysis shows the agency paid out more than $1.8 billion between 2009 and 2016 to share costs for 45 practices designed to cut nutrient and sediment runoff or otherwise improve water quality. ¶A total of $2.5 billion was pledged during the period. Of that, $51 million was targeted for Indiana, Michigan and Ohio farmers in the watershed flowing into western Lake Erie, where fisherman Steele was sickened. ¶Yet some of the lake's biggest algae blooms showed up during those seven years. The largest on record appeared in 2015, blanketing 300 square miles — the size of New York City. The previous year, an algae toxin described in military texts as being as lethal as a biological weapon forced a two-day tap water shutdown for more than 400,000 customers in Toledo. This summer, another bloom oozed across part of the lake and up a primary tributary, the Maumee River, to the city's downtown for the first time in memory. ¶The type of phosphorus fueling the algae outbreak has doubled in western Lake Erie tributaries since EQIP started in the mid-1990s, according to research scientist Laura Johnson of Ohio's Heidelberg University. Scientists estimate about 85 percent of the Maumee's phosphorus comes from croplands and livestock operations. ¶NRCS reports, meanwhile, claim that conservation measures have prevented huge volumes of nutrient and sediment losses from farm fields. ¶Although the federal government and most states refuse to make such anti-pollution methods mandatory, many experts say limiting runoff is the only way to rein in rampaging algae. A U.S.-Canadian panel seeking a 40 percent cut in Lake Erie phosphorus runoff wants to make controlling nutrients a condition for receiving federally subsidized crop insurance. ¶""We've had decades of approaching this issue largely through a voluntary framework,"" said Jon Devine, senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council. ""Clearly the existing system isn't working."" ¶Farmers, though, say they can accomplish more by experimenting and learning from each other than following government dictates. ¶""There's enough rules already,"" said John Weiser, a third-generation dairyman with 5,000 cows in Brown County, Wisconsin, where nutrient overload causes algae and dead zones in Lake Michigan's Green Bay. ""Farmers are stewards of the land. We want to fix the problem as much as anybody else does."" ¶The Environmental Protection Agency says indirect runoff from agriculture and other sources, such as urban lawns, is now the biggest source of U.S. water pollution. But a loophole in the Clean Water Act of 1972 prevents the government from regulating runoff as it does pollution from sewage plants and factories that release waste directly into waterways. They are required to get permits requiring treatment and limiting discharges, and violators can be fined or imprisoned. ¶Those rules don't apply to farm fertilizers that wash into streams and lakes when it rains. Congress has shown no inclination to change that. ¶Without economic consequences for allowing runoff, farmers have an incentive to use all the fertilizer needed to produce the highest yield, said Mark Clark, a University of Florida wetland ecologist. ""There's nothing that says, 'For every excessive pound I put on, I'll have to pay a fee.' There's no stick."" ¶Some states have rules, including fertilizer application standards intended to minimize runoff. Minnesota requires 50-foot vegetation buffers around public waterways. Farmers in Maryland must keep livestock from defecating in streams that feed the Chesapeake Bay, where agriculture causes about half the nutrient pollution of the nation's biggest estuary. ¶But states mostly avoid challenging the powerful agriculture industry. ¶Wisconsin issues water quality permits for big livestock farms, where 2,500 cows can generate as much waste as a city of 400,000 residents. But its Department of Natural Resources was sued by a dairy group this summer after strengthening manure regulations. ¶The state's former head of runoff management, Gordon Stevenson, is among those who doubt that the voluntary approach will be enough to make headway with the algae problem. ¶""Those best-management practices are a far cry from the treatment that a pulp and paper mill or a foundry or a cannery or a sewage plant has to do before they let the wastewater go,"" he said. ""It's like the Stone Age versus the Space Age."" ¶Do the anti-pollution measures subsidized by the government to the tune of billions of dollars actually work? ¶Agriculture Department studies of selected watersheds, based largely on farmer surveys and computer models, credit them with dramatic cutbacks in runoff. One found nitrogen flows from croplands in the Mississippi River watershed to the Gulf of Mexico would be 28 percent higher without those steps being taken. ¶Critics contend such reports are based mostly on speculation, rather than on actually testing the water flowing off fields. ¶Although there is not a nationwide evaluation, Bramblett said ""edge of field"" monitoring the government started funding in 2013 points to the success of the incentives program in certain regions. ¶Federal audits and scientific reports raise other problems: Decisions about which farms get funding are based too little on what's best for the environment; there aren't enough inspections to ensure the measures taken are done properly; farm privacy laws make it hard for regulators to verify results. ¶It's widely agreed that such pollution controls can make at least some difference. But experts say lots more participation is needed. ¶""The practices are completely overwhelmed,"" said Stephen Carpenter, a University of Wisconsin lake ecologist. ""Relying on them to solve the nation's algae bloom problem is like using Band-Aids on hemorrhages."" ¶The AP found that the incentives program pledged $394 million between 2009 and 2016 for irrigation systems intended to reduce runoff — more than on any other water protection effort. ¶In arid western Idaho, where phosphorus runoff is linked to algae blooms and fish kills in the lower Snake River, government funding is helping farmer Mike Goodson install equipment to convert to ""drip irrigation"" rather than flooding all of his 550 acres with water diverted from rivers and creeks. ¶But only 795 water protection contracts were signed by Idaho farmers between 2014 and 2016, accounting for just over 1 percent of the roughly 11.7 million farmland acres statewide. Even if many farmers are preventing runoff without government subsidies, as Bramblett contends, the numbers suggest there's a long way to go. ¶Goodson says forcing others to follow his example would backfire. ¶""Farmers have a bad taste for regulatory agencies,"" he said, gazing across the flat, wind-swept landscape. ""We pride ourselves on living off the land, and we try to preserve and conserve our resources."" ¶But allowing farmers to decide whether to participate can be costly to others. The city of Boise completed a $20 million project last year that will remove phosphorus flowing off irrigated farmland before it reaches the Snake River. ¶Brent Peterson spends long days in a mud-spattered pickup truck, promoting runoff prevention in eastern Wisconsin's Lower Fox River watershed, where dairy cows excrete millions of gallons of manure daily — much of it sprayed onto cornfields as fertilizer. ¶The river empties into algae-plagued Green Bay, which contains less than 2 percent of Lake Michigan's water but receives one-third of the entire lake's nutrient flow. Farmers in the watershed were pledged $10 million from 2009 to 2016 to help address the problem, the AP found. ¶Peterson, employed by two counties with many hundreds of farms, has lined up six ""demonstration farms"" to use EQIP-funded runoff prevention, especially cover crops. ¶""This is a big step for a lot of these guys,"" he said. ""It's out of their comfort zone."" ¶And for all the money devoted to EQIP, only 23 percent of eligible applications for grants were funded in 2015, according to the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition. ¶Funding of the incentives program has risen from just over $1 billion in 2009 to $1.45 billion last year. The Trump administration's 2018 budget proposes a slight cut. ¶""It sounds like a lot, but the amount of money we're spending is woefully inadequate,"" said Johnson of Heidelberg University. ¶While there's no comprehensive tally of algae outbreaks, many experts agree they're ""quickly becoming a global epidemic,"" said Anna Michalak, an ecologist at the Carnegie Institution for Science at Stanford University. ¶A rising number of water bodies across the U.S. have excessive levels of nutrients and blue-green algae, according to a 2016 report by the Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Geological Survey. The algae-generated toxin that sickened Steele in Lake Erie was found in one-third of the 1,161 lakes and reservoirs the agencies studied. ¶California last year reported toxic blooms in more than 40 lakes and waterways, the most in state history. New York created a team of specialists to confront the mounting problem in the Finger Lakes, a tourist magnet cherished for sparkling waters amid lush hillsides dotted with vineyards. Two cities reported algae toxins in their drinking water in 2016, a first in New York. ¶More than half the lakes were smeared with garish green blooms this summer. ¶""The headlines were basically saying, 'Don't go into the water, don't touch the water,'"" said Andy Zepp, executive director of the Finger Lakes Land Trust, who lives near Cayauga Lake in Ithaca. ""I have an 11-year-old daughter, and I'm wondering, do I want to take her out on the lake?"" ¶The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is developing a system for compiling data on algae-related illnesses. A 2009-10 study tallied at least 61 victims in three states, a total the authors acknowledged was likely understated. ¶Anecdotal reports abound — a young boy hospitalized after swimming in a lake near Alexandria, Minnesota; a woman sickened while jet-skiing on Grand Lake St. Marys in western Ohio. ¶Signs posted at boat launches in the Hells Canyon area along the Idaho-Oregon line are typical of those at many recreation areas nationwide: ""DANGER: DO NOT GO IN OR NEAR WATER"" if there's algae. ¶In Florida, artesian springs beloved by underwater divers are tainted by algae that causes a skin rash called ""swimmer's itch."" Elsewhere, domestic and wild animals are dying after ingesting algae-tainted water. ¶A year ago, shortly after a frolic in Idaho's Snake River, Briedi Gillespie's 11-year-old Chesapeake Bay retriever stopped breathing. Her respiratory muscles were paralyzed, her gums dark blue from lack of air. ¶Gillespie, a professor of veterinary medicine, and her veterinarian husband performed mouth-to-nose resuscitation and chest massage while racing their beloved Rose to a clinic. They spent eight hours pumping oxygen into her lungs and steroids into her veins. She pulled through. ¶The next day, Gillespie spotted Rose's paw prints in a purplish, slimy patch on the riverbank and took samples from nearby water. They were laced with algae toxins. ¶""It was pretty horrendous,"" Gillespie said. ""This is my baby girl. How thankful I am that we could recognize what was going on and had the facilities we did, or she'd be gone.""",0

    ","¶The world, it seems, is forging ahead with ways to slow climate change, leaving President Trump and the U.S. even more isolated on the issue. ¶Earlier this month, Syria finally said it planned to join the Paris climate accord, making the U.S. the only United Nations member unsupportive of the agreement reached last year. ¶And earlier this week, the Trump administration pushed coal at the start of a week of international meetings held in Bonn, Germany, to further goals aspired to in the Paris accord -- a move that former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg likened it to ""promoting tobacco at a cancer summit.""¶More in Climate Change¶On Thursday, 20 countries, two U.S. states and five Canadian provinces pushed back. They joined an international alliance vowing to phase out coal from power generation completely by 2030 as part of the talks in Bonn. ¶Signatories include Oregon and Washington in the United States as well as Alberta, Canada; Angola; Austria; Belgium; British Columbia, Canada; Costa Rica; Denmark; Finland; Fiji; France; Italy; Luxembourg; Marshall Islands; Mexico; Netherlands; New Zealand; Niue; Ontario, Canada; Portugal; Quebec, Canada; Switzerland; United Kingdom; and Vancouver, Canada.¶But wait: the world's biggest users of coal -- China, India, the United States, Russia and notably Germany -- didn't join the declaration Thursday. ¶Coal is a major contributor to carbon emissions when it comes to fossil fuels. China is forecast to have the biggest surge in carbon emissions this year, with the U.S. projected to be second as global carbon emissions are expected to reach a record high. The spike follows three years in which human-generated emissions ""appeared to be leveling off,"" according to Inside Climate News.¶And the Trump administration is moving ahead with plans to push more coal even as plants close. In October, the Environmental Protection Agency moved to roll back restrictions on coal-fired power plants, a key policy promise of Donald Trump's presidential campaign.¶U.S. coal production fell 18.8 percent in 2016, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. And while production initially rose earlier this year, it may be flattening  as wind and solar make up a larger part of the mix, Bloomberg recently reported.¶Constructing and operating a utility-size wind farm can cost as little as a lifetime of $30 a megawatt hour, a measure used for electricity consumption, and less if one take subsidies into account. Existing coal plants can cost $26 to $39 a megawatt hour, Bloomberg reported, citing a report from the investment bank Lazard.¶Even without the biggest producers of the fossil fuel, clean energy proponents cheered the coal goal.¶""By moving away from coal, the world will be well on its way to clean air, clean water and climate stability,"" the Sierra Club said in a statement. ""The governments who have joined this alliance just demonstrated how countries should be taking meaningful action on climate, and we applaud them for this critical step to move the world beyond coal.""",0

The authors write that ""fence-line communities"" are disproportionately affected by pollution emitted by nearby industrial facilities.¶""We've found that fence-line communities, including many African-Americans, are suffering especially serious health consequences as a result of these emissions,"" said the CATF's Lesley Fleischman, a co-author of the report.¶More in Climate Change¶The report found that more than 1 million African-Americans across the U.S. live within a half mile of natural gas facilities, with many communities facing a higher risk of cancer linked to emissions from the plants. The authors write that the oil and gas industry emits a total of 9 million tons of methane and other pollutants into the atmosphere every year, making the industry the largest emitter of methane gas in the country. ¶Methane contributes to climate change at a rate that's 87 times higher than carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas contributing to a changing climate.¶""The life-threatening burdens placed on communities of color near oil and gas facilities are the result of systemic oppression perpetuated by the traditional energy industry, which exposes communities to health, economic, and social hazards,"" the report says.¶Across the country, 91 counties are home to existing oil and gas facilities or ones that are in development. More than 6.7 million African-Americans, or 14 percent of the nationwide black population, reside in those counties. ¶Louisiana and Texas have the largest African-American populations living in areas with elevated risks of cancer from pollutants, with nearly 900,000 individuals living near oil and gas facilities. However, the report notes that communities in several other states are also at risk, since pollutants can drift for miles before forming dangerous smog.¶The authors said preserving regulations enacted by the Obama administration is key to protecting communities of color from pollution.¶""Defending the safeguards finalized during the Obama administration and pushing for additional protections against pollution from the oil and gas industry will help improve the health of many African American communities while addressing global climate change,"" the report says.

Activists occupy coal power plant near climate summit,"

    ","¶BONN -- World leaders arrived at global climate talks in Germany on Wednesday to give the negotiations a boost going into the final stretch, as campaigners took over a brown coal-fired power plant and called for a strong signal from rich countries on curbing greenhouse gas emissions. ¶Particular attention was focused on German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose country is co-hosting the talks together with Fiji, a small Pacific nation that faces dramatic consequences from unchecked climate change. ¶Green campaigners and developing nations called on Merkel to use the event on her home turf to announce that Germany will set a firm deadline for phasing out the use of coal by 2030. Germany generates about 40 percent of its electricity from coal, including the light brown variety called lignite that's considered to be among the most heavily polluting fossil fuels. ¶More in Climate Change¶Police and company officials said activists had occupied conveyor belts and other equipment at a lignite-fired power station in western Germany, causing some disruption to the plant. Police said several people in masks occupied the facility Wednesday at Weisweiler, west of Bonn. News agency dpa reported that operator RWE said it switched off two of the four power generating units for lack of coal. ¶In Bonn itself, Greenpeace said 14 of its activists protested on a coal ship on the Rhine river, laying out a banner reading ""Merkel's Dirty Secret: Coal"" as it passed the conference venue.¶The talks, now in their second week, are largely technical in nature. But the Trump administration's threat to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord -- and extreme weather events in many parts of the world -- have created pressure for other governments at the meeting to strongly affirm their support for the 2015 Paris accord.¶The timing is difficult for Merkel: after speaking at the climate talks in Bonn she flies back to Berlin for negotiations on forming a new government that would include both the environmental Green party and a pro-business party, the Free Democrats, which opposes a coal deadline. Energy companies warn that coal is needed to ensure a steady supply of energy for Europe's biggest economy. ¶Much of the limelight Wednesday is expected to fall on Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, which is co-hosting the U.N. talks in Bonn with Fiji. Environmental campaigners want Germany to show its commitment to curbing global warming by announcing a deadline for phasing out the use of coal, a major greenhouse gas.¶President Hilda Heine of the Marshall Islands, whose country risks being swallowed by the Pacific Ocean if global warming causes sea levels to keep rising, said a declaration that Germany will end its use of coal ""would be a signal of hope for my country and for every vulnerable country around the world.""¶Merkel will be joined by U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and French President Emmanuel Macron, who has come out strongly in favor of efforts to fight climate change since taking office earlier this year.¶Still, with U.S. President Donald Trump saying he wants to withdraw from the Paris treaty, scientists warn it will be difficult to achieve the central goal of keeping global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degree Fahrenheit) by the end of the century.¶A group of U.S. states, cities and businesses that back the Paris accord have become the go-to contacts for many negotiators in Bonn who remain eager to work with the United States.¶Washington's official delegation has been largely invisible at the talks, save for a U.S.-sponsored event promoting fossil fuels and nuclear energy late Monday that drew vocal protests from environmental campaigners.¶Last month CBS News corespondent Ben Tracy reported that as the Trump administration declares ""the war on coal"" over, China is doing the opposite. ¶On a farm in northern China, they are planting a new crop: Nearly 200,000 solar panels in the heart of coal country.¶In the south, China flipped the switch on the world's largest floating solar installation --  built on top of a lake created by an abandoned coal mine. Projects like these helped China double its solar capacity last year. It is now twice as big as the U.S. capacity.¶The talks have also seen dozens of announcements from businesses and governments that pledged to reduce emissions or to commit large sums of money to helping poor countries tackle the effects of climate change.¶The meeting, which is scheduled to end Friday, is aimed at producing draft rules for implementing the Paris accord. The rules would need to be finalized by the time of next year's global climate talks in Poland.",0

    ","¶BONN, Germany -- Protesters drowned out speeches by White House advisers and business representatives Monday at an event the U.S. government sponsored at the U.N. climate talks in Germany promoting the use of fossil fuels and nuclear energy. ¶About 200 protesters stood up 10 minutes into the event and began singing an anti-coal song to the tune of ""God Bless the U.S.A."" They were ushered out of the room without further incident. ¶The event late Monday was the only one the U.S. delegation organized at the ongoing climate talks in Bonn. The American delegates are being closely watched by diplomats from the other 194 nations at the conference because of President Donald Trump's announcement that he wants to quit the 2015 Paris climate accord. ¶More in Climate Change¶Before the panel, which featured U.S. government advisers and energy industry representatives, the governors of Oregon and Washington, Kate Brown and Jay Inslee, said Mr. Trump's rejection of climate change was ""a dead end."" ¶""What you're going to hear today is essentially Donald Trump trying to sell 8-track tapes in a Spotify streaming world,"" Inslee, whose state is part of a coalition backing the Paris accord, told reporters. ""That is not going to cut it."" ¶David Banks, a White House adviser who was part of the U.S. panel, said ruling out the use of fossil fuels and other non-renewable sources of energy was only controversial ""if we choose to bury our heads in the sand and ignore the reality of the global energy system."" ¶After the singing protesters left, the panel faced largely hostile questions from the audience about the facts and figures presented to support the use of fossil fuels. ¶The event took place as a new report released Monday showed global carbon emissions will reach a record high in 2017, dashing hopes that levels of the heat-trapping gas might have plateaued following three consecutive years when they didn't go up at all. ¶The talks in Bonn, now in their second week, are intended to hammer out some of the nitty-gritty details for implementing the Paris accord. Participating countries agreed to keep global warming significantly below 2 degrees Celsius -- 3.6 Fahrenheit.¶                Key topics include how to measure individual countries' efforts, taking stock of what's been achieved so far and setting the new emissions reduction targets needed to reach the Paris goal. ¶Developing countries also are pushing for rich nations to pay for some of the devastating impacts climate change inevitably is going to have, particularly on poor communities around the world. ¶Poor nations see the issue of financial compensation, known in U.N. parlance as ""loss and damage,"" as a matter of fairness. They argue that rising sea levels and more extreme weather will hit them disproportionately hard even though they have contributed only a fraction of the carbon emissions blamed for global warming. ¶Rich countries counter that they are already paying billions of dollars to help developing nations reduce emissions -- such as by switching to renewable energy -- and to adapt to climate change. ¶""Without that support forthcoming from the developed countries, there's going to be some real fireworks at the end of this week,"" said Alden Meyer, strategy and policy director for the Union of Concerned Scientists, an advocacy group in Washington. ¶Formal decisions on most issues won't be taken until next year's meeting in Poland, but few want to leave progress until the last minute. Green group said it might fall to ministers to break a deadlock over issues such as compensation for countries hardest-hit by global warming. ¶While other developed countries reject the Trump administration's stance on the Paris agreement, their views on loss and damage are largely in step with Washington's. ¶""It's fair to say that other developed countries are hiding behind the U.S. on the loss and damage,"" Meyer said. ""They need to be called out on this."" ¶The other issue that's being hotly debated in Bonn is what emissions-cutting measures are necessary before 2020. While some countries already have taken reduction steps, activists say they fall far short of what's needed to ensure emissions peak in three years' time -- after which it would become much harder to achieve the most ambitious goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 F.

    ","¶WASHINGTON -- Global carbon pollution rose this year after three straight years when levels of the heat-trapping gas didn't go up at all, scientists reported Monday.¶Preliminary figures project that worldwide carbon dioxide emissions are up about 2 percent this year, according to an international team of scientists. Most of the increase came from China. ¶The report by the Global Carbon Project team dashed hopes that emissions from the burning of coal, oil and gas had peaked. ¶More in Climate Change¶""We hoped that we had turned the corner... We haven't,"" said study co-author Rob Jackson, an Earth scientist at Stanford University. ¶Carbon dioxide emissions rose steadily and slowly starting in the late 1880s with the Industrial Revolution, then took off dramatically in the 1950s. In the last three years, levels had stabilized at about 40 billion tons of carbon dioxide. ¶Estimates for 2017 put it at about 40.8 billion tons. Sixty years ago, the world spewed only 9.2 billion tons. ¶""It's a bit staggering,"" said co-author Ralph Keeling, a Scripps Institution of Oceanography scientist, noting in an email that levels have increased fourfold since he was born in the 1950s. ""We race headlong into the unknown."" ¶Man-made carbon dioxide is causing more than 90 percent of global warming since 1950, U.S. scientists reported this month. ¶This year's increase was mostly spurred by a 3.5 percent jump in Chinese carbon pollution, said study co-author Glen Peters, a Norwegian scientist. Declines in the U.S. (0.4 percent) and Europe (0.2 percent) were smaller than previous years. India, the No. 3 carbon polluting nation, went up 2 percent. ¶The 2017 estimate comes to an average of 2.57 million pounds of carbon dioxide spewing into the air every second. ¶The study was published Monday and is being presented in Bonn, Germany, during climate talks where leaders are trying to come up with rules for the 2015 Paris deal. The goal is to limit temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius since preindustrial times, but it's already warmed half that amount. ¶""It was tough enough and if this paper is indicative of long-term trends, it just got tougher,"" said Princeton University climate scientist Michael Oppenheimer, who wasn't part of the team of 76 scientists who wrote the report. ¶While he called the study authoritative, Pennsylvania State University climate scientist Michael Mann said he sees no need to do figures for 2017 that are not complete, saying it may be ""jumping the gun a bit."" ¶Jackson said the team — which produces these reports every year in November — has confidence in its 2017 report because it is based on real data from top polluting nations through the summer and in some cases through October. Plus, he said past estimates have been correct within a couple tenths of a percentage point. ¶The top five carbon polluting countries are China, the United States, India, Russia and Japan.

The BBC belongs to an international consortium of journalists that received the documents from a German newspaper for analysis and reporting.¶Tuesday's news about Charles was met with criticism by a former adviser on ethical standards for British public officials.¶More in Climate Change¶""There's a conflict of interest between his own investments of the Duchy of Cornwall and what he's trying to achieve publicly,"" Sir Alistair Graham, a former chairman of a panel that advises the British prime minister, told the BBC. ""And I think it's unfortunate that somebody of his importance, of his influence, becomes involved in such a serious conflict.""¶Charles' estate responded that the prince isn't directly involved in its investments, and Clarence House, the prince's residence, said Charles had ""certainly never chosen to speak out on a topic simply because of a company that it may have invested in.""¶The BBC reported that the estate, valued at around $1.2 billion (896 million British pounds), gained $211,500 by investing in Sustainable Forestry Management, which dealt in carbon credits.¶The credits, which were created to help combat climate change, mostly didn't apply to rainforests under two key agreements, the Kyoto Protocol and the European Union's Emissions Trading Scheme, according to the BBC. Sustainable Forestry Management wanted to change that.¶Around four months after Charles' estate bought 50 shares in the company worth $113,500, it provided the prince's office with lobbying material on the changes it wanted, the BBC reported. Charles then advocated for the changes in public speeches and reportedly in meetings with then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown and EU officials.¶Ultimately the changes weren't adopted.

    ","¶A new Trump administration report on climate change paints an apocalyptic portrait of global climate trends, saying the last three years have been the ""warmest years on record for the globe"" and that humans are almost certainly causing the climate to change.¶The massive, 477-page National Climate Assessment says that it is  ""extremely likely"" that global warming has been caused by humans -- with 95 to 100 percent certainty -- mostly from carbon dioxide through the burning of coal, oil and natural gas.¶""It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century,"" the report says. ""Over the last century, there are no convincing alternative explanations supported by the extent of the observational evidence.""¶Thirteen federal agencies were involved in producing the report, which is mandated by law. The Trump administration did not seek to block its release, but the conclusion directly contradicts statements made by senior members of his cabinet.¶More in Climate Change¶Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt have both said carbon dioxide (CO2) isn't the primary contributor to global warming.¶The White House issued a statement shortly after the report was made public. It said the administration ""supports rigorous scientific analysis and debate and encourages public comment on the draft documents being released today."" ¶Since 1900, the report says Earth has warmed by 1.8 degrees and seas have risen by 8 inches. Heat waves, downpours and wildfires have become more extreme and more frequent. Glaciers are receding and Arctic sea ice has sharply declined. ""Arctic sea ice loss is expected to continue,"" the report says, ""very likely resulting in nearly sea ice-free late summers by the 2040s.""¶The new report calls the time period between 1901 and 2016 ""the warmest in the history of modern civilization,"" and warns that record-breaking climate extremes are likely to continue.¶""The last few years have also seen record-breaking, climate-related weather extremes, the three warmest years on record for the globe, and continued decline in arctic sea ice. These trends are expected to continue in the future over climate (multidecadal) timescale,"" it says.¶On an ominous note, the report notes that ""humanity's effect on the Earth system ... is unprecedented,"" and warns that the faster the Earth is ""pushed towards warming,"" the greater the risk of ""unanticipated surprises."" ¶The report identifies two broad types of risks that accompany a changing climate. So-called ""compound events"" occur when two or more extreme weather events happen simultaneously. ""Threshold"" or ""tipping point"" events occur when a significant milestone is reached in the climate system as a whole. The frequency of both types will continue to increase.¶""A lot of what we've been learning over the last four years suggests the possibility that things may have been more serious than we think,"" said Robert Kopp of Rutgers University, one of dozens of scientists inside and outside the government who wrote the reports.¶While more than 190 other countries around the world have committed to lower emissions goals as part of the Paris climate agreement, the Trump administration pulled out of the accord last May. The EPA is also rolling back provisions of the Clean Power Plan and easing limits on emissions from coal-fired power plants.¶The White House responded with a statement saying: ""The climate has changed and is always changing. As the Climate Science Special Report states, the magnitude of future climate change depends significantly on 'remaining uncertainty in the sensitivity of Earth's climate to [greenhouse gas] emissions.' In the United States, energy related carbon dioxide emissions have been declining, are expected to remain flat through 2040, and will also continue to decline as a share of world emissions.""",0

Scientists say greenhouse gases are fueling climate change, and the impact is already being felt around the globe.¶""We are actually moving in the wrong direction,"" Taalas said.¶More in Climate Change¶The latest WMO Greenhouse Gas Bulletin, released Monday, said a strong El Niño event and human activity contributed to the increase of CO2 concentrations to 403.3 parts per million last year, up from 400 in 2015.¶The report notes that temperatures in strong El Niño years are typically warmer than average ""and 2016's temperatures are consistent with that pattern."" BBC News reports El Niño also impacts the amount of carbon in the atmosphere by causing droughts that cut the ability of plants and trees to absorb CO2.¶Because of air bubbles preserved in ice in places like Greenland and Antarctica, researchers have reliable measurements of CO2 concentrations going back 800,000 years. Using those measurements, the bulletin said that the last time CO2 concentrations were at similar levels was three to five million years ago, when the sea level was 66 feet higher than today.¶WMO says the report breaks ground by showing the ""global picture"" on carbon levels.

The critics included leading scientists from Los Alamos National Laboratory, science teachers associations, faith leaders, as well as teachers and administrators from several New Mexico school districts.¶Ruszkowski said he hoped to channel the passions from that hearing into efforts to help children live up to expectations in the new teaching guidelines.¶""We as New Mexicans, as a community, are going to have to be equally fired up about how are kids are doing in terms of mastering the standards,"" he said.¶The final state standards will carry a distinctly New Mexican title — the New Mexico STEM-Ready Science Standards — while automatically incorporating future updates and amendments to the widely used Next Generation Science Standards.¶One new component of the standards asks students to ""obtain and communicate information about the role of New Mexico in nuclear science and 21st century scientific innovations, including how the national laboratories have contributed to theoretical, experimental and applied science."" Another asks students to describe the advantages and disadvantages of technologies associated with the state's energy production.¶The new standards are scheduled to take effect in July 2018.

    ","¶It is by now a familiar story: The storm hits, the cities flood, dramatic rescues ensue to save people from the rising waters, followed by the arduous and expensive cleanup.¶But chances are you've thought less about the deadly and economically destructive consequences of a slower-moving culprit: drought.¶Repeated droughts around the world are destroying enough farm produce to feed 81 million people for a year and are four times more costly for economies than floods, the World Bank found in a new study. Beyond hindering food production, erratic rainfall patterns and longer droughts as the climate changes are causing a host of problems for cities, including businesses. ¶More in Climate Change¶""We are already seeing more extreme rainfall events -- more dry episodes and more wet episodes,"" said Richard Damania, the report's lead author and lead economist for the World Bank's water global practice, in an interview.¶For instance, what experts classify as an unusually severe drought is now appearing much more frequently worldwide. ""There are many, many parts of the globe where the one-in-50 year 'dry shock' appears in six out of the last 10 years for which we have data,"" he said. ""There are other parts of the world where these dry shocks have emerged for seven or eight of the last 10 years. This is not a problem for the future -- it's a problem for the here and now.""¶In cities, a single water outage can cut a company's revenue by more than 8 percent, the study, called ""Uncharted Waters: The New Economics of Water Scarcity and Variability,"" found. For smaller firms, like a single business operator selling their own wares or services, the cost is more than fourfold at 35 percent.¶One in four cities around the globe, amounting to combined economic activity of $4.2 trillion, is classified as water-stressed, according to the World Bank. And more than 80 percent of the world's gross domestic product, a common measure of the size of an economy, comes from cities.¶Meanwhile, water needs are rising. As urban populations swell, demand for water may rise as much as 70 percent, the report concludes. By 2050, nearly 1 billion people will live in cities with an inadequate water supply.¶The systems in those cities can be inefficient. In the developed world, urban areas tend to charge far less than cost for water that flows freely into your tap, the World Bank notes. When you pay for water, you pay for the infrastructure to deliver it, not the water itself.¶That's the case in the U.S., where a recent report from the American Civil Society of Engineers gave drinking water infrastructure a grade of D. It noted that many of the 1 million miles of pipes across the U.S. were laid in the mid-20th century and are coming to the end of their 75-to-100 year useful life.  ¶While water quality is still high in the U.S., the country wastes an estimated 2 trillion gallons of treated drinking water through 240,000 water main breaks a year, that report said.¶The American Water Works Association estimates $1 trillion is needed to maintain and expand service to meet U.S. demands alone in the next 25 years. That can mean higher costs for consumers, but better access to water in the long run.¶For example, a Seattle Times analysis of that city's water rates in 2015 found that people in some of California's drought-stricken cities paid less for water than Seattle, where heavy rainfall makes it plentiful. That's because Seattle has poured more money into infrastructure to keep water safe from contaminants and more renewable. And some Seattle taxes are included in the water rate, which isn't the case in other places.¶That inefficiency can hit small business owners hardest in cities. Take a local restaurant owner. A water shortage or closure because of broken pipes can stifle business and even cause power outages. That can quickly force a small business to close.¶Another consequence: Dwindling supply makes it more likely that water becomes stagnant or contaminated. People may wash their hands less if they are conserving, leading to disease. And children may fail to grow normally, stunting development and raising health costs, Damania said.¶On farms, the consequences are also grim for the food supply and the planet, the study found. Below-average rainfall over years hurts crop yields and pushes farmers into forests, cutting down a natural ""climate stabilizer."" That leads to more drought, exacerbating the problem.¶Other research predicts food shortages and price increases may triple by 2040 because of extreme and erratic weather brought on by climate change.¶Among other potential remedies, the World Bank recommends new water storage and management infrastructure and better policies to go with them; improved water utility regulation that rewards more efficient performance; and better safety nets for poor families.",0

That tally does not include the massive toll from this year's wildfires and three major hurricanes, expected to be among the most costly in the nation's history.¶The report predicts these costs will only grow in the future, potentially reaching a budget busting $35 billion a year by 2050. The report says the federal government doesn't effectively plan for these recurring costs, classifying the financial exposure from climate-related costs as ""high risk.""¶More in Climate Change¶""The federal government has not undertaken strategic government-wide planning to manage climate risks by using information on the potential economic effects of climate change to identify significant risks and craft appropriate federal responses,"" the study said. ""By using such information, the federal government could take the initial step in establishing government-wide priorities to manage such risks.""¶GAO undertook the study following a request from Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.¶""This nonpartisan GAO report Senator Cantwell and I requested contains astonishing numbers about the consequences of climate change for our economy and for the federal budget in particular,"" said Collins. ""In Maine, our economy is inextricably linked to the environment. We are experiencing a real change in the sea life, which has serious implications for the livelihoods of many people across our state, including those who work in our iconic lobster industry.""¶The report's authors reviewed 30 government and academic studies examining the national and regional impacts of climate change. They also interviewed 28 experts familiar with the strengths and limitations of the studies, which rely on future projections of climate impacts to estimate likely costs.¶The report says the fiscal impacts of climate change are likely to vary widely by region. The Southeast is at increased risk because of coastal property that could be swamped by storm surge and sea level rise. The Northeast is also under threat from storm surge and sea level rise, though not as much as the Southeast.¶The Midwest and Great Plains are susceptible to decreased crop yields, the report said. The West is expected to see increased drought, wildfires and deadly heatwaves.¶Advance copies were provided to the White House and the Environmental Protection Agency, which provided no official comments for inclusion in the GAO report.¶Requests for comment from The Associated Press also received no response on Monday.¶President Donald Trump has called climate change a hoax, announcing his intent to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accords and revoke Obama-era initiatives to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Trump has also appointed officials such as EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, all of whom question the scientific consensus that carbon released into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels is the primary driver of global warming.¶Earlier this month Trump nominated Kathleen Hartnett White of Texas to serve as his top environmental adviser at the White House. She has credited the fossil fuel industry with ""vastly improved living conditions across the world"" and likened the work of mainstream climate scientists to ""the dogmatic claims of ideologues and clerics.""¶White, who works at a conservative think tank that has received funding from fossil-fuel companies, holds academic degrees in East Asian studies and comparative literature.",0

    ","¶NEW YORK -- Within the next three decades, floods that used to strike the New York City area only once every 500 years could occur every five years, according to a new scientific study released just days before the fifth anniversary of Superstorm Sandy. ¶The study, performed by researchers at several universities and published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, primarily blames the predicted change on sea-level rise caused by global warming. ¶""This is kind of a warning,"" said Andra Garner, a Rutgers University scientist and study co-author. ""How are we going to protect our coastal infrastructure?"" ¶More in Superstorm Sandy¶The researchers based their analysis on multiple models that factored in predictions for sea level rise and possible changes in the path of future hurricanes. ¶Many of the models had a dose of good news for the nation's largest city: Climate changes may mean that storms are more violent, but are also likely to swing further off-shore, meaning storm surge heights aren't likely to increase substantially through 2300. ¶However, rising sea levels could mean that floods of 7.4 feet or more that struck the New York city area roughly once every 500 years before 1800, and which occur roughly every 25 years now, could happen once every five years between 2030 and 2045. ¶Researchers made no recommendations on what public officials or others should do to prepare. ¶""The idea is this kind of study we hope will provide information that people making those kinds of decisions can use,"" Garner said. ""We know that when Sandy hit in 2012, of course, subways, tunnels flooded, power was knocked out, parts of the city were just really devastated so studies like this provide some warning."" ¶Other researchers included scientists from Penn State University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Princeton University, Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, the University of Massachusetts Amherst and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. ¶The researchers said there is scientific consensus that global sea level will rise in the coming centuries, although it is not certain how high. They cautioned that sea-level rise at New York City could exceed 8 feet by the end of the century if, in a high-emissions future, the West Antarctic ice sheet rapidly melts. ¶The study expects about 5 inches to 11 inches of sea-level rise likely in New York City between 2000 and 2030. ¶The study examined sea level rise through the year 2300. ¶""I think the study is valid, but year 2300 is a long way off,"" said Billy Sweet, an oceanographer for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who was not involved in it. ""What is more certain is the amount of sea level rise likely to occur in the next 50 to 100 years or so and that storm surges from nor'easters and hurricanes will continue to pose a risk for New York City."" ¶Hurricane Sandy merged with two other weather systems into an unusual storm that devastated the oceanfront coastline and caused catastrophic flooding in New York and cities in New Jersey on Oct. 29, 2012. It was blamed for at least 182 deaths and $65 billion in damage in the U.S. ¶State and city officials in New York say they are planning numerous projects to guard against future flooding, including fortifying utilities and transit facilities, and note other projects are still in the design stage.

            Microplastics in Arctic Circle polluting ocean water with plastic waste from around the world - CBS News
    ",CBS News,"October 23, 2017, 8:30 AM","¶I first travelled to the Arctic Circle in 2013 after a biologist friend told me about a small village in Greenland under attack by polar bears. The iconic animals hunt seals on ice, which is now thinning because of climate change. With their frozen bridges gone, the bears turned to garbage cans, just like raccoons.¶The piece was one in what became a long list of ""hungry polar bear"" stories to circulate on TV and online. The polar bear is the poster animal for our changing planet -- and for good reason. They are beautiful, ¶Endangered, and great click-bait. But they're not perfect messengers, because even when they are frail and starving, they're still awe-inspiring.¶Earlier this year a global team of scientists sounded another alarm, revealing what they called the next major threat to the polar bears' Arctic habitat: plastic.¶After spending five years tracking currents and collecting and analysing water samples, they estimated there to be around 300 billion pieces of plastic from all over the world floating in this once pristine ecosystem.¶The story made headlines and gained traction on social media, but soon the unpredictable tides of news carried it back out to sea. A simple Google search a few months later turned up not a single television news report from the Arctic. ¶In an apparent attempt to get a few clicks, one article on the topic featured a fake photo of what appeared to be a passed out polar bear holding a plastic bottle of Coca Cola. To be fair, the photo was real, but the polar bear was in a zoo thousands of miles away from its allegedly plastic-plagued Arctic home.  ¶So were the findings of this plastic research a myth? I mean if there were 300 billion pieces of plastic floating in the Arctic, where was the proof? ¶In late July my producer Leigh Kiniry and I asked our bosses to send us on a myth-busting expedition. The greenlight came quickly, and we grabbed photojournalist Abdi Cadani and set off for Norway's Arctic Circle. ¶It took three flights and a bumpy boat ride to get to our final destination, but once there, it only took a few minutes to find the plastic. Plastic's omnipresence in this remote region is a product of both our warming planet, and our unsustainable appetite for the material.  ¶Plastic Patrol¶Norway's Lofoten islands are a dreamscape of jagged mountains and glassy water. It's so beautiful, Disney used the polar paradise as its muse when creating their blockbuster animation ""Frozen."" During the summer months, when some islands are thawed out, an unusual mission kicks into gear. ¶I first read about June Gronseth's ""plastic patrol"" online. She leads a group of volunteers who comb through the Nordic tundra, searching for garbage. Some of the photos she's posted to her website are unbelievable. ¶""There's so much beauty here, but if you look closely enough, you'll see the beast,"" she told me as our boat pulled up to a rocky coast. ¶""How many people live on the island,"" I asked.¶""Here? Actually none. We're on our own,"" she said with a warm smile. ¶We may have been on our own, but everywhere we looked there were unwanted signs of life. Within minutes we had huge, industrial-sized garbage bag full of plastic junk. Everything from a Coca-Cola carrier with the words ""Made in Venezuela"" on it, to plastic rope and even a motorcycle helmet. Some of the plastic had been in the water so long you couldn't even make out what it was. ¶""The worst is plastic bottles. Water bottles. We see them everywhere,"" Gronseth told me as she fished out a plastic bag wedged between two rocks. ¶Gronseth began cleaning-up the arctic in 2012, after she found two birds caught in some plastic line.¶""Trapped and dead in one piece of plastic on the beach,"" she said. ""My eyes were wide open and I thought, 'we have to stop polluting our seas.'"" ¶That discovery unlocked a dirty secret -- the Arctic Circle has become the world's dumping ground. In only a few years, Gronseth's team grew from a ragtag bunch of fishermen and local activists to a network of over 1,000 volunteers spread out over hundreds of miles. Last year alone they collected more than 40 tons of plastic. ¶The only way to remove it all from the remote islands was by airlifting it out with a helicopter.¶The Global Conveyor Belt¶Science has traced this trash back to its source. In April, two global research programs unveiled the results of their five-year study in the journal, Science Advances. They discovered a global conveyor belt of ocean currents like the Gulf Stream carry plastic all the way from the Americas and Europe to the Arctic. ¶""There is a continuous transport of floating waste from the North Atlantic,"" said Andres Cozar Cabanas, a Spanish biologist at the University of Cadiz and the leader of the study. ¶This waste enters the ecosystem a number of ways; small items like plastic toothpicks are often flushed down the toilet, beachgoers leave behind bottles and food packaging, and plastic that is thrown out can easily blow away from landfills and ending up in rivers or oceans. ¶Scientists say that, for the first time, melting ice has enabled this conveyor belt to dump plastic all the way up in the Arctic's northernmost regions, which were previously protected from the outside world.¶Climate change has also made it easier for research vessels to gain access, and to measure the full extent of the problem. Cabana's team spent five months dipping nets into Arctic water and studying the results. While large floating objects are a concern, Cabanas says the soupy mix they discovered just under the surface is a bigger threat.   ¶""The amount of floating plastic debris trapped in the surface waters is estimated to be on the order of hundreds of tons. It comprises around 300 billion pieces, mainly fragments around the size of a grain of rice,"" he explained. Those fragments are known as microplastics, broken down bits of bigger items like straws, Q-tips, plastic bags and water bottles. They're so small, marine animals often mistake them for food. ¶Faster than Bolt but Weighed Down by Plastic¶You need a microscope and a quick eye to see the animal inside Marine Biologist Ceri Lewis' petri dish in her laboratory at England's Exeter University. ¶""They can reach speeds a hundred times faster than Usain Bolt,"" Lewis told me with pride. At just about an eighth of an inch long, translucent and scaly, the Arctic Copepod is far from ""poster animal"" status, but as Lewis explains, this shrimp-like crustacean is one of the reasons polar bears and other cute arctic species are able to eat every day.  ¶""They are essential for the marine food chain. They produce really lovely fatty acids that then support the fish, which then support the seals, which then support the polar bears."" Copepods also support the same fisheries that supply supermarkets and restaurants.¶Lewis' research monitors the health of the Copepod population, which has already been under stress from warming water. The new concern is microplastics, which Lewis told us the Copepods are starting to eat. ¶""When that happens, the animal's stomach tells it its full so it stops eating. That could kill it or stunt its growth due to a lack of nutrients which could have drastic effects on the health of the marine ecosystem,"" she said.¶Lewis has already found several specimens of Copepods with plastic in their gut but said it's too early to tell how widespread the problem is.¶Plastic has already invaded other parts of the food chain in our world's oceans. Roughly a quarter of fish sampled from markets in California and Indonesia had plastic in their guts, according to a study by the University of California, Davis.¶Seabirds are also devouring the trash. The United Nations Environment Programme estimates that 99 percent of all seabirds will have ingested plastic by mid-century ¶Plasdiction ¶The world is addicted to plastic. Consider this: in 1950 our planet consumed about 1.5 million tons of plastic. That number jumped to over 300 million tons by 2016. The United Nations says at this rate there will be more plastic than fish in the ocean by 2050. Scientists say there are simple measures people can take now to make a lasting impact. The biggest threat is single-use items like plastic bags and bottles.¶According to watchdog group ""Ban The Bottle,"" the average American uses about 129 plastic water bottles a year that are tossed in the garbage. If you do the math, that means Americans throw out over 40 billion water bottles annually.¶Our dependency on plastic bags is even worse. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, Americans use over 380 billion plastic bags and wraps each year. Most of them wind up in landfills or are carried out to sea. Every year about 8 million tons of plastic is believed to escape into the oceans. ¶Back in Lofoten, June Gronseth picked up yet another plastic bag. She hates seeing them blanket the beach like Saran wrap but says she's happy she got to it first, before an animal did.  ¶""I do hope that all people in the world get their eyes open and stop polluting the ocean, we have to stop now,"" she said.¶Gronseth is hopeful, but knows kicking an addiction is difficult, which is why she'll be out here next season patrolling the Arctic, Earth's last paradise, now a new frontier for pollution.  ¶Filed by CBS News foreign correspondent Jonathan Vigliotti.",0
"Off the African coast, a new tool in the fight against climate change: drones","
                  Jacqueline Alemany
              ","
October 20, 2017 / 6:00 AM
      / CBS News
    ","¶The reporting of this story was made possible by a fellowship from the International Women's Media Foundation Great Lakes Fellowship (IWMF).¶Nine thousand miles away from Trump Tower and Hillary Clinton's email server, Aboud Jumbe watched the 2016 presidential election closely. As policy director for Zanzibar's Ministry of Lands, Water, Energy and Environment, Jumbe's day-to-day concerns include rising and warming waters, an existential threat to this island nation, given its precarious geographic location and below sea-level terrain. ¶Jumbe had breathed easy under President Barack Obama. The United States had finally established itself as a leader in the fight against climate change. But as he watched Donald Trump's rise with a sense of dread, glued to the television set much like the rest of the world, that relief was quickly upended. Once becoming president, Mr. Trump staffed his administration with climate change skeptics and quickly pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement.¶More in Climate Change¶""For the first time, I could see the U.S. railing against the world and to me, it was a really sad, sad affair,"" Jumbe recalled last month, sitting in his dimly lit wood-paneled office on the outskirts of Stone Town, the main port city of Zanzibar, a semi-autonomous series of islands off the coast of Tanzania in east Africa.¶Frustrations on the island run deeper than with Mr. Trump's sudden repudiation of the Paris accord. Government officials and residents alike bristle at the fact the developed world is responsible for climate change, while developing nations bear the brunt of the effects. The threat of climate change and rising sea levels are very real to small, developing islands, which often lack the resources and capacity to adapt. ¶Small governments that rely on international financing to climate-proof their countries are turning to more creative solutions. In Zanzibar, they're turning to drones.¶The Zanzibar Mapping Initiative is the world's most ambitious mapping project deploying small-scale drones. The project was born out of a partnership with the World Bank and the Zanzibar Commission for Lands and the State University of Zanzibar, modeled after a drone mapping and digitization project called Dar Ramani Huria, a Swahili phrase that translates to ""The Open Map of Dar es Salaam."" ¶In August 2016, armed with $20,000-lightweight yellow and black senseFly eBee drones, a team of 17 geospatial technology students from the State University set out to fly drones over every single village on Unguja, Zanzibar's larger island. ¶The group of millennials spent nearly a year scattered across the 53-mile long stretch of soil and sand, programming drone flights to capture aerial images and topography of every square inch of land. Hundreds of these images are now being pieced together to create a high-resolution base map of Zanzibar. And the geospatial data collected by the drone during flight will be published online and available to the public by November, with the hope of revolutionizing the policy-making capabilities of the Zanzibari government. ¶Mapping and land management remains a frustrating and expensive problem across the African continent. A mere 2.9 percent of Africa is mapped at a local scale, compared to 87 percent of Europe, according to a 2007 report from the United Nations. As the population swells -- Tanzania's national average population growth rate is one of the fastest in the world -- a lack of up-to-date maps makes for messy land disputes and hamfisted attempts at urban planning. ¶After the Zanzibar Revolution in 1964,  a new semi-autonomous democratic government nationalized the economy and redistributed land to the landless for free. The government handed out leases lasting up to 99 years, sometimes with a verbal agreement and often without proper planning. Houses started popping up in the middle of roadways, and entire villages materialized in flood zones.¶As the lush urban-island of 1.3 million people confronts the creeping threat of climate change and an uptick in natural disasters, high resolution aerial photography and a modern spatial data infrastructure can not only facilitate urban planning but assist government officials in climate-proofing the island. Consumer-facing maps like those developed by Google and Apple lack the kind of granular resolution and detailed data that local officials need. Small-budget governments like Zanzibar have for years reverted to old-school mapping techniques, surveying land by hand with a measuring tape. ¶Disaster risk management is an urgent task in Zanzibar, where much of the economy depends on the tropical climate and marine and terrestrial ecosystems.  Fisheries, seaweed farming and tourism make up at least 30 percent of Zanzibar's GDP, and agriculture contributes to about a quarter of the economy. ¶""If you look at the tourism sector, if you look at the rain farm system and if you look at the fisheries, it is all a climate-dependent system,"" Jumbe, the policy director, said. ""So if you alter that – either naturally or unnaturally -- the people's systems collapse. And so for us, we have to monitor.""¶This means the government has a vital interest in monitoring changes in coastlines, vegetation growth, saltwater intrusion, coral bleaching and sea levels. ¶""It would be wonderful if the drone images could show us the extent of the degradation of seagrass or coral reef patches,"" Narriman Jiddawi, a senior lecturer at the Institute of Marine Sciences in Stone Town, said of her plans to utilize the drone maps. Seagrass, dense underwater meadows crucial to surrounding habitations in shallow ocean water, is one of many plant species on the decline around the Zanzibar coast due to ""changes in salinity and temperature, ocean acidification, storm activity and ultraviolet irradiance,"" according to 2012 report. ¶Sea surface temperatures over the past 20 years have trended upward on Unguja island, the largest island in the Zanzibar archipelago. Predictions from Climate Systems Analysis Group, a climate research group at the University of Cape Town, project a 2 degree celsius increase in temperature by 2050. Even modest changes to the temperatures of Zanzibar's shallow water could wreak havoc on the seaweed farming industry. Data show increases in wind speeds, wave heights and high ocean levels, all of which contribute to erosion of coastlines. ¶""When I see our mangroves suffocating under the rising sea level, when I see our reef habitats disappear, when I look around at my favorite beach spots in Zanzibar, that I used to remember with serenity, I look at them now and feel a desperate sense of despair,"" Jumbe said. ¶Fishermen who have seen their livelihoods swallowed up over the course of their lifetimes know firsthand the dangers of rising sea levels and warming ocean temperatures on Kilimani Bay, a barren stretch of white sand and calm ocean where the land has been seemingly carved out of the southwestern peninsula of the island with an ice cream scooper.  ¶Juma Khamisi, a weathered kofia cap-wearing fisherman who has worked from the same spot for decades, has been forced to venture further and further from shore, in deeper and colder waters, in search of his haul. The 53-year-old says that a dyke once protected a shallow freshwater swamp right off the shore, allowing his fellow fishermen to grow rice and vegetables. The dyke has been compromised in recent years by the encroaching sea. Crops grow no more.  ¶""You can see that there has been a lot of soil erosion,"" Khamisi said through a translator, standing barefoot in the sinking sand, his handcarved wooden boat parked a few feet away. ""Not sure why there is water encroaching the land but what I know is that water levels are increasing."" ¶Half of Zanzibar lives below the poverty line, making the crop-killing effects of climate change that much more devastating. For fishermen like Khamisi, who farm in their backyards and live on roughly $1 dollar a day, it's the difference between feeding a family or going hungry. ¶Traveling around the island, nearly everyone had at least a tangential connection to the Zanzibar Mapping Initiative. But Mohammed Juma, the director of urban and rural planning, takes credit for spearheading the project. ¶His office in Stone Town is littered with vintage maps and coffee-table art books. Wearing tight-fitting maroon pants and a houndstooth jacket, Juma does not look the part of a typical Zanzibari government official.Juma said he began to pay attention to drone work three years ago, when he attended a workshop in Dar es Salaam about an open data initiative in Tanzania funded by the World Bank. ¶""I was fascinated, because one of the issues we are suffering from here is lack of information — especially for me,"" he said. ""I plan. So if I want to go and plan somewhere, I don't have the information.""¶The map of the archipelago used by the government of Zanzibar has not been updated since 2004. That map wasn't digitized for five years, meaning it was already out of date by the time it was finally released in 2009. ¶""It was near impossible,"" Juma said of his predecessors' ability to do their jobs. ¶After the workshop in Dar es Salaam, Juma pulled aside Edward Anderson, a senior disaster risk management specialist for the World Bank based out of Tanzania, who coordinated a previous mapping project. Anderson had been pestering the World Bank to start utilizing drones for various purposes for years. ¶""Until now, if the government really wanted help to update it's base map, you'd need aero-imagery, you'd hire a company,"" Anderson told me(check). ""It would cost $200,000 just to move the plane from Kenya to Zanzibar."" ¶""What the drones do is significantly reduce of cost and complexity,"" Anderson added. ¶Word of the drones spread quickly as they quietly soared over Zanzibar's settlements. In the village of Sebleni, a family said a torrential flood forced them to evacuate their home at 3 a.m. last spring, displacing them until the water finally evaporated in June. They hoped the data collected by the drones would help the government mitigate the devastation of natural disasters. ¶Zanzibar's unofficial landfill is an old quarry pit that's now a hazardous crude dump site surrounded by homes. Hamadi Juma, the head of Zanzibar's Urban Services Project, planned to use the drone imagery to establish the borders of the dump site, resettle the families living around the pit and transition it into Zanzibar's first and only official landfill. ¶""It is in an unsustainable position of being a world class tourist destination without having a sanitary landfill or sludge treatment facility,"" read a financing proposal Juma shared. ¶All over Zanzibar, high-resolution maps are expected to help planners accomplish tasks that come easy to city planners in the West. The images will allow planners to plot street lamps along village roads or initiate the collection of property taxes, which have not been collected on the island since 1964. They can help adjudicate land conflicts, and implement more sophisticated urban development for an island with a booming population. ¶Two members of the Zanzibar Mapping Initiative, Khadija Abdulla Ali and Mohammed Seif Kassim, her former classmate at the State University of Zanzibar, have mapped the school's campus several times over the past year. The imagery showed that informal housing surrounding the university in Tunguu, right outside of Stone Town, had nearly tripled in the previous 12 months.¶""We are 1.3 million on this tiny island, what if all of us have houses – what is the future of this island?"" Abdallah Hama Bakar, a disaster risk management specialist working on the project at the State University, told me. ""Our city will grow horizontally – so we have to do this planning. Otherwise after 20 years, our island will be little more than a settlement.""¶""In Zanzibar, the drone become famous,"" Kassim said in imperfect English as he waited for Ali to identify the best position to launch the drone. We had traveled to a fenced-off clearing of land in the middle of the village of Nungwi one afternoon in early August to take the winged robot for a test drive.¶Kassim pulled out a laptop computer, placed it on the hood of our SUV and began to program the flight path of the drone. With the tiny aircraft in hand, Ali stood still in the center of the pitch, and cocked her head to the sky to test the wind against her face. Soon prepared for launch, she broke into a quick sprint, her orange-bedazzled hijab billowing behind her. She released the drone into flight, cutting the figure of a modern Zanzibari superwoman – cape and all, flapping against the overcast horizon.¶The drone, buzzing overhead at an altitude of around 600 feet, would be able to capture aerial photos with such precision that you'd be able to witness the near-naked kite surfers gleefully skimming past the hijab-wearing seaweed farmers who labor on Nungwi's shallow crystalline shore. ¶Nungwi is a pricey tourist destination on the northernmost tip of the island, where rooms at hotels go for $400 a night and tourists can enjoy beachside couples massages. ¶But the lavish accommodations here are surrounded on all sides by impoverished villages that share a single spout of fresh water. At the turn onto a rutted dirt road into Nungwi, a large sign displays hand-drawn renderings of a man and a woman in skimpy swimsuits, with two big red crosses etched over their bodies. ""Please respect local & traditional culture,"" the sign reads, a timeworn request that is often ignored by vacationers. ¶Much like the lucrative tourism business in Nungwi, the drones buzzing overhead have also become a source of suspicion among locals. As two of the island's drone evangelists working to demystify the flying object and their mission, Kassim and Ali had collected a trove of war stories.¶""In some areas, they fear the drone,"" Ali said. ""They think it's a bomb when it crashes. Or they say, we don't want you to fly drone because you will know our secrets. So you can't."" ¶She recalled a particularly frightening day in the field when her drone crashed, and confused villagers rushed to collect the scattered pieces. They refused to hand over the machine over unless paid the money they demanded. Ali went back to the area the next day with government security guards to finish mapping the area. ¶But she treasured most of her experiences explaining the power and purpose of the drone to fellow Zanzibaris. It reinforced the new kind of professional autonomy the program and drone certification had granted her, freeing her from the seaweed farms. ¶""Most of the men feel like I'm a man, because I'm strong and smart and in our culture, most women are not,"" Ali said, fidgeting with her hands, still covered in henna from her wedding. She married at the end of July in a traditional Islamic wedding. ""In our culture, men have to give you permission to do things. But I choose someone who gives me permission to do everything. Someone who listens and makes you proud of what you do. Women automatically think we can't. But for me, everything is a possibility."" ¶The marginalization of women on Zanzibar -- which is culturally conservative but also embraces Western modernity -- is subtle at first glance. But Ali's gentle fearlessness and prominence around the island is a paradox in a place where a women's rights activist was quietly murdered with a machete. ¶""Khadija is one of those very few women in Zanzibar who are really up for a change – for an evolution, of the way people perceive things and I think we need to help her, support her,"" said Aboud Jumbe. ¶The drone project has enabled women like Ali and her female counterparts to challenge prevailing stereotypes of the role of women on the majority Muslim island, a small stride towards closing a gender gap in economic opportunity. Women account for almost three quarters of the agricultural workforce.  ¶""There are so many factors, including low level of education compared with men, and it is embedded with early marriage, school drop out, the mismatch of education they have with labor market needs -- those are the challenges that make the disparities,""said Mwanaidi M. Ali, the female director of the Zanzibar's Youth Development Department of high female unemployment numbers. ¶""Cultural barriers? No. I am here and I'm the director,"" she added. ¶The numbers tell a slightly different story: Women account for over half of the labor force in Tanzania but compared to men, women only constitute as 32 percent of the paid workforce in industries outside of agriculture, according to a study conducted by Tanzania's Commission for Science and Technology. In urban areas, female unemployment stands at 22.9 percent, compared to their male counterparts at 6 percent. And for young women specifically, the unemployment rate stands at 13.2 percent, according to the Zanzibar Employment Service. ¶The elevation of female drone pilots, who complained of the Mapping Initiative's spotty and third-rate payroll, hasn't necessarily translated to sustainable careers. ¶When Ali, Khairaat Ali Khamis and Asha Khamis Mussa joined the team, their participation was a part of their geo-spatial studies, coupled with a $4 stipend, barely enough money to cover travel allowances and buy bottled water to keep hydrated while working long hours under the blistering island sun. Eventually, after what the World Bank called an internship period, some participants were hired for higher wages. Ali, Khamis and Mussa all say that they were not paid consistently for their work. The three women say that Yves Barthelemy, a contractor for the World Bank who managed the team, oftentimes failed to pay them altogether. ¶""I don't know what the exact word but it was like – he wasn't doing what he was supposed to do sometimes. Because people work and you have to pay them – on time,"" Khamis said. ¶Mussa alleged that Yves Barthelemy, a contractor for the World Bank who managed the team, failed to pay her altogether. ¶Sitting in her older brother's government office at the Fisheries Department on a Saturday morning in August where she was programming his computer, Mussa spoke pridefully of her role as drone pilot, but was mindful of the disapproval from men in her community -- ""they give me different kind of name because of what I'm doing and because of how busy I am."" Wounded not by their comments, but by the missing compensation and too uncomfortable to speak up for herself -- ""you would not feel comfortable either,"" she told me -- Mussa eventually quit. ¶""It hurts me to remember that I was the only one who did not get paid for the last mission,"" she said. She could no longer spend her time doing a job for which she was not being paid.¶Barthelemy disputes Mussa's account and says that she was paid a total of 450 Tanzanian Shilling for a total of 45 days of work. If there was an error, it could be remediated, Barthelemy wrote in an email, but conceded that delays in paying the students were common. ¶""There were delays in paying Yves who was coordinating this and hence delays in paying the students such that indeed, there was a period when they were mapping unpaid, but this should have been reimbursed retroactively,"" Anderson wrote in an email.¶Shortly after being made aware of the payment issue with Mussa, the World Bank said it had been resolved. ¶""No doubt that the days were long, tiring and sometimes frustrating when drones crashed or did not work, then charging batteries at home, then starting early in the morning ... and that as a consequence some of the students thought 10.000 [Tanzanian Shilling] was not worth it,"" Barthelemy added in an email.¶""A lot of this was part of their classwork so the payment wasn't a commercial rate which is why we were able to get the costs down but a number of them were able to get commercial jobs,"" explained Frederick Mbuya, a consultant for the World Bank working with Tanzania's Commission for Science and Technology.  ¶""They are now operating jobs commercially and being paid commercial rates,"" he added. ¶While this was true for Ali, who completed a paid assignment to map a gold mine in Mwanza at the end of the summer, Khamis left the team to become a teacher and Mussa quit. ¶Many people on the island are concerned that the data from the mapping initiative won't be as widely accessible as the World Bank has promised, due to a mix of government incompetence and bureaucratic paralysis.¶""This government has a strongly Soviet bureaucracy -- a very Soviet past -- and is set up with a central command control structure,"" Anderson, the World Bank official, said in his office in Dar es Salaam. A 2015 law made it illegal for any publication or organization to call data ""official"" unless it has been approved by Tanzania's National Bureau of Statistics.¶""When we talk about drone mapping, it's being done by surveyors of the government, so it's a mandate -- we're not worried about the drone data being somehow illegal,"" Anderson said. ¶Anderson says that Zanzibar's agreement with the World Bank stipulates that 7 centimeter-per-pixel resolution of the national map will be made public, but that the Bank hasn't yet sold the notion that data is a public good to be repurposed by the entire government.  ¶""If we remove that platform and go back to working in silos, then we risk ending up in disappointment,"" Jumbe says of the open source push. ¶That's why people like Lorna Slade, the Executive Director of Mwambao Coastal Community Network, are hiring drone experts of their own. Slade, who works with local communities around Unguja to manage their fisheries and local natural resources, hired Yussuf Said Yussuf to map her non-profit's octopus recovery program. Yussuf managed the Zanzibar Mapping Initiative and now serves as Tanzania Flying Labs coordinator for We Robotics, a business incubator for drone services. ¶Octopus hunting is a booming market for Zanzibari fishermen,especially around the holiday of Ramadan. But a mature female octopus needs 30 days undisturbed in a coral reef to breed and hatch their eggs. So Slade's team identifies areas to close off from the fishing community for two to three months to facilitate breeding, a task completed more intelligently and efficiently with aerial imagery, as opposed to village opinion or diving expeditions. Slade hopes to eventually utilize underwater drones to monitor octopus nesting and aquaculture. ¶Unlike in the United States, where the drone market has been somewhat stymied by restrictive and onerous regulations, the creative use of drones to solve basic problems in developing countries like Tanzania, Rwanda, Malawi, and Uganda has flourished. ¶Frederick Mbuya is a World Bank consultant and a drone visionary who founded the ""drone as a service"" company Uhurulabs. He's one of the most prominent proponents of the drone revolution in Africa and has his hands in some of Tanzania's most transformative projects. ¶Nestled in his oasis of his home office in Dar es Salaam, surrounded by drone parts, computers, and vintage mini planes, the gesticular Mbuya rattles off the many ways he's using drones: aerial surveys for land mapping, analysis of agricultural data to improve farm management, oil and gas pipeline inspections, and medical supply delivery. ¶In 2018, the only drone delivery service in the world called Zipline, a California company which is already up and flying in Rwanda, Zipline, will be expanding into Tanzania. Distribution centers throughout the country will charter fleets of drones to deliver vital medical supplies to difficult to access areas to make up for the Tanzanian government's shortcomings. ¶Mbuya is currently working on literature to help other commercial drone companies navigate the process of registering and licensing drones for commercial work in Tanzania -- what he hopes to be an example for the rest of the region wrestling with regulating technology developing at a faster pace than the government can legislate. ¶""There is nothing more powerful than a young innovator in Africa building something themselves and it flying,"" Mbuya said. ¶""I think the Zanzibar project is a bold statement to the rest of the world and to the rest of Africa: look, we have the largest ever mapping project using small scale drones,"" Mbuya says. ""That is something that Zanzibaris should be extremely proud of and African countries should be inspired by. They don't have to lean on foreigners coming in to do the high tech work."" ",0
"Mapping the Great Barrier Reef with cameras, drones and NASA tech","

    ","¶This is part of CNET's series, ""Rebooting the Reef,"" on efforts to save one of the world's greatest natural wonders. ¶Richard Vevers, a British underwater photographer, was horrified when he returned in 2015 to a colorful reef in American Samoa he had shot a year earlier. It had turned pure white.¶Vevers, who runs a marine advocacy group called The Ocean Agency, knew bleaching, a process caused by global warming that starves coral, was the cause. He also knew the public didn't understand the ocean's sorry shape because it couldn't see what was going on. Cameras, he reckoned, could help.¶So The Ocean Agency partnered with Google to take the search giant's Street View concept underwater at Australia's Great Barrier Reef. It designed a military-grade scooter, with an underwater camera mounted on top worth AU$50,000 (about $39,000). The thousands of photographs it took were then processed by image-recognition software that group wrote for the project.¶More in Climate Change¶""As soon as we designed that [technology], the scientists all realized that this could revolutionize the study of coral reefs,"" Vevers says. ""You could suddenly look at coral reefs at a scale that was really unprecedented.""¶Vevers and The Ocean Agency aren't the only researchers mapping the Great Barrier Reef, which is dying as man-made climate change wreaks havoc on its beautiful but delicate ecosystem. Teams from Australia and around the world have projects to chart a complex, dynamic habitat that covers an area as big as Germany. Their work is crucial to efforts to save the reef, which saw 29 percent of its shallow-water coral die last year. After all, how can you save something if you can't see it?¶The teams are using a range of technology both new and old in their projects. In Archer Point, North Queensland, a team of indigenous rangers deploys drones to monitor the health of the reef and map the surrounding country. A team from the University of Sydney takes thousands of photographs of the reef one second apart with GoPro cameras, stitching them into giant high-res images. Off the reef's Whitsunday coast, marine biologist Johnny Gaskell used Google Maps to strike the location of a blue hole filled with healthy coral protected from the bleaching.¶The task is daunting. We think of the Great Barrier Reef as a single expanse of coral, but it's actually a network of 3,000 reefs that spans 2,300 kilometers (1,430 miles) along Australia's eastern coast. Roughly 9,000 species live on it and 2 million tourists visit every year to drink in its splendor.¶The sheer size of the reef makes mapping expeditions expensive, and, no surprise, funding is hard to come by. Large ships that use remote sensing in deep waters can cost about $32,000 a day. A big drilling ship used to recover parts of fossilized reefs, which shed light on past changes in climate, can cost up to about $9.5 million per expedition. The Royal Australian Navy and Maritime Safety Queensland, a state department, shoulder some of the costs, as does the International Ocean Discovery Program, an international consortium that's the largest marine geoscience program in the world.¶It's still not enough. One estimate reckons $1 billion a year for the next 10 years is needed to have a chance to save the reef.¶Robin Beaman and Jody Webster have a bold goal. The James Cook University researchers have created a computerized 3D model of the entire Great Barrier Reef. They're using multibeam sonar, a technique pioneered in the 1970s and refined over decades.¶The technique involves bouncing acoustic pulses off the seabed and measuring the time it takes for the echo to return. Since they know how fast the sound is moving, they can calculate how deep the water is. It reveals the shape of the reef's seafloor in startling detail.¶Beaman and Webster's project builds off an idea proposed in 2005 by their mentor, Bob Henderson. They've been working on it since 2005 and have mapped 100 percent of the reef.¶The two of them work with a German crew on their mapping cruises. When I spoke with Webster, he had just returned from a 23-day cruise on the RV Sonne, which has one of the world's best multibeam systems and a camera worth quarter of a million Australian dollars.¶""When you're doing a cruise like that, it's discovery,"" Webster said. ""You're mapping the seabed for the first time.""¶The Royal Australian Navy has protected the country's waters since before its formal establishment in 1911. For the past three decades, it's used a homegrown technology to map the ocean floor around the country, too.¶Known as Laser Airborne Depth Sounder (LADS), or airborne lidar, it took 20 years to develop and is now a fixture in marine mapping efforts around the world. The concept is similar to multibeam sonar, but uses light rather than sound.¶A LADS system shoots two beams of amplified light -- a green laser and a red one -- at the water below. The green laser pierces the water and reaches the ocean floor. The red one stops at the surface. Each is precisely measured. Subtract the red measurement from the green measurement and you have the depth.¶Each survey is run by a team of specialists: two officers, three senior sailors and three junior sailors. The pilots need the support so they can endure flights for up to seven hours at roughly a kilometre off the ground, which is unusually low by aviation standards.¶The Navy needs to know where the coral reefs are to protect them, as well as the boats that ply the waters above them. Chunks of the Great Barrier Reef, it turns out, are under busy shipping lanes. An Australian government study showed that 3,947 ship voyages called at reef ports in 2012. Port authorities and corporations expect that number to hit 5,871 in 2017, at a yearly growth rate of between 4 and 5 percent.¶Alex Cowdery flew LADS sorties for the Navy when the tech debuted in the 1990s and now works for a company that sells the service to other navies. He keeps charts from his early flights on his office walls to remind his clients this is a well-tested technology.¶Since 1993, the Navy has mapped roughly 240,000 square kilometres of the Great Barrier Reef, more than half of its 347,800-square-kilometre area, he says. The Navy flies an average of one sortie every other day to keep its charts updated. Mapping takes discipline.¶""It was exciting back then,"" Cowdery tells me of his early days flying LADS planes. ""And it's still exciting right now.""¶A NASA-run project called CORAL, the Coral Reef Airborne Laboratory, took to the air from September to October in 2016 to map what's underwater. Developed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, CORAL tests a next-generation hyperspectral instrument important to scientists for distinguishing healthy coral reef systems from unhealthy ones.¶The project uses PRISM, an acronym for the JPL's Portable Remote Imaging Spectrometer, to capture spectrum data that previously couldn't be collected. Spectrometers measure the wavelength of light, which provides insight into what something is made of. The PRISM system was mounted in the belly of an airplane that flew at low altitudes above the reef and pierced the water's surface to capture high-resolution spectrum data.¶The US space agency and Australia's CSIRO proposed the project five years ago but it stalled amid funding issues, a common hurdle for scientific research. Then in 2016, money was found and the project was back on. By September, a NASA team decked out in caps and T-shirts bearing the organisation's iconic logo had arrived in an Australian government facility in Brisbane.¶""It's pretty cool,"" Tim Malthus, who runs a CSIRO coastal studies group, says of working with the NASA team, which he describes as extremely well-organised.¶The PRISM system is a prototype that's much smaller than previous hyperspectral systems and that will eventually be deployed on satellites. The PRISM technology has an advantage over multibeam and lidar surveys, Malthus says, because it's uniform and doesn't require corrections.¶Beaman, the James Cook University researcher, brings multibeam and satellite technologies together in generating his 3D models of the reef. Those models are now being used in a range of projects aimed at saving the reef.¶The accuracy of 3D models helps researchers understand natural hazards and features of the seafloor. For example, E-reefs, a government modeling program, uses the 3D landscapes to model particles as they move through the reef to predict how pollution travels through the area. The model is also used to make decisions on where fishing can be allowed.¶""Unless you map it, you don't know what it is,"" Beaman says. ""That's really what it comes down to.""¶Vevers, the head of The Ocean Agency, says that's what the Google Street View project was all about. If people see the Great Barrier Reef and other reefs around the world, they'll be more emotionally involved in saving them.¶The Ocean Agency technology that was designed for the Street View project is now being used to document the state of reefs in 25 countries around the world. Vevers says the results will be made public so everyone can see what's at stake.¶""Everyone feels like a child when they see that new environment for the first time,"" Vevers says. ""You just get excited.""¶This article originally appeared on CNET.",0

            Dangers posed by Alaska's rapidly thawing permafrost- Jeff Glor - CBS News - CBS News
    ",CBS News,"October 19, 2017, 9:22 AM","¶A new report just issued by NOAA says September's Arctic sea ice coverage was about 25 percent less than it was between 1981 and 2010. As America's only Arctic state, Alaska today faces unique challenges. One of those is the loss of permafrost, the frozen earth that serves as the foundation for huge portions of the state.¶ For the past decade, Sue Natali of the Woods Hole Research Center has been taking trips deep into the remote corners of Alaska's wilderness.   ""This area has been thawing for several decades now,"" Natali said.    Her mission: monitor how the region's warming air temperatures are impacting the frozen earth underground.¶ ""Permafrost is frozen ground, it's ground that remains below zero degrees Celsius for two or more consecutive years,"" Natali explained. ""Everything in that ground that's frozen is permafrost."" ¶But that term is actually misleading because, as Natali and other field scientists are learning, the icy soil buried under spongy moss is anything but permanent.   Recent studies show Arctic permafrost has warmed by up to 2 degrees Celsius in the past three decades and predict that 20 percent of it may thaw by 2040.   Natali uses a drill to extract permafrost, which starts a few feet under the surface and can extend hundreds of feet down. It contains organic material from dead and partially decayed plants and animals.¶ Some of it has been frozen for thousands of years, but as it thaws, that organic material releases gases like methane and carbon dioxide – so-called greenhouse gases – that warm the atmosphere.   ""Our projections say for the larger permafrost region we can expect 150 billion tons of carbon to be released by 2100,"" Natali said. ¶ Based on current emissions, the U.S. is already expected to release that much carbon over the same time period just by burning fossil fuels. Alaska's thawing permafrost would effectively double that figure. ¶The best view of permafrost does come from underground, in a 50-year-old tunnel built and maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers just outside Fairbanks.¶   Down there, it's easy to visualize another danger posed by thawing ground.   ""You can imagine if this – the permafrost thaws and this really large ice wedge here melts out, that you're going to have some pretty substantial ground collapse,"" Natali said.¶It's already happening in Alaska. Forests of trees bent or toppled over, roads like roller coaster tracks, even neighborhoods of homes buckling into uneven ground.¶ University of Alaska researcher Alexander Kholodov studies permafrost loss using hundreds of sensors around the northern hemisphere. He says the data from almost all those stations points to the same trend.   ""It is really warm, so is really close to freezing point, so it's actually very, very vulnerable now,"" Kholodov said. ""We are right on the line now, on the borderline.""¶Another possible side effect of permafrost loss is that thawing remains of long-dead animals could release dormant diseases. Last summer, the first fatal Russian outbreak of anthrax in 75 years killed a child and sickened 20. ",0

    ","¶This year -- 2017 -- is the second-warmest year on record for the entire globe, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Wednesday. ¶The records date back 138 years to 1880, the NOAA said. ¶September was the fourth-warmest September on record and saw a number of weather anomalies across the globe. Those included Hurricane Irma, which churned from Aug. 30-Sept. 16 with winds that reached over 180 mph, and Hurricane Maria, which formed on Sept. 16 and did not dissipate until Oct. 3 and had maximum sustained winds of more than 170 mph. ¶More in Climate Change¶Hurricane Irma was the strongest hurricane since 2005's Hurricane Wilma, and Hurricane Maria was the strongest hurricane to hit Puerto Rico since 1928.¶North America had the eighth highest September temperature on record, and record and near-record temperatures were recorded in the Midwest and the lower Mississippi Valley. ¶In the Arctic, the sea ice extent — or the measurement of the area of the ocean with at least some sea ice — was 25.5 percent below the 1981-2010 average, and the seventh smallest for September since records began in 1979. The Antarctic sea extent was 4.2 percent below the 1981-2010 average, the second smallest sea ice extent on record, behind 1986.¶Africa had the highest September temperature since continental records began in 1910. Much of Asia (excluding Russia) had warmer than average temperatures, with Bahrain having the warmest September since 1902. Much of Australia had above-average temperatures, and Australia set a record for the warmest day in September on the 22nd of the month. ¶Meanwhile, much of Europe had cooler than average temperatures. Ireland and Austria had their coolest Septembers since 2009 and 2007, respectively. Russia also recorded cooler than average temperatures. ",0
Mass die-off of Antarctic penguin chicks alarms researchers,"
","

      / CBS/AP
    ","¶BERLIN -- Almost the entire cohort of chicks from an Adelie penguin colony in the eastern Antarctic was wiped out by starvation last summer in what scientists say is only the second such incident in over 40 years.¶Researchers said Sunday the mass die-off occurred because unusually large amounts of sea ice forced penguin parents to travel farther in search of food for their young. By the time they returned, only two out of thousands of chicks had survived.¶""Not only did the chick starve but the partner (who stayed behind) also had to endure a long fast,"" said Yan Ropert-Coudert, a marine ecologist with the French science agency CNRS.¶More in Climate Change¶Ropert-Coudert, who leads the study of seabirds at the Dumont D'Urville Antarctic research station, said the Adelie colony there numbers about 18,000 pairs who have been monitored since the 1960s. A similar breeding loss was observed for the first time during a 2013-2014 research expedition.¶""It is unusual because of the size of the population concerned,"" he said in an email to The Associated Press. ""Zero breeding success years have been noted before elsewhere, but never for colonies of this size.""¶Sea ice extent in the polar regions varies each year, but climate change has made the fluctuation more extreme.¶A study published by Oceanites in April said the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by a year-round average of 5 degrees Fahrenheit in the past 60 years.¶The environmental group WWF, which supported the research, urged governments meeting in Hobart, Australia, this week to approve a new marine protection area off East Antarctica. Rod Downie, head of polar programs for the group's British branch, said the impact of losing thousands of chicks was dramatic for an otherwise hardy species such as Adelie penguins.¶""It's more like 'Tarantino does Happy Feet', with dead penguin chicks strewn across a beach in Adelie Land,"" he said.¶Ropert-Coudert said creating a protection zone in the D'Urville Sea-Mertz region, where the colony is located, wouldn't prevent larger-than-usual sea ice, but it might ease the pressure on penguins from tourism and over-fishing.",0
"How climate change is ""turning up the dial"" on California wildfires","

    ","¶The deadly wildfires ravaging northern California have destroyed more than 3,500 homes and businesses, leveling entire neighborhoods and forcing thousands of residents to flee the flames.¶At least 31 people have died in the blazes, which have burned 265 square miles of land and rank among the most destructive in California's history. The wildfires kicking off California's fire season come after millions of acres in the western U.S. went up in flames over the summer.¶Experts say fires like those burning up California wine country will be more frequent, more intense and last longer as global temperatures rise. While no single fire can be said to have been caused by climate change, variations in temperature and precipitation are already affecting the complex dynamics that determine how wildfires develop and spread.¶More in Climate Change¶California Gov. Jerry Brown laid the blame squarely at the feet of climate change on Wednesday.¶""With a warming climate, dry weather and reducing moisture, these kinds of catastrophes have happened and will continue to happen and we have to be ready to mitigate, and it's going to cost a lot of money,"" Brown said.¶Scientists and fire experts back up that claim. They point to an alarming increase in the severity and frequency of wildfires in the West over the past several years, warning that the problem is only going to get worse.¶""When we step back and look at the whole West, fires are increasing everywhere at different rates,"" said LeRoy Westerling, professor of management at the University of California, Merced who studies how climate affects wildfires. ""The goose is cooked in someplace like Yellowstone. The frequency of fires is expected to increase so much, and the ecosystem is really going to change.""¶In California, weather patterns over the past several seasons have laid the perfect groundwork for a devastating fire season, which typically peaks in October. ¶As the climate changes, extremes in seasonal conditions are exacerbated, Westerling says. Climate change affects wildfires from two directions at different times of the year: Winters become wetter and shorter, while summers become hotter and last longer.¶""Climate change is kind of turning up the dial on everything,"" Westerling said. ""Dry periods become more extreme. Wet periods become more extreme.""¶Somewhat counterintuitively, more rain and snow in the winter lays the groundwork for more destructive wildfires. More precipitation in the winter means more vegetation can grow in the spring. Over the summer months, that vegetation dries out and becomes the fuel that feeds wildfires when ignited.¶Higher temperatures in the summer months mean the trees, brush and grass are significantly drier once fire season rolls around. High-speed Diablo winds from the interior of the continent and increased evaporation due to higher temperatures contribute to drying out the plant life. Higher temperatures also mean fire season lasts longer.¶California suffered a historic drought last summer, followed by a very wet winter. This dynamic created a tinderbox that was primed to go up in flames, said Susan Jane Brown, an environmental attorney with the Western Environmental Law Center.¶""We had a wet winter and that provided moisture to vegetation, which grew a lot -- grasses, brush, trees,"" Brown said. ""When you have a lot of vegetation that grows, it then dries out and stays around longer than usual.""¶Brown added that grazing and logging have contributed to the conditions fueling severe wildfires across the West.¶""We've done a lot of commercial logging that removed old-growth trees that were fire resistant,"" Brown said. ""We've also increased grazing. When you remove low-intensity fuels, what you've got left is a condition on the ground that's more flammable and less resistant to responding well to fire.""¶Warmer temperatures also mean insects like the mountain pine beetle, which attacks and weakens trees, can extend their range further north, leaving more fuel in their wake, according to Climate Nexus.¶Even under the most optimistic climate projections, the risk of wildfires will remain elevated for decades to come. Westerling warns of dire consequences in the years ahead as global temperatures continue to rise, even if countries cut greenhouse gas emissions.¶""Say you have an increase of even 2 degrees Celsius,"" Westerling said, referring to the target limit in the increase in temperature over pre-industrial levels by 2100 set out in the Paris climate accord, which the U.S. abandoned in June. ""You would need so much more precipitation to counteract the drying that comes with that. No amount of precipitation in any of the models is enough to counteract the drying.""¶Brown said that increased development in areas now prone to more severe fires means further destruction is almost an inevitability.¶""People are coming to realize that many of these places have a mind of their own,"" she said. ""When we try to manipulate natural processes to the extent that we have, we're going to see some effects.""",0

    ","¶Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced an increased commitment to end America's coal dependency and transition the U.S. economy to a clean energy future.¶On Wednesday, Bloomberg announced that Bloomberg Philanthropies, an organization that encompasses all of the charitable giving for the former mayor, would be committing $64 million to support the Sierra Club's ""Beyond Coal"" campaign and other organizations to help move the United States off of coal power altogether.¶The organization has supported the Sierra Club's campaign since 2011 in its effort to seek alternative clean energy solutions.¶More in Climate Change¶""The war on coal is saving tens of thousands of lives and we won't stop fighting until we've saved every last one,"" Bloomberg told reporters at the Sierra Club's Washington office.¶He added, ""Whether you believe what scientists tell us about climate change or not, there's no debating that coal pollution is terrible for our health.""¶The funding includes $30 million to support the ""Beyond Coal"" campaign through 2020 as well as funding for other groups like the League of Conservation Voters to help speed the transition to clean energy sources on the state and local level.¶The announcement comes just days after EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt announced the Trump administration's intentions to withdraw from the Obama-era Clean Power Plan at an event in Kentucky on Monday.¶Former president Barack Obama put the Clean Power Plan into place in 2015 in hopes of reducing carbon dioxide pollution levels by setting individual environmental goals for each state. It also aimed to transition from coal-based energy to wind, solar and natural gas power.¶""When you think about what that rule meant, that rule really was about picking winners and losers. Regulatory power should not be used by any regulatory body to pick winners and losers,"" Pruitt said. ""The past administration was unapologetic. They were using every bit of power, every bit of authority to use the EPA to pick winners and losers in how we generate electricity in this country. And that's wrong.""¶It was not immediately clear if Pruitt would seek to issue a new rule without congressional approval, an approach criticized by Republicans during the Obama administration. Pruitt's rule wouldn't become final for months and is then highly likely to face a raft of legal challenges.¶""Not only is the EPA rolling back this plan, but the Energy Department is requesting a massive taxpayer bailout of failing coal plants, one of the worst ideas Washington has ever come up with, which is saying a lot,"" said Bloomberg.¶Bloomberg also slammed the Trump administration for providing ""false hope"" to those looking to maintain a career in the coal industry, as the business continues to shrink, forcing many to lose their jobs.¶""Coal jobs aren't coming back,"" Bloomberg stated. ""People pretend that they will, but they're only giving false hope to regions where the federal government has failed them for much too long.""¶He said his philanthropic organization has been working to provide grants to individuals working and living in coal country to find new skills to gain new job opportunities outside the industry.¶In recent months, following President Trump's announcement of the U.S. pullout of the Paris Climate agreement, the former mayor said Bloomberg Philanthropies would commit up to $15 million to help fund global efforts to address climate change that lacked support from the U.S. government. Bloomberg brought together more than a thousand entities -- from cities and states to corporations to universities -- pledging to reduce carbon emissions, independent of federal policy. ¶Bloomberg criticized the Trump administration's lack of pro-environmental policies, suggesting it ""sends a message to the rest of the world that it doesn't care about its people.""¶""If you pollute, everyone around the world suffers, the air doesn't stop moving, and we're all in this together, whether we'd like to be or not,"" he warned.¶""The best thing that could happen is if the President of the United States, Donald Trump, has an epiphany,"" Bloomberg added. ""It'd be wonderful if he had environmental secretaries and the rest of his administration to work together to try to improve the life and economy of Americans.""¶CBS News' Blair Guild contributed to this report.",0
EPA's Clean Power Plan reversal opposed by medical coalition,"

      / CBS/AP
    ","¶A coalition of medical groups opposed the Trump administration's move to kill an Obama-era effort to limit carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants, saying such action ""puts American lives at greater risk.""¶Speaking Monday in the coal-mining state of Kentucky, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt said he would be issuing a new set of rules overriding the Clean Power Plan, the centerpiece of President Obama's drive to curb global climate change.¶""A decision to repeal the Clean Power Plan is a choice that puts American lives at greater risk from unhealthy air and the health harms from climate change,"" said Dr. Mona Sarfaty, director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health, a group of medical associations representing 450,000 clinical practitioners.¶More in Climate Change¶Sarfaty cited a 2015 EPA analysis of the Clean Power Plan that said it would help prevent 3,600 premature deaths, 1,700 heart attacks and 90,000 asthma attacks per year.¶""While many regard the Clean Power Plan primarily as an effort to reduce climate change, doctors know it's also about the health of our patients,"" Sarfaty said.¶Her comments are in line with an argument that medical groups have been making in recent years.¶""Scientific surveys have shown clear evidence that our patients are facing adverse health effects associated with climate change,"" Dr. Willarda Edwards of the American Medical Association said in 2016. ""From heat-related injuries and forest fire air pollution, to worsening seasonal allergies and storm-related illness and injuries, it is important that we make every effort to put environmentally friendly practices in place to lessen the harmful impact that climate change is having on patient health across the globe.""¶It was not immediately clear if Pruitt would seek to issue a new rule without congressional approval, which Republicans had criticized the Obama administration for doing. Pruitt's rule wouldn't become final for months, and is then highly likely to face a raft of legal challenges.¶A coalition of left-leaning states and environmental groups vowed to fight the Trump administration's move.¶New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman was among those who said they will sue.¶""The Trump Administration's persistent and indefensible denial of climate change — and their continued assault on actions essential to stemming its increasing devastation — is reprehensible, and I will use every available legal tool to fight their dangerous agenda,"" said Schneiderman, a Democrat.¶For Pruitt, getting rid of the Clean Power Plan will mark the culmination of a long fight he began as the elected attorney general of Oklahoma. Pruitt was among about two dozen attorneys general who sued to stop Obama's 2014 push to limit carbon emissions, stymieing the limits from ever taking effect.¶Closely aligned with the oil and gas industry in his home state, Pruitt rejects the consensus of scientists that man-made emissions from burning fossil fuels are the primary driver of global climate change.¶President Trump, who appointed Pruitt and shares his skepticism of established climate science, promised to kill the Clean Power Plan during the 2016 campaign as part of his broader pledge to revive the nation's struggling coal mines.¶In his order Tuesday, Pruitt is expected to declare that the Obama-era rule exceeded federal law by setting emissions standards that power plants could not reasonably meet.¶Pruitt appeared at an event with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell at Whayne Supply in Hazard, Kentucky, a company that sells coal mining supplies. The store's owners have been forced to lay off about 60 percent of its workers in recent years.¶While cheering the demise of the Clean Power Plan as a way to stop the bleeding, McConnell conceded most of those lost jobs are never coming back.¶""A lot of damage has been done,"" said McConnell, a Kentucky Republican. ""This doesn't immediately bring everything back, but we think it stops further decline of coal fired plants in the United States and that means there will still be some market here.""¶Mr. Obama's plan was designed to cut U.S. carbon dioxide emissions to 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. The rule dictated specific emission targets for states based on power-plant emissions and gave officials broad latitude to decide how to achieve reductions.¶The Supreme Court put the plan on hold last year following legal challenges by industry and coal-friendly states. Even so, the plan helped drive a recent wave of retirements of coal-fired plants, which are also being squeezed by low cost natural gas and renewable power. In the absence of stricter federal regulations curbing greenhouse gas emissions, many states have issued their own mandates promoting energy conservation.¶The withdrawal of the Clean Power Plan is the latest in a series of moves by Mr. Trump and Pruitt to dismantle Mr. Obama's legacy on fighting climate change, including the delay or rollback of rules limiting levels of toxic pollution in smokestack emissions and wastewater discharges from coal-burning power plants.¶On Thursday, Mr. Trump nominated former coal-industry lobbyist Andrew Wheeler to serve as Pruitt's top deputy at EPA — one of several recent political appointees at the agency with direct ties to the fossil fuel interests.¶The president announced earlier this year that he will pull the United States out of the landmark Paris climate agreement. Nearly 200 countries have committed to combat global warming by reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming.¶""This president has tremendous courage,"" Pruitt said Monday. ""He put America first and said to the rest of the world we are going to say no and exit the Paris Accord. That was the right thing to do.""¶Despite the rhetoric about saving coal, government statistics show that coal mines currently employ only about 52,000 workers nationally — a modest 4-percent uptick since Mr. Trump became president. Those numbers are dwarfed by the jobs created by building such clean power infrastructure as wind turbines and solar arrays.¶Environmental groups and public health advocates quickly derided Pruitt's decision as short sighted.¶""Trump is not just ignoring the deadly cost of pollution, he's ignoring the clean energy deployment that is rapidly creating jobs across the country,"" said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club.",0

    ","¶UNITED NATIONS -- Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is heading to the hurricane-battered Caribbean, where he said Wednesday that scientists predict the extreme storms during this year's Atlantic hurricane season ""will be the new normal of a warming world."" ¶The U.N. chief told reporters that Hurricane Irma, which devastated Barbuda, was a Category 5 storm for three consecutive days -- ""the longest on satellite record"" -- and its winds that reached 300 kilometers per hour for 37 hours were ""the longest on record at that intensity."" ¶Hurricanes Harvey and Irma marked the first time two Category 4 storms made landfall on the United States mainland in the same year, Guterres said, and Hurricane Maria, a Category 5 storm, followed up by decimating Dominica and devastating Puerto Rico. ¶More in Climate Change¶The secretary-general said ""scientists are learning more and more about the links between climate change and extreme weather."" ¶A warmer climate ""turbocharges the intensity of hurricanes,"" which pick up energy as they move across the ocean, he said. ""The melting of glaciers, and the thermal expansion of the seas, means bigger storm surges"" and with more people living along coastlines ""the damage is, and will be that much greater."" ¶Guterres said the world has ""the tools, the technologies and the wealth to address climate change, but we must show more determination in moving towards a green, clean, sustainable energy future"" -- and in stepping up implementation of the 2015 Paris climate agreement.¶Guterres made the point during the recent General Assembly that the world - and the U.S. in particular - need to stick with the Paris climate agreement, CBS News' Pamela Falk reports from the U.N. ¶The recent severe hurricane system gave the U.N. chief an added platform to make the point, Falk said. ¶The secretary-general said he will travel to Antigua and Barbuda and Dominica on Saturday to survey the damage and assess what more the United Nations can do. ¶Stephen O'Malley, the U.N. resident coordinator for Barbados and the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States, said Tuesday that the United Nations, World Bank and Antigua government have conducted a post-disaster needs assessment for Barbuda, whose 1,800 residents were evacuated to Antigua before Hurricane Irma damaged 95 percent of its structures on Sept. 14. ¶He said a similar assessment will be done in Dominica, which was ravaged on Sept. 18 by Hurricane Maria, probably in about three weeks. ¶Guterres said the response to the $113.9 million U.N. appeal to cover humanitarian needs in the Caribbean for the immediate period ahead has been poor and he urged donors ""to respond more generously in the weeks to come."" ¶He also stressed that ""innovative financing mechanisms will be crucial"" to enable these small islands to recover, rebuild and ""strengthen resilience.""",0

    ","¶BERLIN -- Climate researchers are warning that Europeans should prepare for the return of ""Lucifer,"" saying the hellishly named heat wave that hit parts of the continent this summer could become a regular occurrence due to man-made climate change.¶Hotter-than-usual temperatures in the Mediterranean region resulted in higher hospital admissions, numerous forest fires and widespread economic losses between June and August. Peak heat struck Italy and the Balkans for three days in early August , when temperatures remained above 30 degrees Celsius (86 Fahrenheit) even at night.¶""We found clear evidence of human influence on this summer's record warmth -- both in the overall summer temperatures and in the heat wave dubbed Lucifer,"" said Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, a senior researcher at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute.¶Van Oldenborgh is part of the World Weather Attribution team that published a study Wednesday, concluding that greenhouse gas emissions linked to human activity have increased the chances of such heat waves four-to-tenfold compared to the early 1900s.¶More in Climate Change¶Gases such as carbon dioxide, which is released by burning fossil fuels, trap heat in the atmosphere and cause the planet to warm like the inside of a greenhouse.¶""Climate change makes a heat wave like this at least ten times more likely, and if we continue to release greenhouse gases then an event like this will become a normal summer, Friederike Otto, deputy director of the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford University, said.¶Extreme, short-term heat already is four times more likely than at the start of the last century, she said.¶""Depending on when we stop and how much is emitted before we stop, that will determine where and if these heat waves become the norm,"" said Otto, who was part of the research group.¶The team's use of actual temperature measurements and computer simulations is widely accepted among scientists as a means of determining whether climate change plays a role in extreme events.¶""The analysis applies state of the art techniques that have withstood rigorous peer-review in many previous studies,"" said Maarten van Aalst, director of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Center.¶The World Weather Attribution team said its study indicates that summers like the one that just ended could become the norm in the Euro-Mediterranean region by 2050 if emissions of so-called greenhouse gases continue to rise.¶Van Aalst, whose center provides research to national Red Cross or Red Crescent agencies around the world, said the new study should be a wake-up call to policymakers in Europe about the need to prepare for hotter summers.¶While the average person in developed countries might enjoy a few days of strong sunshine -- especially if they can cool off at the beach -- elderly people, infants and those who are chronically ill will suffer, he said.¶""Climate change is already having a significant impact on the risks we face today, and we should do what we can to keep that risk from rising out of control.""

    ","¶Global hunger is once again on the rise, reversing some of the progress made over the last decade of steady decline, according to a new report from the World Health Organization (WHO).¶In 2016, an estimated 815 million people across the world were undernourished, amounting to about 11 percent of the global population. That number is up 38 million from 2015.¶Children are particularly vulnerable to the effects of malnutrition. The report found that 155 million kids under the age of 5 are too short for their age. Another 52 million suffer from wasting, meaning their weight is too low for their height. ¶More in Climate Change¶The report cites wars and climate change as factors driving the crisis. ¶""Over the past decade, conflicts have risen dramatically in number and become more complex and intractable in nature,"" the authors wrote.¶More than half of those suffering from hunger live in countries torn apart by ongoing armed conflict, including South Sudan, Nigeria, Somalia and Yemen. Some of the highest proportions of malnourished children in the world are concentrated in zones of conflict.¶""This has set off alarm bells we cannot afford to ignore: we will not end hunger and all forms of malnutrition by 2030 unless we address all the factors that undermine food security and nutrition. Securing peaceful and inclusive societies is a necessary condition to that end,"" the authors wrote.¶Food insecurity – defined as a situation when people lack adequate amounts of food necessary for normal growth and an active, healthy life – and malnutrition are also exacerbated by the effects of climate change, such as the increasing severity of extreme storms, droughts and floods, which can interfere with crops and food distribution.¶The scarcity and desperation that accompany these natural disasters can further deepen existing conflicts and lead to continued deterioration of the crisis, the researchers say, fueling a vicious cycle of greater human suffering.¶Even in more peaceful regions not affected by conflict, droughts and floods linked to the recent weather phenomenon El Niño have contributed to a rise in food security and malnutrition.¶The WHO report is the first U.N. global assessment on food security and nutrition to following last year's announcement of its goal to end hunger and all forms of malnutrition by 2030 as a top international policy priority.¶The report also makes note of another concerning health trend, the doubling of obesity rates worldwide since 1980. Nearly 41 million children are now overweight. While it may seem odd for both obesity and malnutrition to be on the rise, the report says the two problems are actually interrelated.¶""Food insecurity and obesity often co-exist – even in the same household. When resources for food become scarce, and people's means to access nutritious food diminish, they often rely on less-healthy, more energy-dense food choices that can lead to overweight and obesity,"" the authors write.¶The report includes several recommendations to address food insecurity and malnutrition, including agricultural programs and food system policies; effective humanitarian aid for people displaced by conflict; and more support for efforts to achieve long-term peace.¶""Ending hunger and all forms of malnutrition is an ambitious goal, but it is one we strongly believe can be reached if we strengthen our common efforts and work to tackle the underlying causes that leave so many people food insecure, jeopardizing their lives, futures, and the futures of their societies,"" the authors write.",0

"Summer is getting longer in the waters off New England, scientists say","

      / AP
    ","¶PORTLAND, Maine -- Summer is getting longer in the waters off New England, and that could have big ramifications for everything from the strength of storms to the health of fisheries and endangered whales, according to scientists.¶The scientists, led by Andrew Thomas of the University of Maine, said the warming of the Gulf of Maine has added up to 66 days of summer-like temperatures to the water surface since 1982.¶The gulf, which stretches from Massachusetts to Nova Scotia, is a critical piece of ocean for industries such as fishing, shipping and tourism, and researchers have previously said it is warming faster than almost all of Earth's waters.¶More in Climate Change¶The scientists involved in the study used 33 years of satellite data to identify seasonal trends. The data show that the warming of the Gulf of Maine has been much greater in the months from June to October, effectively stretching out the length of summer, Thomas said.¶Warmer, longer summers will result in ""winners and losers"" in the Gulf of Maine, Thomas said, adding that some consequences could be dire.¶""We may cross some threshold where some virus or some bacteria might be able to make a living here,"" Thomas said. ""But if you're a tourist who wants to swim at a beach, a warmer July or August might be just fine.""¶Thomas and his co-authors published their findings in the scientific journal Elementa last month. The paper says longer summers could have serious ramifications because rising water temperatures can disrupt ocean ecosystems.¶The scientists' work illustrates that the Gulf of Maine is ""ground zero for experiencing the impacts of ocean warming,"" said Malin Pinsky, an ecologist and assistant professor at Rutgers University who was not involved in the study.¶The paper also says the trend could provide more hospitable waters for hurricanes, which feed off warm water. The cold water typical of the Gulf of Maine would normally cause a hurricane to lose energy, but such a storm could stay strong if it enters the region in future summers because of the warming trend, according to the study.¶""Many of the big storms that are going to impact New England get some of their energy and some of their moisture from the ocean,"" said Andrew Pershing, a scientist with the Gulf of Maine Research Institute in Portland and a co-author of the paper.¶Some of the biggest impacts of the warming trend already are being felt through changes to the marine life in the Gulf of Maine, where fishermen seek valuable species, such as lobsters and haddock. The warming of the gulf tracks with a trend of some species, such as lobsters, moving further north, Pershing said.¶The trend also could cause a change in the availability of food that jeopardizes the future of endangered North Atlantic right whales, said Nicholas Record, another co-author of the paper and a senior research scientist at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in East Boothbay, Maine.¶The whales, which number no more than 500, have experienced high mortality this year. It's possible the whales are becoming more vulnerable as the ocean warms because the tiny organisms they eat might be moving to different parts of the ocean during the feeding season, Record said.¶""Animals use that seasonality. The more they are out of alignment, the more that strains the food web,"" Record said. ""When the timing moves apart, that has effects that propagate throughout the food web. Usually negative effects."" ",0
Is climate change affecting hurricanes? What we do -- and don't -- know,"

    ","¶Chanh Kieu is Assistant Professor of Atmospheric Science at Indiana University ¶Hurricane Harvey, with its historic amount of rainfall over Texas, followed by a string of Hurricanes Irma, Jose and Katia in the North Atlantic basin in 2017, has triggered longstanding questions about any linkage between hurricanes and climate.¶Can we really blame these recent hurricanes on climate changes? Or are they simply a coincidence of nature happening once every few decades, similar to the triple of Hurricanes Beulah, Chloe and Doria back in 1967?   ¶More in Climate Change¶Answering these questions lies at the heart of the current hurricane climate research that atmospheric scientists are trying to understand. There are signs that climate change can influence hurricanes in several different ways. However, these signals are inconclusive due to our inadequate understanding of how hurricanes interact with the environment.  ¶Much as a flu virus morphs in different environments and becomes more infectious in cold winter temperatures, hurricanes depend on the ambient environment for their existence and motion. To what extent the surrounding environment affects hurricane development is indeed among the most extensively studied topics in hurricane research.  ¶Evidence of the environment's role on hurricane development has been noted since the early 1950s, yet a major milestone was achieved by Kerry Emanuel at MIT in his studies of hurricane dynamics in the late 1980s.  ¶His idea was to consider hurricanes as heat engines that can extract heat from the ocean surface and exhaust it at the upper troposphere. In this way, Emanuel was able to obtain a mathematical expression showing how the maximum potential intensity a hurricane can attain in a given environment depends on sea surface temperature and temperature near the top of the atmospheric troposphere around 14 kilometers, or 8.8 miles, above the sea. A warmer sea surface temperature would result in a higher intensity, according to Emanuel's formulation.  ¶In essence, Emanuel's relationship between hurricane intensity and sea surface temperature  dictates how strong a hurricane can be for a given environmental condition. Numerous studies have then confirmed the importance of sea surface temperature in controlling hurricane maximum intensity, and suggest an increase of 2-3 percent in hurricane strength per 1 Celsius degree increase in sea surface temperature under favorable conditions. ¶From this perspective, it is thus very tempting to assert that hurricane intensity variations must be connected to the global climate due to the vital role of ocean temperatures in hurricane development. Indeed, many studies of hurricane intensity climatology consider ocean temperature as a main proxy to detect the future trend in hurricane intensity change.  ¶The common consensus among these studies is a conclusion that future hurricanes will tend to be stronger than those in the present-day climate, assuming that sea surface temperature will continue its current warming trend into the future.  ¶While we can expect an increase in hurricane intensity as a result of rising ocean temperatures, how to interpret this result to one specific hurricane turns out to be very different.  ¶For an intuitive illustration of how difficult this can be, consider how climate change can affect aspects of our weather, such as the daily variation of temperature.  ¶For instance, a future air temperature warming of 0.5 degrees in the next 10 years would be mostly masked out by any daily temperature variation, which is in the range of 10 degrees between day and night. In this sense, it would be hasty to jump to a conclusion that the high intensity of Hurricane Harvey or Irma is caused by climate changes, simply because fluctuations in local weather conditions could contribute much more than climate change signals.  ¶On top of the day-to-day intensity fluctuations due to local environmental conditions, hurricanes may also possess chaotic behaviors that cause their intensity to highly vary. A recent study showed internal variations of hurricane intensity could be as large as 10-18 miles per hour, which is larger than what would be induced by climate change.   ¶On the other hand, one should not naively deny any claim that the extreme impacts of Hurricane Harvey or Irma are symptoms of climate changes.  ¶Some research has indicated that the change in global climate could lead to a shift of the jet stream behaviors over North America. Flooding related to Harvey was unusual in part because the storm stalled over Texas for much longer than any other hurricane. So while our current knowledge does not allow us to connect Harvey's intensity to any specific changes in climate, the abnormality of the Harvey stalling for a long period over land could be a manifestation of the shift in global circulation in a warmer climate. ¶Likewise, the emergence of triple hurricanes in the Atlantic basin during September 2017 could be another potential signal of the more favorable conditions for hurricane formation from climate change.  ¶From the climatological perspective, it is the frequency and magnitude of these abnormal extremes, such as the prolonged period over land of Hurricane Harvey or the extreme intensity of Hurricane Irma, that are often of utmost interest to researchers. This is because these extremes are signals of climate changes that can be distinguished from day-to-day variations.  ¶Along with direct impacts of climate on hurricane intensity, another conceivable influence of climate on hurricanes is the shift of the hurricane track pattern in the future climate.  ¶In principle, a change in global air circulation patterns could influence the steering flows that guide hurricane movement, much like a leaf carried away by a river. As such, variations in global circulations associated with climate change could introduce another degree of variability to hurricane impacts that we have to take into account.  ¶A recent climatological study led by James Kossin at University of Wisconsin suggested a poleward shift of the hurricane maximum intensity location in a warming climate. But unlike the connection between hurricane intensity and the ambient environment, the linkage between global circulation change and hurricane movement is much harder to quantify at present.  ¶While research on hurricanes gives us a good sense of how hurricanes would change in a warmer climate, measuring this change and, in particular, tying a unique feature of one specific hurricane to climate change are beyond the current level of confidence.  ¶In reality, there are several other factors that could strongly interfere with hurricane development, such as the change of atmospheric temperature with height. These factors directly affect the interaction of hurricanes with the surrounding environment. However, these are very difficult to quantify in the context of climate change due to the different time scales between hurricane development -- measured on the order of days and weeks -- and climate change, which occurs over decades. ¶From a scientist's perspective, the lack of understanding of climate impacts on hurricanes is disappointing, if not irritating. On the other hand, these uncertainties continue to motivate us to search for any possible link between hurricanes -- including their intensity, frequency, time of formation and location -- and climate. Better understanding of hurricane-climate relation is needed, as ultimately that knowledge can help serve society. ¶This article was originally published on The Conversation. ",0
"If hurricanes are getting more extreme, do we need to create a new Category 6?","

              ","
September 11, 2017 / 12:07 PM
      / The Conversation
    ","¶Sally Brown is a Senior Research Fellow at the University of Southampton¶There's been a devastating trail of destruction and flooding along the east Atlantic coast in the last few weeks following Hurricane Harvey and now Hurricane Irma. The latter, currently moving across Florida, is the strongest sustained hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic outside the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico.¶Hurricane strength is measured on the Saffir–Simpson scale, ranging from one (the lowest) to five (the highest) based on the hurricane's wind speed and estimated potential damage. This takes into account parameters such as whether the hurricane uproots trees or removes roofs from houses, and whether the destruction could last for days or months. ¶More in Climate Change¶Initially, Hurricane Irma was rated as a Category 5 (it is now losing energy), with winds moving at 175 mph – destroying homes and causing power failure in the Caribbean. But given that Irma's power has made some islands ""barely habitable,"" is Category 5 really sufficient? Is it time to introduce a Category 6?¶People have been quick to ask if Hurricane Irma is connected to climate change and whether this is a sign of things to come. It remains uncertain whether hurricanes have significantly increased in frequency or severity as global temperatures have risen, partly due to a lack of long-term data.¶We know that hurricane formation is affected by changes in sea surface temperatures – a warm ocean helps fuel hurricanes. This is partly driven by natural periodic and cyclic variations in the Earth's climatic and oceanic systems, meaning that in some years the ocean is warmer than in others.¶Studies have presented mixed views of what will happen in the future with global warming. However, there are many consistent models and research articles indicating that there will be fewer hurricanes along the Atlantic coast, but that those that do form will be more severe – due to the warmer temperatures.¶However, it's important to keep in mind that what we've seen recently, compared with decades ago, is not so much a change in hurricanes, but a change in impacts. Many coasts have become increasingly urbanised, and this trend is likely to continue. As with many small islands, much of the population of Barbuda, Guadeloupe and others in the Caribbean are situated on the narrow coastal fringe – meaning they experience the full force of natural disasters, sometimes on scales never seen before. This means there is more infrastructure to be destroyed or damaged during extreme weather conditions than say 100 years ago. The same can be said as Irma moves over Florida.¶Infrastructure on islands, such as harbours and airports, are key lifelines to the outside world – and any disruption to these can have serious consequences, potentially for many years. On small islands, infrastructure is partly there to support the economy (including tourism), which in turn provides further economic development, social welfare and health benefits to the wider population. Take the infrastructure away as Irma has, and the economy declines leading to a shock.¶This is because, historically, small islands have been essential maritime or colonial hubs or trading posts. But today they are highly reliant on external trade, often through fisheries, agriculture or tourism. Concentrating on one or two industries makes islands strong, but when extreme events or global disasters occur, the shock means they count the cost. Essentially, they have their eggs all in one basket. In Antigua and Barbuda the total contribution of tourism to gross domestic product was 60 percent in 2016.¶Hurricane Andrew, also a Category 5 event, made landfall in August 1992 – affecting the Bahamas and Florida. In the Bahamas, damage worth $250 million was reported, with projections of a decrease of 20 percent in tourist revenue, despite the vast majority of the islands surviving the hurricane. Luckily, advertising campaigns and repairs ultimately prevented the loss in tourist revenue. This is an important lesson about how to respond to such events.¶Other extreme events have caused long-lived adverse effects. For instance, in the Maldives in the Indian Ocean, the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami affected tourism and wider development for several years. ¶Clearly there is a need for planning in emergency response. This needs to be targeted and accompanied by long-term resilience strategies. Shocks can also provide opportunities. Thanks to the Maldivian Safer Islands programme, islands have been constructed to a higher elevation to reduce the long-term risk of flooding.¶The 2015 Paris Agreement, which aims for nations to mitigate the effects of climate change, singles out small, developing island nations, many of which are in the Caribbean, as ""particularly vulnerable"" due to their ""significant capacity constraints."" Irma has reminded the world that extra help is needed when an island state is partially destroyed.¶So will islands continue to suffer as a result of hurricanes – and will it get worse? In addition to warming temperatures and potential increase in future severity, the slow, but long-term effects of sea-level rise could also increase the extent of flood impacts during and after extreme events.¶From 1901 to 2010, sea levels rose by about 1.9 millimeters a year. This is projected to accelerate, so that sea-levels are about a meter higher in 2100 than today. Over a century, sea-level rise could make the difference between minor and major flooding, and the longevity of impacts. ¶Indeed, long-lasting impacts may provide impetus for introducing a Category 6 of the Saffir-Simpson scale. This could describe cases that have a permanent effect on living conditions – potentially making some areas permanently uninhabitable. Such effects are currently not accounted for on the scale. ¶Whether we do introduce a new category remains to be seen, but it is certainly something worth discussing. Adaptation to climate change and extreme events can help to increase resilience and reduce damage in extreme conditions. But due to their shear strength, events such as Hurricane Irma cannot be adapted to. Sadly, humans will never be totally resilient to extreme events and long-lasting impacts remain a major challenge for all.¶This article was originally published on The Conversation.",0

            Hurricane Irma: ""500-year"" rain events are happening more often than you think - CBS News
    ",CBS News,"September 8, 2017, 8:20 AM","¶Monster Hurricane Irma comes just two weeks after Harvey brought ""500-year"" rainfall to parts of Houston. But Harvey and other so-called ""500-year"" floods are happening far more often than their name implies.¶ Just two years ago Charleston had flooding that could have been called a one-in-a-thousand-year event. Now with Irma approaching, and the potential for another massive flooding event, it begs the question of whether we need to re-think whether these really are once-in-a-lifetime events, reports CBS News correspondent Kris Van Cleave.¶The flooding Hurricane Harvey left behind in Houston was both deadly and devastating. Entire neighborhoods became submerged after rainfall totals exceeded ""500-year"" levels, but as it turns out these flooding events are not quite so rare.    ¶This was the third storm in just three years to bring so-called ""500-year"" rain to the city.¶ ""Clearly we're seeing extreme events. Who would have imagined 52 inches in Houston. It's just unimaginable,"" said Sandra Knight of the University of Maryland Center for Disaster Resilience. ¶ The U.S. has experienced at least 24 of these ""500-year"" rain events since 2010, including Hurricane Matthew in 2016. ¶ The ""500 year"" term is a risk assessment tool used for flood insurance, but scientists say the phrase is misleading. It actually does not mean that the event happens only once every 500 years, but instead that there is a one in 500 chance that this amount of flooding will occur in a single year. A 100-year event has a one in 100 chance of occurring. Researchers say these large storms are happening more often.¶""As the climate continues to warm, rare events could even become the norm,"" said Michael Wehner. He studies the behavior of extreme weather events. He says global temperatures have increased a full degree centigrade in the past century and those warmer conditions can create more powerful storms. ¶""Warmer air can contain more moisture than colder air,"" Wehner said. ¶And more water in the air means more rain that can fall in flood zones where populations are growing.¶""Look, in a place like Miami or Houston. And in the past decades we've had an incredible development as we're planning and looking forward, we have to make room for where this water is going to go,"" Knight said. ",0

      / CBS/AP
    ","¶WASHINGTON -- By the time the rain stops, Harvey will have dumped about 1 million gallons of water for every man, woman and child in southeastern Texas -- a soggy, record-breaking glimpse of the wet and wild future global warming could bring, scientists say.¶While scientists are quick to say climate change didn't cause Harvey and that they haven't determined yet whether the storm was made worse by global warming, they do note that warmer air and water mean wetter and possibly more intense hurricanes in the future.¶""This is the kind of thing we are going to get more of,"" said Princeton University climate scientist Michael Oppenheimer. ""This storm should serve as warning.""¶More in Hurricane Harvey¶There's a scientifically accepted method for determining if some wild weather event has the fingerprints of man-made climate change, and it involves intricate calculations. Those could take weeks or months to complete, and then even longer to pass peer review.¶In general, though, climate scientists agree that future storms will dump much more rain than the same size storms did in the past.¶That's because warmer air holds more water. With every degree Fahrenheit, the atmosphere can hold and then dump an additional 4 percent of water, several scientists say.¶Global warming also means warmer seas, and warm water is what fuels hurricanes.¶When Harvey moved toward Texas, water in the Gulf of Mexico was nearly 2 degrees warmer than normal, said Weather Underground meteorology director Jeff Masters. Hurricanes need at least 79 degrees F as fuel, and water at least that warm ran more than 300 feet deep in the Gulf, according to University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy.¶""What I think we can say is that the fact that we do have climate change, our atmosphere is warmer, it contains more moisture, it means that when we do have a hurricane, a tropical cyclone like this, then when an event does occur, then you know climate change does very likely increase the associated rainfall. But climate change per se does not cause tropical cyclones,"" said Clare Nullis Kapp of the World Meteorological Organization.¶Several studies show that the top 1 percent of the strongest downpours are already happening much more frequently. Also, calculations done Monday by MIT meteorology professor Kerry Emanuel show that the drenching received by Rockport, Texas, used to be maybe a once-in-1,800-years event for that city, but with warmer air holding more water and changes in storm steering currents since 2010, it is now a once-every-300-years event.¶Research published last year in the journal Nature Climate Change projected that extreme downpours will happen nearly three times as often in the United States by the end of this century. Its high-resolution computer modeling found extreme rainfall will be five times more frequent in the Gulf Coast and six times more in parts of the Mississippi Delta by 2100.¶""It's much more likely that you'll get hit by very strong thunderstorms, very strong downpours in the future climate,"" study co-author Andreas Prein, a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, told The Associated Press when the study came out. ""What this means in the future is you might have a much higher potential for flash floods. This can have really big impacts.""¶There's a lot of debate among climate scientists over what role, if any, global warming may have played in causing Harvey to stall over Texas, which has been a huge factor in the catastrophic flooding. If the hurricane had moved on like a normal storm, it wouldn't have dumped as much rain in any one spot.¶Harvey stalled because it is sandwiched between two high-pressure fronts that push it in opposite directions, and those fronts are stuck.¶Oppenheimer and some others theorize that there's a connection between melting sea ice in the Arctic and changes in the jet stream and the weather patterns that make these ""blocking fronts"" more common. Others, like Masters, contend it's too early to say.¶University of Washington atmospheric scientist Cliff Mass said climate change is simply not powerful enough to create off-the-chart events like Harvey's rainfall.¶""You really can't pin global warming on something this extreme. It has to be natural variability,"" Mass said. ""It may juice it up slightly but not create this phenomenal anomaly.""¶""We're breaking one record after another with this thing,"" Mass said.¶Sometime Tuesday or early Wednesday, parts of the Houston region will have broken the nearly 40-year-old U.S. record for the heaviest rainfall from a tropical system -- 48 inches, set by Tropical Storm Amelia in 1978 in Texas, several meteorologists say.¶Already, 15 trillion gallons of rain have fallen on a large area, and an additional 5 trillion or 6 trillion gallons are forecast by the end of Wednesday, meteorologist Ryan Maue of WeatherBell Analytics calculates. That's enough water to fill all the NFL and Division 1 college football stadiums more than 100 times over.",0

Twenty-six percent of the country is below sea level. ¶A massive storm surge barrier called the Maeslantkering, or Maeslant Barrier, was completed in 1997, to protect Rotterdam, Europe's largest port. It's equal in size to two Eiffel Towers, on their sides. ¶""This Maeslant Barrier is really here to safeguard us for the future,"" said Henk Ovink. He is water envoy for the King of the Netherlands -- a water ambassador, if you will.¶The Dutch are the world's go-to water management experts. Ovink spent two years in the United States working in areas hit by Superstorm Sandy. ""I said [to them], 'Did you think about preventing the disaster?' And they were like, 'Preventing the disaster? No, we couldn't. No, we have to make sure that we respond faster.' And I said, 'But suppose that there is no disaster because you prepared better?'""¶Who doesn't know the fable about the little Dutch boy who plugged the hole in a dike with his finger and saved his country? ¶What really happened taught the Netherlands about preparedness.  A ferocious North Sea storm in January 1953 flooded 500 square miles and killed more than 1,800 people. The Dutch built themselves a fortress of flood protection.¶Today, the Netherlands considers itself protected against a 10,000-year storm, in part thanks to research done by Deltares, a gee-whiz kind of place, with the largest wave machine in the world. ¶At their experimental facility, they can test structures that protect the coast against ocean waves.¶Deltares has worked with clients in 140 different countries, including the United States. Ap van Dongeren, a coastal flooding expert with Deltares, says all of their designs are assuming a rise in sea levels. ""And that will come with higher waves, so you have to figure that all into your design,"" he said. ¶Sea levels in Holland are expected to rise more than three feet by the end of the century. This projection prompted the Dutch government -- so used to walling water out at all costs -- to rethink, and let the water in instead.¶""For the Dutch, this is a revolution -- the idea that you're safer by lowering the dikes? This is extraordinary,"" said journalist Tracy Metz. ¶In her latest book, ""Sweet & Salt,"" Metz, a longtime Netherlands resident, tells the story of how the farmers of Overdiepse Polder voluntarily agreed to give up their land so that it could become a spillway for a nearby river when it floods, in order to protect cities and towns downstream. ¶For Nol Hooijmaiers, it was a sacrifice with a silver lining. Huge mounds were constructed, so that he and a few of his neighbors were able to build brand new farms high above the floodplain. ¶""So you're happy, not angry?"" asked Teichner.¶""Everybody is happy, ja,"" he replied. ¶Learning to accommodate water has led to innovation. For example: The Sand Engine (Zandmotor), a 24-million-ton pile of sand dumped off Holland's south coast. Nature was the engine that spread it into a flood barrier and a beach. ¶Jim Murley, the man in charge of confronting Miami-Dade County's water issues, and who has consulted Dutch engineers, says parts of the Dutch model are applicable elsewhere. ""Just the way they go about thinking about managing water, how they use their land, creates a mindset,"" he said.¶In South Florida, flooding has become a regular occurrence. According to current estimates, sea levels here will rise as much as six feet by the end of the century. At stake: trillions of dollars of real estate and more than seven million lives.¶So at a vulnerable Miami waste water treatment plant, critical infrastructure is being rebuilt higher. ""We want to be sure that this facility will withstand a storm surge,"" Murley said.¶In Miami Beach, streets are being raised 2.5 feet. A new art museum in downtown Miami is designed so flood water can flush through its foundation.¶Murley said, ""We're starting to think about how we might develop in the future, if we were having to live with water like the Dutch are.""¶Like Rotterdam, where there is a floating conference center surrounded by floating trees; and Amsterdam, with its whole neighborhood of floating houses.¶Jasper Dykshoorn and his wife, Sietske Jacobs, bought theirs five months ago.¶Teicher asked, ""It's weird having the water right out the window?""¶""Yeah, it is,"" Jacobs replied. ""But on the other hand it isn't. You're in a house.""¶She doesn't mind that the baby's crib is under water. The house is moored to a dock. So if the water level rises, so does the house.¶To Dykshoorn, as a Dutchman, the water is a fact of life -- no more, no less. ""It's in our veins, basically,"" he said. ¶      For more info: ",0

The archipelago is made up of 33 coral atolls and lies halfway between Hawaii and Australia.¶Kiribati native Tearei Tekita's says her home was destroyed by an extremely high tide, known as a ""King Tide,"" when the water surged up from the shoreline without notice as she and her niece lay sleeping. She points to what is now a pool of water, where her home, and many others, once stood.¶Scientists have said that the island nation, along with other low-lying Pacific nations, could be uninhabitable within decades. According to Ben Strauss, Vice President for Sea Level and Climate Impacts at Climate Central, ""Sea level is rising 50 percent faster than it was 20 years ago and that is a real cause for alarm, so it is not a future thing we are really seeing that acceleration."" Kiribati, pronounced ""kir-ah-bahss"" by locals, has an average elevation of just 6 feet above sea level.¶For Strauss, and for the people of Kiribati, every increment of sea level rise poses great threat. ""If your maximum elevation is six feet then by the time we get to three feet I think you are in existential stress, you are going to have to have to evacuate"".  For the remote country's 33 small islands that are scattered across the ocean, spanning an area the size of Alaska, evacuation is not easy. Residents told CBS News correspondent Seth Doane that they would want to leave Kiribati due to the extreme weather they face, however, the UN does not recognize climate change as grounds for refugee status.¶Residents spoke openly of the impact climate change has had on their way of life on the island. The high tides that inundate their homes already contaminate their water and kill their crops. Furthermore, locals face the erosion of their land and, ironically, droughts. For mother of two Etrily Karibwa, the constant lack of fresh water reserves has her trying to leave the nation she loves. Between Karibwa and her husband, they have applied for the Pacific Access Category Resident Visa 10 times consecutively, which allows a direct route to claiming residency in New Zealand to live and work indefinitely.¶For Karibwa, emigrating is the only option. ""I have no choice. No other choice. If a tsunami coming or high tides been affecting our water, how can we survive for the future?"" Her fears are echoed by many. Kaboua, who lives on the Kiribati island of Abaiang, showed Doane the various, hard-hit areas where homes were washed away. Kaboua says he is saving money to send his kids elsewhere: ""Yeah, we have to move to maybe another country,"" and half-heartedly jokes, ""countries that have mountains, you know?""¶Former President Anote Tong hopes his people leave before they are forced to evacuate. ""I don't like our people to be categorized, as refugees... having lost a home, the last thing I would push to see them lose is their dignity."" He calls on countries worldwide to take responsibility for saving his fragile nation. ""We have got to understand that climate change is not a national issue it's a global issue, and we need global thinking. We need global leadership that is what is lacking at the moment."" For Tong, this an issue further compounded by President Trump's decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Accord, which he deems as ""selfish.""¶The United States counts for over a quarter of the world's carbon emissions to date. Many of the Kiribati residents CBS News interviewed hold the United States accountable for the impacts they are experiencing, thousands of miles away. Tekita told CBS News she blames the United States for the loss of her home due to climate change. Yet, even having lost her home, she does not want to leave her homeland. ""Even though we lost so many: we lost our property, our home, [it] cannot change my heart,"" she said. ""The land is changing, but I'm still remain the same. And my heart and my spirit remain the same. And I love my people. And I love my land.""",0

This comes two years after NOAA formed the panel, called the Advisory Committee for the Sustained National Climate Assessment, whose 15 members were tasked with advising government and private sector stakeholders on navigating climate change. ¶The National Climate Assessment, as the report on climate change is known, is supposed to be issued every four years, and the next one is expected next spring, according to the Post. ¶In the meantime, the administration is reviewing a report that could be key to the final assessment, which estimates that human activities are to blame for an increase in global temperature from 1951 to 2010.

Just over the international date line from America, it's one of the first countries in the world to see a new day and scientists say it'll be among the first to feel catastrophic effects of climate change.¶When I think about our shoot in Kiribati, one of the images that sticks in my mind was bumping along a rutted, dirt coastal road on an outer-lying island. We were in the back of an open truck (one of the few large vehicles on the island) with our camera equipment while most residents were riding bicycles or little mopeds or walking. Through the palm trees and tropical plants lining the road, we'd see the most stunning vistas and glimpse lives that seemed to be trapped in time. Folks live in simple huts with thatched roofs made from palm trees. We could see families cooking on open fires or drying coconut in the sun. Fisherman would be stitching together fishing nets. Most didn't have cars, running water or what we'd consider ""the basics.""¶Their ""carbon footprints"" are among the lowest in the world. These are not people who travel by air or drive gas-guzzling vehicles. For many, on this remote island in Kiribati, electricity is a luxury. They're not the big carbon polluters but they're the ones who'll be among the first to have their lives disrupted by climate change through rising sea levels and extreme weather.¶We met many folks who already had to leave homes as the seawater encroached and contaminated groundwater and crops or, in some cases, pulled homes into the ocean. Some told us how they've contemplated relocating. Kiribati purchased land in Fiji as a ""back-up"" plan in case huge numbers of people had to flee. ¶The water that we'd see at every turn was always changing colors. At points it was turquoise sea green, or sometimes a brilliant, deep purple. For generations in Kiribati the sea has been at the center of life, but now, that beautiful, stunning water threatens their very existence. ¶One man we interviewed told us that the idea of moving away from these islands was overwhelming. Here in Kiribati, he explained, nature had always provided what they needed: they could climb a tree and pick a coconut to eat or could pick up his fishing spear and catch dinner. ¶I've visited parts of the U.S., like New Orleans, where technology (and money) allows entire neighborhoods to exist below sea level. I've traveled around The Netherlands where a significant portion of its land mass would be below water were it not for advanced engineering. But those are places with money and resources. Kiribati's development index is one of the lowest in the world and fancy engineering is -- at least now -- out of reach. ¶While many in Kiribati are forced to deal with the possibilities of sea level rise, extreme weather exacerbated by climate change, they were not the ones who caused it.

At 61.89 degrees (16.63 Celsius), last month was behind July 2016's all-time record by .09 degrees.¶But Earth's land temperatures in July were the hottest on record at 59.96 degrees (15.5 Celsius), passing July 2016's by one-seventh of a degree.¶More in Climate Change¶Land measurements are important because that's where we live, said NOAA climate scientist Jake Crouch.¶Earlier this week, NASA calculated that July 2017 was a tad hotter than 2016, making it essentially a tie for all-time hottest month. NASA uses a newer set of ocean measurements and includes estimates for the Arctic unlike NOAA.¶Record heat was reported in Africa, Australia, parts of Asia, the Middle East and the Indian Ocean, Crouch said.¶""There is simply no denying the mounting evidence globally and regionally – the new climate normal is upon us now,"" said University of Oklahoma meteorology professor Jason Furtado, who wasn't part of the new report.¶Crouch said this heat is ""very strange"" because there is no El Niño spiking global temperatures, like in 2016.

"Fines for illegal pollution drop under Trump administration, study says","
","
August 10, 2017 / 8:15 PM
      / AP
    ","¶WASHINGTON -- Fines for illegal pollution have plummeted under President Trump, according to analysis by an environmental advocacy group.¶The Environmental Integrity Project looked at that civil penalties paid by polluters during the first six months under Mr. Trump. The group published an analysis Thursday that found penalties were less than half their levels under each of the past three presidents.¶The analysis found that Mr. Trump's Justice Department settled 26 civil cases against companies over environmental violations, totaling $12 million in penalties. That's a 60 percent drop on average from comparable time periods under presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush or Bill Clinton, even before adjustments for inflation.¶Besides reaching fewer settlements, the group said, environmental offenders also were required to perform less cleanup under Mr. Trump and make smaller reductions to future pollution.¶More in Climate Change¶A spokesman for the Justice Department said Thursday it continues to ""vigorously enforce"" environmental laws.¶The report's authors cautioned that six months represent only an eighth of a presidential term but said the early news is neither encouraging nor surprising. Mr. Trump and his Environmental Enforcement Agency chief, Scott Pruitt, have complained that federal regulations are often too onerous and stifle the growth of American businesses.¶""President Trump campaigned on a promise of 'law and order,' but apparently law enforcement for big polluters is not what he had in mind,"" Eric Schaeffer, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project, said in a statement. He previously served as director of EPA's civil enforcement office under both Clinton and Bush.¶""If this drop-off in environmental enforcement continues, it will leave more people breathing more air pollution or swimming in waterways with more waste,"" Schaeffer said.¶Under the first six months under Obama, the Justice Department brought 34 civil cases for violations of the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and other federal environmental laws, with polluters agreeing to pay $36 million in penalties. Bush logged 31 cases with $30 million in penalties, while Clinton accounted for 45 cases with $25 million in penalties.¶The group did not include settlements for pollution cleanups agreed to as part of the federal Superfund program, cases that can often drag on for decades.¶The comparison between presidential administrations is more stark when figures are adjusted for inflation. For example, the $25 million in civil penalties under Clinton in the first half of 1992 would equal more than $43.5 million in today's dollars.¶The Justice Department did not dispute the study's numbers, but a spokesman said figures for civil penalties do not tell the full story because they do not include fines from criminal prosecutions.¶""The department continues to vigorously enforce environmental laws to better protect the American people,"" said Mark Abueg, a public affairs specialist at Justice. ""For example, in just the last six months, (we) filed major new Clean Air Act litigation and obtained a $40 million criminal penalty in a vessel pollution case that safeguards the environment.""¶The $40 million fine Abueg cited was finalized in April as part of the sentencing of Princess Cruise Lines over the illegal dumping and concealment of oil-contaminated waste from its ships. However, the settlement, the largest ever in such a case, was actually negotiated under the Obama administration and announced in December -- the month before Mr. Trump took office -- as part of the company's guilty plea to felony crimes in federal court.

    ","¶Scientists are seeing a troubling consequence of rising carbon dioxide emissions: a decrease in the nutritional value of staple crops in the global diet.¶This drop in crops' key nutrients increases the risk for dietary deficiencies in the world's most vulnerable populations, according to a new study.¶Samuel Myers, a senior research scientist in the department of environmental health at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, studies the effect of human-caused carbon dioxide emissions on crops. ¶More in Climate Change¶He published a study in 2014 that found elevated levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere lower the concentration of key nutrients, including iron, zinc, and protein, in staple food crops like rice, wheat, and soybeans, among others.¶Myers' new research focuses on quantifying the potential real-world health effects of these findings. ¶The study, published online in Environmental Health Perspectives, estimates that if carbon dioxide levels continue to rise at their projected levels, the populations of 18 countries may lose more than 5 percent of their dietary protein by 2050. That would place an additional 150 million people at risk of protein deficiency due to elevated carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere.¶Across the globe, about 76 percent of the population gets most of their daily protein from plants. The findings pose the biggest challenges for Sub Saharan Africa, where millions of people are already protein deficient, and South Asian countries, including India, where rice and wheat make up a large portion of daily protein.¶""For you and I in North America eating a pretty diverse diet, we're probably getting well above the threshold of iron, zinc and protein in our diet,"" Myers told CBS News. ""But it turns out that there are billions of people in lower income countries who don't have really diverse diets and don't have access to animal sourced food rich in these nutrients and are getting the majority of their iron, zinc, and protein from crops. And many of these people are close to the threshold.""¶The researchers estimate that India alone will lose 5.3 percent of the total protein in its diet, placing an additional 53 million people at risk for iron deficiency.¶Myers says the findings highlight the moral and ethical need to address climate change.¶""It's almost entirely people in wealthier parts of the world who have much higher carbon footprints and if you look at who's most vulnerable to these health effects, it's overwhelmingly poorer populations in low-income countries,"" he said. ""There's a real disconnect where the habits of the wealthy world are putting the poor in harm's way.""¶To arrive at their estimates, the researchers combined data from their experiments on the effects of carbon dioxide emissions on the nutritional value of crops with global dietary information from the United Nations and measures of income inequality and demographics.¶The study was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and by the Winslow Foundation.¶A companion study, which Myers co-authored and was also published this week, found that reductions in iron in staple food crops due to excess carbon dioxide emissions will likely exacerbate the already growing problem of iron deficiency. Specifically, 354 million children under the age of 5 and more than 1 billion women of childbearing age – mostly in South Asia and North Africa – are expected to lose nearly 4 percent of dietary iron as a direct result of elevated carbon dioxide levels.¶Finally, the researchers also point to their 2015 study, which showed rising carbon dioxide emissions are also likely to cause roughly 200 million people to become zinc deficient.¶Myers notes that these estimates are conservative and do not include the people who are already deficient protein, iron, and zinc.¶The researchers offer several strategies to help maintain adequate nutritional diets in the most vulnerable populations, such as supporting more diverse diets, enriching the nutritional content of staple crops, and breeding crops less sensitive to the effects of carbon dioxide.¶""Of course the most fundamental thing that can be done is to stop dumping so much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere,"" Myers said, ""but short of keeping carbon dioxide levels from rising, we're going to be forced to try these other nutritional interventions.""",0

He's also made two movies on the subject: ""An Inconvenient Truth"" in 2006 and this year's ""An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power.""¶Gore said the Pentagon has ""for a long time through several administrations"" warned climate change was a national security issue, in part because it affects scarce resources and refugee flows in places like the Middle East. He gave the example of the turmoil in Syria. ¶""Some regions are in danger of becoming literally unlivable with increasing temperatures and humidity. Humidity worldwide has gone up 5 percent just in the last 30 years because of all the evaporation off the oceans. And the desertification and extended drought in the eastern Mediterranean is linked by the scientists to the multi-sided civil war in Syria,"" Gore said. ""Other causes as well, but long before that civil war started, this climate-related drought destroyed 60 percent of their farms, killed 80 percent of their livestock, drove 1.5 million refugees into the cities. And the Syrian ministers were saying on WikiLeaks, 'This is going to cause an explosion. We can't handle this.' And that was before the gates of hell opened in Syria.""¶Pandemic diseases related to shifting climate conditions can also threaten national security, Gore added. ¶""In Latin America last year, for first time ever, doctors were telling women don't get pregnant for two years in some regions of Central and South American because of the Zika virus. These mosquitoes bite more often when the weather goes up. They reproduce more actively. The virus incubates more quickly in the mosquito,"" Gore said. ¶There are a series of tropical diseases moving into regions where people have not developed immunities, he added. ¶""It's the travel revolution and air travel has had something to do with it, for sure, but the climate shifts have changed the regions where these viruses and other microbial diseases are taking hold. It's also a threat to food security and water scarcity,"" Gore said.¶Other climate-related national security issues include threats to military infrastructure, enhanced economic rivalries and increased likelihood of natural disasters. In the past decade, Gore said extreme weather has become ""way more common."" ¶""Superstorm Sandy here flooded the… 9/11 site, for example. We have these rain bombs all over the country, all over the world. Seven inches in a couple of hours in Florida yesterday,"" Gore said. ¶Despite President Trump withdrawing from the Paris climate accord in June, Gore pointed to others who have ""doubled down"" on their commitments to combating climate change.  ¶""All around the world, we're seeing an illustration of the old maxim, for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction. The reaction to what Donald Trump is doing has been very strong. There's a huge upsurge in activism to try to solve the climate crisis,"" Gore said. ""Listen. This is for real. Our kids are depending upon us. We're feeling the effects of it now. We've got to get over this phony kind of discussion, 'Is this real?' Of course it's real.

"""Ghost forests"": What they are and why they’re becoming more common","

Updated on:  August 1, 2017 / 5:50 PM
      / AP
    ","¶PORT REPUBLIC, N.J. -- They're called ""ghost forests"" - dead trees along vast swaths of coastline invaded by rising seas, something scientists call one of the most visible markers of climate change. ¶The process has occurred naturally for thousands of years, but has accelerated in recent decades as polar ice melts and raises sea levels, scientists say, pushing salt water farther inland and killing trees in what used to be thriving freshwater plains. ¶Efforts are underway worldwide to determine exactly how quickly the creation of ghost forests is increasing. But scientists agree the startling sight of dead trees in once-healthy areas is an easy-to-grasp example of the consequences of climate change. ¶""I think ghost forests are the most obvious indicator of climate change anywhere on the Eastern coast of the U.S.,"" said Matthew Kirwan, a professor at Virginia Institute of Marine Science who is studying ghost forests in his state and Maryland. ""It was dry, usable land 50 years ago; now it's marshes with dead stumps and dead trees."" ¶More in Climate Change¶It is happening around the world, but researchers say new ghost forests are particularly apparent in North America, with hundreds of thousands of acres of salt-killed trees stretching from Canada down the East Coast, around Florida and over to Texas. ¶The intruding salt water changes coastal ecosystems, creating marshes where forests used to be. This has numerous effects on the environment, though many scientists caution against viewing them in terms of ""good"" or ""bad."" What benefits one species or ecosystem might harm another one, they say. ¶For instance, migratory birds that rely on coastal forests have less habitat. And the death of the trees makes soil microbes release nitrogen, which adds to nitrogen already occurring from other sources, including agricultural runoff, to contribute to algae blooms and reduced oxygen that can sicken or kill fish. ¶But the conversion of forest into marshland produces ""extremely productive"" wetlands that feed and shelter fish and shellfish. ¶The Atlantic croaker fish, for instance, was rare 15 years ago in southern New Jersey waters but now is abundant, said Ken Able, a Rutgers University professor. ¶""There is a lot of change going on,"" said Greg Noe, a research ecologist with the U.S. Geological Survey. ""It's dramatic and it's changing faster than it has before in human history."" ¶Quantifying the rate of increase in ghost forests is a major focus of Able's research. Some scientists say the increase began around the time of the Industrial Revolution, while others say the speedup began more recently than that. ¶In the past 100 years, Kirwan said, 100,000 acres of forest in the Chesapeake Bay has converted to marshland. Photographs show the rate of coastal forest loss is four times greater now than it was during the 1930s, he said. ¶Seas off the East Coast have risen by 1.3 feet over the last 100 years, said Ben Horton, a Rutgers University professor and expert on sea level rise. That is a faster pace than for the past 2,000 years combined, he said. ¶Some of the most dramatic anecdotal evidence of the acceleration in ghost forest creation is along the Savannah River between Georgia and South Carolina, Noe said. ¶When his team first got there 10 years ago, ""it looked like the trees were under a little stress, but they were all alive,"" he said. ""But five years later, the vast majority of them were dead. That happened right in front of our eyes, much faster than we expected."" ¶Marcelo Ardon, a biology professor at North Carolina State University, studied one site called the Palmetto Pear Tree Preserve on Albemarle Sound in North Carolina from 2006 to 2009. When he returned in 2016, he said, ""what used to look like a healthy cypress swamp, now the trees are dead and the water level is a lot higher. The place has completely changed. I've checked overhead satellite photos and you can see the trees dying."" ¶In southern New Jersey, the most affected species is the Atlantic white cedar, which was a mainstay of the shipbuilding industry because of its resistance to rot. Farther south, cypress, loblolly pines and Eastern red cedar are dying. ¶Large storms can drive salt water further inland and kill trees; 2012's Superstorm Sandy is believed to have led to the deaths of some trees in southern New Jersey, Able said. ¶The difference, Kirwan said, is that in the past, flooded areas would dry out before salt water killed most of the trees. ¶""That same storm 100 years ago would also have killed trees,"" he said. ""But 100 years ago that same land wouldn't have been so wet that new trees couldn't get established and replace the dead ones. That's a big part of where sea level rise comes in."" ",0
"Farmer suicides rise in India as climate warms, study shows","
","
July 31, 2017 / 8:08 PM
      / AP
    ","¶NEW DELHI -- When Rani's husband died by drinking pesticide, he left the family in debt. But even if they could pay off the loans, Rani said their farming days are over.¶""There are no rains,"" said the 44-year-old woman from drought-stricken Tamil Nadu, one of hundreds of farmers protesting in the capital for more government support. ""Even for drinking, we get water only once in 10 days.""¶A new study suggests that India will see more tragedies as climate change brings hotter temperatures that damage crops and exacerbate drought. For every 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming above 20 degrees C (68 degrees F) during the growing season in India, there are 67 more suicides on average, according to the findings published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, or PNAS.¶The message ""is that farming is an inherently risky occupation, with annual incomes often held hostage to the weather, and it's getting riskier in the era of climate change,"" said Vikram Patel, an Indian psychiatrist and mental health expert with Harvard Medical School in Boston who was not involved in the study.¶Experts said the study's findings should raise alarms, especially with India's average temperatures expected to rise another 3 degrees C (5.4 degrees F) by 2050. That will bring more erratic weather events, more drought and stronger storms.¶More in Climate Change¶""Anything that will affect occupational stability is going to affect farmers' mental health,"" Patel said.¶Farming has always been considered a high-risk profession, and a single damaged harvest can drive some to desperation. With agriculture supporting more than half of India's 1.3 billion people, farmers have long been seen as the heart and soul of the country. But they've also seen their economic clout diminish over the last three decades. Once accounting for a third of India's gross domestic product, they now contribute only 15 percent of India's $2.26 billion economy.¶There are many factors that can contribute to suicide, including poor crop yields, financial devastation or debt, access to easy methods of self-harm, or a lack of community support. In India, many farmers will drink toxic pesticides as a way out of backbreaking debt, with the government in some cases guaranteeing monetary aid to their surviving families. That provides a perverse incentive for suicide, ""rewarding people who end their lives by paying family compensation, but only if they die,"" Patel said.¶""We may not be able to stop the world from warming, but that doesn't mean we can't do something to address suicide,"" including providing more financial stability and paying more attention to mental health, he said.¶The study released Monday should make those efforts even more urgent, experts said.¶""It provides evidence for a causal pathway -- from unfavorable weather to poor crop yields to rural misery to increased suicide,"" said Dr. Howard Frumkin, a University of Washington environmental health professor who was not involved in the study. ""With climate change bringing increasingly chaotic weather in many places, this causal pathway is likely to intensify.""¶India's farmers are already hit regularly by strong storms, extreme drought, heat waves and other extreme weather events. Some still rely on natural rainfall to water their crops. Scientists have shown that extreme weather events are already increasing as the planet warms.¶For the study, researcher Tamma Carleton looked at suicide data from India's National Crime Records Bureau between 1967 and 2013, along with data on agricultural crop yields and on temperature change.¶""I estimate that warming temperature trends over the last three decades have already been responsible for over 59,000 suicides throughout India,"" writes Carleton, who studies agriculture and resource economics at the University of California, Berkeley. In other words, warmer temperatures were a factor accounting for a 6.8 percent increase in suicides, the study says.¶She noted limitations in the study, including an inability to differentiate between urban and rural suicides because the crime records bureau only began classifying farmer suicides in 1995. Other experts also noted that the actual number of suicides may be higher than the crime database counted, but said these concerns were unlikely to undermine the study's core findings.¶India's farmers, often complaining about being ignored, hold frequent protests to demand better crop prices, more loan waivers and even water delivery systems to guarantee irrigation during dry spells. Sometimes, they stage sit-ins or dump truckloads of vegetables onto highways to disrupt traffic.¶For the past month, hundreds of farmers -- some carrying human skulls they say are from farmers who committed suicide in the drought-stricken southern state of Tamil Nadu -- have been staging what they say will be a 100-day protest in a central New Delhi square to ""prevent the suicide of farmers who feed the nation.""¶The government recently introduced legislation to subsidize a crop insurance scheme aimed at reducing some of the financial risk faced by farmers who take out loans to buy seeds and agrochemicals. But experts note there is almost no discussion about mental health as it relates to India's farming community, with agricultural debt and crop failure still considered political issues.¶Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh told lawmakers Thursday there were 11,458 farmer suicides in 2016 -- the lowest number in two decades. It was also a year of mild temperatures and normal monsoon rains.¶He acknowledged that the number of farmer suicides had gone up by about 9 percent in each of the previous two years, both of which were marred by drought. The crime bureau found that 58 percent of the 12,602 farmer suicides in 2015 were driven by bankruptcy, indebtedness and other farming-related issues. Most of the victims were marginal cultivators or small farm holders with less than 2 hectares (5 acres) of land.¶""Suicides occur due to extreme economic despair,"" said M.S. Swaminathan, a geneticist whose work on high-yield rice and wheat crops helped drive India's Green Revolution in the 1960s. His research in the late 1980s found that a 1 degree C (1.8 degree F) temperature rise reduced a crop's duration by about one week, causing losses in the overall weight of harvest. His foundation works to find farming solutions not only to rising heat, but also to drought or salinity from coastal sea rise. Given these growing risks, he said, government policy has a large role to play.¶""Suitable crop insurance and a prompt compensation of losses due to climate-related factors will help to avoid a sense of hopelessness that leads to suicide,"" Swaminathan said.",0
Air pollution deaths expected to rise because of climate change,"
","
July 31, 2017 / 5:32 PM
      / CBS News
    ","¶New research predicts that air pollution worsened by climate change will cost tens of thousands of lives if changes are not made.¶The study, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, estimates that if current trends continue, climate change will be responsible for another 60,000 air pollution-related deaths globally in the year 2030. By 2100, that number could jump to 260,000. ¶Previous research has found that some 5.5 million people worldwide already die prematurely due to air pollution.¶The authors say this is the most comprehensive study to date on how climate change will affect health as a result of exacerbating air pollution. The research incorporates results from several of the world's top climate change modeling groups in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Japan and New Zealand.¶More in Climate Change¶Hotter temperatures ""can speed up the reaction rate of air pollutants that form in the atmosphere,"" lead study author Jason West, an associate professor of environmental sciences and engineering in the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, told CBS News. ""Places that by and large get drier from climate change would be expected to increase air pollution concentrations.""¶The study estimates that climate change is expected to increase air pollution-related deaths globally and in all regions except for Africa.¶""Air pollution affects things like heart attacks, stroke, cardiopulmonary disease, and lung cancer,"" he said. ""So because air pollution affects those causes it has a big effect on health.""¶The researchers emphasize that a concerted effort to slow down climate change could make a big difference for our future. The U.S. commitment to such efforts was thrown into question when President Trump withdrew from the Paris climate accord in June. That agreement, signed by more than 190 other countries, aims to reduce carbon emissions, which scientists say have been fueling global warming.¶""Reducing greenhouse gas emissions has a really big benefit for air pollution and therefore for human health,"" West said.¶In addition to increasing air pollution deaths, climate change is also expected to have a growing impact on health through rising rates of heat stress, the wider spread of infectious diseases, and reduced access to clean water and food.",0
Icebreaker sets record for earliest transit of the Northwest Passage,"
","
Updated on:  July 29, 2017 / 5:59 PM
      / AP
    ","¶NUUK, Greenland -- After 24 days at sea and a journey spanning more than 6,214 miles, the Finnish icebreaker MSV Nordica has set a new record for the earliest transit of the fabled Northwest Passage. ¶The once-forbidding route through the Arctic, linking the Pacific and the Atlantic oceans, has been opening up sooner and for a longer period each summer due to climate change. Sea ice that foiled famous explorers and blocked the passage to all but the hardiest ships has slowly been melting away in one of the most visible effects of man-made global warming. ¶Records kept by Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans show that the previous earliest passage of the season happened in 2008, when the Canadian Coast Guard ship Louis L. St-Laurent left St. John's in Newfoundland on July 5 and arrived in the Beaufort Sea off Point Barrow on July 30. ¶The Nordica, with a team of researchers and Associated Press journalists on board, completed a longer transit in less time -- albeit in the opposite direction -- setting off from Vancouver on July 5 and reaching Nuuk, the capital of Greenland, on July 29. ¶While the icebreaker encountered Chinese cargo vessels, Alaskan fishing boats and a German cruise ship in the Pacific, upon entering the Canadian Archipelago, the Nordica traveled alone. Radar indicated the presence of the U.S. Coast Guard cutter Sherman near Point Barrow; along the coast an occasional collection of houses revealed evidence of human settlement in the far north. ¶More in Climate Change¶For the most part, the ship's only companions were Arctic sea birds, seals and the occasional whale, until two-thirds of the way through the voyage, as Nordica was plowing through sea ice in Victoria Strait, a crew member sighted a polar bear. ¶These animals have come to symbolize the threat posed to Arctic wildlife by climate change because the sea ice they depend on for hunting is disappearing a bit more each year. Scientists predict the Northwest Passage will be largely ice free in the summer by 2050 if current levels of warming continue. ¶For now, the passage remains a challenge for conventional ships and efforts are being made to prevent frozen waterways that the local Inuit population depends on for travel from being opened up. Yet tourism and other forms of economic development are already under way. ¶As Nordica sailed through Baffin Bay, the far corner of the North Atlantic that separates Canada and Greenland, it passed cargo ships lining up in the distance. They were preparing to pick up iron ore from a mine on Baffin Island that's expected to operate for decades to come. ¶On July 26, 1845, an expedition to find the Northwest Passage led by British explorer John Franklin was last sighted off Baffin Island. The expedition never made it. Trapped by sea ice, Franklin and his men perished from cold, illness and starvation. Their two ships were found in 2014 and 2016, not far from where Nordica sighted its first polar bear.",0

            Former VP Al Gore on environmentalism, Trump, and the climate crisis - full, extended transcript - CBS News
    ",CBS News,"July 17, 2017, 10:06 AM","¶In this expanded transcript of his interview with correspondent Lee Cowan, former Vice President Al Gore talks about how he came to preach the dangers of the climate crisis; his new film, ""An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power""; and of training people to speak out for solutions as carbon polluters and their lobbyists ratchet up their efforts to spread disinformation. He also discusses his (unsuccessful) efforts to persuade President Trump to keep the United States within the framework of the Paris Climate Agreement.        ¶LEE COWAN: Let's talk about the obvious, which is the Paris Climate Accord. I mean, what do you think is the practical implication of us pulling out? I mean, have we ceded, in some ways, our leadership on climate control by doing that?¶AL GORE:  Well, traditionally the United States has been the natural leader of the world. That's not just pride as an American speaking; it's just the reality. And so without the U.S. being involved, it's hard for the world community to move forward as effectively. However, the backlash and reaction to President Trump's decision has really brought the rest of the world more firmly behind the Paris Agreement.¶LEE COWAN:  It's galvanized a lot of people. ¶AL GORE:  It's galvanized the rest of the world. And it's galvanized a lot of states, and cities, and business leaders here in the U.S. So one of the big fears was that if he pulled out it would give an excuse for other countries like India, for example, to pull out also. But instead it has actually galvanized a lot of these other countries to say, ""Well, we'll show him. We're gonna even more!"" India's just announced within the last couple weeks that within 13 years 100% of all their cars have to be electric vehicles. That's amazing! And they're canceling all these coal plants and ramping up on the solar, and that's happening in lots of places now.¶LEE COWAN: So it's almost like pulling out [gave] impetus to change that you talk about -- that sometimes you really need a jolt to something. ¶AL GORE: Yeah, I think so. There's always a risk of being Pollyannaish on some of these things. But honestly, that is the way it looks now. The rest of the world is expressing determination to go even farther even faster, and that's a really good thing. Those who were worried the U.S. would be isolated, there are some dangers there. But it's really the president who's more isolated now in the aftermath of this. At least that's what it looks like to me.¶LEE COWAN: On the international front, can you compartmentalize this decision, or is there still going to be some collateral damage on other issues as a result?¶AL GORE: There could well be because the decision was made immediately after President Trump also damaged the cohesion of the NATO alliance by declining to reaffirm our obligations to come to the defense of our European allies. And so those and other things taken together could complicate the ability of the U.S. to get cooperation from some of these other countries on matters of top priority to us.¶LEE COWAN: So it's not just climate that could be affected? ¶AL GORE: That's the way I see it. But the rest of the world, like many of us here in the U.S., are kind of looking at President Trump -- and I know some people are really still all for him and everything -- but the majority are trying to make sense of how this presidency is unfolding. And I think the rest of the world's doing the same thing, and so they may not put the full blame on our country as a whole. They recognize we're going through a tough stretch here.¶LEE COWAN: I know you've been asked this before, but if so [much] of what was decided in Paris was voluntary, why did we need the accord in the first place? And if a lot of these states and businesses step up here to do this on their own despite what the White House does, why was the Paris Accord so important?¶AL GORE: Well, it was really and truly an historic breakthrough. And your question's a great one, but it has a real clear answer: When the entire world came together and expressed a common determination to reduce the net greenhouse gas emissions to zero as early in the second half of this century as possible, what that did was send a really powerful signal, not just to governments who had signed the pledges, but to businesses and industries and investors. And as a result it's like the train's leaving the station and everybody's on board. ""You're on the platform. Do you wanna be left behind or not?""¶And most people said, ""Yeah, we wanna be on that train. If the whole world is moving in this direction, let's do it together."" And here in this country there's this big group saying, ""We're still in the Paris Agreement,"" and it includes California, New York, and the state of Washington, Connecticut, Hawaii. You can go right down the list, and all these cities including the big metropolis of Atlanta has just signed up to be 100% renewable as quick as they can get there. And business leaders, you know? There's a huge, impressive list of businesses that are saying, ""We are in the Paris Agreement. We're going to meet and exceed these commitments.""¶LEE COWAN: On that point, though, the president has made an economic argument, that there just isn't room, essentially, in the economy to be sustainable and at the same time provide jobs. And a lot of his base believes that.¶AL GORE: Well, the business community does not believe that at all. And even a lot of people in his base don't believe it -- a majority of Trump's voters were in favor of staying in the Paris Agreement. And if you look at what's really happening in the economy, the economic argument actually is very strongly in favor of the Paris Agreement. There are now twice as many jobs in the solar industry as in the coal industry. Solar jobs are growing 17 times faster than other jobs in the U.S.¶LEE COWAN: Seventeen times?¶AL GORE: It's one of the brightest spots in our economic revival. And the single fastest-growing job over the next ten years, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, is wind turbine technician. And if you take the efficiency jobs and the renewable energy jobs and add them together, they're significantly more numerous now than all of the jobs in fossil energy. Fossil jobs are declining while the renewable jobs are growing fasters than other jobs.¶LEE COWAN: It seems like [Trump] in some ways wants a return to the 19th century in terms of some of these jobs that really just don't seem like they're there anymore, at least not viable for very long.¶AL GORE: Yeah. And in coal country he found a base of support from people who'd been hurt by trends that started decades ago: the mechanization of coal mining, and then natural gas, and now renewables really eliminating the market for coal. The global coal industry has lost most of its market capitalization over the last decades. And those jobs are really not coming back. I know some people don't like to hear that, but I've always supported a really robust retraining program, reemployment program with better wages and better jobs, healthier jobs. But he has reached out to some people who understandably are very upset over the economic trends in Appalachia, for example. And he's basically promised to recreate the 19th century.¶LEE COWAN: When you talk about his base, though, one of the things you bring up in the movie is the town in Texas that is about as red as you're gonna get, reddest county in the reddest state, and that's an example of people who, despite their conservative leanings, still get it, or are getting it from an economic standpoint if nothing else, right?¶AL GORE: Yeah. People who are really connected to what's really happening on the ground understand that this is an historic transition. For example, there's a big coal museum. It just switched over to solar energy.¶LEE COWAN: The coal museum?¶AL GORE: The coal museum, absolutely! Because it's cheaper. And Georgetown, Texas -- an oil state -- one of the most conservative Republican cities in the country, they just completed a transition to 100% renewable energy because it's cheaper than fossil fuels. ¶One of the great developments is that solar energy, wind energy, a lot of the other renewable technologies turn out to respond to research and development, and scaling in the same way that computer chips did, and cell phones, and flat screen TVs. It keeps on getting cheaper, and cheaper, and cheaper. And now in a growing number of regions and countries, it's significantly cheaper than electricity from burning fossil fuels. And so people are saying, ""Hey, let's go for that.""¶LEE COWAN: That has to make your argument easier, because you can show the cost-benefit relationship, which even ten years ago was a little harder argument to make, perhaps?¶AL GORE: Yeah, it's true. I look back at where the facts and figures were ten, 11 years ago and the curve on solar energy was just beginning to start moving up. Now it's way up here and it's just a completely new world. We're seeing a dramatic transformation all around the world. The sustainability revolution, which includes renewable energy, electric cars, efficiency, it has the scope and magnitude of the Industrial Revolution. But it has the speed of the Digital Revolution, and it's happening in rich and poor countries simultaneously, all over the world. It's really great. We can move faster with better policies, and we need to move faster. But we're gonna win this regardless.¶LEE COWAN: When you met with the president-elect at Trump Tower -- and I know you don't want to go into the specifics of the meeting -- did you find him receptive, Mr. Trump, to your argument?¶AL GORE: I found him attentive, and you can misinterpret that for being receptive. And I think he's probably pretty good at that as a businessman. But yes, I did think that there was a real chance that he would come to his senses on this.¶LEE COWAN: You thought you might have gotten through to him?¶AL GORE: Yeah, I did. And by the way, that was not the only conversation. My communication with him continued and I have respected the confidentiality of it. But no, I actually thought there was a better-than-even chance that he would end up staying in Paris. But let me point out one salient fact here: Under his decision, legally the U.S. cannot leave the Paris Agreement until November 4th, 2020, which happens to be the day after the next presidential election.¶And if there's a new president who wants to go back into Paris it just requires 30 days' notice. So the net effect of President Trump's decision will be discouraging for a lot of people, but as a practical matter --¶LEE COWAN: Nothing changes?¶AL GORE: Well, some things do, but the overall thrust of this sustainability revolution's going to continue. Towns, cities, states, businesses, they're going with the flow, which is cheaper renewable electricity. And the rest of the world is even speeding up.¶LEE COWAN: In those conversations with Mr. Trump did you get the sense that he understood climate change? Does he understand the scope of the problem?¶AL GORE: Well, you'd have to ask him that. I don't want to get into the details of what he said to me. I just focused on one thing, and that is trying to get him to stay in the Paris Agreement, and I didn't succeed on that part of it. (laughs) But I think that the larger battle is one that we are gonna win.¶LEE COWAN: You've spent half your life in politics, some of it at the highest levels.¶AL GORE: Second-highest level.¶LEE COWAN: Second highest-level, (laughs) excuse me, Mr. Vice President, that's right. But what do you make of this young administration so far? ¶AL GORE: Oh, (sighs) yeah --¶LEE COWAN: It's hard to do a blanket statement. But --¶AL GORE: Yeah, it's -- it's -- it's --¶LEE COWAN: You've seen it from inside --¶AL GORE: -- a challenging time for our country. And I say that with respect for those who are enthusiastic members of the base, still supporting President Trump. But I was talking to a Republican senator this morning, one who's a close friend of mine, and I heard from him what I hear from quite a few of them, that they're really concerned. And of course the Democrats are on the warpath. But there are more and more Republicans in the House and Senate who are wondering how they're going to manage to separate from him in the midterm elections.¶But the politics are the least important part of it. What's really important is how our country gets through this period, because nothing's getting done in Washington. Every day it's another set of tweets and another set of controversies. And they're not getting anything done.¶LEE COWAN: But do you get the sense that climate change is getting lost in all of this fervor over whether it's Russian hacking, or whatever it is? Does it feel like [climate] is getting pushed further down the --?¶AL GORE: I really don't think so, because there's a law of physics: For every action there's an equal and opposite reaction. And sometimes that shows up in politics and society. And I think that the reaction to President Trump's decision on the Paris Agreement has been much stronger than I had even hoped for. And the determination being expressed by so many people in state governments, city governments, in the business community, the investor community, is really heartening to me. I think there is an excellent chance that the United States will meet and possibly exceed the commitments made by former President Obama in Paris, regardless of what President Trump does.¶LEE COWAN: Back to the economic argument, you mention in the movie that there are a lot of people who recognize the power of solar and wind technologies, but there are those who don't think that they'll really ever lead the energy sector economically. And you've called that essentially a different form of denial.¶AL GORE: It is a new form of denial.¶LEE COWAN: Because?¶AL GORE: There's an investigation underway right now by some of our state attorneys general, including the attorney general of the State of New York, Eric Schneiderman. And they have found evidence, they say, that the internal deliberations of some of the large carbon polluters have led them to mount a campaign to mislead people into thinking that solar and wind is not going to amount to much. ¶But again, if you look at the economic facts, last year you add up all of the new electricity generating facilities built in the United States last year, three quarters of them are wind and solar. Virtually none of them are coal. There's a little sliver of less than a tenth of a percent. About a quarter of it is natural gas, but now solar electricity is getting cheaper than electricity from gas.¶LEE COWAN: So where do you think we are now? What's changed since the original ""Inconvenient Truth"" and now? Where does the debate on climate change sit, do you think?¶AL GORE: Over the last decade there have been a lot of changes, but the two biggest changes are, number one, the economics of renewable energy, solar and wind particularly, and battery storage, and electric vehicles, a lot of other things. The economics have changed radically and now it's becoming cheaper than fossil fuel-based energy in more and more places, and that's going to continue. That's the first big change. The second big change is that over the last decade it's no longer just the virtually unanimous scientific community telling us we've gotta change, now Mother Nature has entered the debate. In the last seven years we've had 11 ""One-in-1,000-year"" downpours in the U.S. We have these floods, and droughts, and sea level rise events, and the melting ice, and tropical diseases. Every night now on the television news is like a nature hike through the book of Revelation. And even if some of the newscasters don't connect the dots, people themselves are. People who don't want to use the phrase ""global warming"" or ""climate crisis"" are saying, ""Wait a minute. Something's going on here that's not right."" ¶And so Mother Nature is persuading a lot of people who weren't ready to believe what the scientists were saying.¶LEE COWAN: So what was your biggest obstacle ten years ago to making this argument, and what's the biggest obstacle now? Has it changed?¶AL GORE: I have felt for a long time that the pathway to solving the climate crisis is through the building of a massive grassroots army of men and women who will go out there and win the conversation on climate, and persuade businesses, and universities, and towns to switch to renewable energy and to reduce emissions. And the big change from ten years ago is that people are way more receptive, not only to the message that we have to act, not only to the message that now we can act, we have the solutions now -- that's the biggest change -- but also willing to make a commitment that we will act. There's a real determination out there to make this happen. They know we owe it to our kids and the generations to come, but they're also seeing that the impact is affecting us right now.¶LEE COWAN: It's still largely in your mind, though, a moral imperative to fix this. This isn't a political debate. ¶AL GORE: I don't think it ever should have been a political issue. After the great recession and when Barack Obama's time in office began in January of '09, that's when the Tea Party movement launched, that's when the Citizens United Supreme Court decision took effect and freed up this flow of anonymous dark money, a lot of it from the carbon polluters, into the political system.¶The carbon polluters have taken the playbook from the tobacco companies. We're here on the site of an old tobacco barn. I know a lot about it. And back when the surgeon general came out and reported that the doctors and scientists had found out that smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer and other diseases, the tobacco companies hired actors and dressed 'em up as doctors, put 'em in front of the camera with a script to say, ""I am a doctor and you don't have to worry about smoking. I do it myself, it's fine."" And the large carbon polluters have actually hired a lot of the same PR people that did that work for the tobacco companies.¶And that really got cranked up at the beginning of Obama's term. And they polarized the debate, and then the Koch brothers and others came in and basically threatened to run primary opponents against any Republican who expressed the view that, ""Yeah, we oughta do something to save the climate balance."" And so they all mostly got scared and stayed silent on it.¶LEE COWAN: But if there's that much money, how do you battle that kind of money and that kind of influence?¶AL GORE: Well, we have a lot of help. Mother Nature has weighed in with these climate-related extreme weather events that have really changed a lot of minds. And perhaps most significantly, the technology and business experts have now developed the solutions to the point where they're available and often cheaper than the old dirty polluting fuels. So we're winning this debate, we're winning this struggle. We're going to solve the climate crisis.¶The only remaining challenge is winning it in time, because every day we put another 110 million tons of global warming pollution into the sky as if it's an open sewer, and it's still building up. And the scientists tell us it's a race against time. We've stabilized emissions globally now for the last three years, but they need to start coming down quickly. We've got the momentum, we've got the wind in our sails, we're gonna win this.¶LEE COWAN: And that's why you're so optimistic? People would look at some of the examples in the movie, how all these different climate events have gotten worse, and worse, and worse, the death toll, everything. And yet the movie comes out with a very hopeful message that we are gonna fix this.¶AL GORE: Well, the movie is unstinting in presenting the latest scientific evidence for why we really have to act urgently, but it also is devoted to showing the new facts on the ground that we now have the solutions. We can fix this.¶LEE COWAN: Which you didn't ten years ago?¶AL GORE: Well, there were some in the first movie, but honestly the new technologies were just beginning to be developed then to the point where they were ready for primetime. Now in a relatively short ten, 11 years they've become available. ¶I see this climate movement as being in the tradition of the other great moral causes that humanity has encountered. The Civil Rights Movement, which I watched from the vantage point here in Tennessee when I was a kid; the abolition movement 150, almost 200 years ago; the Women's Suffrage movement; the Women's Rights movement; the anti-apartheid movement; more recently the gay rights movement. All of them shared common characteristics. They all were aimed at reaching goals that the majority of people said were impossible to reach. In South Africa Nelson Mandela said, ""It's always impossible until it's done.""¶But in every one of these previous movements, finally the underbrush was cleared away and it became a simple choice between what's right and what's wrong. And once that happens, the outcome is foreordained. A great economist, Rudi Dornbusch, once said, ""Things take longer to happen than you think they will, and then they happen much faster than you thought they could.""¶LEE COWAN: And that's where we are now, you think?¶AL GORE: That's where we are now. We're right at that tipping point. The percentage of people in the U.S. who support this, solving the climate crisis, is back up close to the levels it was after the first movie. And we're seeing now Republican members of Congress begin to switch sides. There's a new caucus on climate solutions in the House of Representatives that has quite a few Republicans that have just joined. There are about ten Republican senators -- three already have switched, there are about ten more that are on the verge of switching. So we're going to have a working majority fairly soon.¶LEE COWAN: The first movie made a lot of money, a lot of people saw it. How much impact do you think ""An Inconvenient Truth"" had on the debate itself?¶AL GORE: Well, based on what people come up and tell me about the impact it had on their individual life choices, I'm tempted to say it had a big impact. There are also a lot of social science studies that show that it really pushed the support for solving the climate crisis to the highest levels ever. And it remained bipartisan for years after the movie came out, until the new Supreme Court decision on Citizens United unleashed this flow of dark money from the carbon polluters, and it became an artificially partisan issue on the other side of the aisle.¶But I think the overall impact of the first movie was certainly positive, and I think that's the reason why for the last ten years so many people come up and said, ""When are you gonna make another movie? We need another movie."" ¶LEE COWAN: That said, though, you weren't all that happy about trying to do a sequel at first, right?¶AL GORE: I really wasn't because I have to admit to you that I didn't think the first movie was a good idea. That's just how little I know about the movie industry. (laughs) ¶LEE COWAN: Why didn't you think that was gonna be a good idea?¶AL GORE: Well, it's kind of a silly reason. Back when I was a student I tried to take a shortcut on Shakespeare by getting these videotapes where they set up a camera looking at a stage presentation of Shakespeare's plays, and I thought that'd be a faster way to do a study. And I thought it was just terrible because translating from one medium to another didn't always work. And I foolishly thought that the same thing would happen if they tried to take my slideshow and make it into a movie.¶What I didn't understand was that there's a lotta talent in Hollywood (laughs) behind the camera: the directors, the producers, I mean, they know how to tell a story in ways that I would never be able to do in a million years. ¶And when the second proposal came around I had another flawed assumption, that it might come off as if I was trying to tell the same story all over again. But instead, the directors of this movie, Bonni Cohen and Jon Shenk, took a completely different approach with what they call cinéma vérité. They just followed me around for two years, and human nature being what it is, you forget that they're always there if they're with you all the time. And when they showed me their first rough cut of the movie I was shocked at a lot of the scenes that they captured.  I had completely forgotten they were there! And of course, some of the things are so emotionally engaging I didn't have any spare attention left over to remember that they were filming. And people who haven't been through that experience find it hard to believe, but trust me, it works that way. If you have somebody follow you around with a camera for two years you just naturally tend to forget they're there.¶LEE COWAN: It didn't get annoying? Didn't get cumbersome? ¶AL GORE: Almost never, almost never. Inevitably, there were a few meetings and scenes where the person I was meeting with wasn't cool with having a camera come in. But with those few exceptions, no, we became great friends during the process, so that made it easy and fun.¶LEE COWAN: So as serious a topic as this is you've gotta be having fun with this. I mean, you're going to Sundance, you're going to Cannes. I mean, you're a movie star in a lotta respects.¶AL GORE: Come on, I'm-- no, no, no, I'm not-- I'm not--¶LEE COWAN: No, you really are. It's you and Wonder Woman this summer. (laughs) ¶AL GORE: Yeah, right. (laughs) ¶LEE COWAN: But I mean, that has a lot power with it, and a lot of responsibility, I guess, that comes with that notoriety.¶AL GORE: Well, if I had the power, I would've asked them to take some of the scenes out 'cause I don't think I look -- I think I look like the farthest thing from a movie star. (laughs) But what's important to me is the ability of this film to convey the facts about the climate crisis: Why we have to change, the fact that we now can change 'cause we have the solutions, and we must make a commitment that we will change.¶That's really, now, where happiness and joy is concerned, I will tell you that what gives me a sense of joy is having work to do that justifies pouring every ounce of energy I have into it. That's really a blessing to have in your life. And it gives you energy back when you have the privilege of doing work that makes you feel that way.",0
Macron says his charm offensive may change Trump's mind about climate change,"

      / CBS/AP
    ","¶PARIS -- French President Emmanuel Macron says his glamorous Paris charm offensive on Donald Trump was carefully calculated -- and may have changed the U.S. president's mind about climate change. ¶Macron defended his outreach to Mr. Trump, whose ""America first"" policies have elicited worry and disdain in Europe. ¶""Our countries are friends, so we should be too,"" Macron said in an interview Sunday in the Journal du dimanche newspaper. ¶More in Climate Change¶After a tense, white-knuckle handshake at their first meeting in May, Macron said they gained ""better, intimate knowledge of each other"" during Mr. Trump's visit to Paris last week. ¶On their main point of contention -- Mr. Trump's withdrawal from the landmark Paris climate agreement -- Macron is quoted as saying that ""Donald Trump listened to me. He understood the reason for my position, notably the link between climate change and terrorism.""¶Increasing droughts and other extreme weather blamed on man-made climate change are worsening migration crises and conflicts in some regions as populations fight over dwindling resources. ¶""He said he would try to find a solution in the coming months. We spoke in detail about what could allow him to return to the Paris deal,"" Macron said, according to the newspaper. ¶While in Paris, Mr. Trump remained non-committal about the U.S. eventually rejoining the climate agreement, telling Macron, ""if it happens that will be wonderful, and if it doesn't that will be OK too."" Mr. Trump has said the climate deal was unfair to U.S. business. ¶Macron had said, ""Regarding climate, we have a number of disagreements due to the commitments taken by President Trump during the campaign, so did I, I'm aware of the high importance of that and we've talked about our disagreements.""¶The French leader acknowledged that Mr. Trump's Paris visit -- including a formal welcome at Napoleon's tomb, dinner in the Eiffel Tower and a place of honor at the annual Bastille Day military parade -- was choreographed to give Americans a ""stronger image of France"" after deadly Islamic extremist attacks damaged the country's vital tourism sector. ¶During Mr. Trump's trip, Macron said there is ""no difference"" or gap between the U.S. and France's position on countering terrorism. ¶It was also aimed at Mr. Trump himself, who has said that Paris has been ruined by the threat of terrorism, which he ties to immigrants. ¶""I think Donald Trump left having a better image of France than upon his arrival,"" Macron is quoted as saying.",0

            Al Gore's crusade - CBS News
    ",CBS News,"July 16, 2017, 9:09 AM","¶A huge iceberg -- said to be the size of Delaware -- broke off from the Antarctic Peninsula. It's one of the largest ever recorded. But scientists differ on whether it can be blamed directly on climate change. Still, former Vice-President Al Gore called the floating giant ""a jarring reminder of why we must solve the climate crisis."" Gore has been a crusader on that issue for years now, and took Lee Cowan back to Tennessee to take stock of the battle in our ""Sunday Morning"" Cover Story: ¶Meandering through the rolling green hills of Carthage, Tennessee, is the Caney Fork River -- a place where Al Gore seems right at home.¶""This place down here is where, when I was a boy, my family used to come down here and go swimming,"" he showed Cowan. ¶Yes, he's the man who was almost President, and yes, that is a pretty tough act to follow.¶And yet, Al Gore has still made his voice heard -- and not just echoing off those limestone cliffs on the Gore family farm.¶""One time when Winston Churchill lost an election as a young man, one of his friends said, 'Winston, this is a blessing in disguise.' And he said, 'Damn good disguise!'  So that's sort of the way I feel about it.¶""When I went through that experience in the election of 2000 and the Supreme Court decision, I knew I was going to be fine. And I hated the result, obviously, but I just started looking for other ways I could be of service.""¶So he dusted off an old slideshow that he had once used to convince his colleagues in the House and the Senate that global warming was a provable environmental threat. And in 2006, that wonky slideshow became an Oscar-winning documentary. ¶""An Inconvenient Truth"" made him the face of the climate debate. It helped him win a Nobel Peace Prize -- and it put him right back in the political crosshairs.¶Cowan said, ""You faced some pretty stiff criticism from people that called you everything from a fanatic to a fraud.""¶""Yeah. When I spoke at my father's funeral, I quoted a passage from scripture, 'Woe unto him about whom all men say good things,'"" Gore laughed. ""If everybody's just completely happy with what you're doing, you may not be working hard enough to bring about the kind of change that we need!""¶He's still fighting for change, and he's still giving that slideshow … over 100 times a year, if you can believe that.¶""16 of the 17 hottest years ever measured with instruments have been since the year 2001.""¶It's enough to discourage anyone living anywhere on the planet. But Gore also sounds a hopeful note -- he's even humorous at times.¶""The Vatican has made a commitment to be the first carbon-neutral nation. Now, they have two advantages: they're very small, and God is on their side.""¶On this day it was an audience of about a thousand outside Seattle who lined up not just to hear Gore's presentation, but to learn how to give it themselves.¶""Do you ever get tired of giving the slide show? Does it ever get old?"" Cowan asked. ¶""Honestly it does not for me, because I really have a strong sense that this is what I'm supposed to be doing,"" Gore replied. ""And that makes me want to do more.""¶He's been holding these Climate Leadership Training sessions for about a decade now, to help spread the word about climate change, and to engage those who say it simply doesn't exist.¶""The truth about the climate crisis is still inconvenient to the large carbon polluters, and so they want to bob and weave and dodge the truth and pretend like it's still a big controversy,"" Gore said. ""And it's not.""¶The success of his first film lead him to take to the big screen again. ""An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power,"" which played at the Cannes Film Festival in May, opens nationwide later this summer.¶As he says in the film, ""It is right to save the future for humanity. It is wrong to pollute this Earth and destroy the climate balance. It is right to give hope to the future generations.""¶""You're a movie star in a lot of respects,"" Cowan laughed. ¶""Come on! I'm, no, no, no, I'm not.""¶""No, you really are! It's you and Wonder Woman this summer!  It is.""¶""Yeah, right!""¶For two years cameras followed Gore on his climate crusade, from high above the melting glaciers of Greenland, to the streets of Miami Beach, where he found officials trying to raise road levels to match the predicted rise in sea levels.¶""It's no longer just the virtually unanimous scientific community telling us we've got to change,"" he said. ""Now Mother Nature has entered the debate. Every night now on the television news is like a nature hike through the Book of Revelation.  People who don't want to use the phrase 'global warming' or 'climate crisis' are saying, 'Wait a minute. Something's going on here that's not right.'""¶Much of the film takes place at the Paris Climate Conference two years ago, where 196 nations (including the U.S.) agreed to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.¶It was unprecedented. But back home, the political winds were blowing in Donald Trump's direction -- and Gore feared it was about to be a whole new world.¶Cowan said, ""You've spent half your life in politics, some of it as the highest levels …""¶""Second-highest level,"" Core corrected him¶""Second-highest level. Excuse me, Mr. Vice President, that's right.  What do you make of this young administration so far?""¶""Every day it's another set of tweets and another set of controversies, and they're not getting anything done,"" Gore replied. ¶His biggest worry was what might be un-done if Mr. Trump kept his campaign promise to pull out of the Paris Accord. He tried more than once to change Mr. Trump's mind -- even visiting him at Trump Tower before the inauguration.¶When asked if he found the president-elect receptive to his argument, Gore said, ""I found him attentive, and you can misinterpret that for being receptive. But yes, I did think that there was a real chance that he would come to his senses on this.""¶But in June, President Trump announced that he was withdrawing the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement. ¶""The President has made this an economic argument, that there just isn't room, essentially, in the economy to be sustainable and at the same time provide jobs, and a lot of his base believes that,"" Cowan said. ¶""Well, the business community does not believe that at all,"" Gore replied. ""There are now twice as many jobs in the solar industry as in the coal industry. Solar jobs are growing 17 times faster than other jobs in the U.S. It's one of the brightest spots in our economic revival.""¶And never before, he says, have the solutions to climate change -- wind, solar and electric technologies -- been as cheap or as readily available.¶""And that has to make your argument easier?"" Cowan asked. ¶""Yeah, it's true. I look back at where the facts and figures were ten, 11 years ago, and the curve on solar energy was just beginning to start moving up. Now it's way up here.""¶Al's father, Albert Sr. (a three-term U.S. Senator), once grew tobacco on the Gore family farm.

Maybe not as a U.S. President, but when it comes to those fighting climate change, he's a world leader nonetheless.¶""I could not lay this down or put it aside even if I wanted to, and I don't want to,"" he said.

U.S. communities will face chronic flooding as sea levels rise,"

    ","¶It may not be a household term, but ""chronic inundation"" will become daily reality this century for hundreds of U.S. coastal communities in the crosshairs of sea level rise, according to a new analysis from the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS). ¶Chronic inundation is term used to describe when a community faces flooding at least 26 times a year — the equivalent of every other week — on more than 10 percent of its usable land, the science advocacy group explained. Chronic inundation does not stem from storm events: it's simply the result of high tides rising higher and reaching farther inland as carbon emissions rise and ice sheets melt. This level of flooding will require expensive infrastructure investments, and in some cases mass relocations of residents to safer areas further inland. ¶""There comes a threshold of chronic flooding that makes normal routines impossible and forces communities to make difficult, often costly choices,"" the UCS said in a statement. ""If saltwater regularly soaked your basement or first floor, kept you from getting to work, or damaged your car, how often would it have to happen before you began looking for a new place to call home?"" ¶More in Climate Change¶More than 90 U.S. communities already cope with chronic inundation. That number will jump to 490 by 2100, and include 40 percent of all oceanfront communities on the East and Gulf Coasts, according to the UCS projections. ¶The organization released a new interactive map on its website this week designed to illustrate the threat of rising sea levels in the decades ahead in a highly specific way. Users can zoom in on any location to see current conditions and the flooding projections for the years 2035, 2060, 2080 and 2100. Blue areas along the coasts represent local areas facing chronic inundation.¶The hundreds of communities facing conditions of chronic inundation by 2100 include Charleston, South Carolina, where historic buildings and neighborhoods already routinely flood; Cape May, New Jersey, which is currently facing damaging habitat loss; and the Meadowlands in New Jersey, which plays a key role in protecting the rest of the state from sea level rise, according to the UCS.¶A closer look at the map of Charleston, for example, shows some coastal areas already affected by chronic inundation (below, left), but much wider areas of the community likely to be facing such conditions by the end of the century (below, right):¶The report also warns that chronic flooding will particularly cripple communities that are already socioeconomically vulnerable, those with less money and fewer resources to navigate environmental change and the impact it will have on infrastructure, personal property and people's health. (These also tend to be areas where residents have lower rates of health insurance coverage). ¶The UCS particularly drew attention to southern Louisiana, which will face some of the world's fastest rates of sea level rise. In the map below, pink areas indicate socioeconomically vulnerable communities that face the added burden of chronic inundation:¶Climate change is expected to add fuel to the fire of America's existing economic inequality. ¶According to research published last month in the journal Science, global warming will disproportionately affect poor areas: by the late 21st century, the poorest third of U.S. counties are projected to lose between 2 and 20 percent of their income due to climate change-related disruptions.",0
"Earth faces ""biological annihilation"" in sixth mass extinction, scientists warn","

    ","¶Over the last half-billion years, scientists say there have been five mass extinction events on Earth in which a wide diversity of species on this planet suddenly died off. Now, there's growing evidence that a sixth mass extinction is unfolding, according to scientists who track species around the globe. In a new study, researchers say the current mass extinction is even ""more severe than perceived"" and amounts to ""biological annihilation"" affecting thousands of species.¶In the study, published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers from Stanford University and the National Autonomous University of Mexico unveiled a granular look at population trends among 27,600 species of birds, amphibians, mammals, and reptiles — half of the world's known terrestrial vertebrates — including detailed analysis of 177 species of mammals. ¶The results are grim: researchers found an ""extremely high degree of population decay"" among vertebrates, even in species considered at low risk of extinction. In general, they found that the world's temperate regions are losing species at equal or even higher rates than the tropics. ¶More in Climate Change¶""Earth is experiencing a huge episode of population declines and extirpations"" — when a species ceases to exist in a particular location — ""which will have negative cascading consequences on ecosystem functioning and services vital to sustaining civilization,"" the researchers wrote. ¶""We describe this as a 'biological annihilation' to highlight the current magnitude of Earth's ongoing sixth major extinction event.""¶Dividing the world's land masses into a grid of 22,000 sections measuring 10,000-square-kilometers (about 3,860 square miles) each, the researchers tracked species declines and painted a stark picture of populations being pushed to their limits. ¶For instance: lions have historically occupied roughly 2,000 of the 10,000-square-kilometer cells across several continents, but now occupy little more than 600 cells in sub-Saharan Africa and India. In south and southeast Asia, all the large-bodied mammals analyzed have lost more than 80 percent of their geographic ranges. ¶Looking through the lens of local populations extinctions (the precursor to irreversible species extinctions), the researchers conclude that ""Earth's sixth mass extinction episode has proceeded further than most assume.""¶Senior conservation scientist Robin Naidoo of the World Wildlife Fund said the study ""makes a point that's sometimes missed"" by concentrating on the long, complex path that precedes species extinction, from declining populations to decreasing range. Even if it's far from extinction, a species in decline can cause ""cascading effects on vegetation and habitat"" in ecological networks that depend on balance between animals, plants and microorganisms, Naidoo told CBS News. ¶Conservation groups like the International Union for Conservation of Nature categorize species across the spectrum of extinction risk, from ""least concern,"" to ""near threatened,"" ""vulnerable,"" ""endangered,"" ""critically endangered,"" ""extinct in the wild,"" and eventually ""extinct."" ¶""This paper makes the point that it's not just about extinction — it's about declines in populations. A species doesn't have to go extinct for a variety of negative effects to be felt,"" Naidoo said.¶These negative effects can directly impact humans in many ways. In fishing communities, fish so scarce they're considered ""commercially extinct"" can destroy local economies. In Africa, elephant declines due to poaching cost local economies $25 million per year in lost tourism revenue, according to a recent study from the World Wildlife Fund. ¶Earth's previous mass extinctions were often associated with sudden, cataclysmic natural events: abrupt changes in climate, massive volcanic eruptions, giant meteor strikes (like the one that wiped out the dinosaurs approximately 66 million years ago).¶The current mass extinction stands apart because it's largely caused by humans, researchers say. From pollution to deforestation, overpopulation, poaching, warming oceans, and extreme weather events tied to global warming, human activity is the primary fuel behind this new era of irreversible species loss.¶Humans are leaving the world ""a much, much poorer place,"" Elizabeth Kolbert, author of ""The Sixth Extinction"" and a staff writer for the New Yorker, told CBS News. In her Pulitzer Prize-winning book, Kolbert argues that depleting the planet's biodiversity looks likely to be humankind's most lasting legacy.¶Though periodic extinctions have long played a role in life on Earth, the current scope and rate of extinctions is anything but normal. The Earth has lost 200 species of vertebrates in the past 100 years alone, the researchers behind the new study noted. If the trends of the past two million years had held up, those losses should have unfolded gradually over 10,000 years rather than a single century.¶""An extinction should be something that's very unusual,"" Kolbert said. ""When you can identify lots of species that have gone extinct or are on the verge of extinction, that's actually a very unusual time in the Earth's history and a very dangerous one.""¶This steady stream of species loss, about two extinctions per year, hardly makes a blip on the public's radar. In many cases, that's because the losses are obscure: recent extinctions include Mexico's Catarina pupfish or the Christmas Island pipistrelle bat, hardly household names. ¶Stories about these individual extinctions often fail to convey the magnitude and urgency of the larger context: that for only the sixth time in history of the planet, the Earth's biodiversity appears to be coming apart at the seams. ¶""I really do think — and this study underscores that — that this is the big issue of our time,"" Kolbert said. ""I mean literally right now and for the next many, many centuries, decades, perhaps millennia.""",0

You know that, unfortunately -- and I deplore this -- the United States of America left the climate agreement, or rather announced their intention to do so,"" she said on the final day of the summit.¶""What becomes clear in this declaration is the dissenting view of the United States, but I am gratified to note the other 19 members of G-20 say the Paris agreement is irreversible,"" Merkel continued. ""We feel committed to what we agreed on and should be implemented as quickly as possible.""¶Merkel added that she did not share the same view of British Prime Minister Theresa May, who said Friday that the U.S. could someday return to the climate accord.¶More in Climate Change¶In a communique, the G-20 nations noted the U.S. decision to withdraw from the agreement in a section dealing with energy and climate. ""The United States of America states it will endeavor to work closely with other countries to help them access and use fossil fuels more cleanly and efficiently,"" the communique reads.¶The statement reaffirmed that all 19 nations agreed that the decision to leave the accord would be permanent, and that the U.S. was the only nation that declined to sign the ""G20 Hamburg Climate and Energy Action Plan for Growth."" ¶Mr. Trump won the 2016 presidential election after campaigning to put ""America First"" by pulling the country out of the historic Paris Agreement. In June, he announced his intention to work with world leaders on a deal that would be fair for U.S. taxpayers.¶""In order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its citizens, the United States will withdraw from the Paris climate accord,"" Mr. Trump said from the White House Rose Garden. ""So we're getting out, but we will start to negotiate and we will see if we can make a deal that's fair. And if we can, that's great, and if we can't, that's fine.""¶""I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris,"" he added.",0

    ","¶Since taking over as the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, a longtime critic of the very agency he now oversees, has moved to undo, delay or block over 30 environmental regulations. That's more rollbacks than any other administrator in the agency's 47-year history over such a short period of time, according to the New York Times.¶Since his February confirmation, Pruitt has embarked on record-setting rollbacks, including filing a proposal to undo Obama-era climate change regulations, legal plans to repeal pollution in the nation's waterways, delaying rules requiring fossil fuel companies to rein in leaks of methane and greenhouse gases, and reversed a ban on the use of a pesticide the EPA deemed dangerous to children's health.¶""Just the number of environmental rollbacks in this time frame is astounding,"" Richard Lazarus, a professor of environmental law at Harvard, told the Times. ""Pruitt has come in with a real mission. He is much more organized, much more focused than the other cabinet-level officials, who have not really taken charge of their agencies. It's very striking how much they've done.""¶Environmental advocates say Pruitt is weakening or doing away with numerous necessary regulations, and point to his habit of hiring deputies from major corporations and lobbying groups. Pruitt has also met with numerous corporate lobbyists as he puts his agenda into action.¶More in Climate Change¶""It amounts to a corporate takeover of the agency, in its decision- and policy-making functions,"" Robert Weissman, the president of Public Citizen, told the paper.¶Perhaps the most notable and controversial of the Trump administration's rollback of environmental regulations is Mr. Trump's formal withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement. Pruitt will now take a leading role in steering the withdrawal, according to the Times.¶The U.S. will now be one of only three countries out of 197 nations that isn't signed onto the agreement, with the other two being Nicaragua and Syria.¶The pact is aimed at combating climate change around the world and helping nations adapt to its effects by requiring countries to present plans to reduce carbon emissions. Specifically, it requires countries to set their own targets for reducing emissions by 2020.¶Climate change and the administration's climate accord pullout are expected to become a major topic up for discussion as Mr. Trump heads to Hamburg later this week to meet with other world leaders at the G20 summit.¶Pruitt, meanwhile, says his agency will continue to prioritize handling what he calls ""tangible"" pollution, such as cleaning up Superfund sites.",0

            Saving Florida's coral reef through underwater gardening - CBS News
    ",CBS News,"June 30, 2017, 3:46 PM","¶KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. -- The beauty of south Florida's coastline isn't just skin-deep. Below the water lies a crucial habitat of coral, home to hundreds of species of marine plants and animals. But the beauty of the only tropical reef system in the continental U.S. is vanishing. ¶""Over the past 30 to 40 years, we've seen a drastic decline in coral cover… and it's mostly been due to climate change,"" said Stephanie Schopmeyer, a University of Miami marine biologist who's working to save the species.¶In just one decade, the reef lost nearly half its coral cover. The system stretches more than 300 miles along Florida's coast.¶CBS News correspondent Manuel Bojorquez and his team set out with Schopmeyer to see the Rescue a Reef program in action. Scientists who are certified divers are replanting parts of the reef with the help of ""citizen scientists.""""Citizen scientists are members of our local community that are interested in participating and contributing to any type of science program and in our case it's coral restoration,"" Schopmeyer said. She said there's a waiting list. ¶The first task is to collect recently grown coral from so-called ""trees"" the group has installed just off Key Biscayne. Once they bring them up, the divers are taught how to secure the harvested coral onto the ocean floor. Then it's time to find a spot to replant them.¶Doing that is like underwater gardening – putting down stakes and securing the new coral – all while trying not to drift into other replanted coral that's already growing.But it's on dry land where coral biologists like Ross Cunning work to ensure corals survive challenging conditions.¶ ""We are studying the stress resistance of corals,"" Cunning said. ""We're trying to identify which corals are able to withstand warming temperatures.""¶ Aside from saving the ecosystem, Cunning says billions of dollars are at stake – from fishing to tourism – if the reef does not survive. It also helps protect against beach erosion and another major threat to Florida: hurricanes. ""Coral reefs act as a natural barrier, and when hurricanes approach… they act as a first line of defense against storm surge,"" Cunning said.   Rescue a Reef is slowly trying to rebuild that line of defense.  During Jessica Glenn's ninth dive, she planted about six corals.¶""I live here. I'm a Floridian, so I want to save it,"" Glenn said. ¶ Meanwhile, it was Natalie Mertel's first dive. ""I've been wanting to do this for over a year. And it finally worked out today,"" Mertel said, adding, ""and without the ocean, well – there's no life.""¶Rescue a Reef is not the only program working to replant the coral reef. Schopmeyer said there is a network of divers and scientists that have planted tens of thousands of corals every year, but they have a long way to go.",0

    ","¶Communities across the U.S. should brace themselves for severe economic losses if climate change continues undeterred, according to a new analysis. ¶Every jump of 1 degree Celsius in temperature will cost the U.S. about 1.2 percent in gross domestic product, researchers said in a study that appears Friday in the journal Science. They also delivered a grim message: expect America's income inequality to get worse as the planet warms. ¶The researchers crunched numbers on how climate change will continue to impact the economy and society in a wide range of ways. They projected the impact on everything from agriculture yields and the labor supply to mortality rates and violent crime. They identified how different communities' energy expenditures will change, and mapped out the locations likely to take the greatest hit from coastal damage. ¶More in Climate Change¶Most importantly, they broke their analysis down on a granular, county-by-county level, producing a vivid picture of which U.S. communities stand to lose the most as global warming accelerates. ¶In terms of overall economic losses, southern and midwestern communities are at the highest risk, in some extreme cases losing 20 percent of their local GDP by the end of the century: ¶Some northern and western communities may see slight economic gains over that time period, shifting the balance of economic power in the U.S, the researchers said. These communities may in fact see a boost in agriculture, thanks to milder northern winters, lower energy expenditure on home heating, and other factors. Still, these gains aren't enough to compensate for the negative trend nationwide. ¶Counties along the Atlantic coast are expected to suffer major losses as hurricanes intensify and sea levels rise, redrawing the maps of coastal areas.¶The U.S. appears particularly vulnerable to sea level rise in the next century, according to research from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association. The latest study mapped out the areas of several major coastal cities, like Miami, seen here, which are most likely  to be inundated by floods under median sea level rise in the coming decades.¶According to the researchers, climate change is poised to disproportionately affect areas that already suffer from poverty, exacerbating America's economic inequality. By the late 21st century, the poorest third of U.S. counties are expected to experience losses between 2 and 20 percent of county income, according to the study.¶""We've shown which U.S. regional economies are particularly vulnerable, which will help policymakers,"" co-author Solomon Hsiang, of the University of California, Berkeley, and the National Bureau of Economic Research, said in a statement. ""If we are going to adapt, we need to know where to focus.""¶The data analysis comes from the Climate Impact Lab, a consortium of climate researchers from UC Berkeley, Rutgers, University of Chicago, and other institutions. The group also released an interactive tool for the public to engage with the data and explore the impact on different communities. To make their projections, the researchers assumed a ""business as usual"" framework for the next few decades — meaning, they assumed the U.S. would continue its heavy reliance on fossil fuels. ¶The recent shift in federal policy supports that assumption. President Trump has promised to end the supposed ""war on coal"" and pulled out of the Paris Agreement, which committed the U.S. and more than 190 other nations to reducing carbon emissions. Under EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency has moved into a new chapter of deregulation on industry. ¶Continued climate change, by stretching natural resources to the breaking point and normalizing extreme weather events, is also expected to cause a worsening of physical and mental health problems. ¶Previous medical research has linked climate change to an increase in infectious diseases and heart and lung conditions associated with air pollution and wildfires.¶The new study projects an increase in mortality rates resulting from climate change in southern and midwestern states and much of California over the rest of this century.¶In 2013, researchers from Princeton University and the University of California-Berkeley found that even slight spikes in temperature and precipitation have increased the risk of personal violence and social upheaval throughout human history. ¶Extreme weather events are also known to trigger mental health problems including post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression and substance abuse.",0
Solar energy revolution hits barrier: Air pollution,"

    ","¶Solar energy is running into a pesky problem: air pollution worldwide. ¶Researchers from Duke University found that air pollution — specifically airborne particles, which accumulate on solar cells — is cutting solar energy output by more than 25 percent in certain areas of the world, causing billions of dollars of losses. The research was published this week in the journal Environmental Science & Technology Letters. ¶The hardest hit regions happen to be those currently investing the most in solar energy infrastructure: China, India and the Arabian Peninsula, according to researchers.¶Duke University professor Michael Bergin set out to explore the link between air pollution and solar panel efficiency after a visit to India. ¶More in Climate Change¶""My colleagues in India were showing off some of their rooftop solar installations, and I was blown away by how dirty the panels were,"" Bergin said in a statement. ¶Working with researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology-Gandhinagar and the University of Wisconsin at Madison, Bergin confirmed that solar panels become significantly less efficient as they become dirtier over time. ¶Maintenance is key: the panels he examined showed a 50 percent uptick in in efficiency from being cleaned after several weeks. Cleaning solar panels is somewhat complex, and there's a risk that cleaning them incorrectly could damage the expensive structures. ¶Analyzing the panels at the Indian Institute of Technology-Gandhinagar, Bergin found they were covered in about 92 percent dust and 8 percent carbon and ion pollutants, particles from manmade pollution. ¶That 8 percent is particularly dangerous, researchers said, as small particles from human-made pollution are extremely effective at blocking out light. ¶In polluted environments, ambient particles in the surrounding air also block out sunlight and undercut solar panel efficiency. ¶Extrapolating from their observations in India, the researchers estimate that dry regions like the Arabian Peninsula, Northern India and Eastern China must be facing heavy losses in solar efficiency. Solar panels in these regions face efficiency losses between 17 to 35 percent, depending on how well they're maintained.¶""We always knew these pollutants were bad for human health and climate change, but now we've shown how bad they are for solar energy as well,"" Bergin said. ""It's yet another reason for policymakers worldwide to adopt emissions controls.""¶China stands to lose tens of billions of dollar per year as the country's growing solar energy infrastructure collides with its toxic air pollution, the researchers said. ¶China has emerged as a major player in renewable energy in recent years, overtaking the U.S. as the global leader in renewable power. The momentum stems from extreme circumstances: China is by far the world's largest user of coal and has long struggled to gain control over the toxic smog that blankets urban areas. China's smog routinely shuts down airports, schools and roads, forcing locals to stay inside or risk serious respiratory damage.  ¶China is still committed to the landmark Paris Agreement on reducing carbon emissions, despite President Trump's decision to pull out of the accord. In the wake of the U.S. pullout, China signed a independent, non-binding agreement with the state of California to expand renewable energy trade between the two economies. ",0

    ","¶BOLOGNA, Italy — The United States refused Monday to sign on to a Group of Seven pledge that calls the Paris climate accord the ""irreversible"" global tool to address climate change.¶The G-7 environment ministers issued a final communique Monday after their two-day meeting, the first since the United States announced it was withdrawing from the Paris climate pact. In a footnote to the communique, the United States said it wouldn't join with the other six countries in reaffirming their Paris commitments, but said it was taking action on its own to reduce its carbon footprint.¶""The United States will continue to engage with key international partners in a manner that is consistent with our domestic priorities, preserving both a strong economy and a healthy environment,"" the footnote read.¶More in Climate Change¶As a result, the U.S. said it would not join those sections of the communique on climate and multilateral development banks.¶The head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, had attended the first few hours of the summit Sunday, but then left to attend a Cabinet meeting in Washington.¶Bucking mainstream scientific consensus, Pruitt has argued that carbon dioxide is not a primary cause of global warming — placing him directly at odds with the premise of the Paris Agreement, a framework for nations to lower their carbon emissions starting in the year 2020. ¶Presenting the communique Monday, Italy's environment minister, Gian Luca Galletti, called the Paris accord ""irreversible, non-negotiable and the only instrument possible to combat climate change."" He said the other G-7 countries hoped to continue ""constructive dialogue"" with the U.S., but insisted on the Paris parameters.¶""Everything else for us is excluded,"" he said.¶The 2015 Paris agreement aims to prevent the Earth from heating up by any more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) since the start of the industrial age. Since the world has already warmed about 1.1 degrees Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit), the accord aims to ensure the threshold is not breached, with each nation setting goals to curb heat-trapping emissions.¶All but a very few scientists say the overwhelming majority of global warming is man-made. Scientists have known since the 19th century that burning coal, oil and gas spews carbon dioxide into the air, which then acts like a blanket to trap heat on Earth.¶President Donald Trump announced the U.S. was withdrawing from the Paris accord earlier this month, framing it as a ""reassertion of America's sovereignty."" He has said the U.S. could try to re-enter the deal under more favorable terms, but the European Union — and in particular Italy, France and Germany — have said the Paris accord cannot be renegotiated.¶The former chief of United Nations climate negotiations has echoed that criticism, saying the White House has ""no understanding of the legal underpinning"" of the Paris Agreement.¶In a statement, the EPA said the U.S. had ""reset the climate change discussion"" at the G-7 meeting and stressed that it was a party to the 15-page communique, except for the four pages dealing with climate change and financing for sustainable development.¶""Today's action of reaching consensus makes clear that the Paris Agreement is not the only mechanism by which environmental stewardship can be demonstrated,"" Pruitt said in a statement.¶In fact, the final text doesn't say the Paris accord is the only tool for tackling climate change. Rather, it says that the accord is ""the global instrument for effectively and urgently tackling climate change and adapting to its effects.""¶It says the six G-7 nations — Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom, as well as the European Commission — agree that the Paris accord is ""irreversible and its full integrity is key for the security and prosperity of our planet, societies and economies.""¶While voicing dismay at the U.S. position, which was expected, environmental groups and concerned countries voiced optimism that the remaining six nations reaffirmed the Paris process and that the U.S. withdrawal had led to a groundswell of support elsewhere for the accord.¶""Our hope is that together with big emerging economies we can turn our commitments into action — boldly enough and quickly enough — to protect the most vulnerable among us,"" said Thoriq Ibrahim, the Maldives environment minister and chair of the Alliance of Small Island States.¶No place in the Maldives is higher than seven feet ten inches above sea level, and the small island nation is expected to suffer tremendous losses as sea levels rise in the Indian Ocean.  ¶France's environment minister, Nicolas Hulot, said he hoped many countries would follow France's lead in scaling up their pledges and accelerating the timetable on implementing Paris benchmarks in response to the U.S. withdrawal. He repeated that there is a new ""economic model"" to be found in developing clean energy.¶""Let us make sure that Europe takes its part in this economic opportunity,"" he said.¶While President Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris Agreement fundamentally altered the global dynamics of of climate change action, others are stepping in to try to fill the gap.¶In the wake of the U.S. pullout, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has emerged as a coalition builder, bringing together more than 1,000 entities — from cities and states to corporations to universities — pledging to reduce carbon emissions independent of federal policy. ¶""Mayors, governors, and business leaders from both political parties are signing onto to a statement of support that we will submit to the U.N. – and together, we will reach the emission reduction goals the United States made in Paris in 2015,"" Bloomberg said in a statement. ""Americans will honor and fulfill the Paris Agreement by leading from the bottom up – and there isn't anything Washington can do to stop us.""¶Bloomberg also said his charitable organization, Bloomberg Philanthropies, will commit up to $15 million to help fund global efforts lacking support from the U.S. government.¶In another development last week, California Governor Jerry Brown and Chinese President Xi Jinping signed an agreement to expand trade between California and China with an emphasis on sustainable technologies, according to Brown.",0

    ","¶BEIJING — Energy ministers from around the world gathered in Beijing this week to report increased spending to help counter climate change. Yet one prominent voice, that of U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, delivered a starkly countervailing message as the Trump administration seeks to roll back spending on clean energy and promote fossil fuels.¶India, France, Norway, Canada, Australia, Japan and others said during a private meeting of ministers earlier this week that they were on track to double government research budgets.¶When Perry's turn came, he said deep cuts to research in Trump's proposed budget reflected an increased understanding that developing new technologies into commercial projects should be left to private companies. The proposal must first pass through Congress.¶More in Climate Change¶""If you're going to have to prioritize where your dollars are going, early stage is where we're going to spend it,"" Perry said Friday when asked about his earlier comments. ""Once (a new technology) has been proven up, we need to get out of the business.""¶The approach he outlined marks a sharp departure from the past practice of ushering new technologies through to commercial deployment. It also illustrates a new reality emerging across the global energy landscape, where U.S. innovations long dominated.¶That's opened the way for other large developing nations, especially China, to seize the mantle of leadership in tackling climate change.¶China has committed to remaining in the Paris Agreement despite President Trump's decision to pull the U.S., the world's biggest carbon polluter, out of the pact. ¶India has also not changed its stance. ¶""For us it's not a political issue but a moral and spiritual issue,"" Harsh Vardhan, India's minister of science and technology, told The Associated Press. ""We are working for the future of our children.""¶Trump last week cast his decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord in terms of economic self-interest. He warned American jobs would be transferred overseas if the U.S. remained in the agreement.¶Renewable energy is widely seen as a major driver of future global growth and Trump was accused of fudging the figures on the agreement's economic impact and on its projected effects on reining in rising global temperatures.¶The Republican's announcement drew a quick international rebuke and firm assertions from other nations that they would proceed with the agreement regardless of the U.S. position, a dynamic very much on display at this week's gathering in Beijing.¶The announcement also drew harsh blowback within the United States, as more than 1,000 cities, counties, states, universities and private companies came together to reaffirm that they would work towards the carbon emissions goals laid out by the Paris Agreement independent of federal government support. That coalition was spearheaded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. ¶California Governor Jerry Brown, whose state represents the world's sixth-largest economy and was one of the first to sign on to the coalition, visited China this week to sign an agreement pledging to work together on reducing emissions.¶""Nobody can stay on the sidelines. We can't afford any dropouts in the tremendous human challenge to make the transition to a sustainable future,"" Brown said. ¶Energy ministers from Canada and the European Commission told an AP reporter they were disappointed in the U.S. decision on the Paris accord. Perry said he heard no such direct criticism.¶Perry, a former Texas governor, faces cuts across a range of programs in his new position, from a 70-percent reduction for renewable and energy efficiency programs, to a 50-percent cut for a program that includes research to reduce pollution from coal, according to an analysis by the American Association for the Advancement of Science.¶Perry suggested during a Friday meeting with reporters that he would work with members of Congress to try to restore research spending.¶And even without the Paris accord, he asserted that the U.S. can reduce climate-changing greenhouse gas emissions by promoting nuclear power, capturing carbon dioxide from coal-burning power plants, and pursuing yet-to-be-discovered energy technologies.¶One of the organizers of the Beijing event, Christian Zinglersen, head of the 23-nation Clean Energy Ministerial, said the spending reductions proposed by Trump were no reason to panic. Even before Trump took office, Zinglersen said developing countries had been taking on a bigger role to advance clean energy resources.¶""It's a shift, not just on the contributions side but also in leading more of the work. That creates the need for others to step up,"" Zinglersen said.¶Represented at the three-day meeting in Beijing were representatives of countries that emit 75 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions.¶Among them India outlined its ambitious goal of having electric vehicles account for all new car sales by 2030. Mexico said it was spending $200 million on clean energy projects and efforts to scale up new technologies so they could be commercially deployed.¶For China and India in particular, the motivation is not just battling climate change but also a more immediate desire to cut down on air pollution from burning coal, which is endangering the health of hundreds of millions of their citizens living in urban areas.¶Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli outlined a massive effort to update transmission lines, develop cleaner burning coal plants, and continue expanding solar and wind power capacity, in which China already ranks number one in the world.¶Zhang said China intends to make clean energy a ""new growth point"" in its slowing economic expansion. He singled out the U.S. for potential future cooperation.¶However, Perry said the message he heard from Zhang was ""come and compete.""¶""Competition is a good thing and the United States looks forward to the challenge,"" Perry said.",0
"Polar bears face new challenge as sea ice becomes speedier, study says","

June 8, 2017 / 6:05 PM
      / CBS/AP
    ","¶ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- Rapid global warming has sped up the movement of sea ice off Alaska's coasts, and already at-risk polar bears are paying a price, a new U.S. study says.¶Most sea ice moves throughout the year and the iconic white bears are on a perpetual walk to stay within their preferred habitat, said U.S. Geological Survey research ecologist George Durner, lead author of the study.¶He compares it to living on a treadmill that has picked up speed because ice is thinner, more brittle and moving faster because of wind and ocean currents.¶""Increased sea ice drift rates likely exacerbate the physiological stress due to reduced foraging opportunity already experienced by many polar bears in the warming Arctic, adding yet another 'straw to the camel's back,'"" Durner said.¶More in Climate Change¶Polar bears were listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act in 2008 amid the alarming loss of summer sea ice in recent decades and climate models indicating the trend would persist. However, the government said the act would not be used to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.¶The U.S. polar bear recovery plan says that without action to address climate change -- the primary cause of diminishing sea ice -- it is unlikely that polar bears could be saved. The plan released in January noted positive signs such as emission goals in the Paris climate agreement.¶President Donald Trump, however, withdrew from the international pact last week, arguing that it had disadvantaged the U.S. ""to the exclusive benefit of other countries,"" leaving American businesses and taxpayers to absorb the cost.¶Mr. Trump's decision flew in the face of a vocal campaign by large companies to keep America in the agreement, and it sparked anger among some chief executives. ""Climate change is real,"" Jeff Immelt, CEO of General Electric, said in a tweet after the president's announcement. ""Industry must now lead and not depend on government.""¶In the wake of Mr. Trump's speech, Elon Musk, head of electric-car maker Tesla, resigned from the president's business advisory council. ""Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,"" he tweeted.Bob Iger, chief of Walt Disney, followed suit in quitting the council over the Paris move.¶The hundreds of big companies that backed staying with the Paris accord run the full range of business sectors. They included retailers like Walmart, tech giants such as Apple, automakers like General Motors and even the leading lights of the fossil fuel industry, notably Exxon Mobil.¶Trump also has called for expanded petroleum development in polar bear habitat, including offshore Alaska waters and parts of areas the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.¶Margaret Williams, Arctic program managing director for the World Wildlife Fund, called withdrawal from the Paris agreement frightening but said private, state and local efforts to reduce carbon emissions and turn to renewable energy are a positive sign.¶""There's still a lot of hope,"" she said.¶The political moves come as the Geological Survey and University of Wyoming study documented how polar bears use more energy to stay within their home range.¶Researchers made a conservative estimate that bears will have to kill one to three more seals a year to compensate for faster-moving ice, a challenge for bears already facing fewer hunting opportunities.¶Durner compared their plight to people living in a town hit by both inflation and rising unemployment.¶""For the polar bear, the Arctic is becoming more expensive to live in,"" he said.¶Polar bears can go for extended periods without eating but then gorge on ringed and bearded seals. Ringed seals give birth on sea ice in spring and early summer, and polar bears sniff out their lairs.¶Diminished sea ice has reduced access to prey in the southern Beaufort Sea off Alaska's north coast. Researchers have documented the polar bear's declining body condition, reproduction, survival and abundance.¶In the new study, researchers looked at data from radio-collared female polar bears in the Beaufort and the Chukchi Seas during two periods: 1987-1998 and 1999-2013.¶Sea ice changed in amount, thickness and composition in the second period as melting seasons lengthened.¶Researchers concluded that the bears must kill 2 to 6 percent more seals per year to make up for burning more calories on faster-moving sea ice. The study did not address whether they walk faster or spend more time moving to keep up with the ice.¶Bears in the Chukchi Sea, off Alaska's northwest coast, had to walk farther and burn more calories than south Beaufort bears but are in better shape because more food is available, Durner said.¶Amy Cutting, animal curator at the Oregon Zoo, said in an email that the paper is a key piece in the growing literature examining challenges faced by polar bears.¶With decades of location and movement data on bears, she said, the Geological Survey is uniquely positioned to assess and quantify effects of changes in sea ice.¶""This kind of research is critical to understanding the specific mechanisms through which climate change is impacting polar bear biology,"" Cutting said.

"Climate change could swamp bridges, even far inland","

    ","¶DES MOINES, Iowa — A century-old train trestle stands as one of the trophies of Des Moines' push to spruce up its downtown. Bicyclists and pedestrians pose for pictures beside the brightly painted beams of the Red Bridge and gather on viewing platforms overlooking the Des Moines River.¶But little more than a decade after it was restored, crews went back to the site with a crane to hoist the span 4.5 feet higher, at a cost of $3 million, after experts concluded that the river's flooding risk was nearly double earlier estimates. Climate change was likely to blame.¶""It was like a bomb was dropped off in our lap,"" City Engineer Pam Cooksey said of the revised flood forecasts from the Army Corps of Engineers. The findings suggested that the bridge could act as a dam during bad storms, sending waves of backed-up floodwater into the refurbished business district.¶More in Climate Change¶Climate change is often seen as posing the greatest risk to coastal areas. But the nation's inland cities face perils of their own, including more intense storms and more frequent flooding. Even as President Donald Trump has announced his intention for the U.S. to withdraw from a global climate agreement, many of the nation's river communities are responding to climate change by raising or replacing bridges that suddenly seem too low to stay safely above water.¶The reconstructed bridges range from multi-lane structures that handle heavy traffic loads to small rural spans traversed by country school buses and farmers shuttling between their fields. The bridges are being raised even in states such as Texas, where political leaders have long questioned whether climate change is real.¶In Milwaukee, bridges have been raised as part of $400 million in flood-management projects across a metro area with 28 communities. In Reno, Nevada, officials spent about $18 million to replace a bridge over the Truckee River last year and plan to replace three more after flood-danger projections were increased by up to 15 percent.¶Because the cities are inland, ""A lot of these are not the kind of places that people are used to thinking of being in the forefront of climate change,"" said Jim Schwab, manager of the Hazards Planning Center at the American Planning Association, which is working with nearly a dozen cities on flood-mitigation options.¶Many communities are ""still feeling their way through this particular problem,"" he said.¶No one tracks how many communities are raising bridges or replacing them with higher ones, but the Federal Emergency Management Agency says it's now routinely providing money for this purpose, although no dollar total is available. Typically, more than 1,500 bridges are reconstructed each year for an assortment of reasons.¶Schwab said he's sure hundreds and possibly thousands of bridge-raising projects have been completed recently or are planned. A cursory check by the AP in a handful of states found at least 20 locations where bridges have been raised or construction will begin soon.¶FEMA is now finalizing a rule that states that floods ""are expected to be more frequent and more severe over the next century due in part to the projected effects of climate change."" That could mean higher costs for a country that sustained more than $260 billion in flood damage between 1980 and 2013.¶Given the Trump administration's skepticism of climate change, however, a FEMA spokeswoman says the agency ""has not determined what its next action will be"" on the rule. The Corps of Engineers did not respond to requests for information on cities where flood risks have been reassessed.¶Increasing humidity from the more than 1.5 degree increase in global temperatures since 1880 has resulted in more intense downpours, according to David R. Easterling, director of the national climate assessment unit at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.¶""It causes day after day of rainfall, and that leads to flooding,"" Easterling said.¶In some cases, a city's 100-year flood could be seen as twice what it was 40 years ago, with double the risk, as it was for Des Moines. A 100-year flood is the worst flood that can be expected to happen over a century. It has a 1 percent chance of occurring in any given year.¶River level forecasts have increased in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, since tropic-like rainstorms in 2008 caused the normally placid Cedar River to climb higher than anyone thought possible, eventually topping the previous record flood by 11 feet. More than 1,100 blocks in Iowa's second-largest city wound up underwater.¶Afterward, the Corps of Engineers raised Cedar Rapids' projections for a 100-year flood by 8 percent. As part of a massive flood-control project, the city decided to raise its Eighth Avenue Bridge by 14 feet, putting it 28 feet above the average water surface.¶""What used to be the norm is no longer the norm,"" said Rob Davis, the city's flood-control program manager. ""The norm is much higher.""¶Elsewhere, the college town of Iowa City plans to add about 5 feet of clearance with a new bridge over the Iowa River, and the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District raised a bridge over the Kinnickinnic River to prevent the waterway from backing up amid downpours.¶Similar projects are planned in Hobart, Indiana, and Rockford, Illinois, where higher river levels have been projected.¶The preparations for climate change seem oddly disconnected from the political debate about the issue.¶In Texas, where politicians including Sen. Ted Cruz have questioned whether the climate is growing warmer and if humans have caused the change, Austin has raised two bridges in the past five years and plans to improve three more stream crossings, said Pam Kearfott, a supervising engineer in the city's watershed protection department.¶Officials ""try to stick to the technical basis for change"" and ignore the politics, she said.¶San Antonio is among other Texas cities that have raised bridges in anticipation of greater dangers.¶Sterling Burnett, a research fellow at the Heartland Institute, a think tank that promotes skepticism about human-caused climate change, said the new flooding predictions and climate outlook could be exaggerated, but he doesn't begrudge local governments for raising bridges and making other preparations.¶""They have to work with the data given to them and make decisions,"" Burnett said.¶In the West, small communities in the Ross Valley north of San Francisco anticipate worse seasonal flooding from climate change. They plan to replace five bridges that are now too low, at a cost of more than $10 million.¶As Cooper Martin, who heads the National League of Cities' Sustainable Cities Institute, puts it, ""With the changing climate, cities have to do something.""",0

    ","¶BEIJING - With President Donald Trump pulling the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord, China and California signed an agreement Tuesday to work together on reducing emissions, as the state's governor warned that ""disaster still looms"" without urgent action.¶Gov. Jerry Brown told The Associated Press at an international clean energy conference in Beijing that Trump's decision to pull the U.S. out of the Paris agreement will ultimately prove only a temporary setback.¶For now, he said, China, European countries and individual U.S. states will fill the gap left by the federal government's move to abdicate leadership on the issue.¶More in Climate Change¶""Nobody can stay on the sidelines. We can't afford any dropouts in the tremendous human challenge to make the transition to a sustainable future,"" Brown said. ""Disaster still looms, and we've got to make the turn.""¶Brown later held a closed-door meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, during which the two pledged to expand trade between California and China with an emphasis on so-called green technologies that could help address climate change, Brown said. President Trump's announcement last week that he wants to pull out of the Paris accord did not come up, according to the governor.¶""Xi spoke in very positive terms,"" Brown told reporters after the meeting. ""I don't think there's any desire to get into verbal battles with President Trump.""¶Mr. Trump's decision drew heavy criticism within the U.S. and internationally, including in China, which swiftly recommitted itself to the agreement forged with the administration of former U.S. President Barack Obama. The new president argued that the Paris agreement favors emerging economies such as China's and India's at the expense of U.S. workers.¶Tuesday's agreement between California and China's Ministry of Science and Technology effectively sidestepped Mr. Trump's move, bringing about alignment on an issue of rising global importance between the world's second-largest economy -- China -- and California, whose economy is the largest of any U.S. state and the sixth largest in the world.¶Brown signed similar collaboration agreements over the past several days with leaders in two Chinese provinces, Jiangsu and Sichuan.¶Like the Paris accord, the deals are all nonbinding. They call for investments in low-carbon energy sources, cooperation on climate research and the commercialization of cleaner technologies. The agreements do not establish new emission reduction goals.¶The U.S. has long been a major player in the clean energy arena, driving innovations in electric cars, renewable power and other sectors of the industry. California, with some of the strictest climate controls in the nation, has been at the forefront of the sector.¶China in recent years overtook the U.S. as the world leader in renewable power development. But it has also struggled to integrate its sprawling wind and solar facilities into an electricity grid still dominated by coal-fueled power plants.¶At the same time, Chinese leaders face growing public pressure at home to reduce the health-damaging smog that blankets many urban areas.¶China is by far the world's largest user of coal, which accounts for almost two-thirds of its energy use and has made it the No. 1 emitter of climate-changing greenhouse gases.¶Communist Party leaders pledged that greenhouse gas emissions will peak no later than 2030 under the Paris pact, and start to fall after then. They have canceled the planned construction of more than 100 new coal-fired power plants and plan to invest at least $360 billion in green-energy projects by the end of the decade. The nation's consumption of coal fell in 2016 for a third consecutive year, but rebounded slightly in 2017.¶It could meet its 2030 target a decade early.¶U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry also is attending this week's energy meeting in Beijing. Observers say delegates from other countries will be listening closely to the former Texas governor to gauge how Trump administration policies will shape global energy trends.¶During a Tuesday forum devoted to capturing carbon dioxide emitted from coal plants and other large industrial sources, Perry said his agency was pursuing an ""all of the above"" strategy that includes research intended to spur innovation for coal, nuclear, renewables and other fuels. He left the event without taking questions.¶Perry is from a state known for its oil production but that has also had significant renewables development. Texas has some of the largest wind farms in the country and a fast-expanding solar sector.¶Such U.S. advances in renewables won't simply disappear under Trump, said David Sandalow, a former undersecretary of energy in the Obama administration now at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy. Too many companies and states are heavily invested in the sector for that to happen, he said.¶But a lack of government support for clean energy will cost the U.S. jobs, Sandalow added, with cuts to research programs that Trump has proposed being a sign of what's to come.¶""It's backward looking, and it's going to hurt the U.S.,"" he said. ""The contrast with what's happening in China could not be more stark.""¶Interviewed Tuesday morning on American cable channel MSNBC, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt touted U.S. emissions reductions over past years and said despite withdrawing from the Paris accord, the Trump administration would continue to engage others, particularly developing nations, on the effort.¶""We have a strong, strong approach to reducing emissions. We have nothing to be apologetic about,"" Pruitt said. ""America is not going to be disengaged, we are going to maintain engagement.""¶Mr. Trump is a strong advocate of boosting U.S. fossil fuel industries, in particular coal mining. Cheap natural gas and tighter pollution restrictions toppled coal from its dominant position in the U.S. power sector during Mr. Obama's tenure. Experts say it's unlikely to regain that position anytime soon, regardless of what President Trump does.¶Without mentioning Mr. Trump by name, Brown told attendees at a forum on electric vehicles that ""there are still people in powerful places who are resisting reality.""¶Later, when the AP asked what could prompt the U.S. to return to the forefront of climate change efforts, Brown replied: ""Science, facts, the world, the marketplace.""¶ ",0

    ","¶WASHINGTON -- The top-ranking diplomat at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing has abruptly resigned, telling colleagues he is leaving the foreign service over disagreements with Trump administration policy, U.S. officials said Monday.¶A CBS News source in the embassy confirms David Rank resigned over the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate accord.¶The source says Rank called a town hall meeting of embassy employees Monday afternoon. Most people thought he was going to announce a visit by President Trump, but instead he announced his resignation, citing the decision to leave the Paris agreement as the reason.¶The State Department confirmed Rank's retirement, saying it was a ""personal decision"" but offering no details about his reasons for stepping down.¶More in Climate Change¶Rank was a 27-year career foreign service officer with experience in Afghanistan, Taiwan, Greece and Mauritius.¶He was No. 2 at the embassy, in charge pending the arrival of Trump's new ambassador to China, former Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, who was confirmed by the Senate last month.¶Rank's resignation was first reported by John Pomfret, editor-at-large for the website, SupChina.¶Mr. Trump announced America's withdrawal from a global climate change pact last week. That kept an election campaign promise, but fanned fears of the U.S. abdicating its global leadership role and shunning international consensus on the world's most pressing issues. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was among Trump advisers who had been quietly lobbying for the U.S. to stay in the pact.¶Cooperation with China on combating climate change was often cited by the Obama administration as an area in which Washington and Beijing were able to work together, despite tensions in other areas of the relationship.¶China and the U.S. are the world's two largest emitters of manmade carbon dioxide, considered a top cause of climate change, and agreement between them on capping emissions helped pave the way for the Paris agreement among more than 190 nations.",0

    ","¶Some of the biggest names in technology — from Apple to Amazon, Google, Lyft and Spotify — have jumped on board the growing movement of businesses and civic organizations committed to honoring the Paris Agreement on climate change, regardless of the U.S. government's lack of support. The announcement comes days after President Trump announced his decision to withdraw from the landmark deal signed by 195 nations. ¶""In the absence of leadership from Washington, states, cities, colleges and universities and businesses representing a sizeable percentage of the U.S. economy will pursue ambitious climate goals, working together to take forceful action and to ensure that the U.S. remains a global leader in reducing emissions,"" the coalition, which now consists of more than 1,000 cities, counties, states, universities and businesses, said in a statement released Monday. ¶Going by the name ""We Are Still In,"" the coalition called itself ""the broadest cross section of the American economy yet assembled in pursuit of climate action."" It includes states like New York and California and more than a dozen Fortune 500 companies. ¶More in Climate Change¶The effort is led by philanthropist and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.¶""In the absence of a supportive federal coordinating role, [city, state, business, and civil society] actors will more closely coordinate their own decarbonization actions. Collectively, they will redouble their efforts to ensure that the U.S. achieves the carbon emissions reductions it pledged under the Paris Agreement,"" Bloomberg wrote in a letter to the United Nations secretary-general. ¶He added: ""We do not intend to slow down.""¶The philanthropist has promised to contribute the $15 million the United Nations climate change secretariat now stands to lose from Washington. ¶The president's decision to pull out of the Paris Agreement, which allows individual countries to set their own targets for reducing carbon emissions, has dramatically increased pressure on city, state and private sector leaders to do more to fight global warming within their own domains — beginning a new and complex chapter in the U.S. fight against climate change. ¶But despite growing participation, the newly formed coalition was short on specific institutional commitments to lower carbon emissions. Bloomberg said he will take the lead on coordinating specific, quantifiable commitments in the coming months. ¶So far, pledges have largely come from cities and states: in the days since the president's announcement, 211 U.S. mayors have pledged to follow Paris Agreement standards for their cities and nine U.S. governors have formed a ""climate alliance"" to coordinate statewide action. ¶Cities and states can take steps to reduce emissions within their borders in multiple ways. For instance, local and state governments can do business with utilities that heavily rely on renewable energy and can invest in public transit over single-vehicle infrastructure.¶California, with the world's sixth-largest economy, is using that clout to make deals of its own. In Beijing Tuesday, California Governor Jerry Brown signed an agreement with China pledging to work together on reducing emissions and developing so-called green technologies.¶""Nobody can stay on the sidelines. We can't afford any dropouts in the tremendous human challenge to make the transition to a sustainable future,"" Brown told The Associated Press. ""Disaster still looms, and we've got to make the turn.""¶Lynelle Cameron, president of the Autodesk Foundation, expressed optimism that business leaders appear to be moving off the sidelines on climate change. ¶""In Trump's first few months in office, he has done more to catalyze and motivate the private sector than Hurricane Katrina or Sandy, or the work of talented environmental organizations put together,"" Cameron wrote in an op-ed for CNBC. ""Trump's latest decision will activate the private sector like we've never seen before.""¶Two prominent business leaders, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and Disney chairman Bob Iger, resigned from the White House business advisory council last week to protest the president's decision. ¶Am departing presidential councils.

    ","¶UNITED NATIONS -- Secretary-General Antonio Guterres opened the first-ever U.N. conference on oceans Monday with a warning that the seas are ""under threat as never before,"" with one recent study warning that discarded plastic garbage could outweigh fish by 2050 if nothing is done. ¶The U.N. chief told presidents, ministers, diplomats and environmental activists from nearly 200 countries that oceans -- ""the lifeblood of our planet"" -- are being severely damaged by pollution, overfishing and the effects of climate change as well as refuse. ¶The five-day conference, which began on World Environment Day, is the first major event to focus on climate since President Donald Trump announced last Thursday that the United States will withdraw from the landmark 2015 Paris Climate Agreement - a decision criticized by Bolivia's President Evo Morales and other speakers. ¶More in Climate Change¶Guterres said the aim of the conference is ""to turn the tide"" and solve the problems that ""we created."" ¶He said competing interests over territory and natural resources have blocked progress for far too long in cleaning up and restoring to health the world's oceans, which cover two-thirds of the planet. ¶""We must put aside short-term national gain to prevent long-term global catastrophe,"" Guterres said. ""Conserving our oceans and using them sustainably is preserving life itself."" ¶General Assembly President Peter Thomson, a Fijian diplomat, said ""the time has come for us to correct our wrongful ways."" ¶""We have unleashed a plague of plastic upon the ocean that is defiling nature in so many tragic ways,"" he said. ""It is inexcusable that humanity tips the equivalent of a large garbage truck of plastic into the ocean every minute of every day."" ¶Thomson also warned that illegal and destructive fishing practices and harmful subsidies for fisheries ""are driving our fish stocks to tipping points of collapse."" And he said increasing human-caused carbon emissions are not only driving climate change but causing rising sea levels by warning the oceans and making them more acidic with less oxygen which harms marine life. ¶Thomson said the conference probably represents the best opportunity ever ""to reverse the cycle of decline that human activity has brought upon the ocean"" and spur action to meet the U.N. goal for 2030 to conserve and manage the ocean's resources. ¶The conference asked governments, U.N. bodies, and civil society groups to make voluntary commitments to take action to improve the health of the oceans. So far, over 730 commitments have been received, most on managing protected areas, according to conference spokesman Damian Cardona. ¶At the end of the conference on Friday, nearly 200 countries will issue a Call for Action addressing marine issues which Cardona said has already been agreed. ¶It urges nations to implement long-term and robust measures to reduce the use of plastics, including plastic bags, and counteract sea-level rise that threatens many island nations as well as rising ocean temperatures and increasing ocean acidity. ¶Micronesia's President Peter Christian said Pacific islanders are concerned that the ocean has been ""left to heal itself"" after being used as ""a dumping ground for industrial waste,"" a weapons' testing ground, and being polluted by humans on shores and ships at sea. ¶Stressing the importance of all countries being part of the Paris agreement, Christian said in an apparent reference to Trump's decision: ""While some may continue to deny man's culpability for the damaging effects of climate change on islands and islanders ... no man, no island, no village and no nation can deny that trash in our oceans is of man's own doing."" ¶""And for this, man must clean up his mess,"" he said. ¶Bolivia's Morales was more forthright, telling the conference that the government of the United States, one of the world's ""main polluters,"" decided to leave the Paris Agreement, ""denying science, turning your backs on multilateralism and attempting to deny a future to upcoming generations."" ¶This ""has made it the main threat to mother earth and life itself,"" Morales said. ¶Baron Waqa, president of Nauru, the smallest U.N. member with just over 10,000 people and a single island of just 21 square kilometers, said the nation's exclusive economic zone is over 15,000 times larger and its economic survival depends on tuna. ¶While Nauru and seven neighboring islands have taken action ""to sustainably manage our tuna,"" Waqa said tuna fishing is still threatened by illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing which he said ""is a criminal act, akin to piracy, and must be addressed with urgency."" ¶Waqa urged governments, businesses and civil society to support the Tuna 2020 Traceability Declaration to ensure that all tuna products can be tracked from the vessel where the fish is caught to the final buyer.

""We're going to do it because it's the right thing to do.""¶The non-partisan organization is made up of all 1,408 mayors of American cities with populations greater than 30,000.  Speaking on behalf of his counterparts, Jon Mitchell, a Democrat from New Bedford, Mass., argued while it's hard to quantify the exact level of carbon emissions that cities have achieved, he believes what is clear is that initiatives have long been underway in cities across the country. He listed LED lighting, proliferation of solar technology, and the promotion of bike share programs as examples of how cities across the nation are doing their part to help.¶""Virtually every city in America is doing these things,"" Mitchell said. ""And to the extent that any of these initiatives are cost prohibitive, most of the states have incentive programs in place to fill the market gaps. So, regardless of what the president says, these things are not going to slow down. The commitment is there and the rationale is compelling.""¶That's precisely the attitude Bloomberg took in building his own coalition of local officials, businesses and other groups to help reach climate benchmarks.

We believe in states' rights and so, if a locality, municipality or a state wants to enact a policy that their voters, or their citizens believe in, then that's what they should do.""¶""Let me tell you that the mayors won't quit, because for us - we live close to our people and we care about the environment,"" Burnsville Mayor Elizabeth Kautz said. ""We care about energy efficiency and we want to make sure that people know that mayors won't quit.""¶Bloomberg said he has asked Macron and Hidalgo to convey to other national leaders that the United States, ""through strong action by local leaders, businesses, and investors, remains committed to fulfilling the Paris Agreement"" and that the United Nations has been receptive to his proposal.",0

""His decision was no, and that was the extent of our discussions."" ¶Pruitt, who couldn't cite specific scientific research suggesting climate change isn't real, also said the ""world applauded"" when the U.S. entered the Paris agreement in 2015 because other nations knew the agreement would ""shackle"" the U.S. economy. ¶Asked about his own views on climate change, Pruitt said human activity may contribute a small amount to climate change, but ""climate exaggerators"" have overwhelmed the scientific debate.¶Mr. Trump, who campaigned on backing out of the Paris agreement, has been highly skeptical of climate change in the past.  ¶In November 2012, he tweeted that the Chinese made up climate change to hamper America's economy. ¶The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.¶Mr. Trump's speech Thursday announcing the U.S. exit from the Paris accord didn't address the merits of combating climate change, only the damaging economic effects -- however accurate -- of the Paris deal for the U.S. ",0
Crack in Antarctic ice shelf could create one of the biggest icebergs in history,"

    ","¶BERLIN — Scientists say a crack along a key floating ice shelf in Antarctica indicates that a vast iceberg is close to breaking off.¶The process, known as calving, happens periodically but researchers are watching closely to see whether climate change is affecting the phenomenon.¶Scientists at the University of Swansea in Britain said Thursday the rift in the Larsen C ice shelf grew by 10.6 miles in six days.¶They say the break, when it comes, could produce one of the largest icebergs ever recorded.¶More in Climate Change¶University of Colorado scientist Ted Scambos says the shelf appears to be breaking further back than previously recorded calvings.¶Scambos adds that ""This berg is telling us something has changed, and not for the better. For now, though, the ice shelf will barely notice.""¶Climate change is changing conditions in Antarctica at a stunning pace. In certain parts of Antarctica, scientists describe an ""irreversible situation"" where ice flowing into the sea is quietly raising the risk of coastal floods across the world. Penguins are struggling to survive on the rapidly warming continent, according to research released in April. In addition, Antarctica is breaking records for low levels of sea ice in what scientists say is a sign of an overheating planet. ¶Thus far, 2017 is poised to be the earth's second hottest year on record.",0
How accurate was Trump's Paris climate agreement speech?,"

    ","¶President Trump's announcement from the White House Rose Garden Thursday that the U.S. is backing out of the Paris climate change agreement sparked outrage from his critics, and accolades from his supporters. ¶The president made a number of claims in his speech about the detrimental effects of the 2015 deal, and why the U.S. shouldn't be a part of it. Here are a few of the president's claims, and how accurate they were:¶President Trump: Claims ""absolutely tremendous economic progress since Election Day,"" adding ""more than a million private-sector jobs.""¶More in Climate Change¶True with a big caveat:  While it's true that over a million private-sector jobs have been created since Mr. Trump was elected, he was not yet president on Election Day -- so Obama gets the credit for November, December and most of January, since Mr. Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20 -- so around 500,000 jobs were created while Obama was president. And private-sector job creation from October through April (171,000 private-sector jobs a month) lags just slightly behind the pace of job creation for the previous six months (172,000), entirely under President Barack Obama.¶Mr. Trump: ""Even if the Paris Agreement were implemented in full, with total compliance from all nations, it is estimated it would only produce a two-tenths of one degree -- think of that; this much -- Celsius reduction in global temperature by the year 2100. Tiny, tiny amount.""¶False: Mr. Trump is lowballing the number, which the White House said was based on a Massachusetts Institute of Technology study. The co-founder of the MIT program on climate change, Jake Jacoby, says the Trump administration is citing an outdated report, taken out of context. Jacoby said the actual global impact of meeting targets under the Paris accord would be to curb rising temperatures by 1 degree Celsius, or 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit.¶""They found a number that made the point they want to make,"" Jacoby said. ""It's kind of a debate trick.""¶One degree may not sound like much, but Stefan Rahmstorf, a climate scientist at the Potsdam Institute in Germany, says, ""Every tenth of a degree increases the number of unprecedented extreme weather events considerably.""¶Mr. Trump: ""The cost to the economy at this time would be close to $3 trillion in lost GDP and 6.5 million industrial jobs.""¶This statement was based on a study by NERA Consulting that found that meeting the Obama administration's requirements in the Paris accord would cost the U.S. economy nearly $3 trillion over the next several decades. ""By 2040, our economy would lose 6.5 million industrial sector jobs - including 3.1 million manufacturing sector jobs,"" according to NERA.¶Not knowable: This study was paid for by two groups that have long opposed environmental regulation, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Council for Capital Formation. Both get financial backing from those who profit from the continued burning of fossil fuels. The latter group has received money from foundations controlled by the Koch brothers, whose company owns refineries and more than 4,000 miles of oil and gas pipelines.¶The study makes worst-case assumptions that may inflate the cost of meeting U.S. targets under the Paris accord while largely ignoring the economic benefits to U.S. businesses from building and operating renewable energy projects.¶Factcheck.org points out that under the worst-case scenario, the average annual reduction in GDP would be 6.8 percent from 2034-2040. But the study had a few different scenarios and, under one hybrid scenario, the average yearly reduction was 2.2 percent over that time period.¶Academic studies have found that increased environmental regulation doesn't actually have much impact on employment. Jobs lost at polluting companies tend to be offset by new jobs in green technology.¶President Trump: ""I cannot in good conscience support a deal that punishes the United States -- which is what it does -- the world's leader in environmental protection, while imposing no meaningful obligations on the world's leading polluters.... For example, under the agreement, China will be able to increase these emissions by a staggering number of years, 13. They can do whatever they want for 13 years. Not us. ¶""India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020. Think of it: India can double their coal production. There are many other examples. But the bottom line is that the Paris accord is very unfair at the highest level to the United States.""¶Under the Paris accord, India would still be increasing its overall emissions through 2030, but it aims to reduce its emissions intensity. India's target is to reduce its emissions intensity of GDP by 33 to 35 percent by 2030 below 2005 levels, according to the Climate Action Tracker.¶There are a few things wrong with this. On a pure carbon emissions number, yes, China emits more pollution than the U.S., but India lags the U.S. However, the more fair way to look at this is probably per-capita. On a per-capita basis, ""the U.S. pumped out more CO2 than China and India combined in 2015,"" according to Factcheck.org.¶CBS News' Kathryn Watson contributed to this report",0

It's unclear how their submission to the U.N. would work because there is no formal process for entities that are not countries to join the deal, the report said. ¶Mayors of Los Angeles, Salt Lake City, Atlanta and Pittsburgh have signed onto the effort, the report said, among many others. Some of the university presidents come from schools including Wesleyan, Brandeis and Emory. Democratic governors Andrew Cuomo of New York, Jerry Brown of California and Jay Inslee of Washington are also organizing an effort. ¶More in Climate Change¶Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is helping to coordinate the plan to circumvent Mr. Trump's decision. His charitable organization, Bloomberg Philanthropies, says it will commit up to $15 million to help fill the gap left by the U.S. as a result of backing out of the deal. ¶""Mayors, governors, and business leaders from both political parties are signing onto to a statement of support that we will submit to the U.N. – and together, we will reach the emission reduction goals the United States made in Paris in 2015,"" Bloomberg said in a statement.

    ","¶Corporate America overwhelmingly, if fruitlessly, urged President Donald Trump to keep the U.S. in the Paris climate agreement. Why? Support for fighting climate change is in their own self-interest¶Likely reasons for business' backing of the accord range from its public relations impact to the 195-nation pact's value in aiding particular business strategies, such as the energy supermajors' natural gas operations. ""If you were a large corporation, the herd instinct told you how to chime in"" on backing the international accord, said Bill McKibben, a Middlebury College professor and environmental advocate.¶In announcing that the U.S. was pulling out of the Paris treaty on Thursday, Mr. Trump said it ""hamstrings the United States"" and would cost jobs in a host of industries such as coal and steel. The market reaction to Mr. Trump's speech from the White House Rose Garden was mixed. ¶More in Climate Change¶Peabody Energy (BTU), the largest coal company, was down 0.6 percent on Thursday, and No. 2 Arch Coal (ARCH) rose almost 0.6 percent. The largest steel firm, Nucor (NUE), advanced 1.7 percent.¶Agreed to in 2015, with enthusiastic support from then-President Barack Obama, the deal committed signers to voluntarily reducing their greenhouse gas emissions in a bid to fight climate change.The U.S. is the world's second-largest producer of carbon emissions, after China.¶Mr. Trump's decision flew in the face of a vocal campaign by large companies to keep America in the agreement, and it sparked anger among some chief executives. ""Climate change is real,"" Jeff Immelt, CEO of General Electric (GE), said in a tweet after the president's announcement. ""Industry must now lead and not depend on government.""  ¶In the wake of Mr. Trump's speech, Elon Musk, head of electric-car maker Tesla (TSLA), resigned from the president's business advisory council. ""Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,"" he tweeted.Bob Iger, chief of Walt Disney (DIS), followed suit in quitting the council over the Paris move.¶The hundreds of big companies that backed staying with the Paris accord run the full range of business sectors. They included retailers like Walmart (WMT), tech giants such as Apple (AAPL), automakers like General Motors (GM) and even the leading lights of the fossil fuel industry, notably Exxon Mobil (XOM). ¶Recently, 25 large corporations took out full-page ads in newspapers urging Mr. Trump to stick with the climate pact. ""By expanding markets for innovative clean technologies, the agreement generates jobs and economic growth,"" it read. ¶And Darren Woods, CEO of Exxon, wrote a letter to the president arguing that staying in the agreement would ensure that ""the United States will maintain a seat at the negotiating table."" At the company's shareholder meeting Wednesday, he said, staying in was vital ""to ensure a level playing field so that all energy sources and technologies are treated equitably."" ¶""I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris,"" the president said. In Mr. Trump's estimation, the Paris plan would result in 2.7 million lost American jobs lost by 2025, which environmentalists deride as wrongheaded. ¶The American Sustainable Business Council, a group of mainly smaller companies, argues that plenty of jobs can be created without harming the environment. ""The value of Paris to businesses is the clear market signal that the future is in lower carbon, rather than a chaotic and unsustainable future of business disruptions from rising seas and changing weather patterns,"" the group's CEO, David Levine, said in a statement. ""Even U.S. presidents cannot turn back the clock on history.""  ¶And indeed, employment in energy producers other than coal is surging. According to the U.S. Department of Energy in a January report, solar has more than twice as many U.S. jobs than coal -- 374,000 versus 160,000.¶Time was, of course, that Mr. Trump's stance was a widely held belief among American business leaders. They maintained that pollution reduction equaled job reduction. Things have changed as the public came to embrace many of environmentalists' tenets and started fearing man-made climate change.  ¶In fairness, there's no reason to question Corporate America's sincerity about fighting climate change. Company leaders want a livable world as much as anyone else. But business' advocacy for the Paris pact shows that, for a variety of reasons, support for fighting greenhouse gases now is in their own best bottom-line interest, as well. That's because:¶The accord isn't very radical. It legally requires no country to actually end greenhouse gas emissions.The agreement establishes loose and voluntary criteria to follow. In late 2015, every nation announced a nonbinding plan pledging to decrease the pumping of methane and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The accord's lack of hard mandates makes adhering to its benchmarks less than onerous.  ¶That's not to say the Paris deal is simply a feel-good exercise that will lead to no meaningful results. Fast-growing China, which has an enormous appetite for energy, has committed to weaning itself from rampant coal use because burning coal has led to an enormous pollution problem in Chinese cities. So Beijing plans to meet its targets under the Paris accord by ending construction of some 100 coal-fired electric power plants and shifting billions into vast  wind and solar projects.¶U.S. multinationals now will face a tougher time competing overseas. As the outliers in the international business community, American companies dread being at a disadvantage that may cost them sales. The 25-company ad calling on the president to stay with the climate deal contended that ""U.S. companies are well positioned to lead in these [overseas] markets. Withdrawing from the agreement will limit our access to them and could expose us to retaliatory measures."" ¶By the same token, they're leery that the U.S. government won't be able to strike favorable trade compacts that will benefit American exporters.¶It's good P.R. to support the deal. About seven out of 10 registered voters, or 69 percent, say the U.S. should participate in the Paris agreement, compared with 13 percent who say that the country should not, according to a November 2016 poll by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. ""For consumer-facing companies in particular,"" said environmentalist McKibben, ""it's not popular to oppose the Paris agreement.""¶Certainly, backing the deal is good cover for the oil industry. Exxon, for instance, is fighting an investigation led by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman that seeks to show that it and other energy behemoths are responsible for climate change and have covered up their culpability.  ¶In talking about the Trump White House, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under Bill Clinton, told CNBC Thursday that he ""never imagined"" an administration that's ""way to the right of Exxon on a fossil fuel issue."" ¶While the National Mining Association, which lobbies for the coal industry, favored pulling out of the Paris framework, two coal companies opted for staying. Cloud Peak Energy and Peabody told the White House that remaining in the accord would foster U.S. coal sales to emerging markets that still want the fuel, news reports said. ¶It helps gas producers and hurts coal. Exxon, for instance, is the nation's largest natural gas producer, and gas is displacing coal as the preferred power-generating fuel. Gas is cheaper to produce and cleaner. Benjamin Zycher, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, wrote that ""because the U.S. has a lot of cheap natural gas -- a substantial part of which is produced by ExxonMobil -- [the company] will have a competitive advantage within the agreement.""  ¶Polluting industries can carve out an exception for themselves. While GM and some other automakers have voiced various degrees of support for the Paris treaty, they still push back against stricter federal tailpipe emissions standards. This winter, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers wrote Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt to ask that he squelch Obama-issued emissions' rules. The trade group didn't respond to a request for comment about Mr. Trump's decision to exit the Paris accord.¶Meanwhile, Exxon is under investor pressure to show it's aiding the anti-climate change efforts. On Wednesday, over 62 percent of shareholders backed a nonbinding resolution requiring it to disclose the risks to its business from climate change and what policies it's following to mitigate them. Last year, only 38 percent had backed a similar motion.¶Under CEO Woods, Exxon now has to decide what to do, and a spokesman indicated the board will look at the issue. The company said it already has spent nearly $8 billion in emissions-reduction technology and research on shifting to lower-carbon energy products and processes.¶Mr. Trump characterized his decision as helping the forgotten men and women across this country. Some say that's not true. But along the way, he has evidently forgotten the U.S. business community. ",0

After President Donald Trump announced on Thursday that the U.S. will withdraw from the agreement, Kerry took to Facebook to criticize the decision.¶He accused Mr. Trump of ""unilaterally walking backwards from science and backwards from leadership on behalf of polluters and fringe ideologues,"" and said it ""may be the most self-defeating action in American history.""¶Kerry spoke with CBS News' Anthony Mason on June 1, 2017, on ""CBS Evening News."" What follows is a full transcript of the interview.¶ANTHONY MASON: Mr. Secretary, you call this an unprecedented forfeiture of American leadership. What do you mean? ¶SEC. JOHN KERRY: Well when 195 countries come together working for decades and the United States of America takes the leadership in order to join with China, the two largest emitters in the world, of carbon emissions, to say we must begin to reduce, and then to have a president stand up and simply unilaterally walk away from that, without scientific basis, not based on facts in terms of our economy. The truth is the president... no country is required by this agreement to do anything except what that country decided to do for itself. So Donald Trump is not telling the truth to the American people when he says 'we have this huge burden that's been imposed on us by other nations,' no. We agreed to what we would do. We designed it. It's voluntary and the president of the Unites States could simply have changed that without walking away from the whole agreement¶MASON: The president portrayed it in economic terms and said it gave other nations a financial advantage.¶KERRY: No. That's just not true. The fastest growing job in America, the biggest single job is wind turbine technician. 2.6 million clean energy jobs have been created in America and guess what, half of them, 50 percent, are in states that Donald Trump won. He's going to hurt those people. He's going to hurt those states. America is going to lose economic leadership in this¶MASON: So do you think we have something to lose if we back out?¶KERRY: We have indeed. Do you think American businesses will flourish when they knock on the door of a country and say well we want to give you solar tech... they're going to say w'ell you guys just walked away from the deal. You guys aren't committed to this.' That's why major companies, among them, Exxon Mobile, major Fortune 500 companies, all supported staying in the Paris agreement. Because they know what this means in terms of their job base, their growth and the economy.¶MASON: The president said he was elected by the people of Pittsburgh, not the people of Paris.¶Kerry: Well indeed absolutely true but there's nothing in… what America has agreed to do in this that Paris dictated. There's nothing in what America agreed to do in this agreement that came from France or came from Britain or any other country. We are doing what America decided we could do and should do that was appropriate.¶KERRY: He said he would honor the timetable for withdrawal which would in effect take past the next election.¶KERRY: Well he said as of today he will stop the implementation. So it depends on what Scott Pruitt and the EPA and others continue to do. Tell me, where is the constituency in America to put coal sludge back into rivers and lakes? But that's what he's done. He's signed the executive order to do that. Where is the constituency to reduce the ability of cars to maintain lower automobile emissions? Why would you want to get rid of that? What Donald Trump is doing is serving the polluters and serving a narrow group of ideological interests. That's not leadership. That's abdication of responsibility, and this step does not make America first. It makes America last. ¶MASON: Mr. Secretary, thank you ¶KERRY: Thank you.",0

    ","¶U.S. President Donald Trump announced Thursday that the United States will withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, dealing a significant blow to international efforts to combat climate change. Speaking from the White House Rose Garden, Mr. Trump said the agreement ""is very unfair at the highest level to the United States."" What follows if the full text of the president's remarks.¶PRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you very much. Thank you. I would like to begin by addressing the terrorist attack in Manila. We are closely monitoring the situation and I will continue to give updates, anything happens during this period of time, but it is really sad as to what's going on throughout the world with terror. Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of those affected.¶Before we discuss the Paris accord, I'd like to begin with an update on our tremendous, absolutely tremendous economic progress since Election Day on November 8. The economy is starting to come back, and very, very rapidly. We've added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than 1 million private-sector jobs. ¶More in Climate Change¶I've just returned from a trip overseas where we concluded nearly $350 billion of military and economic development for the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. It was a very, very successful trip, believe me. (Applause) Thank you, thank you.¶In my meetings at the G7, we have taken historic steps to demand fair and reciprocal trade that gives Americans a level playing field against other nations. We're also working very hard for peace in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up -- and you see that, you see it all over -- from the previous administration, including getting many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against terror. Big, big contributions are being made by countries that weren't doing so much in the form of contributions. ¶One by one, we are keeping the promises I made to the American people during my campaign for president. Whether it's cutting job-killing regulations, appointing and confirming a tremendous Supreme Court justice, putting in place tough new ethics rules, achieving a record reduction in illegal immigration on our southern border, or bringing jobs, plants and factories back into the United States at numbers which no one until this point thought even possible, and believe me, we've just begun. The fruits of our labor will be seen very shortly, even more so.¶On these issues and so many more, we are following through on our commitments, and I don't want anything to get in our way.¶I am fighting every day for the great people of this country. Therefore, in order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and it's citizens, the U.S. will withdraw from the Paris climate accord. (Applause) Thank you. But begin negotiations to re-enter either the Paris accord or an entirely new transaction on terms that are fair to the U.S., its business, its workers, its people, its taxpayers.¶So we are getting out. But we will start to negotiate and we will see if we can make a deal that's fair. And if we can, that's great. And if we can't, that's fine.¶The Paris climate accord is simply the latest example of Washington entering an agreement that disadvantages the U.S., leaving American workers who I love and taxpayers to absorb the cost in terms of lost jobs and lower wages and vastly diminished economic production. Thus, as of today, the U.S. will cease all implementation of the non-binding Paris accord and the draconian and financial economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country.¶This includes ending the implementation of the Nationally Determined Contribution and, very importantly, the Green Climate Fund, which is costing the U.S. a vast fortune.¶Compliance with the terms of the Paris Accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States could cost America as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025 according to the National Economic Research Associates. This includes 440,000 fewer manufacturing jobs -- not what we need -- believe me, this is not what we need -- including automobile jobs, and the further decimation of vital American industries on which countless communities rely. They rely for so much, and we would be giving them so little.¶According to this same study, by 2040, compliance with the commitments put into place by the previous administration would cut production for the following sectors: paper down 12 percent; cement down 23 percent; iron and steel down 38 percent; coal -- and I happen to love the coal miners -- down 86 percent; natural gas down 31 percent. The cost to the economy at this time would be close to $3 trillion in lost GDP and 6.5 million industrial jobs, while households would have $7,000 less income and, in many cases, much worse than that.¶Not only does this deal subject our citizens to harsh economic restrictions, it fails to live up to our environmental ideals. As someone who cares deeply about the environment, which I do, I cannot in good conscience support a deal that punishes the United States -- which is what it does -- the world's leader in environmental protection, while imposing no meaningful obligations on the world's leading polluters.¶For example, under the agreement, China will be able to increase these emissions by a staggering number of years -- 13. They can do whatever they want for 13 years. Not us. India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions and billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries. There are many other examples. But the bottom line is that the Paris accord is very unfair, at the highest level, to the United States.¶Further, while the current agreement effectively blocks the development of clean coal in America -- which it does, and the mines are starting to open up. We're having a big opening in two weeks. Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, so many places. A big opening of a brand-new mine. It's unheard of. For many, many years, that hasn't happened. They asked me if I'd go. I'm going to try.¶China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So we can't build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020. Think of it: India can double their coal production. We're supposed to get rid of ours. Even Europe is allowed to continue construction of coal plants. ¶In short, the agreement doesn't eliminate coal jobs, it just transfers those jobs out of America and the United States, and ships them to foreign countries.¶This agreement is less about the climate and more about other countries gaining a financial advantage over the United States. The rest of the world applauded when we signed the Paris Agreement -- they went wild; they were so happy -- for the simple reason that it put our country, the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very big economic disadvantage. A cynic would say the obvious reason for economic competitors and their wish to see us remain in the agreement is so that we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound. We would find it very hard to compete with other countries from other parts of the world.  ¶We have among the most abundant energy reserves on the planet, sufficient to lift millions of America's poorest workers out of poverty. Yet, under this agreement, we are effectively putting these reserves under lock and key, taking away the great wealth of our nation -- it's great wealth, it's phenomenal wealth; not so long ago, we had no idea we had such wealth -- and leaving millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness.¶The agreement is a massive redistribution of United States wealth to other countries. At 1 percent growth, renewable sources of energy can meet some of our domestic demand, but at 3 or 4 percent growth, which I expect, we need all forms of available American energy, or our country (Applause) will be at grave risk of brownouts and blackouts, our businesses will come to a halt in many cases, and the American family will suffer the consequences in the form of lost jobs and a very diminished quality of life.¶Even if the Paris Agreement were implemented in full, with total compliance from all nations, it is estimated it would only produce a two-tenths of one degree -- think of that; this much -- Celsius reduction in global temperature by the year 2100. Tiny, tiny amount. In fact, 14 days of carbon emissions from China alone would wipe out the gains from America -- and this is an incredible statistic -- would totally wipe out the gains from America's expected reductions in the year 2030, after we have had to spend billions and billions of dollars, lost jobs, closed factories, and suffered much higher energy costs for our businesses and for our homes.¶As the Wall Street Journal wrote this morning: ""The reality is that withdrawing is in America's economic interest and won't matter much to the climate."" The United States, under the Trump administration, will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth. We'll be the cleanest. We're going to have the cleanest air. We're going to have the cleanest water. We will be environmentally friendly, but we're not going to put our businesses out of work and we're not going to lose our jobs. We're going to grow; we're going to grow rapidly. (Applause) ¶And I think you just read -- it just came out minutes ago, the small business report -- small businesses as of just now are booming, hiring people. One of the best reports they've seen in many years.¶I'm willing to immediately work with Democratic leaders to either negotiate our way back into Paris, under the terms that are fair to the United States and its workers, or to negotiate a new deal that protects our country and its taxpayers. (Applause)¶So if the obstructionists want to get together with me, let's make them non-obstructionists.  We will all sit down, and we will get back into the deal.  And we'll make it good, and we won't be closing up our factories, and we won't be losing our jobs.  And we'll sit down with the Democrats and all of the people that represent either the Paris Accord or something that we can do that's much better than the Paris Accord.  And I think the people of our country will be thrilled, and I think then the people of the world will be thrilled.  But until we do that, we're out of the agreement. ¶I will work to ensure that America remains the world's leader on environmental issues, but under a framework that is fair and where the burdens and responsibilities are equally shared among the many nations all around the world. ¶No responsible leader can put the workers -- and the people -- of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage. The fact that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States, while empowering some of the world's top polluting countries, should dispel any doubt as to the real reason why foreign lobbyists wish to keep our magnificent country tied up and bound down by this agreement: It's to give their country an economic edge over the United States. That's not going to happen while I'm President. I'm sorry. (Applause)¶My job as president is to do everything within my power to give America a level playing field and to create the economic, regulatory and tax structures that make America the most prosperous and productive country on Earth, and with the highest standard of living and the highest standard of environmental protection.¶Our tax bill is moving along in Congress, and I believe it's doing very well. I think a lot of people will be very pleasantly surprised.  The Republicans are working very, very hard. We'd love to have support from the Democrats, but we may have to go it alone. But it's going very well. ¶The Paris Agreement handicaps the United States economy in order to win praise from the very foreign capitals and global activists that have long sought to gain wealth at our country's expense. They don't put America first. I do, and I always will.  (Applause)¶The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement are the countries that have collectively cost America trillions of dollars through tough trade practices and, in many cases, lax contributions to our critical military alliance. You see what's happening. It's pretty obvious to those that want to keep an open mind.¶At what point does America get demeaned? At what point do they start laughing at us as a country? We want fair treatment for its citizens, and we want fair treatment for our taxpayers. We don't want other leaders and other countries laughing at us anymore.  And they won't be. They won't be.¶I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. (Applause) I promised I would exit or renegotiate any deal which fails to serve America's interests. Many trade deals will soon be under renegotiation. Very rarely do we have a deal that works for this country, but they'll soon be under renegotiation. The process has begun from day one. But now we're down to business.¶Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris accord, it includes yet another scheme to redistribute wealth out of the United States through the so-called Green Climate Fund -- nice name -- which calls for developed countries to send $100 billion to developing countries all on top of America's existing and massive foreign aid payments. So we're going to be paying billions and billions and billions of dollars, and we're already way ahead of anybody else. Many of the other countries haven't spent anything, and many of them will never pay one dime.¶The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars of which the United States has already handed over $1 billion -- nobody else is even close; most of them haven't even paid anything -- including funds raided out of America's budget for the war against terrorism. That's where they came. Believe me, they didn't come from me.  They came just before I came into office.  Not good.  And not good the way they took the money. ¶In 2015, the United Nation's departing top climate officials reportedly described the $100 billion per year as ""peanuts,"" and stated that ""the $100 billion is the tail that wags the dog.""  In 2015, the Green Climate Fund's executive director reportedly stated that estimated funding needed would increase to $450 billion per year after 2020.  And nobody even knows where the money is going to.  Nobody has been able to say, where is it going to?¶Of course, the world's top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated. America is $20 trillion in debt. Cash-strapped cities cannot hire enough police officers or fix vital infrastructure. Millions of our citizens are out of work. And yet, under the Paris accord, billions of dollars that ought to be invested right here in America will be sent to the very countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us. So think of that. ¶There are serious legal and constitutional issues as well. Foreign leaders in Europe, Asia, and across the world should not have more to say with respect to the U.S. economy than our own citizens and their elected representatives. Thus, our withdrawal from the agreement represents a reassertion of America's sovereignty. (Applause) Our Constitution is unique among all the nations of the world, and it is my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it. And I will.¶Staying in the agreement could also pose serious obstacles for the United States as we begin the process of unlocking the restrictions on America's abundant energy reserves, which we have started very strongly. It would once have been unthinkable that an international agreement could prevent the United States from conducting its own domestic economic affairs, but this is the new reality we face if we do not leave the agreement or if we do not negotiate a far better deal.¶The risks grow as historically these agreements only tend to become more and more ambitious over time. In other words, the Paris framework is a starting point -- as bad as it is -- not an end point. And exiting the agreement protects the United States from future intrusions on the United States' sovereignty and massive future legal liability. Believe me, we have massive legal liability if we stay in.¶As president, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to the American people. The Paris Accord would undermine our economy, hamstring our workers, weaken our sovereignty, impose unacceptable legal risks, and put us at a permanent disadvantage to the other countries of the world. It is time to exit the Paris accord -- (Applause) -- and time to pursue a new deal that protects the environment, our companies, our citizens, and our country.¶It is time to put Youngstown, Ohio, Detroit, Michigan, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania -- along with many, many other locations within our great country -- before Paris, France. It is time to make America great again. (Applause) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.¶Thank you very much. Very important. I'd like to ask Scott Pruitt, who most of you know and respect, as I do, just to say a few words.",0
What you need to know about the science of climate change,"

    ","¶Mike Augustyniak is the director of meteorology at CBS Minneapolis station WCCO.¶The president's announcement that the U.S. has pulled out of the Paris climate accord has renewed interest in the nearly two-year-old agreement. The way I see it – regardless of the final decision – anything that shines a spotlight on this important agreement is a gift.¶To understand why the Paris Agreement is important step in fighting global warming, you first need to understand the facts of climate change.¶More in Climate Change¶THE CONSENSUS IS CLEAR¶Human activities are influencing and changing the climate in ways that humanity has never experienced before, and these changes pose clear risks to humans and nature.  Choose your source — the U.S. Department of Defense; the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report, and its more than 400 contributing authors; the World Meteorological Organization; the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA); the American Geophysical Union (AGU); the 97% of climate scientists who agree; or the thousands of scientists who have published their findings in peer-reviewed scholarly journals.¶THE SCIENCE IS CLEAR¶The physics of how greenhouse gases affect the Earth's temperature (also called the Earth's energy balance) has been understood since the 19th century.  Yes: the science behind climate change is older than the light bulb.  While there are many heat-trapping greenhouse gases (methane, water vapor, and ozone, just to name a few) carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most important long-lived global warming gas.  It's also the gas that human activities influence the most, through the burning of fossil fuels.¶THE SCIENCE BEHIND CLIMATE CHANGE IS OLDER THAN THE LIGHT BULB¶Many people wonder how we can be so sure that CO2 and human activity is the main cause of global warming.  ""What about volcanoes?"" some ask; others wonder about sunspots, or the earth's wobbling axis (known as Milankovitch Cycles).  Computer models have been run backwards to determine the contributions that each of these factors, and others, have made to the change in global temperatures since the 1880s.  The results of more than 60 different models, run by 20 different organizations worldwide, all show that the rise in global temperature we are seeing today can only be replicated if human effects (i.e. an increase in atmospheric CO2) is added into the model.¶See for yourself: still images from this interactive visualization published by Bloomberg uses NASA's ModelE2 to show that the only way the model reproduces the global warming we've actually seen is if human effects and CO2 are added into the simulation.¶If you're not swayed by models, there are multiple other ""fingerprints"" that point to CO2 being responsible.¶SO, WHAT ABOUT CO2?¶Consistent readings of how much CO2 is in the atmosphere have been taken atop the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii since 1958; but, using tiny air bubbles trapped in glacial ice cores, we can reliably measure how much CO2 was in the atmosphere as far back as 800,000 years ago.¶What's shocking, but clear, is the amount of atmospheric CO2 hasn't been this high in 800,000 years; that's long before human civilization began.¶THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD: PULLING TOGETHER¶The goal of the historic agreement, signed in 2015 by nearly 200 nations (in the words of the authors) is to hold ""the increase in global average temperature to well below 2°C [3.6°F] above pre-industrial levels"". While 2°C threshold is generally agreed upon by politicians as a common rallying point to drive action, scientists know that the earth's average temperature has already risen about 1°C, and that we're already seeing profound impacts. Island nations actually pushed for the goal to be 1.5°C, as they have the most to lose from sea-level rise caused by global warming.¶How individual nations meet the pledge they signed on to is entirely up to them, but each country will be required to review (and possibly improve) their plan every five years, beginning in 2020. The U.S. plan, submitted by President Obama in March of 2015, is to reduce greenhouse emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent by 2025.  Developed nations (including the U.S., the E.U., and others) are also required to kick in $100 billion a year to help developing nations end their reliance on fossil fuels – a major contributor to atmospheric CO2.¶The treaty also specifies that nations who don't meet their pledge will face no international legal action; a stipulation stressed by the Americans.¶WHAT'S THE POINT, THEN?¶The hope is that even a nonbinding agreement can motivate governments and people to start acting on climate change, and to innovate along the way. It's more of a carrot than a stick, which banks on the optimism of humanity. The choices that you and I make, individually on a daily basis, can have just as big of an impact on the climate as any international agreement.",0

    ","¶The former chief of United Nations climate negotiations is slamming the White House for, in her words, having ""no understanding of the legal underpinning"" of the Paris Agreement.¶""I would call it a vacuous political melodrama,"" Christiana Figueres, former executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, said of President Trump's Rose Garden announcement that the U.S. would turn its back on the Paris Agreement, a landmark international accord to reduce carbon emissions and build global capacity for clean energy. ¶The president's announcement misrepresented how withdrawal from the Paris Agreement actually works, Figueres said. In actuality, she explained, the process for withdrawing from the agreement signed by 195 nations is complex and lengthy, taking four years to complete. ¶More in Climate Change¶""Apparently the White House has no idea how an international treaty works,"" she said. ¶Figueres has been a prominent voice in recent years arguing that nations should embrace clean energy industries and abandon ""dirty"" industries, like coal, not only for the health of the planet but for the health and growth of their economies. ¶Speaking alongside Figueres in a conference call for reporters, California Governor Jerry Brown said his state remains ""all in"" in its commitment to reducing carbon emissions regardless of the federal government's decision. ¶""California will resist because his effort is misguided,"" Brown told reporters after the president's announcement. ""I will even say this is an insane move by the president.""¶Brown pledged to continue his state's momentum towards a clean economy. California has a goal of 50 percent renewable energy by 2030. ¶In withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, the U.S. puts itself in the company of Syria and Nicaragua — the only two countries in the world who refused to sign the accord. The U.S. is the biggest carbon polluter in the world, according to data compiled by the United Nations. ¶Thus far, 147 countries have ratified the agreement, meaning it is the law of the land in those nations. In exiting the pact, some fear the U.S. could trigger a domino effect among other countries. ¶Anticipating U.S. withdrawal, climate change advocates have closely scrutinized world leaders' comments regarding their commitment to the Paris Agreement in recent weeks. Many have spoken out to confirm they remain committed to the deal.¶Speaking in Berlin on Wednesday, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said fighting climate change is a ""global consensus"" and an ""international responsibility"" and reaffirmed China's commitment to the deal. ¶""It's not invented by China,"" he said of climate change. It was a pointed reference to a 2012 tweet by Mr. Trump falsely claiming that ""the concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.""¶China plans to introduce a nationwide cap-and-trade system later this year. ¶The president's reversal of U.S. policy comes on the heels of his participation in the G7 Summit last week, where his relationship with world leaders, particularly German chancellor Angela Merkel, appeared strained. Merkel has long championed the Paris Agreement. ¶Merkel alluded to lowering expectations for U.S. leadership on climate change and other issues after the summit. ¶""The times in which we could completely depend on others are on the way out. I've experienced that in the last few days,"" Merkel said at an election rally in Munich on Sunday.¶She added: ""We Europeans truly have to take our fate into our own hands.""¶The Kremlin has signaled that the nature of the Paris Agreement will fundamentally change if key participants pull out. ¶""President (Vladimir) Putin signed this convention in Paris. Russia attaches great significance to it,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Thursday, while also adding a caveat: ""At the same time, it goes without saying that the effectiveness of this convention is likely to be reduced without its key participants."" Russia has not yet ratified the agreement.",0

    ","¶President Trump followed through on his campaign promise to withdraw from the Paris climate accord by formally announcing the U.S. intention to pull out of the agreement, saying the move would help American workers and the economy.¶""The Paris climate accord is simply the latest example of Washington entering an agreement that disadvantages the U.S. leaving American workers, who I love, and tax payers to absorb the cost in terms of lost jobs and lower wages and vastly diminished economic reduction,"" Mr. Trump said. ¶Following Mr. Trump's announcement , reaction from both supporters applauding Mr. Trump's move, as well as those who disagree with the pull out, was swift across the political spectrum.¶""The nations that remain in the Paris Agreement will be the nations that reap the benefits in jobs and industries created.  I believe the United States of America should be at the front of the pack.  But even in the absence of American leadership; even as this Administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future; I'm confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we've got.""¶More in Climate Change¶""Removing the United States from the Paris Agreement is a reckless and indefensible action. It undermines America's standing in the world and threatens to damage humanity's ability to solve the climate crisis in time. But make no mistake: if President Trump won't lead, the American people will. President Trump's decision is profoundly in conflict with what the majority of Americans want from our president; but no matter what he does, we will ensure that our inevitable transition to a clean energy economy continues.""¶""The Paris climate agreement was simply a raw deal for America. Signed by President Obama without Senate ratification, it would have driven up the cost of energy, hitting middle-class and low-income Americans the hardest. In order to unleash the power of the American economy, our government must encourage production of American energy. I commend President Trump for fulfilling his commitment to the American people and withdrawing from this bad deal.""¶""I applaud President Trump and his administration for dealing yet another significant blow to the Obama Administration's assault on domestic energy production and jobs. President Obama made commitments in this deal based off a costly power plan that we knew at the time was on shaky legal ground. By withdrawing from this unattainable mandate, President Trump has reiterated his commitment to protecting middle class families across the country and workers throughout coal country from higher energy prices and potential job loss.""¶""President Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement is a devastating failure of historic proportions. Future generations will look back on President Trump's decision as one of the worst policy moves made in the 21st century because of the huge damage to our economy, our environment and our geopolitical standing. Pulling out of the Paris agreement doesn't put America first, it puts America last in recognizing science, in being a world leader and protecting our own shore line, our economy and our planet. It's now crystal clear President Trump is comfortable both ceding the moral high ground and the economic upper hand to countries like China, and endangering the future of our planet.""¶""By walking away from this pact, President Trump is abandoning America's leadership position in the fight against the climate crisis and is sending a strong message to the rest of the world to create, design and manufacture clean energy solutions and create jobs elsewhere.  If President Trump wants nations like China and India to take stronger and swifter action on climate, then he should do so through the accountability and enforcement provisions in the Paris Agreement, not by breaking our word and storming out of the room."" ¶Today President Trump announced he has decided the United States will leave the Paris Agreement under the United Nations...¶Climate change requires a global approach. I'm disappointed in the President's decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement #mepolitics¶Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.¶Disappointed with today’s decision on the Paris Agreement. Climate change is real. Industry must now lead and not depend on government.¶When climate change is already causing devastating harm, we don't have the moral right to turn our backs on efforts to preserve this planet.¶""Today the President announced that the United States will no longer be bound by an agreement unilaterally entered into by the Obama Administration. This was neither submitted to nor ratified by the U.S. Senate, and is not in the best long term economic interest of the United States. President Trump's decision will prove to be the right course of action and one I fully support.¶I support President Trump’s desire to re-enter the Paris Accord after the agreement becomes a better deal for America and business.¶As the Mayor of Pittsburgh, I can assure you that we will follow the guidelines of the Paris Agreement for our people, our economy & future. https://t.co/3znXGTcd8C¶""Withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement isn't just a setback, it's irresponsible. This damages our nation's reputation as an international leader and puts future generations at risk to the threat of climate change. Boston will not standby given what's at stake. As Mayor, I will continue to work with U.S. Mayors and cities around the world to uphold the tenets of the Paris climate agreement and protect Boston against the very real impacts of climate change.""¶""As a Governor, I always worked to balance economic growth and environmental protection.  We can, and we must do both.  President Trump acted in America's best interest, moving away from a flawed agreement that placed too heavy a burden on American jobs, and opening the door to a new agreement that reaches the right balance.  America will remain a leader in environmental protection.  But we will not jeopardize our economy in order to please other counties that don't come anywhere near our environmental standards.""¶""The decision by the United States to withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change is a major disappointment for global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote global security. The Secretary-General remains confident that cities, states and businesses within the United States -- along with other countries -- will continue to demonstrate vision and leadership by working for the low-carbon, resilient economic growth that will create quality jobs and markets for 21st century prosperity. It is crucial that the United States remains a leader on environmental issues.""",0

    ","¶Former President Obama, without mentioning his successor's name, criticized President Trump for deciding to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, which his administration helped negotiate, and which he signed. ¶""Even in the absence of American leadership; even as this Administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future; I'm confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we've got,"" the former president said in a statement.   ¶In his announcement Thursday afternoon that the U.S. would formally withdraw from the Paris pact, Mr. Trump claimed that the landmark climate agreement is ""very unfair, at the highest level, to the United States"" and expressed concern that the international deal would hinder U.S. economic growth and energy markets, like the coal industry.¶The president's decision makes U.S. one of three countries that have not signed on -- the other two are Syria and Nicaragua. Nicaragua refrained from signing because the punishments outlined in the climate agreement for non-complying nations were not harsh enough.¶More in Climate Change¶Mr. Trump, who had promised during his campaign to withdraw from the accord, saw the climate accord as a job-killer. Obama, however, saw the transition to renewable energy sources as a job creator. But in his statement, he suggested that the world's climate future might not be in the government's control anyway.¶""Simply put, the private sector already chose a low-carbon future,"" Obama wrote.  ""And for the nations that committed themselves to that future, the Paris Agreement opened the floodgates for businesses, scientists, and engineers to unleash high-tech, low-carbon investment and innovation on an unprecedented scale."" ¶He also said that it was U.S. leadership on the world stage -- his administration's -- that made the Paris agreement possible. And what made that leadership possible, he added, ""was America's private innovation and public investment in growing industries like wind and solar – industries that created some of the fastest new streams of good-paying jobs in recent years.""

    ","¶The nationalist wing of the administration can add a point to the scoreboard after a messy and public months long battle inside the White House: President Trump, against the wishes of the rest of the world, defiantly quit the Paris Agreement on climate change on Thursday in the Rose Garden.¶""I am fighting every day for the great people of this country,"" Mr. Trump announced. ""Therefore, in order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and it's citizens, the U.S. will withdraw from the paris climate accord."" ¶""But we will start to negotiate and we will see if we can make a deal that's fair. And if we can, that's great. And if we can't, that's fine,"" he added. ¶More in Climate Change¶The President's inclination was always to pull out of the Agreement, according to sources inside the White House. ¶But in a White House divided, the influential voices that ultimately pushed Mr. Trump to execute his campaign promise to exit the Agreement included Senior Advisor Steve Bannon, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, and Myron Ebell, a former Trump transition official and climate change skeptic. Twenty-one Republican Senators also called on Mr. Trump make a ""clean exit"" from the accord in two-page letter sent to the White House last week.¶Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Ivanka Trump, National Economic Council director Gary Cohn and several CEOs urged Mr. Trump to remain in the 195-nation pact. Mrs. Trump was integral to creating a semblance of a process, facilitating meetings on both sides of the aisle in order to better inform the President's decision making, according to a White House spokesperson.¶Faulting the Obama administration for a ""poorly negotiated deal,"" ultimately, the White House argues that remaining in the deal serves little to improve the climate, decapitates the U.S. coal industry, imposes unrealistic targets on the U.S. — but not on countries like China and India— and would cost the economy almost $3 trillion over several decades and 6.5 million industrial jobs. ¶""The Paris Climate Accord is simply the latest example of Washington entering an agreement that disadvantages the U.S. leaving American workers, who I love, and tax payers to absorb the cost in terms of lost jobs and lower wages and vastly diminished economic reduction,"" Mr. Trump said. ¶The rules of the pact, however, prevent Mr. Trump from formally exiting the Paris Agreement for another four years.¶Article 28 of the Agreement stipulates that the U.S. cannot withdraw from the agreement until three years from the date of entry – November 4th, 2016 -- and a withdrawal mandates a one-year notice period. A majority of Americans do not want the U.S. to exit the Paris Agreement.¶Jean-Claude Juncker, the President of the European Union, seized on this clause on Wednesday and mocked Mr. Trump's ""America First"" impulses.¶""So this notion, 'I am Trump, I am American, America First and I'm going to get out of it' – that won't happen,"" Mr. Juncker said. ""We tried to explain that to Mr. Trump in Taormina in clear German sentences. It seems out attempt failed, but the law is the law and it must be obeyed.""¶The administration could very well expedite the process and exit the Agreement in only one year if Mr. Trump decides to exit the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the underlying structure that facilitates international cooperation on climate change.¶""Pulling out of the UNFCCC is the quickest path to removing America from a costly, unworkable, and ineffective agreement that President Trump correctly said should be cancelled,"" the conservative Heritage Foundation argued in a report.¶The administration is still working on specifics to exit the plan but, as of Thursday, it will ""cease all implementation of the non-binding Paris Accord and the draconian and financial economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country,"" Mr. Trump said. ¶""This includes ending the implementation of the nationally determined contribution and the green climate fund which is costing the U.S. a vast fortune,"" he added. ¶Reverberations from Mr. Trump's decision were felt around the world, further unsettling allies after his appearances at the G7 and G20 summits of rich nations, followed by an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal from National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster and Senior Advisor Gary Cohn that candidly outlined the administration's transactional worldview.¶""The president embarked on his first foreign trip with a clear-eyed outlook that the world is not a 'global community' but an arena where nations, nongovernmental actors and businesses engage and compete for advantage,"" Cohn and McMaster wrote.¶World leaders did not hold back. On Thursday morning, before Mr. Trump's formal announcement, Germany and China pledged to continue to fight climate change. At a joint news conference with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, German Chancellor Angela Merkel praised China for becoming ""a more important and strategic partner.""¶""We are living in times of global uncertainty and see our responsibility to expand our partnership in all the different areas and to push for a world order based on law,"" she said.¶Andrew Light, a Senior Fellow at the World Resources Institute and a Former Climate Change Official from the State Department, told CBS News that withdrawing from the Paris Agreement will not only have severe diplomatic blowback, but will hand the Chinese more ""influence on a silver platter.""¶""Why would you willingly give put that leadership for what will come across as narrow ideological victory for a very small part of the White House?"" Light said.¶The most immediate effect, Light argued, is the shadow this decision casts over American businesses.¶""It's going to hurt us economically as well because it'll make us harder for American businesses to compete in the clear energy marketplace if the federal government isn't setting up deals to compete in that marketplace,"" he said. ¶An army of business leaders, from inventor and entrepreneur Elon Musk to Apple CEO Tim Cook, protested the decision. Twenty-four corporations including Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, and Unilever, penned an op-ed that ran in major U.S. newspapers, urging Mr. Trump to remain in the Agreement.¶""As businesses concerned with the well-being of our customers, our investors, our communities, and our suppliers, we are strengthening our climate resilience, and we are investing in innovative technologies that can help achieve a clean energy transition,"" the ad reads. ""For this transition to succeed, however, governments must lead as well.""¶Major energy corporations such as ExxonMobil, Chevron and BP also support the agreement, although coal companies do not. ¶Leading up to the announcement, it was business as usual for a White House with a President who thrives on controversy and chaos. Mr. Trump himself indulged in the suspense of his announcement on Twitter of Wednesday night, teasing Thursday's announcement.¶ ""I will be announcing my decision on Paris Accord, Thursday at 3:00pm. The White House Rose Garden. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"" he tweeted. ¶Noticeably missing from the process, as headlines continued to outpace a formal decision, was any regard for normal diplomatic protocols. Diplomats around D.C. scrambled to get a firm answer on what Mr. Trump's plans were before he announced them.¶""I don't know if it's complicated for partners or if its just disorganization within the White House itself,"" one Western diplomat reasoned.¶""In a formal discussion we had with some people from the National Security Council, they don't think the president is going to change. He is not used to an administrative process. He doesn't understand the need for bureaucracy, so now the administration is trying to adapt to the president [rather] than adapt the president to the bureaucracy,"" the diplomat concluded.",0

    ","¶The U.S. is pulling out of the Paris climate agreement, President Trump announced Thursday in the White House Rose Garden.  ¶""In order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its citizens, the United States will withdraw from the Paris climate accord,"" Mr. Trump said, and instead, he said that the U.S. will ""begin negotiations to reenter either the Paris accord or really a entirely new transaction"" on terms that he said are fair to U.S. businesses, workers and taxpayers.¶""So we're getting out, but we will start to negotiate and we will see if we can make a deal that's fair. And if we can, that's great, and if we can't, that's fine,"" he added.¶Pulling out of the agreement -- one of President Obama's major achievements in office -- could take up to three years to carry out. The decision was long-awaited, given that Mr. Trump promised on the campaign trail last year to withdraw from the pact. CBS News' Major Garrett confirmed Wednesday that the president was expected to pull out.¶The president claimed Thursday that the agreement ""disadvantages"" the U.S. and is ""very unfair, at the highest level, to the United States.""  ¶More in Climate Change¶""I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris,"" Mr. Trump said.    ¶He warned that the current agreement blocks the development of clean coal in America and said that the deal represents a ""massive redistribution of U.S. wealth to other countries."" He offered to sit down with Democratic leadership in Congress to help renegotiate a ""better deal.""  ¶""It's time to exit the Paris accord,"" Mr. Trump said, adding that it's time to pursue a new deal that protects the environment, the U.S. and its people. ¶The U.S. will now be one of only three countries out of 197 nations that isn't signed onto the agreement, with the other two being Nicaragua and Syria.  ¶The pact is aimed at combating climate change around the world and helping nations adapt to its effects by requiring countries to present plans to reduce carbon emissions. Specifically, it requires countries to set their own targets for reducing emissions by 2020. The Obama administration, for example, had committed the U.S. to reducing carbon emissions by 26 to 28 percent by 2025. The agreement also established a $100 billion fund to help vulnerable countries deal with the effects of climate change. ¶In a statement Thursday, Obama touted the benefits of the Paris agreement and blasted Mr. Trump's leadership. ¶""The nations that remain in the Paris Agreement will be the nations that reap the benefits in jobs and industries created,"" Obama said. ""I believe the United States of America should be at the front of the pack. But even in the absence of American leadership; even as this Administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future; I'm confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we've got."" ¶Last October, Obama celebrated the news that the agreement would take effect November 4. ¶""Today the world has officially crossed the threshold for the Paris Agreement to take effect,"" he said from the Rose Garden. ""Today the world meets the moment and if we follow through on the commitments this Paris Agreement embodies, history may well judge it as a turning point for our planet."" ¶During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump pledged to withdraw from the agreement, arguing at a North Dakota rally, ""This agreement gives foreign bureaucrats control over how much energy we use on our land, in our country."" The president has previously called climate change a ""hoax,"" tweeting in 2012, """"The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive."" ¶Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, applauded the president for withdrawing from what he called a ""raw deal for America,"" arguing that it would have ""driven up the cost of energy, hitting middle-class and low-income Americans the hardest."" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, also praised the move, saying that Mr. Trump has ""reiterated his commitment to protecting middle class families across the country and workers throughout coal country from higher energy prices and potential job loss.   ¶Besides Obama, other key Democrats lambasted Mr. Trump for pulling out of the deal.  ¶Former Vice President Al Gore, who made the climate change documentary ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" said that removing the U.S. from the agreement is a ""reckless and indefensible action.""

Speaking to reporters, a spokesman for President Vladimir Putin, Dmitry Peskov, said that Russia ""thinks highly"" of the accord and there was no alternative to it. But he added that its implementation would not be as effective ""without the key signatories.""¶Martin Schulz, a former European Parliament president who is hoping to unseat Merkel in Germany's upcoming general election, said he hoped Trump would think better of withdrawing from the accord. If the U.S. does leave, he said, the Europe Union should seek ways to balance out the economic advantage that U.S. companies might have from the absence of climate regulations. ¶""Those who want to export their goods and services to our market also have to accept our standards,"" he said.¶During a trip to Europe this week, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed India's commitment to fighting climate change and said it would be a ""crime"" to spoil the environment for future generations.¶President Donald Trump is expected to announce his decision on whether to abandon the Paris climate accord Thursday afternoon. Abandoning the pact would isolate the U.S. from a raft of international allies who spent years negotiating the 2015 agreement to fight global warming and pollution by reducing carbon emissions in nearly 200 nations.¶I will be announcing my decision on Paris Accord, Thursday at 3:00 P.M.  The White House Rose Garden.  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!¶While traveling abroad last week, Trump was repeatedly pressed to stay in the deal by European leaders and the Vatican. Withdrawing would leave the United States aligned only with Russia among the world's industrialized economies.¶While not mentioning the U.S. by name, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told reporters overnight that climate change is a ""global challenge"" that no country can ignore, and that her country would work with the European Union to uphold the deal, even if the U.S. pulls out.¶""No matter whether other countries' positions may change, we will continue to uphold"" a model of sustainable development, Hua said at a regularly scheduled news conference.¶When asked about whether China had spoken to the Trump administration about the climate agreement, she said, ""China and the United States have close communications about a wide variety of topics, and of course, this includes the issue of climate change."" ¶China is the top emitter of man-made carbon dioxide emissions, and the United States is second. Both were key to reaching an agreement at Paris in 2015, which came into force in November and aims to keep global warming below 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit compared with pre-industrial times.¶Trump claimed before taking office that climate change was a ""hoax"" created by China to hurt the U.S. economy, an assertion that stands in defiance of broad scientific consensus.¶In March, he signed an executive order to roll back Obama-era policies regulating carbon emissions. Trump said he wanted to create more coal mining jobs, though industry analysts say demand is likely to decline as the price of solar, wind and other alternatives falls.¶Scientists say Earth is likely to reach more dangerous levels of warming sooner if the U.S. retreats from its pledge because America contributes so much to rising temperatures. Calculations suggest withdrawal could release up to 3 billion additional tons of carbon dioxide a year - enough to melt ice sheets faster, raise seas higher and trigger more extreme weather.",0

    ","¶President Trump announced the U.S. will withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, the 2015 landmark international accord aimed at combating climate change. ¶Speaking in the White House Rose Garden Thursday, Mr. Trump said the U.S. would ""begin negotiations to reenter either the Paris accord or really an entirely new transaction on terms that are fair to the United States.""¶The move deals a significant blow to efforts to slow the rise of global temperatures and reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Mr. Trump framed his decision as motivated by economics, saying the Paris agreement harms U.S. businesses and workers ""to the exclusive benefit of other countries.""¶More in Climate Change¶Why is Mr. Trump pulling out of the agreement, and what does such a decision mean for the future of efforts to combat climate change? Here's a rundown of what the deal actually is, why Mr. Trump opposes it and what effects the U.S. pulling out could have.¶The Paris climate accord, known as the ""Paris Agreement"" by the United Nations, is an international agreement reached in 2015 aimed at reducing carbon emissions, slowing rising global temperatures and helping countries deal with the effects of climate change.¶Under the terms of the agreement, signatories committed to ""holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.""¶The deal requires countries to set their own targets for reducing emissions by 2020. The Obama administration committed the U.S. to reducing carbon emissions by 26 to 28 percent by 2025.¶The agreement also established a $100 billion fund to help vulnerable countries deal with the effects of climate change.¶The final text of the agreement was adopted at the Conference of Parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, known as COP21, in December 2015. The U.S., which took the lead in negotiating the deal, signed onto the agreement in April 2016, along with China, the European Union and 171 other nations. China and the U.S. account for nearly 40 percent of global carbon emissions. ¶The agreement took effect in November of that year, after nations accounting for 55 percent of global emissions ratified the treaty. As of May 2017, 147 parties have ratified the agreement, out of 195 who signed onto the accord. ¶The Obama administration committed the U.S. to the agreement without seeking ratification in the Senate, meaning Mr. Trump can withdraw support unilaterally. The U.S. joins Nicaragua and Syria as the only countries not participating in the agreement.¶Mr. Trump repeatedly called climate change a ""hoax"" during the presidential campaign. As president, he has taken significant steps to roll back Mr. Obama's climate change agenda. In March, Mr. Trump signed an executive order scrapping the Obama administration's ""Clean Power Plan,"" which mandated steep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions by power plants.¶The president vowed a year ago to ""cancel"" the Paris Agreement as president, but his administration repeatedly delayed making a final decision on the matter. As recently as last week, a senior White House official told reporters Mr. Trump was ""evolving"" on the issue of climate change after meeting with world leaders who encouraged him to preserve the accord. Secretary of Defense James Mattis said in an interview on ""Face the Nation"" Sunday that Mr. Trump was ""wide open"" to leaders' points of view on the Paris Agreement.¶But pulling out of the agreement is popular with Mr. Trump's political base, many of whom are skeptical of the science underlying climate change policy. Critics of the accord say the limits on emissions place an onerous and disproportionate burden on American businesses (although other business leaders disagree).¶The process of the U.S. withdrawing from the agreement could take at least three years, and scientists warn such a decision could have dire consequences for the planet.¶The Associated Press recently asked two dozens climate scientists what would happen if the U.S. reneges on its commitments under the Paris Agreement. They said that doing so would make it much more difficult to prevent crossing a dangerous threshold in global temperatures.¶Withdrawing from the deal could result in an additional 3 billion tons of carbon dioxide being released into the atmosphere each year, speeding up the rate of rising sea levels and melting ice sheets. The U.S. could contribute to an increase of as much as 0.3 degrees Celsius in global temperatures by the end of the century if if abandons the deal, according to one simulation.¶""The U.S. matters a great deal,"" Climate Interactive co-director Andrew Jones told the AP. ""That amount could make the difference between meeting the Paris limit of two degrees and missing it."" ",0

G-7 leaders were unable to reach unanimous agreement on climate change after Mr. Trump said he needed more time to decide whether to back a key climate accord.¶""The times in which we can fully count on others are somewhat over, as I have experienced in the past few days,"" Merkel told the crowd of some 2,500 that gathered to hear her and Bavarian governor Horst Seehofer.¶""And so all I can say is that we Europeans must really take our destiny into our own hands,"" she said, according to the dpa news agency. ¶According to his top economic adviser Gary Cohn, Mr. Trump's views on climate change were ""evolving,"" but Mr. Trump's delay in formally deciding whether or not to stay involved in the accord forced G-7 leaders to declare the U.S. is ""not in a position to join the consensus"" around the agreement.¶More recently, Defense Secretary James Mattis told CBS News' John Dickerson that he was part of some of the discussions in Brussels when talks of climate change came up. ¶""The president was open, he was curious about why others were in the position they were in, his counterparts in other nations.

Our Cover Story is reported by Martha Teichner:¶The windmills at Kinderdijk were built nearly 300 years ago, to pump water out of the surrounding farmland. But the Dutch have been outsmarting the water that's everywhere around them for a thousand years,  ¶It is a matter of survival. Twenty-six percent of the country is below sea level. ¶A massive storm surge barrier called the Maeslantkering, or Maeslant Barrier, was completed in 1997, to protect Rotterdam, Europe's largest port. It's equal in size to two Eiffel Towers, on their sides. ¶""This Maeslant Barrier is really here to safeguard us for the future,"" said Henk Ovink. He is water envoy for the King of the Netherlands -- a water ambassador, if you will.¶The Dutch are the world's go-to water management experts. Ovink spent two years working in areas hit by Superstorm Sandy. ""I said [to them], 'Did you think of preventing the disaster?' And they were like, 'Preventing the disaster? No, we couldn't. No, we have to make sure that we respond faster.' And I said, 'But suppose that there is no disaster because you prepared better?'""¶Who doesn't know the fable about the little Dutch boy who plugged the hole in a dike with his finger and saved his country? ¶What really happened taught the Netherlands about preparedness.  A ferocious North Sea storm in January 1953 flooded 500 square miles and killed more than 1,800 people. The Dutch built themselves a fortress of flood protection.¶Today, the Netherlands considers itself protected against a 10,000-year storm, in part thanks to research done by Deltares, a gee-whiz kind of place, with the largest wave machine in the world. ¶At their experimental facility, they can test structures that protect against the coast from ocean waves. ¶Deltares has worked with clients in 140 different countries, including the United States. Ap van Dongeren, a coastal flooding expert with Deltares, says all of their designs are assuming a rise in sea levels. ""And that will come with higher waves, so you have to figure that all into your design,"" he said. ¶Sea levels in Holland are expected to rise more than three feet by the end of the century. This projection prompted the Dutch government -- so used to walling water out at all costs -- to rethink, and let the water in instead.¶""For the Dutch, this is a revolution -- the idea that you're safer by lowering the dikes? This is extraordinary,"" said journalist Tracy Metz. ¶In her latest book, Metz, a longtime Netherlands resident, tells the story of how the farmers of Overdiepse Polder voluntarily agreed to give up their land so that it could become a spillway for a nearby river when it floods, in order to protect cities and towns downstream. ¶For Nol Hooijmaiers, it was a sacrifice with a silver lining. Huge mounds were constructed, so that he and a few of his neighbors were able to build brand new farms high above the floodplain. ¶""So you're happy, not angry?"" aske dTeichner.¶""Everybody is happy, ja,"" he replied. ¶Learning to accommodate water has led to innovation, for example: The Sand Engine (Zandmotor), a 24-million-ton pile of sand dumped off Holland's south coast. Nature was the engine that spread it into a flood barrier and a beach. ¶Jim Murley, the man in charge of confronting Miami-Dade County's water issues, and who has consulted Dutch engineers, says parts of the Dutrch model are applicable elsewhere. ""Just the way they go about thinking about managing water, how they use their land, creates a mindset,"" he said.¶In South Florida, flooding has become a regular occurrence. According to current estimates, sea levels here will rise as much as six feet by the end of the century. At stake: trillions of dollars of real estate and more than seven million lives.¶So at a vulnerable Miami waste water treatment plant, critical infrastructure is being rebuilt higher. ¶""We want to be sure that this facility will withstand a storm surge,"" Murley said. ¶In Miami Beach, streets are being raised 2.5 feet. A new art museum in downtown Miami is designed so flood water can flush through its foundation.¶Murley said, ""We're starting to think about how we might develop in the future, if we were having to live with water like the Dutch are.""¶Like Rotterdam, where there is a floating conference center surrounded by floating trees; and Amsterdam, with its whole neighborhood of floating houses.¶Jasper Dykshoorn and his wife, Sietske Jacobs, bought theirs five months ago.¶Teicher asked, ""It's weird having the water right out the window?""¶""Yeah, it is,"" Jacobs replied. ""But on the other hand it isn't. You're in a house.""¶She doesn't mind that the baby's crib is under water. The house is moored to a dock. So if the water level rises, so does the house.¶To Dykshoorn, as a Dutchman, the water is a fact of life -- no more, no less. ""It's in our veins, basically,"" he said. ¶      For more info: ",0

Meanwhile, gentoo penguins appeared to be adapting to changing circumstances. ¶“In one generation, I have personally witnessed the precipitous decline of once abundant Adélie and chinstrap penguin populations,” Oceanites founder and president Ron Naveen said in a statement. “These iconic birds are literally canaries in the coal mine. They provide critical insights into the dramatic changes taking place in the Antarctic.”¶The researchers theorize that gentoo, Adélie and chinstrap penguins might be adapting differently to changes in their food supplies. Left without the same supplies of krill, a small crustacean, gentoo penguins appear to be supplementing their diet by eating more fish. Adélie and chinstrap penguins, however, do not demonstrate the same behaviors. ¶Researchers also pointed to the collapse of sea ice, which penguins require to hunt from, as a root cause for the declining numbers.¶The Adélie penguin appears healthier in other parts of the Antarctic that have not experienced such significant changes from rising temperatures, like East Antarctica and the Ross Sea, researchers said.¶Global warming is transforming Antarctica, one of the most remote places on Earth, as sea ice melts, leaving more open water than ever before. ¶Antarctica’s ice shelves — the powerful structures that act as buffers preventing glaciers and ice streams from spilling out into the sea — are also in decline. Antarctica’s Larsen-A and Larsen-B ice shelves have already collapsed, and new satellite images show massive cracks in the Larsen-C ice shelf. ¶And of course, it’s not just a problem of the southern hemisphere. Last year, NASA described the melting ice in the Arctic as the “new normal.”",0

    ","¶Satellites are bearing witnesses to a massive, steadily growing crack in Antarctica’s Larsen-C ice shelf.¶Ice shelves are extremely vulnerable to climate change. Two other portions — known as the Larsen-A and Larsen-B ice shelves — already collapsed in 1995 and 2002, respectively. ¶Using images captured by their satellites, European Space Agency (ESA) scientists are watching the Larsen-C crack worsen in slow motion. They combined several radar images to create the following interferogram image of the ice shelf, with its growing crack visible on the right-hand side. ESA says the interferogram measures surface deformation of the ice along the line where it’s splitting apart, which may not be visible on the surface.¶When the ice shelf ultimately breaks, it will create one of the largest icebergs ever recorded, according to the ESA. ¶More in Climate Change¶Antarctica’s ice shelves are crucial to global environmental stability because they act as buffers, holding back Antarctic glaciers and ice streams from spilling out into the sea. ¶Rising temperatures and increased water flow could eventually cause Antarctica’s ice shelves to collapse entirely, triggering dangerous sea level rise across the world. Sea level rise is a major risk factor this century: according to projections from NOAA, global sea levels are expected to rise between one foot and 8.2 feet by the year 2100. ¶In a study published last week, scientists explained that Antarctica’s ice shelves are even more vulnerable to melting and collapse than previously thought due to the unexpectedly widespread free-flowing water recently seen across the continent. ¶Global warming is transforming the Arctic, with effects that include significantly warmer temperatures, declining amounts of sea ice, and more open water in previously frozen areas with each passing year. ¶The ice shelves “act as a safety band,” the ESA explained. “If lost, it could be the point of no return.”",0

            Mike Bloomberg, Carl Pope say jobs come from clean energy, not coal - on ""CBS This Morning"" - CBS News
    ",CBS News,"April 24, 2017, 10:30 AM","¶A new CBS News poll shows a majority of Americans have a pessimistic view about prospects for the environment, with 57 percent believing it will be worse for the next generation. Only 12 percent believe the environment will be better than it is today. ¶But a new book by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Charles Pope, former executive director of the Sierra Club, offers a more optimistic view. It’s called “Climate of Hope: How Cities, Businesses, and Citizens Can Save the Planet” (St. Martin’s Press). ¶On “CBS This Morning” Monday, Bloomberg said that leadership in finding solutions to environmental problems may come down to the foresight of cities, rather than federal or state governments. ¶“Local governments influence how we get around, what fuels we can burn, whether or not we are compliant with the rules,” he said. “People who want to live cleaner, breathe cleaner air, drink more pure water, have a better economy, it’s in the cities where they can change things.” ¶He said the book was a reaction to pessimism about government action — or perceived inaction.  “Carl and I got together and said, ‘Everybody’s so pessimistic, but we really are making a big difference.’ We are going to meet the COP21 goals without any help from the federal government, basically,” he said, referring to targets for reducing greenhouse gases set in the Paris climate accords. ¶Pope added, “In fact, the United States has reduced its carbon emissions by a larger ratio than any other major industrial nation. We’ve already accomplished two-thirds of what President Obama promised to accomplish by 2025, and this is being driven by public sentiment at the local level, by leaders from cities and by innovation by American businesses.” ¶When co-anchor Norah O’Donnell asked about two of the world’s largest polluters, China and India, Bloomberg responded, “China, in all fairness, is one of the countries that is working the hardest to clean things up. Why? Because you can’t see across the street, the pollution is so bad. They’ve woken up and said, ‘We just are not going to stay in power unless we do something.’ And so they are closing coal-fired power plants, they are closing cement plants, they are closing steel plants, and moving them away from the cities.” ¶“And India just announced that they will not build any more coal-fired power plants for the next decade,” said Pope. “They’ve put a complete suspension on starting new coal-fired power plants, because in India right now if you put out a bid, solar comes in first, wind comes in second, coal comes in a poor third, in terms of cost.” ¶“We are now at a point at which alternative means of creating energy are lower than fossil fuel?” asked co-anchor Charlie Rose. ¶“Cleaner means cheaper,” Pope said. “Cheaper equals cleaner. That’s what clean energy has become.” ¶Bloomberg also condemned President Trump’s rollback of pollution controls for mining companies, which the president called “job-killing.”  “If we start putting the tailings of these coal mines into the rivers —which an EPA regulation just got rolled back and will now permit — people downstream are going to all of sudden wake up one day and find they and their kids have been poisoned,” Bloomberg said.   ¶Mr. Trump, who is seeking to cut the Envrionmental Protection Agency’s budget by about one-third, promised to end a supposed “war on coal” and bring back jobs for unemployed coal miners. ¶“Unfortunately for people who work in the coal injury, technology is devastating them,” Bloomberg said. “Back in 1925, there were 800,000 people that worked in coal; in 1980 there were 250,000. Today there’s 55,000 — and production has gone up. It’s all technology that’s destroying jobs. ¶“We can’t just sit here and say ‘woe to us’ or ‘woe to the coal miners.’ We’ve got to do something. And what you have to do is help them train for other jobs because those [coal] jobs aren’t going to come back.” ¶“But you have an administration in Washington that says it’s going to reduce the standards from the EPA, that it’s going to withdraw from the Paris agreement,” said Rose. ¶“Hopefully that won’t happen,” Bloomberg said. “Hopefully they’ll get some sense and say, ‘Look, America’s going to meet its goals anyway. It would send a bad message. Let’s go along to try to work from within rather than from without.’ ¶“But no matter what they do, we are going toward a world where coal is going to be less-used, where fewer people are going to be working in the industry, and we’ve got to find ways to get jobs for people not just in this industry but in lots of industries around the world being pushed out by technology. And you don’t do it by going and creating jobs you don’t need; you have to create jobs we need. ¶“A good example is, we have lots of soldiers, veterans. We’ve got take care of them. We’ve got to find jobs for veterans. But you don’t go start a war to give them jobs. You find things that they can do and that we need in society and there are ways to do that.” ¶Pope said, “Let’s look at the reality: We didn’t make America great by keeping buggy whips going in the 1920s. We made America great by building the world’s greatest auto industry. We have the opportunity to build the world’s greatest clean energy industry. We ought to be embracing the future. Already clean energy employs five times as many people as natural gas, coal, and oil combined. So there are hundreds of thousands of jobs in the clean energy industry. There can be millions, and cities are competing with each other to see who can get the most of them. That’s what’s great about cities. They compete to move forward, not to look backward.” ¶      For more info:  ",0

    ","¶NEW YORK -- Scientists, students and research advocates rallied from the Brandenburg Gate to the Washington Monument on Earth Day, conveying a global message of scientific freedom without political interference and spending necessary to make future breakthroughs possible. ¶The March for Science, coinciding with Earth Day, was set for more than 500 cities, anchored in Washington, D.C., and to be joined by dozens of nonpartisan scientific professional societies in a turnout intended to combine political and how-to science demonstrations. ¶“When the first time in recorded history scientists have to get together to form a march in support of science, something serious is going on,” Rockefeller University’s Erich Jarvis told CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook, who is covering the march in Washington. ¶President Trump, in an Earth Day statement hours after the marches kicked off, said that “rigorous science depends not on ideology, but on a spirit of honest inquiry and robust debate.” 	¶Organizers portrayed the march as political but not partisan, promoting the understanding of science as well as defending it from various attacks. They cited proposed federal cuts to the National Institutes of Health totaling $6 billion, or 18 percent of the institute’s budget.¶More in Climate Change¶The marches also come at a time when Americans are increasingly pessimistic about the future of the planet. A CBS News poll found this week that just 12 percent of Americans believe the environment will improve for the next generation, while 57 percent said it will get worse.¶Here are the highlights from marches and Earth Day events around the globe.¶Thousands of people stood outside the Washington Monument amid bouts of downpours, listening to a mix of speeches and music. Speakers noted that President Trump was in the White House nearby, having canceled a weekend in New Jersey.  	¶This was the first protest for Jeannette Villabon and her son Nikko Chey of Stanhope, New Jersey. So Villabon went all out, donning a Tyrannosaurus rex costume and holding a sign that said: “Hey tiny hands fund EPA study. Quit being cretaceous.”  ¶Mr. Trump’s “archaic thinking is going to ruin us all,” Villabon said. ¶Other signs were only slightly less pointed, such as “edit genes not the truth,” “data not dogma”  and “global warming is real. Trump is the hoax.” Signs and banners readied for the Washington rally reflected anger, humor and obscure scientific references, such as a 7-year-old’s “No Taxation Without Taxonomy.” Taxonomy is the science of classifying animals, plants and other organisms.  ¶ Why did the Dinosaur cross the road?

His mother, grandmother and brother traveled with him from Parkersburg, West Virginia. “I have to do everything I can to oppose the policies of this administration,” said his grandmother, Susan Sharp. ¶ It might be raining, but that isn't stopping these women, and thousands of others, from joining the #marchforscience in D.C. today!¶A post shared by March for Science (Official) (@sciencemarchdc) on Apr 22, 2017 at 11:30am PDT¶One of the organizers of the first Earth Day, Denis Hayes, said the crowd he saw on the National Mall in Washington appeared energized and “magical,” almost like what he saw that first day 47 years ago.¶In Manhattan, the March for Science began with a rally at 10:30 a.m. near Columbus Circle at Central Park West. ¶Thousands of participants walked down Broadway to midtown Manhattan, ending at West 52nd Street. A 1.6-mile stretch of Broadway was closed to cars for the march. ¶Marchers held signs with slogans such as, “The oceans are rising and so are we,” and, “Denial is not a policy,” CBS New York reports. ¶Some marchers also held signs with a silhouette of President Donald Trump and messages such as “absolute zero” and “black hole.” ¶Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo released a statement honoring Earth Day and noting the challenges facing the environment. ¶“From combating climate change and reducing carbon emissions to safeguarding our coastal communities and strengthening resiliency in the face of extreme weather -- New York must continue to lead the way forward,” Cuomo said. ¶ We drew massive crowds all across the world! @activistbarbie #MarchForScience¶A post shared by March for Science (Official) (@sciencemarchdc) on Apr 22, 2017 at 1:15pm PDT¶The March for Science Los Angeles, under the slogan “Science, Not Silence,” was expected to be one of the largest of the approximately 500 being held nationwide at a time when federal funding for researching climate change and other initiatives is under threat.¶This is huge! #MarchForScienceLA has been marching by our spot for 37 minutes...and finally thinning out. #CBSLA @CBSLA pic.twitter.com/NV9xCvt4xD¶Led by two electric massive electric Hummers, several thousand people marched in downtown Los Angeles. They chanted “Money for science and education, not for wars and climate alteration” and carried signs that read: “There is no Planet B” and “The Earth does not belong to man.”¶“Facts matter,” local organizer Alex Bradley said in a prepared statement. “In California, we use science to enable technology, spur innovation and create new industries and new jobs.”¶A variety of beautification projects and community education events were planned, reports CBS Los Angeles.

    ","¶In a unique study spanning the entire continent, scientists have found that water is gushing across Antarctica — more than they ever realized.¶The researchers from Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory have found significant drainage of meltwater flowing across the continent’s ice sheets during summer in Antarctica. Until now, these streams of water were mainly associated only with Antarctica’s far north regions. ¶The discovery of widespread streams across the continent is ominous news, indicating Antarctica’s ice may be much more vulnerable to melting than scientists predicted. Free-flowing water, which absorbs solar energy more than ice, puts nearby ice at greater risk of melting. ¶More in Climate Change¶“I think most polar scientists have considered water moving across the surface of Antarctica to be extremely rare. But we found a lot of it, over very large areas,” Jonathan Kingslake, a glaciologist at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and lead author of the study, said in a statement. ¶“This is not in the future — this is widespread now, and has been for decades,” he said. The research was published this week in the journal Nature.¶In the study, climate scientists carefully catalogued aerial and satellite images of Antarctica from 1947 to the present. The images helped them map 700 distinct systems of ponds, channels and streams across the continent, researchers said. They noted that there’s no clear evidence to suggest the number of meltwater drainages has increased over the time period they covered. But, this study provides a baseline for evaluating the spread of free-flowing water across the continent in the future. ¶The meltwater appears to proliferate whenever Antarctica’s temperature creeps up, researchers said, a bad omen as the continent is expected to plunge deeper into global warming this century. ¶Antarctica stands on the front lines of global warming, as rising temperature have wreaked havoc on the icy continent. Recent years have also transformed the Arctic, with significantly warmer temperatures, lower levels of sea ice, and more open water. ¶Experts say Arctic warming creates a toxic feedback loop: as the Arctic continues to warm, it will release greater levels of the greenhouse gas methane, formerly locked in the frost, which in turn absorbs the sun’s heat and further accelerates the warming of the planet. Last year, 2016, was the warmest year on record since official record keeping began in 1880, according to analyses from NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).¶The below video captures a meltwater stream flowing from Antarctica’s Nansen Ice Shelf into the ocean:¶“These streams are something that require more investigation,” said Paul Mayewski, director of the Climate Change Institute at the University of Maine and a climatologist who’s done significant fieldwork in Antarctica. Mayewski was not involved in the study but called it “impressive.”¶What are the stakes? As meltwater drains across Antarctica, it flows into the crevices of the so-called “ice shelves” that surround the continent, weakening those ice structures from within. Over time, free-flowing water could lead Antarctica’s ice shelves to collapse entirely, triggering dangerous sea level rise across the world. ¶The Columbia University researchers expanded on these consequences in an accompanying study, also published in Nature.¶Sea level rise is expected to pose a massive threat to humankind this century. Global sea levels could rise between one foot and 8.2 feet by the year 2100, according to projections published by NOAA earlier this year. Though eight feet may not sound like a huge number, the consequences to human life would be devastating, as would the economic impact: researchers estimate that a rise of just six feet would be enough swallow up the homes of about six million Americans.¶For Mayewski, the new study is as a warning: that Antarctica’s ice sheets are more precarious than long thought. ¶“Cities preparing for a conservative view of sea level rise by 2100 may be underestimating the full potential,” he said.

To avoid a three-mile cross country ski from the nearest paved road, first you need a forest service permit. Then you hitch a ride like ours, courtesy Dave Ochs and his Crested Butte Mountain Bike Association.¶But it’s all worth it when you discover a remote cabin deep in the woods is home to one of the world’s most valuable – and unexpected – troves of scientific data.¶ “So I came out late May, summer of ‘72,” Barr said. “It was such a mental relief just to have peace and quiet in my life.”¶He lived in a shack that was 8 by 10 feet, he said. ¶“The wind would literally blow snow through the cracks,” Barr told CBS News correspondent John Blackstone.¶“You came for the solitude, but you started to get a little bored?” Blackstone asked.¶“A bit of boredom, but a lot of it was just… making my own activity,” Barr said.¶Since 1974, he’s taken measurements twice a day, but it wasn’t just the snow depth and when it melted. Using a hand-operated system he built himself, he also calculated how much groundwater that snow would produce when it melted. ¶ When that wasn’t enough to keep Barr busy, he started tracking wildlife and recorded it all by hand in a series of now-tattered notebooks.¶“You’ve gotta be a little obsessive though,” Blackstone said.¶“Oh yeah!” Barr responded.¶In the early ‘90s, scientist David Inouye from the neighboring Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory needed data for his research on wildflowers. He had heard about Barr’s notebooks, but was shocked when he saw how comprehensive they were.¶ “I said, ‘Billy! You know those data are really relevant to how the climate is changing, and how animals are responding to the changing climate,” Inouye said.¶ Barr said he had no idea his measurements would have any kind of long-term significance. ¶“Remember this was mid-’70s, early-mid-’70s,” Barr said. “If you asked me about climate change, I would’ve said, yeah, it got warm, I took my sweater off. I mean, it meant nothing to me!”¶ But now it means everything to the global scientific community, which has published his numbers in dozens of scientific papers. ¶“One of these days, I’ll read ‘em! Yeah,” Barr said. “I wasn’t out to prove anything. I just recorded the numbers.”¶ “This winter we’ve had 21 record highs, last winter 17, the winter before, 36!” Barr said at his weather station.¶ Like most climate scientists, Barr is concerned by what his numbers show: temperatures are rising and snow is melting earlier each year.¶ “It’s worrisome, obviously, it’s not a good trend,” Barr said. “Will we lose water storage? Will drought increase? Will floods and famine increase?”¶ But Barr leaves the answers to big questions like those to others. He’s content to do his part and head out into the wilderness, where there’s an infinite amount of data waiting to be collected. ",0
"Ahead of Earth Day, most Americans pessimistic about environment’s future","
","

    ","¶By Jennifer De Pinto, Fred Backus, Kabir Khanna and Anthony Salvanto ¶Few Americans expect the environment to be better for the next generation, a pessimism that has lingered for over a decade in this poll. Most (57 percent) say it’ll get worse.¶And while protecting the environment is important to most Americans (89 percent), many feel doing so costs money and time – which some (39 percent) say they simply don’t have. ¶So it’s wealthier Americans who are more likely to report personally taking those steps.¶There’s disagreement over recent actions by the Trump administration. Fifty-one percent say it’s bad for the Trump administration to have lifted Obama-era environmental regulations, fearing that will cause more environmental harm, while 38 percent say lifting those restrictions is good, because it will make it easier for business to create jobs. ¶Two-thirds of Americans rate the quality of the air and water where they live as at least somewhat clean, and almost no one feels theirs is very polluted, but few – 28 percent - call it very clean. There are differences by where people live. Americans in rural areas -- 42 percent -- are more likely to say the quality of their air and water is very clean, compared to those in urban (25 percent) and suburban areas. ¶More in CBS News Polls¶Most Americans continue to believe that global warming exists, whatever the cause, and most believe that cause is mainly human activity. But partisanship dramatically affects these responses.¶Democrats are more than twice as likely as Republicans to say human activity is the main cause; most independents also cite human activity. Republicans are more divided over whether it is that or just natural patterns. ¶Sixty-five percent of younger Americans say it is human activity. Fewer than half of seniors (42 percent) hold that view.¶Those who believe global warming is caused by human activity are more likely to say the environment will be worse for the next generation, and to think the recent rollback of regulations is a bad thing. Americans who say it’s the earth’s natural patterns are less pessimistic about the environment and support the recent lifting of environmental regulations.¶This poll was conducted by telephone April 11-15, 2017 among a random sample of 1,011 adults nationwide.  Data collection was conducted on behalf of CBS News by SSRS of Media, PA.  Phone numbers were dialed from samples of both standard land-line and cell phones.¶The poll employed a random digit dial methodology. For the landline sample, a respondent was randomly selected from all adults in the household. For the cell sample, interviews were conducted with the person who answered the phone.¶Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish using live interviewers.  ¶The data have been weighted to reflect U.S. Census figures on demographic variables. ¶The error due to sampling for results based on the entire sample could be plus or minus four percentage points. The error for subgroups may be higher and is available by request. The margin of error includes the effects of standard weighting procedures which enlarge sampling error slightly. ¶This poll release conforms to the Standards of Disclosure of the National Council on Public Polls.",0
"Scientists witness first modern case of ""river piracy""","

      / AP
    ","¶WASHINGTON — Scientists have witnessed the first modern case of what they call “river piracy” and they blame global warming. Most of the water gushing from a large glacier in northwest Canada last year suddenly switched from one river to another.¶That changed the Slims River from a 10-foot deep, raging river to something so shallow that it barely was above a scientist’s high top sneakers at midstream. The melt from the Yukon’s Kaskawulsh glacier now flows mostly into the Alsek River and ends up in the Pacific Ocean instead of the Arctic’s Bering Sea.¶It seemed to all happen in about one day, last May 26, based on river gauge data, said Dan Shugar, a University of Washington Tacoma professor who studies how land changes. A 100-foot tall canyon formed at the end of the glacier, rerouting the melting water, Shugar and his colleagues wrote in a study published in Monday’s journal Nature Geoscience.¶The term “river piracy” is usually used to describe events that take a long time to occur, such as tens of thousands of years, and had not been seen in modern times, especially not this quickly, said study co-author Jim Best of the University of Illinois. It’s different from something like the Mississippi River changing course at its delta and it involves more than one river and occurs at the beginning of a waterway, not the end.¶More in Climate Change¶The scientists had been to the edge of the Kaskawulsh glacier in 2013. Then the Slims River was “swift, cold and deep” and flowing fast enough that it could be dangerous to wade through, Shugar said. They returned last year to find the river shallow and as still as a lake, while the Alsek, was deeper and flowing faster.¶“We were really surprised when we got there and there was basically no water in the river,” Shugar said of the Slims. “We could walk across it and we wouldn’t get our shirts wet. It was like a snake-shaped lake rather than a river.”¶What had been a river delta at the edge of the Slims River had changed into a place full of “afternoon dust storms with this fine dust getting into your nose and your mouth,” Best said.¶The lack of water in the Slims wasn’t because of changes in rainfall, Shugar said. They know that because it’s a river fed mostly by glacial melt, not rain, and the Alsek increased in amounts similar to what disappeared from the Slims.¶The Kaskawulsh glacier covers about 9,650 square miles, about the size of Vermont. The front of the glacier has retreated nearly 1.2 miles since 1899, Shugar said.¶The scientists calculate that there is only a 1 in 200 chance that the retreating glacier and river piracy is completely natural without man-made global warming. They used weather and ice observations and a computer simulation that models how likely the glacier retreat would be with current conditions and without heat-trapping greenhouse gases.¶Several outside scientists praised the study as significant and sensible.¶“This is an interesting study and reconfirms that climate change has large, widespread and sometimes surprising impacts,” Pennsylvania State University glacier expert Richard Alley, who wasn’t part of the study, said in an email.",0
Mysterious new crack in Greenland glacier revealed in NASA photos,"

    ","¶There is a new crack in one of Greenland’s largest glaciers, and NASA researchers have captured the first images of the ice shelf’s mysterious rift.¶Operation IceBridge, NASA’s airborne survey of polar ice, recently completed a land-ice mission over northwest Greenland. During the mission, researchers flew over and photographed a new rift near the center of Petermann Glacier’s ice shelf (the floating end of the glacier). In the survey photos, the new rift appears relatively close to a larger, known crack that is spreading toward the center of the ice shelf. [Images: Greenland’s Gorgeous Glaciers]¶Part of Petermann Glacier’s ice shelf could break off if the two rifts intersect, but researchers with Operation IceBridge said in a post on Facebook that the “medial flowline” (the flow of ice in the middle of the ice shelf) could keep the new rift from advancing.¶Petermann, one of Greenland’s largest glaciers, has shrunk in recent years. Previous rifts have resulted in massive icebergs breaking away from the glacier. In 2012, an iceberg the size of Manhattan broke away from the glacier’s ice shelf. In 2010, another iceberg, this one four times the size of Manhattan, dropped, or calved, from Petermann. It was one of the largest ever recorded in Greenland, Live Science had reported.¶The glacier’s new rift was discovered by Stef Lhermitte, an Earth sciences professor at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, while studying satellite images of the area, reported The Washington Post. Lhermitte provided coordinates of the chasm to Operation IceBridge so that researchers could conduct an aerial survey of the ice shelf.¶More in Climate Change¶“[It’s] amazing to see the rift from nearby after studying it from space for several days,” Lhermitte told The Washington Post. “From these images alone, it is difficult to already say anything about what exactly caused the crack on this unusual spot.”¶Glaciers typically crack along their sides. A rift in the center of the floating ice shelf could be due to the warming ocean waters beneath the shelf, Lhermitte hypothesized, according to The Washington Post.¶In other parts of the world, researchers have observed warm ocean waters that are melting ice shelves from below and weakening them at the center. A recent study of Antarctica’s Pine Island Glacier showed that subsurface cracks in the glacier were likely caused by melting underneath the floating ice shelf.¶Original article on Live Science.",0
Scientists seek holy grail of climate change: Removing CO2 from the atmosphere,"

      / AP
    ","¶WADI ABDAH, Oman -- Deep in the jagged red mountains of Oman, geologists are drilling in search of the holy grail of reversing climate change: An efficient and cheap way to remove carbon dioxide from the air and oceans. ¶They are coring samples from one of the world’s only exposed sections of the Earth’s mantle to uncover how a spontaneous natural process millions of years ago transformed CO2 into limestone and marble. ¶As the world mobilizes to confront climate change, the main focus has been on reducing emissions through fuel efficient cars and cleaner power plants. But some researchers are also testing ways to remove or recycle carbon already in the seas and sky. ¶More in Climate Change¶The Hellisheidi geothermal plant in Iceland injects carbon into volcanic rock. At the massive Sinopec fertilizer plant in China, CO2 is filtered and reused as fuel. In all, 16 industrial projects currently capture and store around 27 million tons of CO2, according to the International Energy Agency. That’s less than 0.1 percent of global emissions - but the technology has shown promise. ¶“Any one technique is not guaranteed to succeed,” said Stuart Haszeldine, a geology professor at the University of Edinburgh who serves on a U.N. climate body studying how to reduce atmospheric carbon. ¶“If we’re interested as a species, we’ve got to try a lot harder and do a lot more and a lot of different actions,” he said. ¶One such action is underway in the al-Hajjar Mountains of Oman, in a quiet corner of the Arabian Peninsula, where a unique rock formation pulls carbon out of thin air. ¶Peter Kelemen, a 61-year-old geochemist at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, has been exploring Oman’s hills for nearly three decades. “You can walk down these beautiful canyons and basically descend 20 kilometers (12 miles) into the earth’s interior,” he said. ¶The sultanate boasts the largest exposed sections of the Earth’s mantle, thrust up by plate tectonics millions of years ago. The mantle contains peridotite, a rock that reacts with the carbon in air and water to form marble and limestone. ¶“Every single magnesium atom in these rocks has made friends with the carbon dioxide to form solid limestone, magnesium carbonate, plus quartz,” he said as he patted a rust-colored boulder in the Wadi Mansah valley. ¶“There’s about a billion tons of CO2 in this mountain,” he said, pointing off to the east. ¶Rain and springs pull carbon from the exposed mantle to form stalactites and stalagmites in mountain caves. Natural pools develop surface scum of white carbonate. Scratch off this thin white film, Kelemen said, and it’ll grow back in a day. ¶“For a geologist this is supersonic,” he said. ¶He and a team of 40 scientists have formed the Oman Drilling Project in order to better understand how that process works and whether it could be used to scrub the earth’s carbon-laden atmosphere. The $3.5 million project has support from across the globe, including NASA. ¶Carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas driving climate change, which threatens political instability, severe weather and food insecurity worldwide, according to the United Nations climate body. ¶Natural CO2 levels have risen from 280 to 405 parts per million since the Industrial Revolution, and current estimates hold that the world will be 6 C hotter by 2100. ¶In 2015, 196 nations signed the Paris climate accords, agreeing to curb greenhouse gas emissions to levels that would keep the rise in the Earth’s temperature to under 2 C. ¶That has injected new urgency into the work underway in Oman, where Keleman’s team recently spent four months extracting dozens of core samples, which they hope to use to construct a geological history of the process that turns CO2 into carbonate. ¶“It’s like a jigsaw puzzle,” said Nehal Warsi, 33, who oversees the drilling process. ¶Around 13 tons of core samples from four different sites will be sent to the Chikyu, a state-of-the-art research vessel off the coast of Japan, where Keleman and other geologists will analyze them in round-the-clock shifts. ¶They hope to answer the question of how the rocks managed to capture so much CO2 over the course of 90 million years - and to see if there’s a way to speed up the timetable. ¶Kelemen thinks a drilling operation could cycle carbon-rich water into the newly formed seabed on oceanic ridges far below the surface. Just like in Oman’s mountains, the submerged rock would chemically absorb carbon from the water. The water could then be cycled back to the surface to absorb more CO2 from the atmosphere, in a sort of conveyor belt. ¶Such a project would require years more of testing, but Kelemen hopes the energy industry, with its offshore drilling expertise and deep pockets, will take interest. ¶“Ultimately, if the goal is to capture billions and billions of tons of carbon, that’s where James Cameron comes in,” he said, half joking, referring to the “Titanic” and “Avatar” director who has also pioneered undersea technology. Cameron himself piloted a submersible to the deepest point on Earth in 2012 and retrieved samples while filming “Deepsea Challenge.” ¶“He hasn’t responded to my messages yet,” Kelemen said. ",0
World adds record amount of renewable energy capacity in 2016 -- now what?,"

    ","¶Green energy has hit a new milestone: The world added record levels of renewable energy capacity in 2016 despite an investment level that was 23 percent lower than the previous year, according to a new United Nations report. ¶Globally, those low expenditures -- the lowest seen since 2013 -- were largely due to declining prices in renewable energy, a sign of vitality in the sector. For instance, the average dollar cost per megawatt for solar photovoltaics and wind energy dropped by more than 10 percent, according to the report. ¶In total, the world spent $241.6 billion on renewable energy last year. (That excludes spending on “large hydro,” which largely refers to projects that use a dam and a reservoir to retain water from a river.)¶More in Climate Change¶The report reflects an important moment, said David Konisky, associate professor at Indiana University’s School of Public and Environmental Affairs.¶“It reflects a slow but sustained trajectory towards cleaner sources of energy. It reflects the fact that the cost of renewable technologies are coming down pretty drastically,” Konisky said.¶Last year’s spending created 139 gigawatts of renewable energy infrastructure, 8 percent more than the amount of renewable capacity built in 2015. ¶“The report is a reminder that, if you set aside policy for a moment, there are factors in the marketplace which are continuing to push countries towards cleaner sources of energy,” Konisky said.¶Of course, market forces alone cannot create the conditions required for renewable energy transformation. Policy also matters.¶Since the election of President Trump, the U.S. has made a dramatic pivot from its global environmental agenda under President Obama. ¶Earlier this week, the U.S. dealt a blow to international climate cooperation: Top officials from the “Group of Seven” industrial nations reached a standstill in their attempts to draft a joint declaration due to a Trump administration review of climate policies. The final declaration was left incomplete. ¶A longtime critic of the landmark Paris Agreement, Mr. Trump has vowed to withdraw from the global pact governing lower carbon emissions.¶Domestically, Environmental Protection Agency chair Scott Pruitt has ushered in a new chapter in the history of the EPA since his February confirmation, from reversing a key rule underpinning the Clean Water Act to clearing the way for the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines. Before assuming leadership of the EPA, the former attorney general of Oklahoma made a name for himself among EPA opponents for suing the agency more than a dozen times. Recent emails unearthed by the Associated Press reveal Scott Pruitt’s strong ties to business leaders in the fossil fuel industry, an industry whose carbon emissions Pruitt is now charged with regulating.¶Reflecting global averages, the UN report painted a rosy picture of renewable energy infrastructure worldwide. However, the report also documented a significant slowdown in China, Japan and some emerging markets.¶In looking at the evolution of clean energy, Konisky emphasized the importance of examining multiple forces at play at the same time -- including political and market forces that may be counteracting each other. ¶“For the U.S., when you have policy moving in the opposite direction as the markets, it may slow down some of the de-carbonization and movement towards clean energy,” he said.",0
"Dozens of icebergs drift into shipping lanes, causing Atlantic standstill","

April 6, 2017 / 5:19 PM
      / AP
    ","¶PROVIDENCE, R.I. — More than 400 icebergs have drifted into the North Atlantic shipping lanes over the past week in an unusually large swarm for this early in the season, forcing vessels to slow to a crawl or take detours of hundreds of miles.¶Experts are attributing it to uncommonly strong counter-clockwise winds that are drawing the icebergs south, and perhaps also global warming, which is accelerating the process by which chunks of the Greenland ice sheet break off and float away.¶As of Monday, there were about 450 icebergs near the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, up from 37 a week earlier, according to the U.S. Coast Guard’s International Ice Patrol in New London, Connecticut. Those kinds of numbers are usually not seen until late May or early June. The average for this time of year is about 80.¶More in Climate Change¶In the waters close to where the Titanic went down in 1912, the icebergs are forcing ships to take precautions.¶Instead of cutting straight across the ocean, trans-Atlantic vessels are taking detours that can add around 400 miles to the trip. That’s a day and a half of added travel time for many large cargo ships.¶Close to the Newfoundland coast, cargo ships owned by Oceanex are throttling way back to 3 or 4 knots as they make their way to their homeport in St. John’s, which can add up to a day to the trip, said executive chairman, Capt. Sid Hynes.¶One ship was pulled out of service for repairs after hitting a chunk of ice, he said.¶“It makes everything more expensive,” Hynes said Wednesday. “You’re burning more fuel, it’s taking a longer time, and it’s hard on the equipment.” He called it a “very unusual year.”¶Coast Guard Cmdr. Gabrielle McGrath, who leads the ice patrol, said she has never seen such a drastic increase in such a short time. Adding to the danger, three icebergs were discovered outside the boundaries of the area the Coast Guard had advised mariners to avoid, she said.¶McGrath is predicting a fourth consecutive “extreme ice season” with more than 600 icebergs in the shipping lanes.¶Most icebergs entering the North Atlantic have “calved” off the Greenland ice sheet. Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University, said it is possible climate change is leading to more icebergs in the shipping lanes, but wind patterns are also important.¶In 2014, there were 1,546 icebergs in the shipping lanes — the sixth most severe season on record since 1900, according to the patrol. There were 1,165 icebergs in 2015 and 687 in 2016.¶The International Ice Patrol was formed after the sinking of the Titanic to monitor iceberg danger in the North Atlantic and warn ships. It conducts reconnaissance flights that are used to produce charts.¶In 104 years, no ship that has heeded the warnings has struck an iceberg, according to the ice patrol.",0
House climate change hearing devolves into name calling,"

    ","¶WASHINGTON — Climate science and politics too often revert to name calling and bullying, which can get in the way of real work.¶That was the only thing House Science Committee members, three scientists who often clash with mainstream science, and a prominent climate scientist could agree to at a contentious hearing Wednesday.¶They couldn’t agree on who was doing the name calling, though.¶More in Climate Change¶Republicans and three scientists invited by them to testify accused the mainstream climate scientist, Michael Mann of Pennsylvania State University, and major international science panels of trying to silence researchers who disagree about the magnitude of global warming.¶Mann, meanwhile, said he was harassed by people trying to stifle science.¶Mann and Republican Rep. Dana Rohrabacher of California both compared the other side’s behavior to repression in the former Soviet Union under Josef Stalin. Mann first raised the Stalin analogy, then Rohrabacher used the comparison four times after that to talk about Mann and other mainstream climate scientists.¶“For scientists to call names to beat someone into submission, that’s a Stalinist tactic,” Rohrabacher said.¶Former Georgia Tech climate scientist Judith Curry, who often clashes with mainstream science, said she was the victim of “gutter tactics” by “scientists who demonize their opponents.”¶She pointed to the way she and Mann have clashed, saying the Penn State professor wrongly called her a climate denier, when she acknowledges that the world is warming and humans play a role. She disagrees with mainstream climate science over implications of global change, how much the world is warming, how much is human-caused, and its certainty.¶At first Mann said he didn’t call Curry a denier. But in his written not oral testimony he called Curry “a climate science denier.” Mann said there’s a difference between denying climate change and “denying established science” on how much humans cause climate change, which he said Curry did.¶Mann said the chance that humans are causing less than half of the global warming now going on is less than 1 in 10,000, citing an international panel of scientists convened by the United Nations. Curry disagreed, insisting it’s not clear. “I just don’t know how much is human versus how much is natural,” she said.¶When pressed by Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.) on whether humans are mostly to blame, Mann replied: “I go with physics. You can go with opinion.”¶The American Meteorological Society and the American Association for the Advancement of Science both said in email statements to The Associated Press that the overwhelming scientific evidence is clear that global warming is primarily caused by humans.¶Republican committee Chairman Lamar Smith of Texas, a lawyer, said, “much of climate science today appears to be based more on exaggerations, personal agendas and questionable predictions than on the scientific method.”¶Led by Representative Smith, the House Science Committee opposed the Obama administration’s efforts to regulate the gas, oil and coal industries and reduce carbon emissions.¶The panel of three scientists who often clash with mainstream science and Mann was not representative of the peer reviewed research in the field, which overwhelmingly finds climate change to be real, human caused and a problem, Democrats said.¶Though climate headlines tend to focus on places like Antarctica, where global warming is rapidly transforming the physical environment, climate change is upending the U.S., too.¶Earlier this month, doctors representing 11 top medical societies lobbied in Washington for more aggressive action against climate change, which they said poses an immediate health threat to millions of Americans, citing problems such as widespread heart and lung disease associated with air pollution and increased mortality from floods and other extreme weather events. ¶The U.S. is already setting twice as many daily heat records as cold records, and research suggests breaking heat records will become more and more routine as man-made climate change worsens.¶Retired Adm. David Titley, now a Penn State meteorology professor, said in an email to the AP that scientists should boycott House hearings because it is a “charade” and perpetuates the myth that there is a legitimate scientific debate on the issue.¶Democratic Rep. Don Beyer of Virginia asked, “Why can’t we all just get along?” and then answered his own question: “It’s because the stakes are so large.”",0

This method involves beaming radio waves toward the ground from a satellite and measuring the time it takes for the reflected waves to bounce back. The instrument aboard the CryoSat satellite is the first of its kind designed for monitoring ice, according to the ESA; it can also measure sea level. [Images of Melt: Earth’s Vanishing Ice]¶The measurements are useful to scientists who are trying to understand changes in the Antarctic ice sheet, including where increased snowfall is causing accumulating ice and where melting and iceberg calving are causing ice losses.¶“This should benefit not only studies of the Antarctic ice sheet, but also projections of future sea-level rise,” Andrew Shepherd, the director of CPOM, said in a statement.¶As the climate warms, Antarctica’s ice is changing. In 2002, the Larsen B ice shelf collapsed spectacularly, and a massive rift in the Larsen C ice shelf is threatening to do the same to that floating ice. When floating ice shelves collapse, they do not raise sea levels by themselves, but their loss does remove a barrier to the flow of land-based ice into the oceans.¶Scientists have observed a trend toward melting on the land-based West Antarctica ice sheet in recent years, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. The data from East Antarctica has been trickier to interpret, with some research finding that the region was adding ice because of increased snowfall. (Warm air can hold more moisture, so as the globe warms, precipitation might increase in some areas.) Because of the balancing act between ice loss in the west and ice gains in the east, there has been a long-running scientific controversy over whether the continent as a whole is losing or gaining ice.¶Alarmingly, field scientists recently discovered huge craters called moulins on East Antarctica’s Roi Baudouin ice shelf. The melt features had never been seen before on an ice shelf. Research published in the journal Nature Climate Change in December 2016 on the moulins and new satellite data found that East Antartica may be more vulnerable to melt than previously believed.¶Original article on Live Science.

    ","¶UNITED NATIONS -- The emergency relief coordinator for the United Nations is warning of the worst famine since the world organization was founded in 1945. It is putting an estimated 20 million lives immediately at risk, and while war is exacerbating the disaster in places like South Sudan, Stephen O’Brien says the primary culprit is climate change. ¶Drought and acidification of the oceans is at a crisis point. Drinking water is sparse, animals are dying, and populations are on the move, desperate to find food. ¶As the U.N. warns the window is fast closing to avert a massive human tragedy, the Trump Administration is rolling out its new energy independence order to change the U.S. approach to climate change and reverse some of the previous administration’s climate regulations.¶More in Famine and drought¶ 	 	 U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres has said the agencies rushing to help people staring down starvation need to raise $4.4 million by the end of this month for the four countries at highest risk; Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen.¶ 	 	 “By 2040, 1 in 4 children -- 600 million children -- will live in areas of extremely high water stress,” Anthony Lake, Executive Director of U.N. children’s agency UNICEF says in a new report, “Thirsting for a Future.”¶ 	 	 “The effects of climate change reduce the quantity and quality of water, causing rising temperatures, help bacteria and other pathogens to flourish, and disappearing glaciers leave land dry and arid,” Lake says.¶ 	 	 The effects of climate change -- and drought in particular -- are already affecting 1.4 million children who face imminent risk of death from severe acute malnutrition as the famine spreads. In Ethiopia alone, the UNICEF report says, “we anticipate that more than 9 million people will be without safe drinking water in 2017.”¶ 	 	 At the beginning of June, the U.N. will host the Ocean Conference at U.N. Headquarters in New York to try to mobilize scientists to address famine caused by climate change. ¶U.N. Climate Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa and Melanne Vereer, Executive Director of Georgetown’s Women, Peace and Security program, wrote this week that “climate change is a security threat and a vulnerability multiplier.” ¶They argue that the danger is most present in a handful of North African nations where the inability to find water for subsistence farmers is leading many into a poverty trap. ¶Michael Sandler, U.S. Fund for UNICEF’s content director, says climate change and famine are intertwined not only in the four countries already experiencing or threatened by mass-hunger, but in places like Kenya and Uganda, where refugees fleeing drought are pouring in.  ¶In Senegal this week, U.N. Deputy Secretary-General Amina J. Mohammed explained why helping the victims -- particularly the younger victims -- of climate change-induced famine is not just a matter of charity, but security. ¶“A disengaged population of youth is prone to large-scale migration and susceptible to radicalization,” she said.

And you can’t slay them,” he said.¶“It’s not a hoax. This matters to every American.”¶Now, climate change funding is on the federal chopping block. ¶“If funding goes away, it will be difficult for me to do my job,” Santer said. ¶Difficult, he says, but not impossible, since much of Santer’s research at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory is covered by grants.

The Clean Power Plan requires that, by 2030, the power sector’s CO2 emissions be brought down to 32 percent below their 2005 levels, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).¶EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, who previously challenged the legality of the plan when he was Oklahoma’s attorney general, recently said on ABC’s “This Week with George Stephanopoulos” that the rollback would be both “pro-growth and pro-environment.” But what are the scientific consequences of discarding the plan? [The Year in Climate Change: 2016’s Most Depressing Stories]¶For starters, without the mandate to lower CO2 emissions, America’s electrical power industry could continue to emit high levels of CO2, said Ken Kimmell, the president of the Union of Concerned Scientists, a science advocacy group. The industry’s current CO2 emissions equate to 30 percent of the annual such emissions for the country, and higher levels of CO2 in the atmosphere are linked to climate change, he said.¶More in Climate Change¶The Clean Power Plan was the nation’s first limit on CO2 from power plants, Kimmell told Live Science. ¶EPA officials had said they expected the plan to help the country meet its goals as outlined in the Paris Agreement, a 2015 deal in which 195 countries pledged to reduce CO2 emissions. But Pruitt said the plan was not tied to the Paris deal.¶“The Clean Power Plan is not tethered to the Paris accords,” he told Stephanopoulos.¶However, the new administration doesn’t appear to have a replacement for the Clean Power Plan, Kimmell said.¶“They’re just going to repeal it, so that’s a big problem,” Kimmell said.¶In addition to warming the planet, outdoor air pollution is tied to a number of maladies, including death. In the United States, the plan was projected to prevent 3,600 premature deaths; 1,700 heart attacks; 90,000 asthma attacks; and 300,000 missed workdays and school days, the EPA said.¶The plan would have helped the nation move away from burning coal and toward “cleaner sources, like [natural] gas, and even really clean sources, like renewable energy, such as wind and solar,” Kimmell said. “There are significant health benefits when you switch from a dirty resource like coal to cleaner resources.” [8 Ways Global Warming Is Already Changing the World]¶During the second presidential debate in the 2016 campaign, Trump mentioned the use of “clean coal” technology. This technology doesn’t yet exist, experts have told Live Science.¶The idea behind such technology is to find a way to capture CO2 and other pollutants from power plants before those materials enter the atmosphere. But developing this technology costs money, meaning power plants likely won’t do it unless the government motivates them, Edward Rubin, a professor of engineering and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, told Live Science in October 2016.¶“From everything I’ve read about Mr. Trump’s view of climate change, I suspect he would not be a proponent of policies to reduce carbon emissions drastically,” Rubin said at the time.¶Federal policy isn’t the only force driving the development of clean energy in the U.S. State legislatures across the country have put forth hundreds of bills supporting clean energy, according to InsideClimate News. For instance, politicians in almost a dozen states have sponsored bills that would expand renewable electric power, InsideClimate News reported.  ¶But some of these bills face opposition from other state politicians, and from groups such as the American Legislative Exchange Council, Americans for Prosperity, the Heartland Institute, and utility and fossil fuel companies, InsideClimate News reported.¶Overall, policies that protect the environment thrive when the federal government supports them, Kimmell said. For instance, “since 2007, our electricity consumption has stayed flat even while the economy has grown,” he said.¶This happened, in part, because of the government’s efforts to promote energy-efficient products, especially through its Energy Star program, which labeled energy efficient appliances such as LED light bulbs, dishwashers and “refrigerators that use 80 percent less energy than their predecessors,” Kimmell said.¶Original article on Live Science.",0

Arctic sea ice dwindles to record low for winter,"

      / CBS/AP
    ","¶WASHINGTON -- The frigid top of the Earth just set yet another record for low levels of sea ice in what scientists say is just the latest signal of an overheating world.¶The National Snow and Ice Data Center in Colorado says the Arctic this month set a record low for winter peak sea ice area: 5.57 million square miles (14.42 million square kilometers). ¶That’s about 35,000 square miles (97,000 square kilometers) — an area about the size of Maine — below 2015’s record. Last year had a shade more than 2015, but nearly a tied record.¶More in Climate Change¶This puts the Arctic in a “deep hole” as the crucial spring and summer melt season starts and more regions will likely be ice-free, said Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Colorado, which released the findings Wednesday.¶“It’s a key part of the Earth’s climate system and we’re losing it,” he said. “We’re losing the ice in all seasons now.”¶The record ice melt comes at the end of a season marked by unusually warm temperatures in the Arctic. During Christmas week, the North Pole soared to about 50 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal, a weather pattern Paul Mayewski, professor at the University of Maine’s Climate Change Institute, described as “remarkable.”¶At the other end of the world, Antarctica, where sea ice reaches its lowest point of the year in March, also hit a record low mark. Antarctic sea ice varies widely unlike Arctic sea ice, which has steadily decreased.¶The ice data center measures how wide sea ice extends based on satellite imagery. It’s harder to measure the thickness and overall volume, but data from the University of Washington show that as of late last month ice volume levels were down 42 percent from 1979, said polar science center chief Axel Schweiger.¶Several scientists called the sea ice loss disturbing.¶“It’s evidence that the climate at the top of the world continues to change faster than anywhere else on Earth with impacts to us that are still frankly unknown,” Pennsylvania State University meteorology professor and retired admiral David W. Titley, said in an email.¶Scientists blame a combination of natural random weather and man-made global warming from the burning of coal, oil and gas. The winter of 2016-2017 was unusually toasty and the Arctic saw three “extreme heat waves,” Serreze said.¶A new study earlier this month in the journal Nature Climate Change found that natural causes can explain between 30 and 50 percent of plunging September sea ice lows, while Serezze and others give climate change an even bigger role in sea ice loss.¶A relatively new idea — that still divides meteorologists — links the shriveling ice cap at the North Pole to a weaker polar vortex and weak and ambling jet stream, which can mean more extreme weather for a good part of the rest of the world.¶“Recent cold spells and big snowstorms that we have experienced over the past few winters have occurred when the polar vortex is weak,” top winter weather forecaster Judah Cohen, of the private Atmospheric Environmental Research in Lexington, Massachusetts, said in an email.¶It’s not just the weather.¶As more regions become free of ice, shipping lanes will open in the Arctic, there will be more drilling for oil and gas and more overall economic activity. And that may mean rising tensions between countries over newly available resources, Serreze said.¶“The Arctic is the canary in the climate’s coal mine,” said Texas Tech climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe. “What happens in the Arctic doesn’t stay in the Arctic. This entire planet is interconnected.”",0
Climate change is killing this remnant of the Ice Age,"

    ","¶Humans are in the process of changing the planet in a way that hasn’t happened in 2.6 million years.¶For eons, the Laurentide Ice Sheet has been a fixture of North America. At its peak, it covered the majority of Canada and sent icy tendrils down across the Midwest and Northeast, covering Chicago, New York and Toronto in a mile or more of ice. It helped carved mountains as it advanced, and it filled the Great Lakes as it receded at the end of the last Ice Age.¶About 2,000 years ago, the ice sheet remnants reached equilibrium on Baffin Island, Canada’s largest island, now dubbed the Barnes Ice Cap. But that equilibrium has been disrupted by human-driven climate change.¶More in Climate Change¶A new study shows that the last vestige of the once-mighty ice sheet faces near certain death, even if the world rapidly curtails its carbon pollution. The results indicate the Arctic has entered a state nearly unheard of since the Pliocene, an epoch when the Arctic was largely free of ice.¶“This is the disappearance of a feature from the last glacial age, which would have probably survived without anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions,” said Adrien Gilbert, a glaciologist at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, Canada and lead author of the new study.¶The Barnes Ice Cap covers an area about the size of Delaware. After reaching a near steady state 2,000 years ago, the ice cap began shrinking in the late 1800s, with a marked increase in its decline since the 1990s. That coincides with the rapid rise in human carbon pollution, which has also driven a roughly 1.8 degree Fahrenheit increase in the global average temperature over that period.¶But researchers can look back much deeper into the ice cap’s history using other clues. The new research, published on Monday in Geophysical Research Letters, looked at an array of amazingly named cosmogenic radionuclides in bedrock around the ice cap to tease out when the ground was free of ice.¶Cosmogenic radionuclides are isotopes that form when exposed to cosmic rays. That can only happen when the ground isn’t covered by ice, giving researchers a way to see how rare the current shrinking ice cap is.¶Their findings show that there were two periods where ice extent was roughly as tiny as it is now. Both periods came hundreds of thousands of years ago and were due to natural changes in the earth’s tilt and orbit that helped warm the planet.¶Today’s rapid change is different because human carbon pollution is the main driver of the unrelenting warmth in the region, which is warming twice as fast as the rest of the world. The findings indicate that the Arctic likely hasn’t been this warm in 2.6 million years.¶Looking into the future using climate models, sustained warming almost certainly spells doom for the ice sheet. On our current trajectory of carbon pollution, the research indicates that the ice cap is likely to disappear in the next 300 years. That’s a geological blink of an eye for an icy legacy that stretched across millions of years.¶Even under a best-case scenario, with human carbon pollution peaking in 2020 and decreasing rapidly thereafter, the ice cap will still likely melt away in the next 500 years.¶“Their study convincingly reveals that the Barnes Ice Cap will likely disappear within 300 years, taking with it the last remnants of the Laurentide Ice Sheet that once blanketed northern North America some 20,000 years ago,” Alex Gardner, an ice researcher at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said while lauding the state of the art ice modeling effort.¶The findings underscore the wealth of alarming information coming out of the Arctic. Sea ice is set to hit a record-low maximum for the third year in a row, warm air has repeatedly cranked up the thermostat this winter and forests are burning at an unprecedented pace.¶The fate of the Barnes Ice Cap is similar to other land ice across the region, including the monstrous Greenland ice sheet. Their melt will help fuel sea level rise around the globe.¶“If it was just the Barnes Ice Cap that melted, there would be little need for coastal communities to worry,” Gardner said. “Unfortunately the Barnes Ice Cap will not respond in isolation. As the atmosphere and oceans warm in the coming decades, ice sheets and glaciers will retreat globally resulting in massive transfers of ice into the oceans, raising sea levels by multiple feet by 2100.”¶You May Also Like:¶Originally published on Climate Central.",0
"World needs dramatic energy shift from fossil fuels, studies warn","

      / AP
    ","¶BERLIN — The world must swiftly shift energy production away from fossil fuels if it is to prevent a dangerous increase in global temperatures, according to separate reports released Monday by two international agencies.¶Both reports concluded that fundamentally changing the way power is produced would require considerable investment — though there were would also be savings due to improvements in energy efficiency.¶The International Energy Agency and the International Renewable Energy Agency were asked to outline scenarios that would keep global average temperature increases below 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, compared with preindustrial times.¶To ensure a two-thirds chance of that happening, the IEA said, “would require an unparalleled ramp up of all low-carbon technologies in all countries.”¶More in Climate Change¶Ambitious measures would include “the rapid phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies, CO2 prices rising to unprecedented levels, extensive energy market reforms, and stringent low-carbon and energy efficiency mandates would be needed to achieve this transition,” it said.¶“Such policies would need to be introduced immediately and comprehensively across all countries,” the IEA added.¶The IRENA report concludes that “early action is critical” and failure to act swiftly will only increase costs further down the line.¶The IRENA scenario also predicts that more jobs will be created than lost.¶The two reports also differ on the extent to which fossil fuels would continue to be used, especially cleaner options such as natural gas.¶The reports were released ahead of a meeting on energy and climate change in Berlin, expected to attract more than a thousand participants.¶The meeting, organized by Germany, comes at a time of uncertainty about the role the United States will play in international efforts to limit global warming. U.S. President Donald Trump has pledged to roll back climate commitments made by the Obama administration.",0
Watch out: Mammals shrink when Earth heats up,"

    ","¶Global warming shrank certain animals in the ancient past, and scientists worry it could happen again.¶Warm-blooded animals got smaller at least twice in Earth’s history when carbon dioxide levels soared and temperatures spiked as part of a natural warming, a new study says.¶University of New Hampshire researcher Abigail D’Ambrosia warned that mammals — but not people — could shrivel in the future under even faster man-made warming.¶More in Climate Change¶“It’s something we need to keep an eye out for,” said D’Ambrosia, who led the new work. “The question is how fast are we going to see these changes.”¶Three different species shrank noticeably about 54 million years ago when the planet suddenly heated up. One of them — an early, compact horse — got 14 percent smaller, going from about 17 pounds to 14.6 pounds, according to an analysis of fossil teeth in Wednesday’s journal Science Advances .¶“These guys were probably about the size of maybe a dog, then they dwarfed,” said D’Ambrosia. “They may have gone down to the size of a cat.”¶Another creature that contracted was a lemur-like animal that’s the earliest known primate. It shrank about 4 percent; while it may not seem like much, it’s noticeable because studies of the animal over millions of years showed it was usually getting bigger over time, D’Ambrosia said.¶Previous studies have documented a similar shrinking of mammals, including another early horse ancestor, during an earlier warming about 56 million years ago. Scientists and farmers have also long tracked animals, such as cows, that shrink and give less milk during hotter stretches.¶This latest work shows heating and shrinking are connected over millions of years.¶“These results are very significant because they provide another independent test of whether climate drives changes in body size in mammals,” said Jonathan Bloch, curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Florida Museum of Natural History, who wasn’t part of the study. “If we start to see patterns repeat themselves, we can learn from that. And what we learn from these lessons will certainly be important as we think about the possible response of plants and animals to future climate change.”¶Both D’Ambrosia’s study and that of the earlier warming are based on fossils recovered from the Bighorn Basin of Wyoming. D’Ambrosia said it’s unlikely that the shrinking only happened there.¶In hotter climates, mammals and other warm-blooded animals need to shed heat so they shrink. Smaller animals have more skin — or fur — per pound than bigger animals so more heat can escape, making them better adapted for warmer climate. Larger animals do better in the cold because they have less skin per pound and keep their heat.¶The bigger natural warming — 56 million years ago — saw temperatures rise 9 degrees or more probably from giant belches of methane from dead plants and animals that had accumulated on the sea floor, said Princeton University climate scientist Michael Oppenheimer.",0

    ","¶Extreme coasting flooding — the kind that typically hits Europe once a century — could happen as often as once a year as global warming intensifies, researchers warn. ¶Scientists from the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre considered factors like sea level rise, tides, waves, and storm surges to predict changes in “extreme sea levels” by 2100 under a few different scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions.¶Their conclusion is grim: flooding events once considered exceptional are poised to increase in frequency and push the infrastructures built to protect coastal communities past their breaking points, researchers said. ¶More in Climate Change¶The study was released this week in the journal Earth’s Future, published by the American Geophysical Union.¶The extreme coastal flooding is expected to vary considerably across Europe, according to the new projections. ¶Northern Europe is poised to be hit especially hard. Coastal communities along the Mediterranean and the Black Sea could see exceptional coastal flooding events several times a year. Along the North Sea and the Atlantic coasts of the U.K. and Ireland, sea levels could rise nearly 1 meter (3 feet). The researchers predicted lower but still serious increases in flooding along the Norwegian and Baltic Seas.¶The new study leverages new research into “wave energy flux” — that is, the energy that sea waves carry to the coastline. ¶Extreme waves are expected to carry up to 30 percent more energy by 2100, researchers project. The more energy carried by waves, the stronger they become. ¶Of course, Europe is not the only continent that should be concerned about sea level rise. Much of the U.S. is also at risk.¶In January, a report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) warned that nearly all of the U.S. coastline is more vulnerable than the global average if severe scenarios for sea level rise come to pass this century.¶Coastal communities along the Northeast and western Gulf of Mexico are especially in danger, according to NOAA. ¶Scientists say the growing risk of coastal flooding is a result of climate change, and a prime example of the interconnectedness of environmental trends across the planet. Rapidly melting ice sheets in Greenland and Antartica, fueled by warming oceans, are among the factors accelerating sea level rise around the world. ",0
"War on global warming only way to save world's coral, study says","
","
March 15, 2017 / 5:43 PM
      / CBS/AP
    ","¶SYDNEY -- Reducing pollution and curbing overfishing won’t prevent the severe bleaching that is killing coral at catastrophic rates, according to a study of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. In the end, researchers say, the only way to save the world’s coral from heat-induced bleaching is with a war on global warming. ¶Scientists are quick to note that local protection of reefs can help damaged coral recover from the stress of rising ocean temperatures. But the new research shows that such efforts are ultimately futile when it comes to stopping bleaching in the first place. ¶“We don’t have any tools to climate-proof corals,” said Terry Hughes, director of the ARC Center of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies in Australia and lead author of the study published on Thursday in the journal Nature. “That’s a bit sobering. We can’t stop bleaching locally. We actually have to do something about climate change.” ¶More in Climate Change¶Across the world, scores of brilliantly colored coral reefs once teeming with life have in recent years become desolate, white graveyards. Their deaths due to coral bleaching have grown more frequent as ocean temperatures rise, mainly due to increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The warner water stresses corals, forcing them to expel the colorful algae living inside them, which leaves the corals vulnerable to disease and death. Given enough time, bleached coral can recover if the water cools, but if the temperature stays too high for too long, the coral will die. ¶Preserving coral reefs is crucial, given we depend on them for everything from food to medical research to protection from damaging coastal storms. ¶Scientists and policymakers have thus been scrambling to find ways to prevent bleaching. Last year, for example, Hawaiian officials proposed several measures they hoped would fight bleaching on the state’s reefs, such as limiting fishing, establishing new marine protected areas and controlling polluted runoff from land. The question was whether such efforts could provide the corals any resistance to bleaching, or just help them recover. ¶The researchers conducted aerial and underwater surveys of the Great Barrier Reef, which has experienced three major bleaching events, the worst of which occurred last year. The scientists found that the severity of bleaching was tightly linked to how warm the water was. In the north, which experienced the hottest temperatures, hundreds of individual reefs suffered severe bleaching in 2016, regardless of whether the water quality was good or bad, or whether fishing had been banned. That means even the most pristine parts of the reef are just as prone to heat stress as those that are less protected. ¶Prior exposure to bleaching also did not appear to provide any protective benefit to the coral. The scientists found that the reefs that were highly bleached during the first two events, in 1998 and 2002, did not experience less severe bleaching last year.  ¶Ultimately, the study concluded, saving reefs from the ravages of bleaching requires urgent action to reduce global warming. ¶“I think it’s a wake-up call,” Hughes said. “We’ve been hoping that local interventions with water quality and fishing would improve the resistance of the corals to bleaching. We found no evidence that that’s actually true, at least during a very severe event.” ¶The study shows that older ways of thinking about reef management, such as reducing river runoff, are now moot points when it comes to preventing bleaching, said Kim Cobb, a climate scientist and coral researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. ¶“It all seems so quaint now, really,” said Cobb, who wasn’t part of the study. “A future that we thought was decades coming is basically here.” ¶The research also illustrated the gravity of the situation facing the 1,400-mile Great Barrier Reef. The team found 91 percent of the reef has been bleached at least once during the three bleaching events. Even more alarming, Hughes said, is that a fourth bleaching event is already underway. Corals need years to recover from bleaching, so back-to-back events increase the possibility that the bleached coral will die. ¶“This is the first time the Great Barrier Reef has not had a few years between bleaching events to recover,” Dr. Neal Cantin from the Australian Institute of Marine Science said, after Australia’s lead management agency for the reef confirmed on Friday that, for the second consecutive year, mass coral bleaching is devastating the Great Barrier Reef. ¶The study shows that very intense coral bleaching events are no longer isolated and are happening more regularly, said coral reef scientist Julia Baum of Canada’s University of Victoria. That assertion has been further bolstered by the Great Barrier Reef’s latest bleaching event, which began a few weeks ago and which Baum says has stunned scientists. ¶“None of us were expecting the water to be heating up again right now,” Baum said. “I think it’s beyond what any of us could have imagined. It’s our worst nightmare.” ¶In 2015, UNESCO placed the Great Barrier Reef on its watchlist due to concerns about the Australian government’s handling of the site. ",0
What would the U.S. look like without the EPA?,"

    ","¶Acid rain devouring New England forests. Homes built on toxic sites. Unswimmable rivers and cities cloaked in smog. The United States looked very different before the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) arrived, but a recent Congressional bill calls for the agency’s abolition. So Americans may wonder: What would life be like without the EPA?¶In its 47 years of operation, the EPA has achieved dramatic improvements in the cleanliness of the nation’s air and water, among other accomplishments, said Sara Gregg, an associate professor of history and environmental studies at the University of Kansas. To accomplish this, however, the agency has imposed numerous regulations on industry, making itself a frequent target of critics. Last month, Congressman Matt Gaetz, R-Florida, gave those criticisms stark expression in a bill calling for the agency’s abolition on Dec. 31, 2018.¶In an email to fellow representatives about the bill, Rep. Gaetz said, “The American people are drowning in rules and regulation,” the New York Daily News reported. “And the Environmental Protection Agency has become an extraordinary offender.” (The congressman’s office did not respond to a request for comment.) [10 Ways the EPA Has Protected Earth and You]¶More in Climate Change¶President Donald Trump similarly suggested abolishing the agency during the presidential campaign, and his administration has proposed cutting the EPA’s staff by one-fifth and its budget by 25 percent, The Washington Post reported.¶These proposals ignore the reasons the agency was created, said James Salzman, a professor of environmental law at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Removing federal oversight and entrusting environmental regulation solely to the states would return the country to a failed status quo, Salzman said.¶“We’ve been there. It was called the 1960s, and it didn’t work very well,” he said.¶Before the EPA’s establishment in 1970, the country experienced a series of environmental crises, Gregg said. Famously, the Cuyahoga River in Ohio caught fire — multiple times — due to pollution. Acid rain was destroying New England forests. The 1972 Federal water pollution control act amendment declared that the nation’s rivers and streams were not fishable or swimmable, and must be cleaned up by 1982, Gregg said.¶“Congress acknowledged … that it was not safe to put your body into the water,” she said.¶Archived pictures from the 1960s and 1970s show how bad the air had gotten, with New York covered in smog, Gregg added. Louisville, Kentucky, too, wore a shroud of smog like those that cloak cities like New Delhi and Beijing today, reported Popular Science.¶“I think about … the photographs that show oil spills that were unaddressed, or the products of tanneries or lumberyards or paper production that flowed into the rivers and lakes and streams of the nation,” Gregg said. “I think about … factories spewing a range of chemicals that nobody actually understood.” [The 10 Worst Oil Spills]¶The EPA, in conjunction with legislation like the Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act, addressed those catastrophes by various means, such as requiring scrubbers in coal-fired power plants and regulating the dumping of chemicals.¶In doing so, the EPA accomplished what the states themselves couldn’t, Salzman said. Because pollution has no respect for political boundaries, a federal agency was needed, he said. That acid rain eating its way through New England trees, for example, came from pollution spewed by Midwestern coal plants. [In Photos: The World’s 10 Most Polluted Places on Earth]¶“For a variety of reasons, states were just not willing to make the tough decisions to dramatically reduce pollution,” Salzman said.¶The EPA, however, not only consolidated various agencies and efforts related to environmental protection, but also recognized the flow of pollution across spaces, Gregg said.¶“And I can’t quite wrap my mind around the idea that somehow [this flow of pollution] can be overcome by the abolition of a national-level agency,” she said.¶Today, the EPA’s work has continued to transform the country, Salzman said.¶“The results have been extraordinary, by any measure,” he said. “Our air is cleaner to breathe. ... Our waters are much cleaner. Our hazardous waste is much more safely treated and managed. And this has led to direct benefits in public health that, when quantified, are worth many billions of dollars.”¶Air quality, in particular, represents an enormous environmental-health achievement, said Tracey Holloway, a professor of environmental studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.¶“A lot of people don’t realize that air pollution in the United States is a success story,” she said. “We have some of the healthiest air in the world, especially considering that we use more energy than anywhere else.” [5 Ways Climate Change Will Affect Your Health]¶This has meant longer lives and fewer cases of asthma attacks and respiratory diseases, she said. Since the enactment of the Clean Air Act amendments of 1990 alone, pollution reductions avoided 160,000 premature deaths; 130,000 heart attacks; and millions of cases of respiratory problems, a 2011 EPA study estimated.¶The agency’s work has led to similar improvements in water quality, Salzman said. Other EPA efforts include the study of industrial chemicals’ health effects; the Superfund program, which allows for the cleanup and emergency evacuation of toxic sites; and the administration of the popular Energy Star program, which certifies energy-efficient appliances for consumers.¶Rep. Gaetz’s bill, of course, would not travel back in time and prevent the EPA’s birth. So would abolishing the EPA now immediately return the U.S. to the 1960s? That’s unlikely, Gregg said, because the nation’s industries have “internalized the understanding that pollution does not pay in the United States.¶“It’s not as though retrofitted coal plants would pare out their scrubbers, which they’ve invested millions of dollars in,” she said. “It just doesn’t work that way.”¶In the long term, though, conditions will degrade as new production facilities come online without regulations, she said. And some 2,000 or so new industrial substances would arrive every year without any understanding of their health risks, Popular Science reported. The country and the agency, too, still have work to do on understanding and combating pollution, particularly for ozone and particulate matter, according to a 2014 NASA report on air quality.¶And without the EPA’s abilities to quickly assess environmental hazards, future environmental disasters would be worsened, The Washington Post reported. A proposed 42-percent budget cut to the EPA’s research division already makes that a danger, the Post reported.¶In the end, the EPA is unlikely to face flat-out abolition, Salzman said, because all federal environmental legislation assumes the existence of the EPA for enforcement. So eliminating the agency would require rolling back those laws, too, which is unlikely, he said.¶“It’s hard for me to imagine that there would be public support to rewrite all of our major environmental laws,” he said.¶Budget cuts, however, and efforts to return regulation to the states, are very real possibilities, Gregg said. Long-established efforts, like those mandated by the Clean Water Act, should be more resistant to proposed cuts, but newer programs, like environmental-justice efforts could disappear, she said. (These efforts aim to make environmental protection equitable for all people, according to the EPA.) Radon testing, lead cleanup and industrial-site cleanup are also at risk, Grist magazine reported.¶Gaetz’s bill still stands as a symbolic criticism, representing charges that the agency stifles the economy, though research doesn’t support that idea, Salzman said. The economic benefits of the 1990 clean air amendments, for example, would outpace losses by a factor of 30 by 2020, the 2011 EPA study estimated.¶“The EPA was created to protect the environment for all of us, not to kill jobs,” Salzman said. “And they don’t kill jobs, on balance.”¶Follow Michael Dhar @michaeldhar.

Doctors warn climate change is harming our health,"

    ","¶Climate change isn’t just happening in the Arctic Circle and Antarctica where more ice is melting year after year. Its impact is being felt right here at home, and it’s posing a threat to the health of millions of Americans, say doctors representing 11 top U.S. medical societies. They are joining forces in Washington, D.C., today to speak out about the health risks posed by climate change.¶They announced the formation of a new organization, the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health — made up of family physicians, pediatricians, obstetricians, allergists, internists and other medical experts — and are meeting with lawmakers on Capitol Hill to discuss their concerns. More than half of all U.S. doctors are members of one of the participating groups, which include the American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Pediatrics.¶They’ll also present a new report, “Medical Alert! Climate Change is Harming Our Health,” which includes scientific evidence and accounts from doctors who see climate change exacerbating a wide range of health issues, including: ¶“More than 97 percent of climate scientists have concluded that human-caused climate change is happening,” the report states. ¶“It’s not only hurting polar bears, it’s hurting us,” said Dr. Mona Sarfaty, the director of the new consortium and a professor at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia. She is also director of the Center for Climate Change Communication there.¶More in Climate Change¶Sarfaty told CBS News that primary care physicians as well as doctors in many specialty areas are reporting that climate change is making their patients sicker. Yet, she said, a recent poll showed only 32 percent of Americans could name a specific way in which global warming is harming human health.¶Carbon dioxide levels in the air are increasing and air and ocean temperatures are warming, contributing to more frequent and extreme droughts, wildfires, and flooding, Sarfaty explained. In turn, she said doctors are seeing an uptick in heat-related illnesses; worsening chronic conditions such as asthma; injuries and deaths from extreme weather like floods; infectious diseases spread by increasing populations of mosquitoes and ticks (including those that spread Lyme disease); illnesses stemming from contaminated food and water; and mental health problems like aggression and anxiety.¶Certain groups of people are especially vulnerable to the health effects of climate shifts, including children, student athletes, pregnant women, the elderly, low-income families, and people with chronic illnesses, the report said.¶But Sarfaty noted it’s challenging to get this message through to many people because they feel fine. ¶“We think that people are largely unaware that climate has anything to do with their health. They think of it as an environmental issue and put it into an environmental box or a political box. But we think people need to know that this is about their health. It’s not one of those boxes. The truth is, it’s affecting somebody you know,” she said.¶Dr. Nitin Damle, president of the American College of Physicians and an internist in Wakefield, Rhode Island, shared a story in the report. He said that over the past five years, his practice has seen a rise in the incidence of tick-borne diseases, including Lyme disease and other infections. ¶“My physician colleagues used to treat two or three cases a month during tick season; now each of us sees 40 to 50 new cases during each tick season,” he said. “Those blacklegged ticks, the carriers of Lyme disease, thrive in warm, muggy weather. In my home state of Rhode Island, where winters have gotten warmer and shorter, these tiny, sesame seed-sized insects have more time to bite humans and spread Lyme disease. Tick season used to be relegated to summer; it now spans spring and autumn. And this isn’t limited to the typical tick hotspot states.” ¶Damle drew a comparison to doctors working to prevent smoking and help patients quit because it increases the risk of cancer and lung disease.¶“We see efforts to combat climate change in the same way: they will improve health today and reduce health risks down the road,” he said.¶Dr. Robert Byron, a long-time practicing internist at Bighorn Valley Health Center, in Hardin, Montana, spoke at the consortium’s Washington, D.C., press conference.¶“There are day-to-day things we’re seeing in individual patient care. Montana is seen as the blue sky state, but what we’ve seen in recent years is a marked increase in wildfires,” Byron said. “Fire season has increased by over two months in the last 50 years.”¶He added, “We caution patients with asthma and COPD to not be outside as much. We’ve seen increases in the amount of medication they use and increased hospitalizations in terms of flare-ups of their diseases. This used to be the exception and now it’s the rule and it’s a result of climate increases in our area.”¶While in D.C., leaders of the consortium plan to connect with certain “priority states where we felt policy makers really needed to get the message out, where the legislators may be less attuned to health consequences,” Sarfaty said. Those states include Montana, Wisconsin, Minnesota, New Mexico, Arizona and Virginia.¶The Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health includes the American College of Physicians (ACP); American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, Immunology (AAAAI); the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP); the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP); and the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), among others.¶“We want to send a very strong message to the American public and our leaders that climate change is already harming the health of Americans,” Sarfaty said.",0
Mass coral bleaching hits the Great Barrier Reef – again,"
","
March 13, 2017 / 5:55 PM
      / CBS News
    ","¶For the second consecutive year, mass coral bleaching is devastating the Great Barrier Reef, Australia’s lead management agency for the reef confirmed on Friday.¶The latest coral bleaching, a phenomenon that can result in coral dying off, is part of a larger event that has damaged the world’s largest reef over the past two years. Global warming is fueling the phenomenon, as warming ocean waters put corals at serious risk. ¶The news comes after Australian government experts and researchers from the Australian Institute of Marine Science surveyed the Great Barrier Reef between Townsville and Cairns last week. It was the first aerial survey conducted this year, and the news was grim. ¶More in Climate Change¶The examination found severe bleaching in offshore reefs ranging from north of Ingham to the area near Cairns. “This year more bleaching is being observed in this central part of the Reef, which last year escaped widespread severe bleaching,” Australia’s Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority said in a statement.¶The survey confirmed anecdotal evidence collected by visitors to the reef, as well as other reef surveys completed by marine park rangers and commerical operators, the park’s director of reef recover, Dr. David Wachenfeld said. ¶“Mass bleaching is occurring on the Great Barrier Reef for the second consecutive year,” he confirmed. ¶Widespread coral bleaching during back-to-back summers is particularly toxic, as it does not leave enough time for the corals to fully recover. ¶“This is the first time the Great Barrier Reef has not had a few years between bleaching events to recover,” said Dr. Neal Cantin from the Australian Institute of Marine Science. ¶The environmental organization Greenpeace has also been documenting the bleaching, and is trying to sound the alarm worldwide. ¶“I’ve been photographing this area of the reef for several years now and what we’re seeing is unprecedented,” conservation photographer and marine biologist Brett Monro Garner said in a statement last week. “Just a few months ago, these corals were full of colour and life. Now, everywhere you look is white. The corals aren’t getting the chance to bounce back from last year’s bleaching event. If this is the new normal, we’re in trouble.”¶In 2015, UNESCO placed the Great Barrier Reef on its watchlist due to concerns about the Australian government’s handling of the site. ",0
Memo to Scott Pruitt: Here's how carbon dioxide is warming the planet,"

    ","¶The head of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said he doesn’t believe that carbon dioxide is a main driver of climate change.¶“I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do, and there’s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact. So no, I would not agree that it’s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see,” EPA chief Scott Pruitt told CNBC’s morning news show “Squawk Box” Thursday.¶Pruitt’s comments are in opposition to the scientific research on climate change. But when even the head of the EPA doubts the consensus, it can be hard to cut through the noise to understand what research scientists are really using when they express climate-change concern. [The Reality of Climate Change: 10 Myths Busted]¶More in Climate Change¶“I think plenty of people have pretty serious concerns in their life and they just don’t have the time to do all of the homework and the background to figure this out,” said Katherine Moore Powell, a climate ecologist at the Field Museum in Chicago.¶So here’s a primer explaining exactly why scientists know the climate is changing and that human activities are causing it.¶At this point, even the staunchest climate deniers would be hard-pressed to argue that the climate is not warming. Simply put, it’s getting hotter out there. Combining land and ocean measurements from 1850 to 2012, researchers have found that the average surface-air temperature globally has risen by 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit since the beginning of the industrial age. That’s according to the fifth report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), released in 2014. The top graph in the figure from the IPCC report summary for policy makers shows the temperature anomaly in Celsius.¶The next graph in this sequence shows sea-level rise, which has gone up globally by about 7.4 inches on average since 1901. According to the IPCC, the rate of sea-level rise since the middle of the 1800s has been higher than the rate during the previous two millennia. Scientists use tide gauges and satellite measurements to track sea-level changes, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Geologists and other Earth scientists can study rocks, fossils and sediment cores to get a longer-term look at sea-level changes, according to NASA.¶The bottom two graphs show rising greenhouse-gas concentrations and estimated emissions of carbon dioxide by humans since 1850. The rising trend is evident on each figure. Scientists monitor carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by pumping air into an artificial chamber and shining an infrared light through the sample. Carbon dioxide absorbs infrared light very efficiently — more on that in a minute -- so the amount of infrared absorbed can be used to calculate the amount of CO2 in the sample. [Top 10 Ways to Destroy Earth]¶The premier (and longest-standing) site for these measurements is the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, which recently reported that the planet’s atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration has surpassed 400 parts per million. In 1958, when observations at Mauna Loa began, the annual carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere was 315 parts per million.¶Carbon dioxide is no dark-horse candidate for the warming of the atmosphere. In 1896, Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius (who would later win the first-ever Nobel Prize for Chemistry) published a paper in the Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science that laid out the basics of what’s now known as “the greenhouse effect.”¶The effect is a result of how energy interacts with the atmosphere. Sunlight enters the atmosphere as ultraviolet and visible light; some of this solar energy is then radiated back toward space as infrared energy, or heat. The atmosphere is 78 percent nitrogen and 21 percent oxygen, which are both gases made up of molecules containing two atoms. These tightly bound pairs don’t absorb much heat.¶But the greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, water vapor and methane, each have at least three atoms in their molecules. These loosely bound structures are efficient absorbers of the long-wave radiation (also known as heat) bouncing back from the planet’s surface. When the molecules in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases re-emit this long-wave radiation back toward Earth’s surface, the result is warming.¶So, temperatures are rising, as are levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide. But are the two connected?¶Yes. The evidence is strong. In 2006, scientists presented a poster at the 18th Conference on Climate Variability and Change that even measured the effect directly. Using spectrometers (tools that measure spectra to identify particular wavelengths), the researchers analyzed the wavelengths of infrared radiation reaching the ground. Based on the varying wavelengths, the scientists determined that more radiation was occurring due to the contribution of specific greenhouse gases.¶Overall, they found that greenhouse gas radiation had increased by 3.5 watts per square meter compared with preindustrial times, a rise of just over 2 percent. Other researchers have noted “missing” infrared wavelengths in radiation into space, a phenomenon that happens because these missing wavelengths get stuck in the atmosphere.¶Scientists also know that the extra carbon in the atmosphere is the very same carbon that comes from burning fossil fuels. By analyzing molecular variations called isotopes, researchers can trace the origin of atmospheric carbon, Moore Powell said.¶“We know what the burning of fossil fuels looks like, in a scientific sense,” she said.¶That’s not to say that the climate is as simple as an actual greenhouse. Many factors influence global temperatures, including volcanic eruptions and variations in the solar cycle and Earth’s orbit that alter the amount of sunlight reaching the planet.¶But scientists know that volcanoes and the sun aren’t to blame for recent climate change. According to the IPCC, volcanic carbon dioxide emissions have been, at most, a hundredth of human CO2 emissions since 1750. In addition, volcanic eruptions cause changes for short timescales of about two years, not the longer-term changes being observed currently.¶The sun is more complex, but researchers have found that the recent solar-cycle minimum (between 1986 and 2008) was actually lower than the previous two solar-cycle minimums (the sun moves between quiet minimums and active maximums about once every five years). If anything, the IPPC concluded, recent solar activity should have resulted in cooling, not warming. Likewise, a 2012 study found that between 2005 and 2010, a period when solar activity was low, the Earth still absorbed 0.58 watts of excess energy per square meter, continuing to warm despite the lower level of solar energy going into the system.¶Given the weight of the evidence, scientists have come to a consensus that climate change is happening, and that human greenhouse gas emissions are the primary cause.¶So where are the real scientific debates?¶There are still a lot of questions left about how fast climate change will happen and what the precise effects will be.¶“What I would say is most uncertain is simply how quickly things are changing,” Moore Powell said. “I’m very interested in the pace.”¶One of the major unknowns is the ultimate influence of clouds on climate: Clouds are white, so they reflect sunlight back toward space, which could have a cooling effect. But clouds are also water vapor, which traps heat. And different types of clouds might have warming or cooling effects, so the precise role of clouds in the feedback loop of global warming remains difficult to untangle, scientists have said.¶Another burning question is how high, and how quickly, the sea level will rise as warming sea waters expand and Antarctic and Arctic ice melts. The IPCC forecasted a rise of 20 to 38 inches, assuming no efforts are made to curb greenhouse gas emissions.¶That range is broad, largely because the dynamics of Antarctic ice sheets are not completely understood. If Antarctica’s land-based glaciers slough off to the sea rapidly with a little bit of warming, that will be bad news for coastal communities, researchers have said. That’s why scientists are watching closely right now as a rift is splitting the Larsen C ice shelf on the Weddell Sea. If the giant iceberg-calving event about to occur destabilizes the ice shelf, it could result in the rapid flow of the land-based glaciers behind it into the ocean. This type of rapid glacial flow already occurred nearby, when the Larsen B ice shelf crumbled in 2002.¶For an ecologist like Moore Powell, there are also myriad questions to answer about how ecosystems will respond to a changing climate. If the pace is slow enough, plants and animals can adapt. But in many places, the change is happening very quickly, Moore Powell said.¶“There’s not enough time at this pace for natural adaptation to take over,” she said.¶Original article on Live Science.

The numbers are in on this freakishly warm February,"

    ","¶WASHINGTON -- A freakishly balmy February broke more than 11,700 local daily records for warmth in the United States, but it didn’t quite beat 1954 for the warmest February on record, climate scientists said.¶The average temperature last month was 41.2 degrees -- 7.3 degrees warmer than normal but three-tenths a degree behind the record, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported Wednesday.¶It was unseasonably toasty for most of the country east of the Rockies, but a cool Pacific Northwest kept the national record from falling, said NOAA climate scientist Jake Crouch.¶Chicago had no snow. Oklahoma hit 99 degrees. Texas and Louisiana had their hottest February. NOAA said local weather stations broke or tied warm temperature records 11,743 times but set cold records only 418 times.¶More in Climate Change¶An international science team’s computer analysis of causes of extreme weather calculated that man-made global warming tripled the likelihood for the nation’s unusually warm February. The mostly private team of researchers, called World Weather Attribution, uses accepted scientific techniques to figure if climate change plays a role in extreme events based on computer simulations of real world conditions and those without heat-trapping gases.¶“I don’t recall ever seeing a February like this,” said Princeton University climate scientist Gabe Vecchi, who was part of the quick attribution study that was not peer reviewed. “We expect this to happen with more and more frequency over time.”¶Several outside scientists praised the quick study including Pennsylvania State University meteorology professor David Titley, who was on a National Academy of Sciences panel that certified the accuracy of climate change attribution science.¶“This is the new climate normal that we all need to come to grips with,” Titley said. “And it’s stunning how quickly our climate has changed.”¶Natural random weather variations and climate change combined to make it a weird February, meteorologists said.¶Overall, NOAA said it was the sixth warmest U.S. winter on record, about 3.7 degrees warmer than the 20th century average.¶“You definitely do feel that this is going to be something that you get to enjoy now and you pay for after the fact,” said Vecchi, who was biking in short-sleeves in New Jersey last month.¶Oklahoma University meteorology professor Jason Furtado said he worries that the lack of deep Arctic cold plunges in February means the Gulf of Mexico never cooled down. And when severe weather season in the spring starts, the moisture coming north from warmer Gulf waters will goose outbreaks and increase the probability of nasty spring storms and tornadoes. Massachusetts already had an unprecedented February tornado.¶A March frost could kill early blooming trees and flowers and the lack of a proper winter could lead to more mosquitoes and ticks this year, Vecchi said.¶“What is lurking behind the corner while we’re outside throwing a Frisbee might be looking to make our lives less pleasant,” he said.",0
EPA chief says carbon dioxide not a primary cause of global warming,"

    ","¶WASHINGTON -- The new chief of the Environmental Protection Agency said Thursday he does not believe that carbon dioxide is a primary contributor to global warming, a statement at odds with mainstream scientific consensus and his own agency.¶EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said measuring the effect of human activity on the climate is “very challenging” and that “there’s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact” of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.¶“So, no, I would not agree that (carbon dioxide) is a primary contributor to the global warming that we see,” Pruitt told CNBC’s “Squawk Box.”¶More in Trump's First 100 Days¶Pruitt’s view is contrary to mainstream climate science, including NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the EPA itself.¶NASA and NOAA reported in January that earth’s 2016 temperatures were the warmest ever. The planet’s average surface temperature has risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit since the late 19th century, “a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide and other human-made emissions into the atmosphere,” the agencies said in a joint statement.¶The EPA says on its website that “carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas that is contributing to recent climate change.” The agency notes that human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels, “release large amounts of CO2, causing concentrations in the atmosphere to rise.”¶Kerry Emanuel, professor of atmospheric science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said Thursday that “Scott Pruitt is just plain wrong on this.”¶Emanuel, co-director of the Lorenz Center at MIT, said the most authoritative compilation of scientific research has shown that increasing carbon dioxide has been the dominant source of global warming, followed by methane and other gases.¶Environmental groups and Democrats seized on Pruitt’s comments as evidence he is unfit for the office he holds.¶“The arsonist is now in charge of the fire department, and he seems happy to let the climate crisis burn out of control,” said Sierra Club executive director Michael Brune.¶Pruitt “is spewing corporate polluter talking points rather than fulfilling the EPA’s mission of protecting our air, our water and our communities,” Brune said, noting that EPA has a legal responsibility to address carbon pollution.¶Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, said the comments underscore that Pruitt is a “climate denier” and insisted lawmakers will stand up to him.¶“Anyone who denies over a century’s worth of established science and basic facts is unqualified to be the administrator of the EPA,” Schatz said in a statement.¶Pruitt previously served as Oklahoma attorney general, where he rose to prominence as a leader in coordinated efforts by Republican attorneys general to challenge former President Obama’s regulatory agenda. He sued or took part in legal actions against the EPA 14 times.¶Pruitt said during his confirmation hearing in January that climate change is real - breaking with President Trump and his own past statements.¶Pruitt told Democratic senators that he disagreed with Mr. Trump’s earlier claims that global warming is a hoax created by the Chinese to harm the economic competitiveness of the United States.¶“I do not believe climate change is a hoax,” Pruitt said.¶In December, Mr. Trump said that he was “open-minded” about climate change -- but also that “nobody really knows” the truth about the issue.¶In an interview with “Fox News Sunday,” moderator Chris Wallace pointed out to Mr. Trump  that in the space of a week he both met with former Vice President Al Gore and appointed Pruitt to head the EPA. Where, Wallace asked, does Mr. Trump stand on climate change? ¶“I’m very open-minded. I’m still open-minded,” he said. “Nobody really knows.”¶Pruitt has previously cast doubt on the extensive body of scientific evidence showing that the planet is warming and man-made carbon emissions are to blame. In a 2016 opinion article, Pruitt suggested that the debate over global warming “is far from settled” and he said “scientists continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and its connection to the actions of mankind.”",0

            Climate Diaries: Saving whales in Antarctica - CBS News
    ",CBS News,"March 6, 2017, 7:57 PM","¶ANTARCTICA -- A pod of killer whales is spotted crossing a stretch of open water. Researchers jump into small boats to chase them, just like in the old days. ¶This hunt, though, isn’t about killing whales.  It’s about trying to save them. ¶“One of the reasons we study top pedators,” said John Durban, “is to understand the health of the ecosystem that supports them.”  ¶It’s an ecosystem that is changing. ¶Durban and Holly Fearnbach are modern whale hunters, using modern gear -- a camera mounted on a drone -- to give the whales a health checkup, and finding some are in trouble.  ¶“She’s very, very thin,” said Fearnbach about a whale. “You can see her ribs really clearly, so she’s lost all of the fat all along her entire body.”¶“You’re looking at a dying whale here?” CBS News asked. ¶“Yes, you’re looking at a dying whale. And she has a dependent offspring and so, once the female dies, then she’s also going to lose her calf, so it’s very worrying,” Fearnbach said. ¶It’s too early to know why it’s happening, but the prime suspect? Antarctica is warming up. ¶“There’s, um, a problem with their food supply, and ... fewer seals,” said Durban. “And that’s what we’ve been seeing so far this year.” ¶“ Less ice, fewer seals -- is that a leap?” CBS News asked. ¶“It’s certainly a hypothesis,” Durban said. ¶Durban and Fearnbach have had to cobble this project together. Fearnbach works for a marine animal welfare organization called SR3, and Durban works for NOAA Fisheries department. ¶They get transport in Antarctica with Lindblad-National Geographic expeditions.   ¶“This is the seventh year in a row that we’ve conducted research on board this ship,” Durban said. ¶And it’s the long-term commitment that’s important. ¶“We’re studying animals that live as long as we do, and to understand them and to get enough opportunities with them, it takes multiple years,” said Durban.¶Right now, though, even the short-term commitment is in doubt.

Antarctica's record high temperatures documented in new report,"

    ","¶Temperatures on the Antarctic continent reached a record-breaking high of 63.5 degrees Fahrenheit in 2015, according to a new report of balmy records for the bottom of the world. ¶And things got even toastier back on Jan. 30, 1982, when the thermometer peaked at 67.6 degrees F at Signy Research Station on Antarctica’s Signy Island, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), a division of the United Nations. This temperature was the highest on record for the Antarctic region, an area including all land and ice south of 60 degrees south latitude, the WMO said. ¶When WMO experts looked at just the continent itself (the area including the continent and its nearby islands), they found that the warmest temperature -- a positively balmy 63.5 degrees F -- happened on March 24, 2015, at the Argentine Esperanza Base research station, located by the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. [Images of Melt: Earth’s Vanishing Ice] ¶More in Climate Change¶The highest temperature for the Antarctic Plateau (an area with an elevation of 8,200 feet, or 2,500 meters) reached 19.4 degrees F at the Automatic Weather Station on the Adélie Coast on Dec. 28, 1980, the report found. ¶These high temperatures are a large departure from the continent’s lowest recorded temperature of minus-128.6 degrees F at Vostok Station on July 21, 1983, the WMO said.  ¶The WMO published the report online March 1 in a continuing effort to expand its worldwide database on extreme weather and climate conditions, the organization said. The database will help the WMO learn about naturally occurring climate change, as well as human-induced climate change along global and regional levels, WMO officials said. ¶Usually, Antarctica is cold, windy and dry, the WMO said. The average annual temperature ranges from about 14 degrees F on the Antarctic coast to about minus-76 degrees F (minus-60 degrees C) in Antarctica’s higher-elevation interior, the WMO said. ¶Moreover, Antarctica’s ice sheet contains 90 percent of the world’s freshwater, and if the ice sheet were to melt, it would raise sea level by about 200 feet. That’s disconcerting, given that the Antarctic Peninsula is one of the fastest-warming regions of the planet, having warmed by almost 5.4 degrees F over the past 50 years, the WMO said. ¶In addition, about 87 percent of glaciers along the Antarctic Peninsula’s west coast have retreated over the past 50 years, especially in the past 12 years, the WMO added. ¶The warming can be felt even during short visits down south, said Jamin Greenbaum, a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics, who was not involved in the new report. ¶“I just returned from Antarctica a few weeks ago, where I saw, firsthand, how warm it was there,” Greenbaum told Live Science. “It was my 10th consecutive fieldwork experience down there, and I’ve never seen so much surface meltwater — it was remarkable.” ¶Meltwater is the result of high temperatures that can melt the surface of the ice and snow, Greenbaum said. Meltwater is fairly alarming, he said, because it can lead to the rapid retreat of coastal ice, as well as sea-level rise. ¶“There was so much [meltwater] that even a large section of the snow road we take every day collapsed, forcing us to use helicopters to commute between the research station and the airfield,” Greenbaum said. [In Photos: Huge Icebergs Break Off Antarctica] ¶Another Antarctic expert, Eric Steig, said that “these temperatures are very likely associated with the extremely strong sea ice loss.” But the origin of that loss “is actually unclear at the moment,” said Steig, an adjunct professor of Earth and space sciences at the University of Washington, who was not involved in the report.  ¶The new report may help scientists figure out what’s behind these high temperatures. For instance, the WMO’s Commission for Climatology international evaluation committee found that the records at all three stations took place during an influx of warm air. ¶The WMO scientists and their colleagues hope to learn more, and they aim to increase weather forecasting capability during the Year of Polar Prediction project, which will last from mid-2017 to mid-2019, the WMO said. ¶Original article on Live Science.

"""A sense of despair"": The mental health cost of unchecked climate change","

    ","¶Climate change is taking an obvious physical toll on earth: from depleted farmland to the rise of toxic pollution to the degradation of long-stable ecosystems to the disappearance of biodiversity and endangered species. ¶But looking beyond the physical, experts are also trying to sound the alarm about the quieter, more insidious effects of climate change: namely, that global warming is threatening the emotional health of humans worldwide. ¶“We see a sense of despair that sets in as inevitably Mother Nature, who we think of as our nurturing force, tells us we’re not going to be able to survive the conditions she’s set for us,” Dr. Lise Van Susteran, a practicing psychiatrist and expert on the dangers of climate change on mental health, told CBS News. ¶More in Climate Change¶Dr. Van Susteran presented on this topic earlier this month at the Climate & Health Meeting in Atlanta, a conference that looked at climate change through the lens of public health. Former Vice President Al Gore organized the meeting when, days before President Trump’s inauguration, a long-planned Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) summit on the topic was abruptly cancelled.¶Study after study shows that climate change has led to an increased burden of psychological disease and injury worldwide, particularly in developing countries. ¶What’s behind this link? For starters, climate change has normalized extreme weather events. These events, including floods, tornadoes, fires, drought, and sea level rise, are known to trigger mental health problems including post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, the abuse of alcohol and drugs, and more.¶Extreme weather has a particularly disturbing link to increased aggression. In 2013, researchers from Princeton University and the University of California-Berkeley found that even slight spikes in temperature and precipitation have increased the risk of personal violence and social upheaval throughout human history. ¶The researchers found that just one standard-deviation shift in heat or rainfall increases the risk of a riot, civil war or ethnic conflict by an average of about 14 percent. A similarly sized uptick in heat or rain triggers a 4 percent increase in person-on-person violence like rape, murder and assault. ¶With projections that the Earth may warm between three and four degrees Fahrenheit by 2050, the researchers warned that climate change is almost certainly the precursor to more human conflict in the near future.¶Global warming is a particularly corrosive force in some farming economies, where overheating, unpredictable weather, new invasive species, and land losses are sinking communities into extreme poverty and creating a breeding ground for violent conflict.  ¶For millions, the effects of climate change are so severe that leaving home is the only option for survival. Thirty-two million people fled their homes because of extreme weather in 2012 alone, according to the United Nations. ¶Escaping hazards ranging from mudslides to drought, climate refugees add more stress to an already dire refugee situation worldwide. According to the UN, the world is currently witnessing the highest levels of displacement on record.¶As climate refugees become more and more common, refugee laws lag behind: none of the existing international or regional refugees law mechanisms specifically addresses climate refugees, the UN says. ¶Climate change is triggering mental health problems beyond just developing countries and conflict zones. ¶In cities, babies who are exposed in the uterus to higher levels of urban air pollutants (known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) are more likely to develop symptoms of anxiety and depression down the line, Columbia University researchers found in 2012. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are the chemicals come from burning fossil fuels. ¶“Climate anxiety” can cripple individuals regardless of their geography, privilege, or vulnerability to the effects of climate change, Dr. Van Susteran said. Joining with other mental health professionals, she is one of the founders behind the Climate Psych Alliance, a new coalition trying to raise awareness about the links between climate change and clinical trauma. ¶“You can see how desperate, angry, despairing people are,” she said. “It’s a legitimate response to what people see as inaction, intentional inaction... Whether we know it or not, whether you accept it or not, everyone experiences climate anxiety.”¶Seen through a certain lens, inaction on global warming meets the criteria of child abuse for future generations, she said.¶“When children believe their parents didn’t do something right, or did something wrong, they spend a whole lifetime feeling abandoned. What in the world are future generations going to think or feel when they know that action could have been taken?” ¶In the age of an unstable climate, the link between natural disasters and psychological trauma is “under-examined, underestimated and not adequately monitored,” Italian researchers assessed in a January study in the journal Occupational and Environmental Medicine. That research gap is particularly worrisome in Africa, German researchers said in a paper published last year. ¶Climate change is often the hidden catalyst — the fuel behind war, displacement and collapsed economies that doesn’t make it into the headlines.¶Syria’s civil war, for instance, is most frequently framed as an entrenched political conflict. Closer examination shows that’s far from the full story: in fact, the country’s six-year conflict is rooted in a devastating drought. Earnings depleted and Syrian farmers moved to overcrowded cities, where political corruption and public health crises helped foment bloody revolution. ¶Climate change carries enormous political risk for the 21st century, Dr. Van Susteran warned. ¶“In times of peril and scarcity, people regress,” she said. “They turn to what they perceive as strong leaders to protect them, and are willing to give up their freedoms and values in exchange for perceived security.”",0
"Global warming, overfishing threaten Earth's ""super-zoos,"" scientists warn","

      / AP
    ","¶WASHINGTON -- The six ocean hot spots that teem with the biggest mix of species are also getting hit hardest by global warming and industrial fishing, a new study finds. ¶An international team looked at more than 2,100 species of fish, seabirds, marine mammals and even tiny plankton to calculate Earth’s hot spots of marine biodiversity. ¶These underwater super-zoos are in patches of ocean that are overfished and warming fast, and these pressures hurt the lush life there, according to a study appearing in Wednesday’s journal Science Advances. ¶More in Climate Change¶“In those hot spots, the changes are already happening,” says study co-author Andre Chiaradia, a senior scientist and penguin expert at the Phillip Island Nature Parks in Australia. “They are the most at risk.” ¶Several outside marine and climate scientists praised the work, saying it showed the importance of protecting these areas and reducing fishing. ¶“Biodiversity and fisheries are humanity’s legacy” that should be preserved, marine ecologist Maria Vernet of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography said in an email. She wasn’t part of the research. ¶While scientists in the past have identified key areas of biodiversity, the new work is more detailed. Researchers found the liveliest ocean hot spot also happens to be where the science of evolution sprouted: the Pacific Ocean off the central South American coast. It includes the area around the Galapagos Islands and goes back to “our good friend (Charles) Darwin. When he went there, he got amazed,” Chiaradia said. ¶Other hot spots include the southwestern Atlantic Ocean off Argentina; the western Indian Ocean off the African coast; the central western Pacific Ocean surrounding Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines; the southwestern Pacific off Australia’s southern and eastern coast; and the Oceania region of the Pacific around the international date line. Four of the six hot spots are in the Pacific; all are either in the southern hemisphere or just north of the equator. ¶“What makes this biodiversity? It’s the isolation,” Chiardia said. “On land, we have kangaroos and weird animals like the platypus. And in the ocean it’s not different.” ¶The ocean is home to Australian sea dragons, a fish related to the seahorse that resemble mythical dragons and sometimes even have yellow and purple markings on their bodies. ¶These hot spots also tend to be places where the ocean waters churn more, Chiardia said. ¶Penguins, which are near the top of the food chain, are a good example of the impact of changing water temperatures and currents. Warm El Nino waters have decimated Galapagos penguins and the population of southern African penguins has dropped by about 90 percent in just 20 years, Chiardia said. ",0
Bill would leave evolution and climate skepticism up to teachers,"

    ","¶PIERRE, S.D. — South Dakota legislators are weighing whether to let teachers decide how much skepticism to work into lessons on contentious scientific topics such as evolution and climate change.¶A House committee on Wednesday is set to consider the measure, which would give legal protection to teachers who want to discuss “in an objective scientific manner the strengths and weaknesses” of the subjects.¶South Dakota is one of at least three states, along with Texas and Oklahoma, considering such a bill. Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee have enacted similar laws, according to Glenn Branch, deputy director of the California-based National Center for Science Education, which opposes the proposal. ¶More in Climate Change¶Branch said there are concerns that such a bill would embolden some teachers to start presenting creationism in their classrooms.¶Critics argue that the measure is bad for students and that allowing teachers to teach any science curriculum they choose could subject school districts to litigation. Federal courts have struck down attempts to present creationism in various forms at public schools, Branch said.¶South Dakota Sen. Jeff Monroe, the bill’s prime sponsor, said teachers should be able to talk about weaknesses in scientific theories, but he disputed that it would allow for creationism to seep into school teachings. Rogue teaching of creationism instead of science wouldn’t happen because it’s not included in South Dakota’s science content standards, he said.¶The Republican has said he has heard from concerned teachers, including one who was chastised for discussing how embryos develop and another who was frustrated that she was forced to teach climate change as a fact.¶“That’s how we got off the theory that man can’t fly, that’s how we got off the flat earth theory, by analyzing the theories, not by being stuck, told this is true and you’re going to believe it and they’re going to teach it as true,” said Monroe, who added that it could help students learn.¶The effort may face a hurdle in GOP Gov. Dennis Daugaard, who said in a recent letter to a group of Augustana University professors that he views the bill as unnecessary.¶Deb Wolf, a high school science instructional coach who helps teachers in Sioux Falls schools write science curriculum said the bill is superfluous. She said she’s concerned that it would protect educators who teach things that aren’t “truly science.”¶Pam Wells, a Mobridge-Pollock High School science teacher, said some parents have asked her to teach intelligent design during her 35 years in public schools. Wells said she read the textbooks they gave her on the subject, but decided not to include it in her curriculum because the theories weren’t based in science.¶Wells said one high school senior told her that he wouldn’t come to her class if she dropped evolutionary theory and picked up intelligent design, which holds that certain features of life forms are so complex that they can best be explained by an origin from an intelligent higher power. “He said, ‘If I wanted to learn about that I’d go to church,” said Wells, who plans to testify against the bill.¶Shannon Schlomer is a father of five kids who have attended Mobridge-area schools. He has written letters to the editor of the local paper urging lawmakers to kill the bill, which he said aims to belittle established science and would hurt kids in South Dakota who want to go to college to become physicists, geologists or cosmologists.¶Steve Matzner, an Augustana professor who signed a letter earlier this month urging House members to vote against the bill, teaches introductory biology classes every year. Some of the students come from small schools where evolutionary theory is breezed over, and they tend to struggle grasping evidence-based teaching, he said.¶“The biggest effect of the bill would be that it could underprepare high school students if their science education is being watered down,” he said.

A plunge into the freezing Antarctic Ocean water is something you may only want to try once.¶But encounters with the Antarctic wildlife are something you may want to do over and over again. These trips are called expeditions, not cruises, for reasons that go beyond marketing. ¶And with climate-change skeptics in the White House, they may be a new model for how scientific research gets paid for in the future.¶Renowned Antarctic ice scientist Ken Taylor says word is already out that there will be less research money available from this administration.¶“We’ve already gotten indications from our federal funding agencies, particularly the National Science Foundation, that we should anticipate budget cuts,” Taylor said. “It didn’t take very long after the election for that word to come down.”¶Even when research is government-funded, the money often doesn’t go far enough, even now. ¶John Durban, an employee of the NOAA Fisheries department, uses a drone to check on the health of Antarctic whales.

They leave with knowledge.¶The scientists on board give the tourists a sense of purpose, and if it weren’t for the tourists, the scientists wouldn’t be here. It’s a marriage made in heaven.",0
NASA satellite spots mile-long iceberg breaking off of Antarctic glacier,"

    ","¶A massive, 1-mile-long chunk of ice has broken off Antarctica’s fast-changing Pine Island Glacier, and NASA satellites captured the dramatic event as the icy surface cracked and ripped apart.¶The Pine Island Glacier is one of the largest glaciers within the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, accounting for about 20 percent of the ice sheet’s total ice flow to the ocean, according to NASA scientists. The immense glacier is also one of the least stable, and in recent years, the ice sheet has been quickly retreating and losing massive amounts of ice. Previously, icebergs the size of cities have broken off of the Pine Island Glacier. [Photo Gallery: Antarctica’s Pine Island Glacier Cracks]¶The glacier’s last major iceberg break — an event known as calving — was in July 2015, when an iceberg measuring almost 225 square miles separated from Pine Island Glacier.¶More in Climate Change¶The Earth-watching Landsat 8 satellite captured images of the latest iceberg event between Jan. 25 and 29, seeing the progression from the initial crack to the iceberg floating into the bay. Though this latest iceberg is about 10 times smaller than the 2015 event, measuring between 0.6 and 1.2 miles, NASA scientists said the recent break shows how fragile the ice shelf is.¶“I think this event is the calving equivalent of an ‘aftershock’ following the much bigger event,” Ian Howat, a glaciologist at The Ohio State University, said in a statement. “Apparently, there are weaknesses in the ice shelf — just inland of the rift that caused the 2015 calving — that are resulting in these smaller breaks.”¶More icebergs may break off of the Pine Island Glacier in the near future. NASA has previously photographed small rifts developing about 6 miles from the ice front, and one such rift was observed on Nov. 4, 2016, during one of the agency’s Operation IceBridge flights to monitor the region.¶Climate change and the warming ocean have been linked to the the retreat and melt of the world’s ice. According to Howat, such “rapid fire” calving is generally unusual for the glacier, but West Antarctic glaciers are eroding due to the flow of warm ocean water beneath them. A recent study found that the warming ocean was melting an ice crevasse of the Pine Island Glacier at the bedrock level, melting the glacier from its center.¶These warmer ocean waters are causing the Antarctic ice shelf to break from the inside out. As such, scientists expect further calving along the glacier and have warned that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet could collapse within the next 100 years.¶Original article on Live Science.",0

            Climate Diaries: Dramatic decline in Antarctica's penguin population due to climate change - CBS News
    ",CBS News,"February 15, 2017, 6:55 AM","¶In this installment of our “Climate Diaries” series, CBS News correspondent Mark Phillips continues his reporting from Antarctica, one of the most remote places on earth. He shows us the dramatic shifts happening around a half-century-old research base. The icescape and the area’s penguin population reveal the impact of the rapid pace of climate change.¶It can seem like a landscape frozen in time in Antarctica, but it’s anything but. And one place has been keeping meticulous records of the changes for 50 years, reports CBS News correspondent Mark Phillips. ¶At Palmer Station, about 40 people work at a U.S. research base that has clung to this rocky outcrop on the Antarctic coast since the mid-1960s.¶ Bob Farrell has run the station for the past 18 years. If anybody knows how things have been changing here, it’s him. ¶“It changes all the time. I mean, day to day it changes,” Farrell said.   Palmer was put here because it was a great place to study Antarctic wildlife. It sat in the middle of the perfect habitat for the Adelie penguin, who nested here in their tens of thousands. These are the birds that brought you “Happy Feet.” But they don’t seem happy any more.¶“We’re counting the penguins every year,” said Shawn Farry. He is called the “bird man.” But lately, he’s had a lot fewer birds to study. ¶“These local islands where we’ve been censusing for – it’s 43 years now -- have declined by about 85 percent,” Farry said.              “Eight-five percent?” Philips asked.                “The numbers on this island at their peak were almost 9,000 and this year, it was about 1,200,” Farry said.              The Adelie penguins need one essential condition to thrive. They need sea ice to hunt from, and there’s less of that around now.             “In the last several decades, the amount of ice along the peninsula declined by about, well, three months of sea ice,” Farry said.¶“The sea ice season is three months shorter than it used to be?” Phillips asked.¶“Correct,” Farry said. ¶At first, it was hoped the penguins had simply moved further south into the Antarctic in search of the ice they love. Sadly, it seems not.             “We do work other places down the peninsula looking for them,” Farry said.              “You’re not finding them?” Phillips asked.                    ¶“Correct. We’re not finding them,” Farry said.¶Not just the sea ice is retreating at Palmer. The base is next door to a spectacular glacier that is less spectacular than it used to be. They’ve got a photograph showing the extent of the glacial ice in 1975 and where it had retreated to by 2013. Then a funny thing happened.¶Normally in places like this, you talk about things moving at glacial speed, taking their time -- not here. Here they know exactly when that glacier split off from this place. On March 14, 2014, this became Detrich Island. ¶They had thought the island was part of the mainland, until the glacier linking it to the shore collapsed and disappeared.¶The speed of change has shocked even Farrell, the old Antarctica hand. ¶“Yeah, I mean, when you come back here after a year and you see, ‘Wow, the glacier is quite a bit farther back,’ or you have people coming back who haven’t been here for quite a while and they’re shocked by it,” Farrell said. “Yeah, it’s really remarkable.”             They’ve got a little bet going on Palmer Station where they’ve always thought the base was on the mainland. Now they think it may actual be on an island. They may not have to wait long to find out.  ",0
Climate threat to wildlife may have been massively underreported,"

    ","¶More than 700 of the world’s threatened and endangered animal species may be directly affected by climate change, according to a new study — vastly more than the number of animal species scientists initially thought would face risks from global warming.¶Scientists had previously determined that only 7 percent of mammals and 4 percent of birds on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) “Red List” of threatened species are affected by climate change. However, a new study finds that the threat from climate change may have been massively underreported.¶In a comprehensive analysis of 130 previous studies on the subject, researchers found that nearly half of the world’s threatened and endangered mammals and nearly a quarter of birds are already seriously impacted — more than 700 species total. [8 Ways Global Warming Is Already Changing the World]¶More in Climate Change¶Most climate change studies focus on impacts in the future, but the researchers said the effects of global warming are being felt “here and now.” And research on present threats were focused on specific species and were spread across numerous journals, according to study co-author James Watson, director of the Science and Research Initiative at the Wildlife Conservation Society.¶“We did the study because no one had really pulled together the evidence of how much climate change has impacted species to date,” Watson told Live Science. “We know that the last 50 years have been warmer than the 50 years before that, and that there’s already been a 1-degree [Celsius] global warming event, but no one really talks about it.”¶Once the researchers combined the studies into one analysis, Watson said the evidence of change was apparent and they could generalize trends across species. For example, the species most threatened lived in areas that have already warmed dramatically, or they had very specific survival requirements.¶Primates, in particular, are threatened because they have specialized diets and their tropical homes are vulnerable to extreme weather events caused by climate change. In some cases, species can adapt to the changes, but others are facing dire consequences, Watson said.¶“For instance, mountain gorillas live on top of mountains — they’ve got nowhere else to go if the climate changes,” Watson said. “They’re stuck on top of these mountains, so they might not survive climate change because they can’t move anywhere else.”¶Though birds can fly from mountaintop homes, the researchers found that species that live at higher altitudes and experience little seasonal temperature changes are negatively affected by climate change. Animals that dwell in aquatic environments also face even higher risks because these ecosystems are among the most vulnerable to global warming, according to the scientists.¶While the analysis notes that slightly more than 700 species may be affected by climate change, the researchers said this study only scratches the surface of how many of the planet’s endangered species are at risk. The studies reviewed for their research only focused on mammals and birds — the most well-studied taxonomic groups, according to the scientists.¶“We looked at only the most mobile species that probably should adapt the best and we found that they’re getting hammered,” Watson said. “Cold-blooded animals are probably even more susceptible to climate change and we didn’t even look at them yet. Certain types of plants even are far more susceptible, because they can’t move — they’re actually stuck in the soil.”¶The researchers are also calling for conservation efforts and governmental policies on climate change to focus on the present impacts on animals.¶“We have to give species their best chance to overcome this, and the only way to do that is to keep nature intact,” Watson said. “It’s pretty simple really, we’ve just got to stop altering nature and degrading nature. We’ve got to keep things functioning and hope for the best.”¶The new analysis is detailed in a paper published online Monday, Feb. 13, in the journal Nature Climate Change.¶Original article on Live Science.",0

            Climate Diaries: Researchers using unusual techniques to save killer whales in the Antarctic - CBS News
    ",CBS News,"February 14, 2017, 7:06 AM","¶In this latest installment of the “Climate Diaries” series, CBS News correspondent Mark Phillips is in Antarctica, following a group of researchers chasing killer whales. They are using new technology, including drones, to learn about the health of the ocean’s top predator. Phillips shows us how the Antarctic Ocean’s dwellers are experiencing the effects of climate change.¶The ship that took a CBS News team to the U.S. research base at Palmer Station, Antarctica is not your average love boat.  There’s some serious scientific work being done on this cruise, and the findings are not always happy ones, reports CBS News correspondent Mark Phillips.    The National Geographic Explorer is a different kind of adventure cruise ship. She’s on a whale hunt, cutting through the pack ice near the Antarctic Circle. The good ship Explorer is not just here for sightseeing, although there’s plenty to see.¶ And while nobody shouts “Thar she blows,” when whales are spotted, this time in open water, people do jump into small boats to chase them, just like in the old days. This hunt, though, isn’t about killing whales; it’s about saving them. It’s about giving them a health check, and the prognosis isn’t particularly good.¶“One of the reasons we study top predators -- and killer whales are the top predator in the ocean -- is to understand the health of the ecosystem that supports them,” said John Durban. He and Holly Fearnbach are modern whale hunters who use the latest tools. They use a drone fitted with equipment to monitor the whales’ condition. ¶“With a small drone like this, we can fly just a little over 100 feet -- the whales don’t know it’s there -- and we fly a camera much lower so the quality of the images are so much better,” Durban explained.  ¶ The results are better pictures, but, it turns out, not better whales. The images of one pod of killer whales were not encouraging, particularly for the adult female -- the mother of the family.¶ “What’s wrong with her?” Phillips asked.             “She’s very, very thin,” Fearnbach said. ¶ “You could see just following her, her whole body profile, you could see her ribs really clearly, so she’s lost all of the fat along her entire body,” Fearnbach said.  “You’re looking at a dying whale here?” Phillips asked.¶             “Yes, you’re looking at a dying whale. And she has a dependent offspring, and so once the female dies, then she’s also going to lose her calf, so it’s very worrying,” Fearnbach said.¶And it’s not just the size of the whales that Durban and Fearnbach are looking at. You wouldn’t think you could take health-analyzing samples from whales out here in the Antarctic Ocean, but you can. The team has developed a technique – here they’re using it in the Pacific – to actually breathalyze whales by flying through the cloud of mist they produce when they breathe.  ¶ “You can tell by flying through that cloud of whale breath, the exhalation of a whale… you’re picking up what’s inside the whale, is what you’re saying?” Phillips asked.             “Yeah. So these collection plates, like the one on the top here and the front here, they’re sterile, and we’re able to collect droplets of whale blow. And from that, we take them back to the lab and use genetic techniques to identify the microorganisms that are in that blow,” Durban explained. ¶It’s early in the program and Durban and Fearnbach are just building up a database of what comes out of a whale’s blowhole. But if a whale is unwell, the theory is you’d effectively be able to smell it on their breath.¶In the meantime, they can only take an educated guess on why they’re finding sick whales in these pristine waters, which, like everywhere else, are getting warmer. The pack ice around which they normally hunt is not as abundant as it used to be; neither is the food they hunt for. ¶“Our hypothesis certainly is there’s… you know, a problem with their food supply, and… fewer seals. And that’s what we’ve been seeing so far this year,” Durban said.¶“Less ice, fewer seals? Is that a leap?” Phillips asked.¶“It’s certainly a hypothesis,” Durban said. ¶The next time Durban and Fearnbach are down this way, they’ll be looking for this family of whales, hoping they’re still around. Because this place is so remote and so difficult to work in for much of the year, wildlife research is less developed than in the Arctic. Everybody knows about the polar bears; now, it’s time to think about the killer whales.",0

It’s very clear,” said Ken Taylor, a scientist who runs one of the continent’s most ambitious ice research projects. ¶And what’s going on is the huge crack that’s opened up in one of the floating ice shelves that cling to the coast here.¶“There’s a large berg about to break off of the Larsen Ice Shelf,” Taylor said. “The size of Delaware, yes, it’s very large and the fracture that is breaking off is expanding quite a bit lately, jumps about a mile every week or so.”¶It’s not the ice from the ice shelf that is worrying.¶More Antarctic ice flowing into the sea would increase the threat to low-lying coastal areas around the world, including in the United States.¶“There are several spots around Antarctica that are believed to be in this irreversible situation, where the ice on the ground is going to flow into the sea and there’s nothing we can do to stop it at this point,” Taylor said.¶Eric Guth is part of the Extreme Ice Survey, a scientific study that uses time-lapse photography to document what’s happening and prove that Antarctic ice is on the move. ¶Images snapped every hour, then strung together, show how quickly the glaciers are flowing.  The pictures aren’t just useful for science, but they have another purpose, according to Guth.¶“Much of the general public are visual learners, as am I, and I think being able to see that with your own eyes is a very compelling way of communicating information,” he said.¶Arguments over the causes of climate change may be raging again at home. In Antarctica, suggestions of a hoax come up against some cold hard facts.  ¶Taylor, the ice scientist, normally drills miles deep into the icecap for answers. Sometimes, though, they’re floating all around.¶Bubbles trapped in the ice contain the air that was around tens of thousands of years ago, when the ice froze.  And that air that contained a fraction of the warming greenhouse gasses the human race is now pumping into the atmosphere.  ¶“If you break this open and smell that air, you’re smelling ancient air. It’s really good air, it’s like air before humans messed up the atmosphere,” Taylor said.¶There’s another kind of chill in Antarctica as well, a chill felt by the scientific community who fear the research money they need will be harder to come by in the future. And that there is a less sympathetic ear in government for the kind of science they’re doing.",0

This morning, traveling aboard the Lindblad Expeditions National Geographic Explorer, he reports from the far-less-traveled continent of Antarctica, where a massive iceberg is poised to break away, at a time of uncertainty over the U.S. government’s policy toward climate change:¶It’s high summer down in Cierva Cove, Antarctica, and the temperature has been soaring all the way up to the freezing point. But when it comes to doing climate research, this is one of the hottest places on the planet.¶Summer in Antarctica is an explosion of life in a place often thought of as a bleak, frozen wasteland.¶And it’s an explosion of scientific research, because this is the time of year when Antarctica is accessible and can be studied. This is when it reveals the secrets that have been locked into its ice.¶Ken Taylor, one of America’s foremost ice scientists, has been studying the huge crack that’s opened up in one of the floating ice shelves that cling to the coast of Antarctica. “There’s a large berg about to break off of the Larsen ice shelf,” he said. ¶A berg the size of Delaware.  ¶“Yes, it’s very large, and the fracture that is breaking off is expanding quite a bit lately, it jumps about a mile every week or so.”¶It’s not so much the floating sea ice from the shelf that is worrying; it’s that without the ice shelf to hold it back, the glacial ice on land will flow into the ocean more quickly and drive sea levels up even more than the three feet that is already predicted for this century.¶“There are several spots around here, around Antarctica, that are believed to be in this irreversible situation, where the ice on the ground is going to flow into the sea, and there’s nothing we can do to stop it at this point,” Taylor said. ¶Eric Guth is trying to get at science in another way. Because there are concerns about ice shelf stability, there are concerns about warming sea temperatures around the Antarctic peninsula.¶What Guth is producing is an overview … literally. He is part of the Extreme Ice Survey that is documenting the changes that are happening, in pictures. Cameras placed at strategic locations snap one shot an hour, year-round.¶And they produce time-lapse images showing how the glaciers are moving, looking to see if they’re speeding up or getting thinner.¶“This type of visual evidence, I think, is what people need,” Guth said. “Much of the general public are visual learners, as am I, and I think being able to see that with your own eyes is a very compelling way of communicating information.”¶Why is all this happening? Again, the ice tells the story, and it is not in denial.¶Ken Taylor normally drills miles deep into the Antarctic icecap to find the answers. Sometimes, though, you can find them floating all around you. ¶Trapped in the ice are bubbles of the air that was around tens of thousands of years ago when it was frozen -- air that had a fraction of the amount of the greenhouse gases in it compared to what the human race is pumping into the atmosphere now.  ¶“It’s trapped in the ice, and if you release it, you can tell what the atmosphere was like 20-, 50-, 100,000 ago?” Phillips asked.¶“If you break this open and smell that air, you’re smelling ancient air. It’s really good air! It’s like air before humans messed up the atmosphere, yeah,” Taylor replied.¶There’s another kind of chill down here as well -- a chill in the scientific community who’s working here. A fear the research money they need for their work will be less forthcoming in the future, and a less sympathetic ear in government for the kind of science they do.",0

    ","¶An expansive new image shows the changes in Antarctica’s Larsen Ice Shelf since the mid-1980s.¶The story is one of retreat, and the ice continues to crumble. A growing crack in a portion of the ice shelf called Larsen C is poised to free an iceberg the size of Delaware from the continent.¶Larson C isn’t visible in the new satellite image, which focuses on two more northerly portions of the sheet, Larsen A and Larsen B. Ice shelves are floating mattresses of ice that form from the outflow of the glaciers that creep slowly across the Antarctic continent. The Larsen Ice Shelf is on the northeast coast of the Antarctic Peninsula along the Weddell Sea. It was named for the Norwegian explorer Carl Anton Larsen, who explored parts of it in 1893 by ship and ski. [Images of Melt: Earth’s Vanishing Ice]¶More in Climate Change¶Since 1995, the Larsen Ice Shelf has lost 75 percent of its mass, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). In 1995, a 579-square-mile (1,500 square kilometers) chunk of Larsen A broke off from the ice shelf, according to NASA’s Earth Observatory. In 2002, an even larger portion of Larsen B — 1,255 square miles (3,250 square km) crumbled away. While calving events are normal, collapses of this magnitude have only been seen in the last 30 years, according to the NSIDC.¶The collapse of floating ice doesn’t raise sea levels, but a 2004 study by NSIDC researchers found that in the wake of Larsen B’s 2002 collapse, the land-based glaciers that feed the ice sheet have accelerated their flow toward the sea. This speedy flow of ice does have the ability to raise sea levels.   ¶“You can think of the Larsen or really any ice shelf like it is a cork in the neck of a champagne bottle lying on its side,” Christopher Shuman, a researcher who has studied these ice sheets at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, told the Earth Observatory. “Once you pop that cork, the wine inside — all that glacial ice sitting on land — will start flowing out.”¶The newly released image is a combination of four images that were taken by the Operational Land Imager on the Landsat 8 satellite on Jan. 6 and Jan. 8, according to the Earth Observatory. An overlay shows the former extent of the ice shelf in 1986, 2002 and 2016.¶The ice sheets are not only retreating, but also thinning, as a 2016 study in the journal Annals of Glaciology by Shuman and his colleagues found. The ice shelf is losing thickness at a rate of between 6.2 feet and 8.9 feet (1.9 and 2.7 meters) each year, with the fastest losses occurring on the eastern side of the shelf, the researchers reported. Scientists expect the remnants of the Larsen B Ice Shelf to vanish entirely as early as 2020, marking the end of an ice mass that previously persisted for 12,000 years.¶Original article on Live Science.

"Major global warming study again questioned, again defended","

    ","¶WASHINGTON — Another round of bickering is boiling over about temperature readings used in a 2015 study to show how the planet is warming.¶The issue is about how readings gathered decades ago were adjusted to try to get a clearer picture of how the Earth’s temperature is changing now. Those adjustments have been questioned by some who reject mainstream climate science and have tried to claim there has been a pause in global warming.¶A January study in a scientific journal used another set of measurements to confirm the readings and prove again that the earth’s temperature is rising quickly and that the warming has not paused.¶But a congressional committee on Tuesday seized on complaints from a retired scientist from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration about how the original data were handled to claim the data were falsified — even though the retired NOAA scientist they cite does not argue that it was.¶More in Climate Change¶What is being touted as a scientific scandal is more about data handling than what rising temperatures show, according to phone and email interviews with more than two dozen experts on the issue, including the former government scientist, whose blogging Saturday reignited a debate.¶The hubbub was sparked when retired NOAA data scientist John Bates claimed in a blog post that his boss, then-director of the National Centers for Environmental Information Thomas Karl, “constantly had his ‘thumb on the scale’ — in the documentation, scientific choices and release of datasets — in an effort to discredit the notion of a global warming hiatus” and rushed a study published in the journal Science before international climate negotiations.¶Bates said in an interview Monday with The Associated Press that he was most concerned about the way data was handled, documented and stored, raising issues of transparency and availability. He said Karl didn’t follow the more than 20 crucial data storage and handling steps that Bates created for NOAA. He said it looked like the June 2015 study was pushed out to influence the December 2015 climate treaty negotiations in Paris.¶However Bates, who acknowledges that Earth is warming from man-made carbon dioxide emissions, said in the interview that there was “no data tampering, no data changing, nothing malicious.”¶“It’s really a story of not disclosing what you did,” Bates said in the interview. “It’s not trumped up data in any way shape or form.”¶Still, after Bates’ blog post, the House Science Committee, a British tabloid newspaper and others who reject mainstream climate science accused NOAA of playing “fast and loose” with land and water temperature data.¶House Science Committee Chairman Lamar Smith, R-Texas, speaking at a hearing Tuesday, called on Science to retract the 2015 study and blasted NOAA for not being cooperative with his subpoenas. When the journal’s publisher Rush Holt, a physicist and former Democratic congressman, said the charges don’t support a retraction because the issue is more about data procedures than science, Smith, an attorney, interrupted him and insisted: “They falsified global warming data.”¶The Karl study looked mostly at ocean temperature records several decades old and determined that those older readings skewed too warm when compared to modern monitoring from buoys and other devices because they were taken in ships’ engine rooms. He adjusted those old readings down, which makes it clearer that the earth’s temperature is rising now.¶Since then, a new independent study from the University of California, Berkeley looked at the same issue in a different way, and confirmed the Karl calculations.¶“Not using their data we get the exact same results, both for the ocean record and for the land,” said Zeke Hausfather, lead author of the Berkeley study. He called Bates’ claims “all about procedural disagreements within NOAA that have very little bearing about our understanding about what’s happening to Earth’s climate.”¶Marcia McNutt, who was editor of Science at the time the paper was published and is now president of the National Academy of Sciences, praised Bates for wanting to highlight the importance of data archiving, but said his criticisms have little to do with the main part of the paper and chastised the House for using issues of data archiving to try to discredit the 2015 study.¶“The study has been reproduced independently of Karl et al — that’s the ultimate platinum test of whether a study is to be believed or not,” McNutt said. “And this study has passed.”¶The Associated Press interviewed more than two dozen experts by phone or email. Most agreed with Karl or didn’t take a side but said it didn’t matter because global warming continues regardless of this latest kerfuffle. Two supported Bates, saying there were serious scientific integrity concerns.¶As far as the study being rushed, the journal says its records show otherwise. Science’s new editor-in-chief Jeremy Berg said it usually takes 109 days between a paper’s submission and its publication. The Karl study was received by the journal on Dec. 23, 2014 and published 185 days later, on June 26, 2015.¶“The paper was not rushed in any way,” McNutt said. “It had an exceptional number of reviewers, many more than average because we knew it was on a controversial topic. It had a lot of data analysis.”",0

    ","¶SAN FRANCISCO -- Ocean rise already is worsening the floods and high tides sweeping California this stormy winter, climate experts say, and this month’s damage and deaths highlight that even a state known as a global leader in fighting climate change has yet to tackle some of the hardest work of dealing with it.¶The critical steps yet to come include starting to decide which low-lying cities, airports and highways, along with threatened landmarks like San Francisco’s Embarcadero, to hoist above the rising water and which to abandon -- and where to start getting the many billions of dollars for those climate rescues.¶“People always tell us we’re ahead of the curve” on climate change, said Larry Goldzband, head of a regional San Francisco Bay commission that late last year stepped up regional efforts to identify and prioritize communities and infrastructure at risk from rising sea level. As proud as Californians are of their climate-change efforts, “I always think, ‘Man, if we are ahead of the curve, I feel sorry for the rest of the country,’” Goldzband said.¶More in Climate Change¶A 2009 study by the Pacific Institute, a California-based environment think-tank, estimated $100 billion in property was at risk from ocean rise in California, two-thirds of it in the low-lying San Francisco Bay region. That’s far more than the state takes in from income taxes each year.¶Experts say the real cost of raising, shielding or evacuating vulnerable spots, which include mass-transit systems, power plants and sewage plants, could be far higher.¶“Astronomical. The San Francisco airport? What would it cost to replace that?” asked Gary Griggs, director of the Institute of Marine Sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz.¶Griggs is part of a scientific working group requested by Gov. Jerry Brown to examine whether new evidence on melting and potential ice-sheet collapse in the Antarctic, whose ice holds almost 90 percent of the Earth’s fresh water, means sea-level rise may be even higher than the 3 feet projected for California by the end of the century.¶The Pacific off California has risen just about 8 inches overall in the past century. For the next three decades or so, the accelerating pace of sea rise primarily will make worse the flooding and erosion from big storms like this month’s in California.¶“Probably until mid-century, short-term events ... are going to be more damaging than sea-level rise itself,” Griggs said.¶In January, a series of powerful storms brought more than a foot of rain to parts of the San Francisco Bay, triggered record 34-foot waves off the state’s central coast, killed at least five people and prompted the evacuations of thousands around the state.¶The dead included a cab driver who slid off a wet road and into a swollen estuary off Oakland’s airport, which along with San Francisco’s bayside airport is one of the big sites expected to be hit more and more often by flooding as the Pacific Ocean rises a foot over the next 30 years.¶Brown, who declared an emergency in much of the state this month because of flooded towns and highways, crumbled roads and rockslides, has vowed to fight if the fossil-fuel friendly Trump administration goes after California’s landmark programs to reduce climate-changing carbon emissions. Brown’s administration in 2015 also sought to speed up planning for dealing with sea rise and other climate change.¶On a sparkling afternoon after three storms brought some of the heaviest rain and surf to California in decades, ecologist Fraser Shilling stood on a highway bridge north of San Francisco, looking over sprawling miles of floodwater and salty bay water swallowing the highway’s exit ramp, and drowning salt marshes and fence posts as far as the eye could see.¶State Route 37 is a busy highway for tens of thousands of commuters and truckers in and out of California’s wine country. Shilling, a co-director of the Road Ecology Center at the University of California, Davis, had forecast it wouldn’t be seeing this kind of regular high water for at least another 20 years.¶“This is the new normal,” says Shilling, who believes sea rise already is changing conditions on the ground more than some state agencies realize. “And all of our infrastructure is not accommodating the new normal.”¶Pumps and bulldozers labored to clear water from another stretch of the state highway, two weeks after the storms.¶State and local governments acknowledge that low-lying sites like State Route 37 will be hit by sea-rise worsened floods and tides more and more, before the bay claims them completely.¶But authorities are stymied by the financial and political difficulties of raising billions to elevate or protect the highway, or reroute it through pricey vineyards inland. As it is now, substantial state funding isn’t expected for this particular highway until 2088, long after parts of it are expected to be regularly submerged.¶“Our biggest challenge is how to fund and build it before it goes underwater,” said Kate Miller, executive director of the transportation authority for Napa County.¶California might not really start funding its rescues from sea rise until a major part of the public is inconvenienced, said state Sen. Jerry Hill, a Democrat from San Mateo County.¶Hill’s prediction of what would free the funds: If a low-lying stretch of U.S. Highway 101 near San Francisco’s old Candlestick Park floods, and much of the Bay Area suddenly could not get to work.¶“That will be the wake-up call, when the rubber hits the road,” he said. “When the water hits the tailpipe.”",0

"Sea level rise will disproportionately hit U.S. this century, NOAA warns","

    ","¶Global sea level rise is unfolding at a stunning pace, and a new report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) says the U.S. will find itself directly in the crosshairs. Over the coming decades, some parts of the nation’s coastline will be hit harder than others, the study finds.¶The report — co-authored with the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Geological Survey, the Environmental Protection Agency, the South Florida Water Management District, and scientists from Rutgers and Columbia University — outlined six likely scenarios for sea level rise, ranging in severity from low to extreme, so that communities and the federal government can plan around those likelihoods. ¶In almost all the scientists’ projections, sea level rise will disproportionately affect the coasts of the U.S. Northeast and the western Gulf of Mexico, compared to averages across the globe. Except for Alaska, the report says nearly all of the U.S. coastline is more vulnerable than the global average if more severe scenarios come to pass.¶More in Climate Change¶In the mildest projected scenario, global sea levels will rise by about one foot by the end of this century. In the worst-case scenario, global sea levels will rise by 8.2 feet. ¶Though eight feet may not sound like a huge number, the consequences would be devastating: researchers have estimated that a lower rise of six feet would be enough swallow up the homes of about six million Americans.¶The new report is an update to one issued in 2012, and paints a significantly darker picture of sea level rise. The worst-case scenario outlined in this report is 1.6 feet higher than the worst-case scenario scientists projected for this century just five years ago. ¶What’s behind the growing concern about sea level rise? A major factor, scientists say, is the rapid melting of Arctic ice due to global warming. The Earth saw its third straight year of record-high temperatures in 2016, while polar ice diminished to record lows. ¶In historical perspective, Arctic warming over the past five years is “as fast and as large a magnitude” as the warming that occurred during the last vestiges of the Ice Age 11,500 years ago — the transition that gave birth to our modern climate era, Paul Mayewski, professor at the University of Maine’s Climate Change Institute, told CBS News last month.¶The latest report also points out that worldwide, sea level rise will impact different geographic areas in vastly different ways, shaped by factors like land elevation and ocean circulation.¶“The ocean is not rising like water would in a bathtub,” said William Sweet, Ph.D., a NOAA oceanographer and lead author of the report, explained in a statement. “For example, in some scenarios sea levels in the Pacific Northwest are expected to rise slower than the global average, but in the Northeast they are expected to rise faster.” ¶The authors say the report was conceived in response to states and cities’ requests for more information tailored to their specific locations, to help them prepare and make decisions about how to manage and adapt their critical infrastructure.

    ","¶Potential large-scale solutions to combat the influence that humans have on Earth’s rising temperatures may directly affect astronomers.¶During one of the United States’ largest astronomical conferences, on Jan. 4, scientists discussed what geoengineering the planet’s atmosphere could mean for astronomers whose job it is to observe the night sky. Geoengineering refers to directly altering the Earth or its atmosphere to try and lessen the impact of climate change. While climate change is seemingly unrelated to night-sky observation, the panelists argued that it was an issue that astronomers needed to be concerned with.¶“It’s an astronomical problem if we define astronomy to include planetary science and evolution,” said David Grinspoon, an astrobiologist at the Planetary Science Institute. He was joined by Jane Long, a retired scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory; Tom Ackerman, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Washington; and Mel Ulmer, an astronomer at Northwestern University. James Lowenthal, an astronomer at Smith College, served as moderator.¶  [Changing Earth: 7 Ideas to Geoengineer Our Planet]¶More in Climate Change¶“We [humans] need to learn how to become a long-term stabilizing factor on this planet,” Grinspoon said.¶To mitigate the most serious consequences of global warming, climate scientists have warned that the rise in Earth’s temperature needs to be capped at no more than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius). Long-term strategies require reducing the burning of fossil fuels, which puts carbon dioxide into the air. But the panelists said that won’t be sufficient to reach the low levels necessary to meet the goals established by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).¶“One of the dirty little secrets of the IPCC is that it requires negative emissions,” Long said, referring to the process of recapturing CO2 that has already been released. No existing models predict staying below the necessary levels, she said, which means that it’s not enough to simply stop emitting carbon dioxide; further steps will need to be taken to remove what’s already in the air.¶Geoengineering Earth’s atmosphere includes several different proposals for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Various proposed methods can lock solid or liquid carbon into the ground, in trees or in water.¶“I like fizzy water, and I’m looking forward to seeing lots of CO2 in ground water,” Ulmer joked.¶Geoengineering also includes methods for reducing the amount of sunlight. The panelists discussed releasing aerosol particles or spraying seawater into the atmosphere to form clouds, and launching mirrors into orbit to redirect sunlight. The planet’s temperature depends on how much sunlight it receives, so changing that amount can keep the planet cooler.¶Changing the amount of sunlight is more readily deployable than removing carbon dioxide, Ackerman said. Synthetic volcanic clouds or clouds that hang over the ocean would reflect sunlight back into space, lowering the temperature.¶Geoengineering the atmosphere isn’t something to be rushed into, however. According to Ackerman, there is no active research program in the United States or Europe that is studying the consequences of geoengineering.¶“Nobody wants to do this,” Ackerman said. “No one wants to fund it.”¶With no funding for trying to understand how any of the proposed methods could affect the atmosphere, those ideas are immediately dismissed from the realm of possibility. That needs to change if scientists plan to actively take steps to reduce carbon dioxide, the panelists said.¶“We can’t go out and start this tomorrow, at least not in any responsible way,” Ackerman said. He said that he firmly supports the need to do more research before deploying any systems to change the environment. That includes studying what kinds of unintended consequences could come from geoengineering.¶The panel members seemed certain that manipulating the climate on large scales could lead to problems on smaller scales: Changing the entire planet’s climate could result in catastrophes at regional levels.¶“We can have a solution that works globally and gets the average temperature down to a safer range,” Grinspoon said. It’s possible, however, that such a solution could kick off a monsoon and cause a disaster for a lot of people, he said.¶The panel members agreed that geoengineering was only a short-term solution to help scale down the planet’s temperature before it reaches catastrophic levels — it’s not a long-term, permanent solution.¶“Solar-radiation management is not a substitute for mitigation,” Long said.¶Adding particles into the air could have a number of important ramifications, including affecting how well astronomers can view the night sky. According to Lowenthal, some studies have shown that adding clouds to the atmosphere can increase the brightening of the night sky by as much as 25 percent. But that doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be done.¶“Fixing global warming is more important than astronomy,” Grinspoon said. He expressed the hope that such a solution might inspire more astronomers to invest time in promoting climate change. Even without that impetus, he felt that the need to address the long-term consequences of global warming outweighed the potential benefits of studying the heavens.¶“There’s no question to my mind that saving our civilization and many other species is more important than our ability to do ground-based astronomy for a few decades,” Grinspoon said.¶Follow Nola Taylor Redd on Twitter @NolaTRedd or Google+.

Hawaii considers 100 percent renewable energy goal for transportation,"
","

      / AP
    ","¶HONOLULU -- Hawaii has the most aggressive renewable energy targets in the nation, aiming for its utilities to get 100 percent of their electricity from renewable sources by 2045.¶Now advocates want to extend that goal to the transportation sector to urge all forms of ground transportation to fuel up using renewable sources by 2045.¶“The majority of our fossil fuel goes into transportation, and that’s a challenge that we have to solve, and we currently don’t have a vision for what that future looks like,” said Jeff Mikulina, executive director of the Blue Planet Foundation, which is pushing the bill.¶More in Climate Change¶But Hawaii officials aren’t planning to make everyone get rid of their fuel-powered cars - at least not yet.¶“Nobody wants to step in and force people to get rid of cars that they might love now,” said state Rep. Chris Lee, chairman of the Energy and Environment committee.¶The goal represents a steep climb for the auto industry in a state where there are about 5,000 electric vehicles, out of an estimated one million cars on the road.¶“Our ability to achieve it is really going to be dependent on what happens throughout the entire automotive industry,” said Hugh Baker, managing director of HD Baker & Co., an energy consulting company. “We can say we want 100 percent clean transportation technology, but the market in Hawaii is not nearly big enough by itself to move the whole global automotive industry. It will really take more than just Hawaii.”¶Unlike Hawaii’s groundbreaking 100 percent renewable goal for electricity, where utilities in the state will be fined if they don’t comply by deadline, the proposed transportation goal isn’t a mandate.¶With one million cars on the roads, hundreds of auto dealerships and multiple counties with fleets of vehicles, it’s unclear how the state could enforce a renewable fuels mandate, advocates said. Beyond the vehicle stakeholders, there are cyclists and pedestrians in the mix, making it challenging for the state to even measure what percentage of the state’s transportation fuel comes from renewables.¶The bill is being introduced in the Hawaii Legislature, which began Wednesday. If passed, Hawaii would be the first in the nation to set such a high goal for its transportation sector. Vermont also has an aggressive goal for renewable fuel in transportation, but most states don’t have such targets in place.¶“That’s a huge, huge transformation,” said Hawaii Gov. David Ige in a recent interview with The Associated Press. “We are the most isolated community on the planet, and we import virtually all of the oil we use today.”¶Details of the bill are still being worked out, but it’s undecided whether it will come with funding, Lee said.¶The state recently created a new position in the Department of Transportation to work on renewable fuels in transportation, and it is planning to build infrastructure to increase electric vehicle charging stations at work locations in Honolulu’s urban core using state funds, he said.¶Lawmakers also are introducing a bill to boost the required number of electric vehicle charging stations, which is currently one station per 100 spaces, so that commuters can charge electric vehicles during the day when more energy from the sun is pumping into the grid.¶Encouraging more electric vehicles - or “batteries on wheels” - could help Hawaii meet its renewable electricity goals.¶“It’s easier to manage more renewable energy when we have electric vehicles on the grid that can suck up that excess and hopefully in the future put some energy back on the grid,” Mikulina said.¶Auto dealers in Hawaii support the transition to renewable energy, but they believe it will take a massive advertising campaign by the state to encourage people to buy vehicles powered by alternative fuels, said David Rolf, executive director of the Hawaii Automobile Dealers Association.¶“I’m passionate about this goal, but I’m also realistic,” Rolf said.¶Hawaii’s residents ranked second in the nation in 2015 with 2.94 electric vehicles for every 1,000 residents, just behind California, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.¶Tackling the fossil fuels used in air travel - which is critical to Hawaii’s tourism-driven economy - will have to wait.¶About a quarter of the 36 million barrels of oil Hawaii imported in 2015 was used for commercial aviation. But the long flights require energy in a dense form, and with today’s technology that’s generally only available in fuels, energy experts said.¶“They need to go so far between recharge opportunities that they really need something with a higher energy density than batteries, and it’s just not even physically possible for an airplane to carry enough batteries to go where it needs to go,” said Matthias Fripp, an assistant professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.",0

    ","¶WASHINGTON -- Global warming is going to steal away some of those postcard-perfect weather days in the future, according to a first-of-its-kind projection of nice weather.¶On average, Earth will have 10 fewer days of mild and mostly dry weather by the end of the century, the researchers estimate. Some places will get more days perfect for picnics or outdoor weddings, while other places will lose a lot. Rio de Janeiro, Miami and much of Africa are big losers, while Europe and Seattle will gain nicer weather.¶“It’s the type of weather where you can go outside and do something fun,” said study lead author Karin van der Wiel, a meteorology researcher at Princeton University and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . “It’s not too cold. It’s not too hot. It’s not too humid.”¶More in Climate Change¶For the past three decades, the world has averaged 74 mild days a year. But by 2035 that will shrink to 70 and then 64 by the last two decades of the century, according to the study, published Wednesday in the journal Climatic Change . Mild weather was defined as between 68 and 86 degrees (18 and 30 degrees Celsius) with low humidity and no more than a trace of rain.¶Any change depends on where you live and the time of year. For example, on average, the U.S. will lose nine mild summer days by the end of the century, although most is gained back with more mild days in the winter, spring and fall. The report estimates that Washington, Chicago, New York and Dallas will lose two weeks of pleasant summer weather but some is gained back. On average, Washington loses 13 mild days; Atlanta, 12; Chicago, 9; Denver and New York, 6; and Dallas, 1.¶The biggest losers will be the tropics and nearly all of Africa, eastern South America, South Asia and northern Australia. Rio de Janeiro, on average, will see 40 mild days disappear. Miami will lose its only mild summer day and nearly a month of spring and fall mild days by 2100.¶“The changes are more dramatic in parts of the developing world, where you have high concentrations of populations,” said NOAA climate scientist and co-author Sarah Kapnick.¶Other places, especially northern developed ones, will gain some of what the tropics lost. England and northern Europe are big winners. Seattle should pick up nine mild days and Los Angeles, which already has a lot of nice weather, gets six extra by the end of the century.¶The scientists didn’t specifically focus on whether the loss of mild days has already started globally, but they did see it happening in much of Africa and South America, Van der Wiel said.¶Climate scientists usually focus on extreme weather -- record heat, tropical cyclones, droughts, floods — and how they could get worse as the world warms. Kapnick said she wanted to look at nice weather because her friends kept asking her what day to choose for good wedding weather.¶The team used a middle ground scenario for global warming -- not worst-case runawaycarbon pollution and not dramatic cuts in emissions of heat-trapping gases -- and ran different computer simulations to see what would happen.¶It’s not just fewer nice days to enjoy. Fewer mild days will also harm agricultural production and allow disease carrying insects to thrive more in more places, said University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd.¶Stanford University climate scientist Chris Field, who led an international study of extreme weather, questioned the purpose of the study: “Extreme conditions are the sharp end of the climate stick. It is in the extremes when things break and damage occurs.”¶National Center for Atmospheric Research scientist Gerald Meehl, who also studies extreme weather, said a decrease in mild weather may not quite have the economic and health costs but there are other factors such as tourism “or simple human enjoyment.”",0

    ","¶WASHINGTON — Government scientists say the Earth sizzled to a third straight heat record last year. Globally, the average temperature over land and ocean surfaces for 2016 was the highest since record keeping began in 1880.¶They mostly blame man-made global warming with help from a natural El Nino, which has since disappeared.¶The figures announced Wednesday come from NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which measure global temperatures in slightly different ways. They said last year passed 2015 as the hottest year on record.¶NOAA calculated that the average global temperature last year was 58.69 degrees (14.84 degrees Celsius) - beating the previous year by .07 degrees (.04 Celsius).¶More in Climate Change¶Temperatures were particularly high in the first half of the year due to the power of El Niño.¶Sixteen of the 17 hottest years ever on record have officially occurred in the 21st century, according to the WMO. The only outlier was 1998.¶NASA’s figures include more of the Arctic, which was warmer than usual. The agency said last year was .22 degrees (.12 degrees Celsius) warmer than 2015. ¶Looking forward, continued melting of polar ice in the Arctic could lead to catastrophic sea level rise and flooding around the world. Some 13 million Americans could become “climate refugees” by the end of this century if the worst projections come to pass, research in 2016 warned.¶NASA’s Gavin Schmidt said most of the record heat was from man-made climate change.",0
"U.S. plan on endangered polar bears lacks teeth, critics say","

    ","¶ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service released its plan Monday for the recovery of threatened polar bears, acknowledging it will take no direct action for addressing the primary threat -- greenhouse gases that contribute to the decline of sea ice habitat.¶Polar bears, the first species to be declared threatened or endangered because of climate change, rely on sea ice for hunting seals and raising their young. Climate models project that rising temperatures will continue to diminish sea ice throughout the century.¶The plan calls for reduced greenhouse-gas emissions but focuses agency actions only on other conservation strategies, such as preventing contamination from spills, protecting dens or reducing conflicts with people.¶More in Climate Change¶Shaye Wolf, climate science director for the Center for Biological Diversity, which filed the petition to list polar bears in 2005, called the recovery plan toothless.¶She said it acknowledges that polar bears will not survive without cuts in large-scale greenhouse-gas pollution and shows the need to keep global temperature rise well below 2 degrees Celsius. But the agency’s job was to call out the steps needed for polar bears to survive, Wolf said.¶“It acknowledges the problem but fails to put the solution in the core strategy for the bear,” she said.¶The agency said in its plan that addressing increased greenhouse gases that result in Arctic warming will require global action. Until that happens, the focus of recovery will be on efforts by U.S. wildlife management that contribute to polar bear survival in the interim “so that they are in a position to recover once Arctic warming has been abated,” the plan said.¶Dirk Kempthorne, who was secretary of the U.S. Interior Department under President George W. Bush, announced in 2008 that polar bears would be listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. But he said that law would not be used to set climate policy or limit greenhouse-gas emissions.",0
Quirk may shield U.S. coast during busy hurricane season,"
","

      / AP
    ","¶WASHINGTON -- A climatic quirk seems to be slightly shielding the U.S. coast during busy hurricane seasons, often weakening major storms just as they approach America’s beaches, a new study finds.¶That could help explain why it’s been more than 11 years since a major hurricane with winds of more than 110 mph has hit the United States mainland.¶Last year’s Hurricane Matthew was a perfect example of this uniquely American “protective barrier” of stronger crosswinds and cooler coastal waters, according to the study’s author, climate scientist Jim Kossin of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.¶More in Climate Change¶Matthew devastated Haiti as a monster storm hitting land with 145 mph winds, threatened Florida as a major hurricane and then fizzled as it finally came ashore in South Carolina, barely registering as a hurricane with 75 mph winds.¶Kossin’s study published Wednesday in the journal Nature found that shifts in air and ocean conditions over decades work together to weaken major storms along the U.S. coast. This protective barrier begins around the U.S.-Mexico border in Brownsville, Texas, and gets more noticeable around the Atlantic coast, Kossin said.¶“It’s a lucky byproduct for the United States coast,” Kossin said. “It’s really unfortunate that we’re the only ones that seem to be benefiting from this situation.”¶The Atlantic Ocean seems to alternate between cycles of heavy and low hurricane activity. The current heavy cycle began in 1993, after a low period of more than two decades. During those quieter times, when a major hurricane forms in the Atlantic it is three to six times more likely to rapidly intensify near the U.S. coast than during the busier times, according to the study.¶Kossin mapped sea surface temperatures and wind shear levels in the Atlantic to see small changes near the U.S. coast - but only during a busy cycle. His study found a localized increase in high altitude crosswinds — called wind shear — that tear at a storm’s structure. It also found slightly cooler sea surface temperatures, which reduce a hurricane’s fuel of hot water. The changes seem to be just a function of larger natural conditions, he said.¶Take October’s Hurricane Matthew: “As it approached Florida, it started to encounter wind shear, which weakened it to a minimal hurricane,” Kossin said.¶Previously, he also found that during busy cycles, bigger storms tend to form slightly more to the east — toward Africa — giving them more opportunity to curve harmlessly north in the Atlantic instead of hitting the U.S. coastline. All those factors seem to be helping reduce the U.S. threat compared to other places in the Atlantic, he said.¶Even with that “protective barrier” as Kossin calls in in the paper, there is still a greater chance of major hurricanes nearing the U.S. during busy times than quiet times, Kossin said. That’s because there are more storms brewing overall.¶Three outside scientists contacted by The Associated Press praised the study as interesting, though not complete, while two others cautioned against reading too much into it. Georgia Tech’s Judith Curry called it solid research while Penn State’s David Titley said he worried about small sample size and natural variations.¶Kossin and other scientists also said the 11-year major hurricane landfall drought since 2005’s Wilma is a bit of a statistical quirk because of strict meteorological definitions and national borders. Superstorm Sandy in 2012 wasn’t considered a major hurricane because its winds weren’t strong enough.",0
Global warming data that riled doubters turns out to be true,"

    ","¶WASHINGTON — A new independent study shows no pause in global warming, confirming a set of temperature readings adjusted by U.S. government scientists that some who reject mainstream climate science have questioned.¶The adjustments, made by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in 2015 to take into account changes in how ocean temperatures have been measured over the decades, riled a House committee and others who claimed the changes were made to show rising temperatures. The House Science Committee subpoenaed the agency’s scientists and then complained that NOAA wasn’t answering its requests quickly enough.¶The new international study looked at satellite data, readings from buoys and other marine floats for ocean temperatures. Each measurement system independently showed the same 20 years of increase in temperatures that NOAA found: about two-tenths of a degree Fahrenheit per decade since 2000, said the study’s lead author, Zeke Hausfather of the University of California, Berkeley.¶More in Climate Change¶“Our research confirms that NOAA scientists were right,” Hausfather said. “They were not in any way cooking the books.”¶NOAA adjusted past data to take into account old measurements by ships that often recorded temperatures from their engine rooms, where heat from the engines skewed the data. Buoys and satellite data don’t have such artificial warming, Hausfather said.¶In 1990, about 90 percent of the ocean temperature readings were done by ships, now it is about 85 percent by the more accurate buoys, Hausfather said.¶Scientists Andrew Dessler of Texas A&M University and Kevin Trenberth of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, who weren’t part the original study or the more recent one that confirmed its conclusions, called both accurate.¶“This paper further allays any qualms that there may have been scientific errors or any non-scientific agendas,” Trenberth said in an email.¶Officials at the House Science Committee did not respond to repeated requests for comment.¶Hausfather’s study was published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances.",0
How climate change transformed the Earth in 2016,"

    ","¶2016 was a milestone year in the continued warming of the planet. From unstable agriculture to the drought in California to melting ice sheets to extreme weather events and heat waves, climate change has disrupted virtually every corner of the world.¶It’s impossible to exhaustively list all the ways in which climate change was felt in 2016, but here’s a guide to understanding the year that was for the planet:¶“In the centuries to come, history books will likely look back on September 2016 as a major milestone for the world’s climate,” Brian Kahn of Climate Central wrote earlier this year.¶More in Climate Change¶That’s because, during September, a month in which atmospheric carbon dioxide — a heat-trapping greenhouse gas —is usually at its lowest, the monthly value failed to drop below 400 parts per million. The 400 ppm mark has sad significance in the climate community, as it has long been considered a point of no return for the atmosphere by scientists. ¶This year is poised to be the hottest year in the 137-year official record, with global temperatures climbing even higher than record-breaking 2015, according to data released in November from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Temperatures were particularly high in the first half of the year due to the power of El Niño.¶Though final data from December is not yet in, January to November 2016 was the warmest such period worldwide on record, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. ¶If 2016 ends up with the title of hottest year on record, as expected, that would mean that 16 of the 17 hottest years on record have occurred in this century. The only outlier was 1998, according to the WMO.¶Still need perspective? Research released this year shows that, if we take a much longer view of Earth’s temperature history and consider temperature averages in 5,000 year increments, the Earth is now warmer than it has been in 120,000 years.¶Global warming has had a particularly dramatic impact on the Arctic, which has been transformed by significantly warmer temperatures, lower levels of sea ice, and more open water in recent years.¶Last month, the average Arctic sea ice extent — the measurement scientists use to represent the area of ocean where there is at least some sea ice — was 17.7 percent below the averages from 1981 to 2010, according to NOAA. That’s the lowest November extent since the NOAA began keeping records in 1979.¶“For the people in the Arctic, no one has to tell them an abrupt climate change has hit,” Paul Mayewski, professor at the University of Maine’s Climate Change Institute, told CBS News in an interview last week.¶Continued melting of polar ice could lead to catastrophic sea level rise and flooding on coastlines around the world. Some 13 million Americans could become “climate refugees” by the end of this century if the worst projections come to pass, one study this year warned.¶Scientists say human activities are directly linked to Arctic warming: driving a gas-powered car about 90 miles – the distance between New York and Philadelphia – produces enough carbon pollution to melt about a square foot of Arctic sea ice during the critical month of September, research shows.¶The continued warming of the planet in 2016 is having a destabilizing impact on agriculture worldwide. ¶Those disruptions were particularly felt in coffee production, which supports an estimated 120 million of some of the world’s poorest people in Africa, Central and South America, and Southeast Asia.¶In the mountains of eastern Uganda, a coffee-rich region, growers struggled to protect their crops — which require just the right altitude and temperature and the right amounts of rain and sunshine — from the effects of global warming. Faced with headaches such as new pests and diseases, and beans rendered inedible from too much sunshine, many small-scale family farmers can no longer rely on coffee production to feed their families, pay for medical care, and send their kids to school. ¶Experts project that by the middle of this century, climate change could rule out as much as half of the land now used for coffee production worldwide, CBS News’ Mark Phillips reported in December.¶Warming oceans in 2016 caused the largest die-off of corals ever recorded on Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, scientists said in November. The reef’s coral cover suffered significant bleaching this year due to the El Nino weather effect and continued climate change.¶Coral bleaching occurs when unusual environmental conditions, like increased sea temperatures, result in corals expelling the small algae which normally provide oxygen and nutrients. The loss turns the corals white. Reefs can recover if temperatures drop and the algae resettle, but if not, the corals will die.¶This year’s coral die-off was “substantially worse” than the previous worst-ever event in 1998, Australian scientists reported. Experts estimate the Great Barrier Reef has lost 50 percent of its coral cover in the past three decades.¶A resilient body, the Great Barrier Reef could regain the corals it’s lost, Australian officials said. But even under good conditions, that could take 10 to 15 years, scientists said, and the acceleration of climate change threatens to derail the natural rhythm of loss and recovery.",0

    ","¶Temperatures around the North Pole will almost certainly pass the melting point, 32 degrees Fahrenheit, in the days leading up to Christmas, as global warming wreaks havoc on some of the world’s coldest and iciest areas, scientists say.¶“High up into the Arctic and close to the North Pole, the temperatures are very, very possibly above freezing,” Paul Mayewski, professor at the University of Maine’s Climate Change Institute, told CBS News Wednesday. He called the current temperatures in the Arctic “remarkable.”¶The Arctic has seen a dramatic transformation in recent years, with significantly warmer temperatures, lower levels of sea ice, and more open water. In November, the average Arctic sea ice extent — the measurement scientists use to represent the area of ocean where there is at least some sea ice — was 17.7 percent below the averages from 1981 to 2010, according to NOAA. That’s the lowest November extent since the NOAA began keeping records in 1979. ¶More in Climate Change¶At the moment, temperatures at the North Pole are about 50 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal. Meteorologist Jeff Berardelli of CBS affiliate WPEC explains that “essentially a conveyor belt of very warm, most air” is currently pushing north into the Arctic. ¶The ongoing warming trend is hardly news to people in the region, where Mayewski does field research collecting and analyzing snow samples and ice cores.¶“For the people in the Arctic, no one has to tell them an abrupt climate change has hit,” Mayewski said. ¶But, he noted, the same cannot be said for people living farther down in the Northern Hemisphere who are unknowingly experiencing the ripple effects of Arctic warming. ¶“They assume the Arctic is far away, and they assume, ‘What impact could this have on us?’” Mayewski said. ¶But Arctic warming is directly tied to extreme weather in the Northern Hemisphere, he explained. With the barrier between the cold north and warm south weakening, cold air masses are more easily moving south and warm air masses are more easily moving north, fueling the changes in surface ocean currents that can exacerbate extreme weather events. In addition, as sea ice transforms into open water, that open water absorbs more heat, a cycle of warming that increasing moisture levels and raises the odds of events like floods and droughts throughout the hemisphere. ¶Mayewski cited a long list of recent extreme weather events in the Northern Hemisphere: the drought in the western United States, the historically cold East Coast winter of 2014, the initially mild winter of 2015-16 that suddenly gave way to record cold temperatures.¶“All of this points to instability,” he said. ¶In historical perspective, Arctic warming over the past five years is “as fast and as large a magnitude” as the warming that occurred during the last vestiges of the Ice Age 11,500 years ago — the transition that gave birth to our modern climate age, Mayewski said.¶The Arctic’s climate system has followed largely linear patterns until now.¶“While none of the global climate models predicted we’d have an Arctic warming so fast, it no less happened. The models are based on input from the last few decades. We’re experiencing something which is a surprise, a quick change in the climate system,” he said, citing the rapid release of greenhouse gases and the hole in the ozone as accelerating factors. ¶As the Arctic continues to warm, it will release dangerous amounts of the greenhouse gas methane, which absorbs the sun’s heat and further warms the atmosphere. In the first two decades after its release, methane is 84 times more potent than carbon dioxide, according to the Environmental Defense Fund.¶Now, with warming well underway in the Arctic, climate scientists stress that the only way to change course is to dramatically mitigate the rise of greenhouse gases worldwide.¶“The more we can mitigate now, the better we are,” Mayewski said, calling the Paris Agreement on climate change a “fantastic start and a very important cornerstone.” ¶President-elect Trump campaigned on the promise to withdraw from the international climate accord.¶Earlier this month, Donald Trump said he is “open-minded” about climate change — but added that “nobody really knows” the truth about it, contradicting the near-universal scientific agreement on the issue.¶This year from January to November was the warmest such period for the Earth on record, according to NOAA. That follows another record-breaking warm year in 2015.",0
"Climate change fingerprints seen on 24 weird weather cases, study says","

      / AP
    ","¶WASHINGTON, D.C. -- A new scientific report finds man-made climate change played some role in two dozen extreme weather events last year but not in a few other weird weather instances around the world. ¶An annual report released Thursday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration found climate change was a factor, however small or large, in 24 of 30 strange weather events. They include 11 cases of high heat, as well as unusual winter sunshine in the United Kingdom, Alaskan wildfires and odd “sunny day” flooding in Miami. ¶The study documented climate change-goosed weather in Alaska, Washington state, the southeastern United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, China, Japan, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, the western north Pacific cyclone region, India, Pakistan, Egypt, Ethiopia and southern Africa. ¶“It has to be measureable. It has to be detectable. There has to be evidence for it and that’s what these papers do,” said NOAA scientist Stephanie Herring, co-editor of the report. ¶More in Climate Change¶In six cases -- including cold snaps in the United States and downpours in Nigeria and India -- the scientists could not detect climate change’s effects. Other scientists, though, disputed that finding for the cold snap that hit the Northeast. ¶Herring highlighted the Miami flooding in September 2015. Because of rising sea levels and sinking land, extremely high tides flooded the streets with 22 inches of water. ¶“This one is just very remarkable because truly, not a cloud in the sky, and these types of tidal nuisance flooding events are clearly become more frequent,” she said. ¶The report also found an increase in tropical cyclone activity and strength in the western Pacific can be blamed partly on climate change and partly on El Nino, the now-gone natural weather phenomenon. But similar storm strengthening hasn’t increased noticeably around the United States yet, said study co-editor Martin Hoerling, a NOAA scientist. ¶The report was published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society. Using accepted scientific techniques, 116 scientists from around the world calculated whether the odds of the extreme weather events were increased by global warming. They based their calculations on observed data, understanding of the physics of the climate and computer simulations - techniques that the National Academy of Sciences said were valid earlier this year. ¶Columbia University meteorology professor Adam Sobel, who was on the national academy panel but not part of this report, praised the NOAA study but noted it wasn’t comprehensive. It picked only certain but not all weather extremes to study. ¶For the February 2015 Northeast cold snap, other scientists have connected the polar vortex pushing south to shrinking ice in the Arctic Ocean. ¶Judah Cohen, seasonal forecasting chief at Atmospheric Environmental Research in Lexington, Massachusetts, said he even predicted the 2015 polar vortex because of the low sea ice. He said the same thing is happening with the bitter cold hitting the U.S. this week. ¶NOAA’s Hoerling said the research found a connection between the shrinking ice and the polar vortex but didn’t see one causing the other.

    ","¶The environmental protection movement is bracing for what could be one of its biggest challenges in decades: the nomination of a climate change skeptic and longtime opponent of Environmental Protection Agency regulations to assume leadership of that same agency. ¶Scott Pruitt, attorney general of the oil and gas-friendly state of Oklahoma, was confirmed as President-elect Trump’s pick to head the EPA on Wednesday. ¶“Quite clearly, this is a 180-degree shift from where the administration has been on most things environment-related,” David Konisky, associate professor at Indiana University’s School of Public and Environmental Affairs, told CBS News. ¶Hamstrung from enacting climate change legislation through Congress, the Obama administration has in recent years relied heavily on the EPA to implement its environmental agenda across the country through enacting regulations and regulatory oversight. Under Pruitt, the agency is poised for major transformation. ¶More in Climate Change¶Here’s what you need to know about Trump’s Cabinet pick:¶In an op-ed published earlier this year in The National Review, Scott Pruit argued that global warming is “far from settled,” despite the overwhelming consensus among scientists that human activities are behind the accelerated warming of the planet, with consequences ranging from vanishing polar ice to extreme weather patterns worldwide to the loss of coral on the Great Barrier Reef and food supplies for already endangered species. ¶“Scientists continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and its connection to the actions of mankind. That debate should be encouraged — in classrooms, public forums, and the halls of Congress,” Pruitt wrote. He went on: “Dissent is not a crime.”¶Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, said Wednesday that Pruitt’s views “couldn’t make him more out of touch with the American people — or reality.”¶Pruitt’s future boss is also a climate change skeptic. The president-elect has previously said that he believed climate change was a “hoax created by and for the Chinese,” though he recently indicated that he was open to rethinking his position. ¶During his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump pledged to “cancel” U.S. involvement in the Paris climate agreement, a landmark global accord that aims to reduce carbon emissions and halt the effects of climate change.¶In a statement released by Trump’s transition team, Pruitt said Americans “are tired of seeing billions of dollars drained from our economy due to unnecessary EPA regulations, and I intend to run this agency in a way that fosters both responsible protection of the environment and freedom for American businesses.”¶In Oklahoma, Pruitt established a dedicated “federalism unit” within the Office of the Solicitor General to fight against federal government regulation. ¶He has led court challenges to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and the constitutionality of the Dodd-Frank campaign finance law. Pruitt’s supporters view him as a champion of fighting overzealous, wasteful government regulation.¶Importantly, Pruitt has used his perch as attorney general to sue the EPA multiple times to block what he considers excessive regulation of natural resources. ¶Under Pruitt, who’s called himself a “leading advocate against the EPA’s activist agenda,” federal regulation of the environment could be gutted. ¶The EPA is designed as a collaborative body, with the work of environmental protection shared between the federal agency and state governments. In essence, the federal government sets standards, in line with the president’s environmental agenda, and individual states then implement those standards with oversight from regional offices of the EPA. ¶Across the country, this model creates huge variability in environmental standards. Some states and some regional offices are aggressive and meticulous in their approaches to environmental protection; others, far less so. The water crisis in Flint, Michigan was caused, in part, by shoddy oversight from the EPA’s regional office tasked with overseeing Flint, according to a state-commissioned report released earlier this year.¶Under Pruitt, the EPA will likely devolve more responsibilities to state governments and weaken the EPA’s regional oversight further, adding to the variability that already exists in environmental protection across the country. ¶“If your goal is making sure everyone has a baseline of environmental protection, that becomes threatened,” Konisky said of Pruitt’s stance on decentralized regulation. ¶Like most federal agencies, the EPA is staffed by career public servants who enjoy, to some degree, civil service protections that make layoffs challenging and guarantee some level of consistency from administration to administration. ¶These staffers represent Pruitt’s first hurdle. ¶“[They] won’t roll over to an administrator who doesn’t share those principles,” Konisky said. “They don’t yield completely to an agenda that they find problematic.”¶What does history teach us? In terms of values and priorities, Pruitt appears closely aligned with 1981-1983 EPA Administrator Anne Gorsuch Burford, who served under President Reagan. A firm believer that the EPA was too big, wasteful and unfriendly to private enterprise, Burford found herself at odds with EPA staff for weakening the agency’s authority and slashing its budget, as well as for several mismanagement scandals. Eventually — having made enemies in her own agency and with both Republicans and Democrats in Congress — Burford was forced to resigned. ¶If Pruitt faces internal opposition, he can easily shift career staff around — essentially, removing individuals with different policy views to less influential positions.  ¶As administrator, Pruitt will also have significant authority to hire like-minded individuals to lead the EPA’s program offices, which oversee areas like chemical safety, pollution prevention, and water safety, and carry out his deregulation agenda. ¶Environmental groups now enter a new chapter in which they need to play both defense and offense to keep their cause alive, without allies in the executive branch, Konisky said. ¶Defense will come in the form of efforts to block specific legislation in Congress and to defend existing environmental protections in the courts.¶Offense will likely move to another front: winnable battles in green-friendly cities and states, like California.¶“You’ll see these groups look to other venues at the state and local level where they can be successful in pushing policy,” Konisky said. “Environmental groups will try to work through the states to achieve new protections where they can.”",0

            Climate change killing Uganda coffee crop and hitting world's poorest hard - CBS News
    ",CBS News,"December 8, 2016, 6:43 AM","¶The nomination of a climate change skeptic to run the Environmental Protection Agency may have renewed old arguments in Washington, but CBS News correspondent Mark Phillips says in Uganda, there’s no argument. ¶The facts there are clear, and they affect people in the African country directly. As Phillips discovered, the facts also affect anybody, anywhere who starts their day with a favored hot, brown beverage.¶To millions of people, coffee is the other dark liquid that powers the world. But because of the damage being done to the planet by the primary dark liquid, oil, along with other fossil fuels, coffee is in trouble. ¶So, too, are the farmers who grow it.¶High in the mountains of eastern Uganda, coffee is the most important crop grown, but it hasn’t been a good year for harvest.¶Anthony and Vincent Khabala’s family have been growing coffee on their farm about 4,000 feet up the slopes of Mount Elgon for generations. Lately, they’ve been having problems their family has never encountered before.¶It turns out coffee is as fussy as the people who drink it. This Goldilocks of crops likes just the right altitude, the right temperature and the right amount of rain and sunshine -- and all in the right order.¶“Too much sunshine produces bad fruits,” Anthony tells CBS News, and this year, there’s been too much sunshine on Mount Elgon.¶On another farm, Phillips meets another farmer with another problem. ¶A fine white powder coats parts of Sam Massa’s coffee plants. It’s produced by the stem-borer beetle, which drills into the plants and, according to Massa, “completely ruins” them.¶Massa says the warming weather has brought new pests and diseases that used to live down in the valleys, up the hillsides.¶“Ten years back, it was not here,” he tells Phillips. But now, “most of the farms have been destroyed completely, totally by this stem borer.”¶Crop yields have been dropping and prices are up by as much as 30-percent in some areas since last year, according to published reports. ¶More than just the consumer’s morning pick-me-up is threatened here; the farmers are caffeine-dependent for another reason. ¶From picking the coffee plant berries to processing them to drying and sorting the beans and getting them to market, this is a family business, and every member of the family contributes.¶ Cash from the coffee sales provides the only income to pay for school for the kids, and for medical care. ¶Coffee production supports an estimated 120 million of some of the world’s poorest people.¶But there is an imbalance in the coffee world; the retail end is controlled by big brands, the big global distributers, but much of the production comes from small family-run, almost vegetable-patch sized farms like the ones Phillips toured in Uganda. ¶If production fails on Mount Elgon, the big boys can simply go elsewhere. The people who depend on those sales for their livelihood, however, can’t go anywhere.¶The latest estimates warn climate change may mean as much as half of the land now used for coffee production around the world will no longer be suitable for it by the middle of this century.¶For the people who consume coffee, it’s about a drink.¶ For the people who produce it, and depend on it, it’s about life.¶ The problem isn’t limited to Africa: The same things are happening in Central and South America, and in the new coffee boom areas of Southeast Asia.¶One more thing that may be the cruellest cut; the type of coffee plants being hit hardest by the changing conditions, the ones at greatest risk, are the best, most coveted of them all -- the Arabica beans.

Weather Channel to Breitbart: Stop using us to mislead public on climate change,"

    ","¶In an unusually direct message, the Weather Channel is taking Breitbart to task for using Weather Channel content to “mislead Americans” about climate change.  ¶“Though we would prefer to focus on our usual coverage of weather and climate science, in this case we felt it important to add our two cents,” the Weather Channel wrote in a post on its website Tuesday.¶It firmly denied a claim that overall global temperatures are declining, an idea promoted by Breitbart and spread widely on social media.¶More in Climate Change¶The company was specifically concerned after Breitbart — the right-wing opinion website that had been led by President-elect Donald Trump’s chief advisor Steve Bannon — used a Weather Channel video clip atop an article that claimed the last three years of weather patterns represent “the final death rattle of the global warming scare.” ¶Breitbart is the primary megaphone of the alt-right, an extreme right-wing movement promoting white nationalism that has gained new national stature with Bannon’s involvement in the Trump campaign and future administration.¶The Weather Channel explained that, while Breitbart had the legal right to use its video clip through a content sharing agreement, it did not want to stand idly by without addressing the article’s specific, erroneous claims. ¶The Weather Channel outlined multiple examples of Breitbart “cherry picking, or pulling a single item out of context to build a misleading case.”¶For instance, Breitbart’s article claimed that “global land temperatures have plummeted by one degree Celsius since the middle of this year — the biggest and steepest fall on record.”¶The Weather Channel pointed out that this characterization is based only on one satellite estimate of temperatures over land in the lower atmosphere. ¶“Temperatures over land give an incomplete picture of global-scale temperature,” the Weather Channel responded. “Most of the planet — about 70 percent — is covered by water, and the land surface warms and cools more quickly than the ocean. Land-plus-ocean data from the other two satellite groups, released after the Breitbart article, show that Earth’s lower atmosphere actually set a record high in November 2016.”¶Warming ocean temperatures, in particular, are a concern as scientists predict melting polar ice could lead to catastrophic sea level rise.¶The weather experts also disputed Breitbart’s claim that any recent warming was simply the result of El Niño. “NOAA data show ... El Niño clearly added to the strength of the record global warmth observed since late 2015. However, if the El Niño spike is removed, 2016 is still the warmest year on record and 2015 the second warmest.”¶This Breitbart article gained even more attention after it was shared on social media by the U.S. House Committee on Science, Space and Technology last week. The committee, led by Republican Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas, has 180,000 followers on Twitter and has opposed the Obama administration’s efforts to regulate the gas, oil and coal industries and reduce carbon emissions.¶New research suggests that the world is not only breaking heat records, but breaking heat records at a faster and faster pace due to man-made climate change. If greenhouse gas emissions continue at their current pace, there will be about 15 new heat records for every cold record 50 years from now, according to a study published last month in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.¶The Weather Channel ended its note with a direct plea to Breitbart: “The next time you write a climate change article and need fact checking help, please call. We’re here for you. I’m sure we both agree this topic is too important to get wrong.”",0
"Polar ice the size of India has melted into the sea, scientists say","

December 5, 2016 / 5:22 PM
      / CBS News
    ","¶As global temperatures continue to rise and break records, polar sea ice covering an area about the size of India has vanished, according to climate scientists. The trend of polar ice melt has been alarming researchers, with sea ice in the Arctic and Antarctica being measured at record lows for this time of year, Reuters reports. ¶“There are some really crazy things going on,” Mark Serreze, director of the U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) in Boulder, Colorado, told the news service. ¶Serreze said temperatures in regions of the Arctic, for instance, were 36 degrees Fahrenheit above average on some days last month. ¶More in Climate Change¶Beyond that, the NSIDC satellite measurements show that on Dec. 4, the extent of polar sea ice was 1.48 million square miles below the 1981-2010 average. That amounts to about the size of India, or for another point of reference, two Alaskas. ¶The latest measurements appear to reverse a trend of expanding Antarctic sea ice, which some skeptics cited to contradict evidence of climate change.¶A number of factors may be contributing, including warmer waters in the Pacific from this year’s El Nino weather event, the report said. ¶Scientists say man-made global warming also played a major role.¶This of course has been viewed as a major global crisis for world leaders. With last year’s Paris climate agreement, nearly 200 governments agreed to curb carbon emissions with the goal of keeping the world’s temperature increase to no more than 2 degrees Celsius above the global average temperature before the Industrial Revolution. ¶It remains unclear whether the U.S. commitment to that deal will be honored by President-elect Donald Trump, who has previously called climate change a “hoax” and stated he might want to pull out of the Paris agreement. Mr. Trump backtracked somewhat in November, telling the New York Times that he has an “open mind” when it comes to climate change.¶Mr. Trump and Ivanka Trump held meetings with Al Gore Monday at Trump Tower to discuss the issue of climate change. Gore characterized his talk with the president-elect as “very productive” and “a sincere search for areas of common ground.”¶Those meetings came as Antarctica’s sea ice measured 4.33 million square miles — its smallest for early December, effectively beating 1982’s record, NSIDC reports. Similarly, sea ice in the Arctic, though expanding for the winter, hit a record low of 3.96 million square miles this season, below 2006’s record.¶All of this is “an extraordinary departure from the norm,” Anders Levermann, a professor at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, told Reuters.¶Scientists worry that these developments could have a domino effect. As sea ice melts, glaciers could collapse more quickly into their surrounding waters, potentially increasing the rate of sea level rise rapidly.",0
Australia considers new price tag on pollution,"

    ","¶CANBERRA, Australia — Australia will consider making electrical power companies pay for greenhouse gas pollution they create, three years after the government scrapped the national carbon tax, a Cabinet minister said Monday.¶The conservative government rejected all polluter-pays options in 2014 when it repealed Australia’s 3-year-old carbon tax levied against the nation’s biggest industrial polluters.¶But Environment and Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg said that charging power generators fueled by coal and natural gas for their pollution was under consideration as the government looks for ways to achieve its carbon gas reduction targets.¶More in Climate Change¶He said while his government rejected the previous center-left Labor Party government’s policy of charging all major industrial polluters, the electricity industry produced a third of Australia’s greenhouse gases and could face its own charges.¶The new scheme could include international trade in carbon credits, he said.¶“How we do we meet our emissions reduction targets while at the same time keeping electricity affordable and the lights effectively on? That’s our target,” Frydenberg told Australian Broadcasting Corp.¶The government on Monday released details of its climate change policy review which will begin in February. Australia has pledged to reduce its carbon emissions by at least 26 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.¶The government replaced the carbon tax with a 2.55 billion Australian dollar ($1.9 billion) fund paid by taxpayers to give incentives to polluters to reduce their emissions. Only AU $400 million is left, Frydenberg said.¶Environmentalist John Connor, chief executive of the Australian Climate Institute, said the fund could not achieve Australia’s reduction target.¶Australia is among the world’s worst greenhouse gas polluters on a per capita basis because of its heavy reliance on abundant reserves of cheap coal for electricity generation.",0
"""Extreme"" downpours could become much more common","

    ","¶Extreme downpours — like those that flooded Louisiana, Houston and West Virginia earlier this year — will happen nearly three times as often in the United States by the end of the century, and six times more frequently in parts of the Mississippi Delta, according to a new study.¶Scientists have long pointed out that warmer air holds more moisture, so man-made climate change will increase the frequency of extreme downpours. That increase has already started, they say, but new work with much stronger computer simulations shows just how bad it will get, and where.¶The high-resolution computer simulation — about 25 times better than other computer models — projects at least a fivefold increase in downpours in the Gulf Coast, Atlantic Coast and Southwest, according to a study in Monday's journal Nature Climate Change.¶More in Climate Change¶Study lead author Andreas Prein, a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said the entire U.S. will average a 180 percent increase in these types of downpours by 2100. The Midwest and parts of the West Coast are expected to see the smallest increases.¶Previous projections haven't been as detailed because they could not take into consideration small scale weather events like thunderstorms. The new computer simulations can, Prein said. He looked at the type of thunderstorms that are in the top one half of 1 percent of rainmakers.¶""It's much more likely that you'll get hit by very strong thunderstorms, very strong downpours in the future climate,"" Prein said. ""What this means in the future is you might have a much higher potential for flash floods. This can have really big impacts.""¶Outside experts praised the study.¶""The paper elegantly shows why these heavy downpours increase in frequency when the air is moist but decrease when the air is dry,"" said Stanford University climate scientist Chris Field. ""With high warming through the century, this paper projects that most of the U.S. (gets) scary increases in the frequency of downpours.""",0
California's next global warming target: dairy cows,"
","
November 29, 2016 / 11:55 AM
      / AP
    ","¶GALT, Calif. — California is taking its fight against global warming to the farm. The nation’s leading agricultural state is now targeting greenhouse gases produced by dairy cows and other livestock.¶Despite strong opposition from farmers, Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation in September that for the first time regulates heat-trapping gases from livestock operations and landfills.¶Cattle and other farm animals are major sources of methane, a greenhouse gas many times more potent than carbon dioxide as a heat-trapping gas. Methane is released when they belch, pass gas and make manure.¶More in Climate Change¶“If we can reduce emissions of methane, we can really help to slow global warming,” said Ryan McCarthy, a science advisor for the California Air Resources Board, which is drawing up rules to implement the new law.¶Livestock are responsible for 14.5 percent of human-induced greenhouse gas emissions, with beef and dairy production accounting for the bulk of it, according to a 2013 United Nations report.¶Since the passage of its landmark global warming law in 2006, California has been reducing carbon emissions from cars, trucks, homes and factories, while boosting production of renewable energy.¶In the nation’s largest milk-producing state, the new law requires dairies and other livestock operations to reduce methane emissions 40 percent below 2013 levels by 2030. State officials are developing the regulations, which take effect in 2024.¶“We expect that this package ... and everything we’re doing on climate, does show an effective model forward for others,” McCarthy said.¶But dairy farmers say the new regulations will drive up costs when they’re already struggling with five years of drought, low milk prices and rising labor costs. They’re also concerned about a newly signed law that will boost overtime pay for farmworkers.¶“It just makes it more challenging. We’re continuing to lose dairies. Dairies are moving out of state to places where these costs don’t exist,” said Paul Sousa, director of environmental services for Western United Dairymen.¶The dairy industry could be forced to move production to states and countries with fewer regulations, leading to higher emissions globally, Sousa said.¶“We think it’s very foolish for the state of California to be taking this position,” said Rob Vandenheuvel, general manager for the Milk Producers Council. “A single state like California is not going to make a meaningful impact on the climate.”¶Regulators are looking for ways to reduce so-called enteric emissions — methane from the bodily functions of cows. That could eventually require changes to what cattle eat.¶But the biggest target is dairy manure, which accounts for about a quarter of the state’s methane emissions.¶State regulators want more farmers to reduce emissions with methane digesters, which capture methane from manure in large storage tanks and convert the gas into electricity.¶The state has set aside $50 million to help dairies set up digesters, but farmers say that’s not nearly enough to equip the state’s roughly 1,500 dairies.¶New Hope Dairy, which has 1,500 cows in Sacramento County, installed a $4 million methane digester in 2013, thanks to state grants and a partnership with the local utility, which operates the system to generate renewable power for the grid.¶But co-owner Arlin Van Groningen, a third-generation farmer, says he couldn’t afford one if he had to buy and run it himself.¶“The bottom line is it’s going to negatively impact the economics of the California dairy industry,” Van Groningen said of the new law. “In the dairy business, the margins are so slim that something like this will force us out of state.”¶State officials say they’re committed to making sure the new regulations work for farmers and the environment.¶“There’s a real opportunity here to get very significant emissions reductions at fairly low cost, and actually in a way that can bring economic benefits to farmers,” Ryan said.",0
Great Barrier Reef hits sad milestone,"

    ","¶CANBERRA, Australia — Warming oceans this year have caused the largest die-off of corals ever recorded on Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, scientists said Tuesday.¶The worst-affected area is a 400-mile swath in the north of the World Heritage-listed 1,400-mile chain of reefs off Australia’s northeast coast, said the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies.¶The center, based at James Cook University in Queensland state, found during dive surveys in October and November that the swath north of Port Douglas had lost an average of 67 percent of its shallow-water corals in the past nine months.¶More in Climate Change¶Farther south, over the vast central and southern regions that cover most of the reef, scientists found a much lower death toll.¶The central region lost six percent of bleached coral and the southern region only one percent.¶“The mortality we’ve measured along the length of the Great Barrier Reef is incredibly patchy,” the center’s director, Terry Hughes, told reporters. “There’s very severe damage in the northern section of the reef.”¶“The good news is that south of Port Douglas, including the major tourist areas around Cairns and the Whitsundays (Whitsunday Islands), have had relatively low levels of mortality,” he added.¶The governments of Australia and Queensland will update the UNESCO World Heritage Center this week on progress being made to protect and improve the reef, including their response to coral bleaching.¶Providing a status update to the World Heritage Committee was required as part of its decision in June last year not to list the reef as “in danger.”¶Federal Minister for the Environment and Energy Josh Frydenberg said Tuesday that the reef’s coral cover had increased by 19 percent in recent years before it suffered a “significant bleaching event” this year, caused by the El Nino weather effect and climate change.¶“What that shows is that the Great Barrier Reef is very resilient and quite strong,” Frydenberg’s office said in a statement.¶The government’s plan to spend $1.5 billion over the next decade on improving the reef’s health.¶Hughes said the coral death rates in the north would likely make the task of keeping the reef off the “in danger” list much harder.¶“In its ongoing dialogue with UNESCO, Australia has said the outstanding universal values of reef are in tact because of the pristine condition of the northern reef. That’s simply no longer the case,” Hughes said.¶Researcher Andrew Baird said the 2016 coral die-off was “substantially worse” than the previous worst-ever event in 1998.¶“The proportion of reefs that were severely affected was much, much higher,” Baird said, adding that he did not have precise figures immediately available.¶The 1998 event was restricted to in-shore reefs around the Queensland coastal city of Townsville, while the 2016 destruction affected a much larger area, he said.¶Scientists expect that the northern region will take at least 10 to 15 years to regain the lost corals. They are concerned that another bleaching event could interrupt that recovery.¶There have been three extreme mass bleaching events in 18 years on the reef. In each case, the areas that suffered the worst bleaching were where the water was hottest for the longest period of time.¶Reef tourism operator Craig Stephen did not expect the dead coral would diminish visitors’ experience of one of Australia’s biggest tourist drawcards.¶“The patchiness of the bleaching means that we can still provide our customers with a world-class coral reef experience by taking them to reefs that are still in top condition,” Stephen said in a statement.¶Graeme Kelleher, who headed the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority for 16 years, said last week that Australians must not buy the “political lie” that they can have the reef as well as major coal mines nearby.¶“We’ve lost 50 percent of the coral cover on the Great Barrier Reef in the last 30 years and the main cause of that is the burning of fossil fuel. I sincerely hope UNESCO rejects the claim that the government is doing enough,” Kelleher said.",0
Wind turbines face uphill battle in upstate New York,"
","
November 28, 2016 / 12:41 PM
      / AP
    ","¶Clean energy and environmental interests usually go hand in hand. But in western New York, they are battling over plans to build dozens of wind turbines that could be among the nation’s tallest, rising 600 feet above the scenic shores of Lake Ontario.¶Apex Clean Energy’s proposal to plant 70 propeller turbines amid the farms and towns east of Niagara Falls is still in its early stages, but it has already generated thousands of pages of comments, studies and legal documents considered by state regulators.¶Wildlife groups are concerned the turbines could disrupt a major flyway for migrating birds. Local lawmakers worry about flight operations being compromised at a nearby military base. Residents fret about potential health threats from noise, which are still being studied, and say views could be dominated by structures taller than any skyscraper in upstate New York.¶More in Climate Change¶“There’s nothing this size on land,” opponent Pam Atwater said of the turbine towers proposed by Apex. “We’re not even really talking about aesthetics or anything like that. But of course it’s going to have an impact. The terrain here is flat. You can see for miles.”¶It’s a debate playing out as rapidly improving technology for towers and turbines allow the wind industry to move on to increasingly taller structures.¶Federal Aviation Administration records show that the vast majority of the hundreds of proposed turbines the agency is reviewing for air safety would stand at or just below 500 feet. But two other projects in New York — one in central New York, one in the northeast corner — have submitted plans for a combined 70 turbines from 640 to 656 feet tall, and there are several projects with towers topping 600 feet in the works in Texas and Kansas. The tallest towers in the world now top 700 feet and operate offshore in Europe.¶Charlottesville, Virginia-based Apex, a major national wind farm developer, said it hasn’t settled precisely on the turbine size for the project named Lighthouse Wind, but noted that taller machines offer greater yield.¶“Currently in New York the tallest wind turbine is just under 500 feet,” Apex development manager Taylor Quarles told The Associated Press. “But certainly the trend in the industry is to go higher as the consistency and wind speed, essentially the quality of the wind, does tend to increase with elevation.”¶Seventy turbines is the high end of its proposal, he said, and it may require only 50 or 60 of the larger machines to achieve the project’s goal of generating 201 megawatts of electricity, enough to power 50,000 average New York homes.¶“There is this phase where what used to be the offshore type of size is now migrating onshore for more wind resources,” said Yates Town Supervisor James Simon, a wind farm opponent. He said that makes people in his community and the neighboring town of Somerset, essentially, “guinea pigs.”¶Atwater notes that “they’re designed for offshore use, so there is no place you can go and no one who can tell you what the impact’s going to be.”¶Retired truck driver Howard Pierce, whose home in Yates is across a street from one boundary of the project, said he isn’t worried about environmental issues as much as the payments landowners will get for leasing to Apex.¶“The No. 1 industry in our town is farming, and the wind farm would give these farmers a steady income every year,” Pierce said. “This would not depend on the commodity prices.”¶The project is one of the first tests of a new state regulatory regime, known as “Article 10” for the 2011 law that took the power to approve major energy projects out of the hands of a mix of local and state authorities and gave it to a single state authority, the Board on Electric Generation Siting and the Environment. There is not yet a timetable for when the panel will make a decision.¶Gov. Andrew Cuomo has set a goal of meeting half the state’s energy needs from renewable sources by 2030. One of the challenges to that goal has been a lull in wind projects since 2013. Installed capacity grew in leaps from 2000 to 2012 and then stalled, with almost no new capacity added in recent years, according to federal Department of Energy statistics.¶That has opponents worried the process will be biased toward approving the project.¶Republican Assemblyman Steve Hawley, who opposed Article 10 and Lighthouse Wind, is giving the process a chance.¶“I’m going to trust that they’re going to take, not with a grain of salt, not in one ear and out the other, but seriously take the locals’ concerns into consideration,” he said.",0
The problem with Donald Trump's stance on global warming,"

    ","¶Is there reason to doubt climate change because some of the nation’s hottest days happened in 1898, as President-elect Donald Trump told the New York Times in an interview Tuesday?¶In an exchange with Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. and staff about climate change on Tuesday (Nov. 22), Trump said, “I have an open mind to it,” but later added, “You know the hottest day ever was in 1890-something, 98. You know, you can make lots of cases for different views.”¶However, it’s misleading to single out a weather event — such as a particularly hot day in 1898 — as evidence for or against climate change, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Ocean Service (NOS). [The Reality of Climate Change: 10 Myths Busted]¶More in Climate Change¶“Weather is what you see outside on any particular day,” the NOS reports. “So, for example, it may be 75 degrees and sunny or it could be 20 degrees with heavy snow.”¶In contrast, climate is an average of weather over time. “For example, you can expect snow in the Northeast in January, or for it to be hot and humid in the Southeast in July,” the NOS said.¶Extreme values, such as record rainfall or record high and low temperatures, are known as climate records because they stand out in a long period of time, the agency added.¶In 1898, both Oregon and Maryland reached their highest temperatures on record: 119 degrees Fahrenheit (66 degrees Celsius) in Oregon and 109 F (60.5 C) in Maryland, according to The Weather Channel. But these record-hot temperatures are simply climate records in two states, not evidence for widespread climate change, according to experts.¶Rather, looking at the climate for an extended period of time gives researchers a better idea about the direction the climate is heading. For instance, 2016 is expected to be the hottest year on record by a significant margin, with world temperatures an average of 2.2 F (1.2 C) above preindustrial levels, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said, as reported by Climate Central.¶Moreover, 2011 to 2015 is the hottest five-year period on record, according to a separate WMO report released this month, according to Climate Central. When 2016 officially becomes the hottest year on record, 16 of the 17 hottest years will have happened since 2000, with the El Niño year of 1998 being the only exception, Climate Central reported.¶Ninety-seven percent of climate scientists agree that this rapid warming is not due to natural causes, but due primarily to the result of human activity, according to NASA.¶These increasing temperatures are “consistent with our expectations for the response of the climate system to increases in greenhouse gases,” Jennifer Francis, a research professor in the Department of Marine and Coastal Sciences at Rutgers University in New Jersey, told Live Science last week.¶During the interview with Trump, Sulzberger also conflated a single weather event — Hurricane Sandy, which slammed the Caribbean and the East Coast of the United States in 2012 — with climate change, saying, “Well, since we’re living on an island, sir, I want to thank you for having an open mind. We saw what these storms are now doing, right? We’ve seen it personally. Straight up.”¶However, there is debate about whether Hurricane Sandy was a consequence of climate change. In general, scientists are hesitant to say that climate change caused the 2012 hurricane, but some say that climate change contributed to it, Live Science reported in 2012.¶For instance, warm oceans and moist air give strength to existing hurricanes, Kevin Trenberth, a distinguished senior scientist in the Climate Analysis Section at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, told Live Science.¶Moreover, it’s possible that future flood-causing surges from hurricanes and other storms will be more severe as climate change causes sea levels to rise, according to study published in October in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.¶Original article on Live Science.",0
Heat records have become the new normal,"

    ","¶WASHINGTON — The United States is already setting twice as many daily heat records as cold records, and a new study predicts that will get a lot more lopsided as man-made climate change worsens.¶Under normal conditions, without extra heat-trapping gases from human activity, the nation should set about the same number of hot and cold records over the course of several years. But that’s not happening and it’s steadily getting worse, scientists said.¶If and when the nation warms another 4.5 degrees, expect there to be around 15 heat records for every cold one, the new study in Monday’s Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences predicts. That warming can be as early as 50 years from now if greenhouse gas emissions - from the burning of coal, oil and gas - continue at their recent pace or a century away if carbon pollution slows down, said study lead author Gerald Meehl, senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research.¶More in Climate Change¶“This climate is on a trajectory that goes somewhere we’ve never been. And records are a very easy measure of that,” said study co-author Claudia Tebaldi, who’s also at the atmospheric center in Boulder, Colorado.¶They used records from the nation’s weather stations for their statistical calculations.¶After an earlier study in 2009, Meehl and Tebaldi looked further in the past and into the future. In the Dust Bowl hot 1930s, there were 1.1 hot records for every cold. After a couple decades of more cold records and an even one-to-one ratio in the 1980s, the number of high heat marks left cold in the dust.¶So far in the 2010s there have been 2.2 hot records for every cold, including six hot records for every cold this year, Meehl said.¶Looking at records is important because people don’t feel shifts in average temperature, but they do notice shifts in extremes like this, Meehl said.¶“These results are not surprising,” University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd said in an email. “And it further points to the notion that ‘extremes’ not averages get our attention. In life we get alarmed when we have a fever, not when our temperature is near the 98.6 average. We are setting Earth on course for high fever events to be quite common.”",0

    ","¶JAENSCHWALDE, Germany — Amid whiffs of chemicals and the electric hum of transformers, Kraftwerk Jaenschwalde rises like an ash-colored fortress over a landscape disfigured by decades of open-pit coal mining.¶The communist-era colossus in eastern Germany is one of Europe’s dirtiest power plants, belching 24 million tons of climate-warming carbon dioxide into the air every year.¶It could have been closed for good when former owner Vattenfall, a Swedish utility, decided to get rid of its coal assets in Germany to reduce its carbon footprint. But as local officials point out, the lignite industry employs thousands in this region and together with hard coal accounts for more than 40 percent of Germany’s power production.¶More in Climate Change¶“This is the reason why you can’t shut down a coal mine or power plant from one day to another,” plant spokesman Thoralf Schirmer says.¶That the fight against climate change ran into that cold hard reality here in the heart of Europe — the world’s climate leader — shows how challenging it’s going to be to keep the global temperature rise “well below” 2 degrees Celsius, as agreed in last year’s Paris emissions pact.¶A growing body of evidence suggests that the power plants, buildings, cars, trucks, ships and planes in use today are likely to emit enough CO2 over their lifetime for the world to miss that target. Coal plants alone could blow the carbon budget for 1.5 degrees C of warming, the lower threshold also mentioned in the agreement, unless they are shut down early.¶“For 1.5 degrees we would have to start retiring things like crazy and we wouldn’t be able to build anything new,” says University of California, Irvine, scientist Steven Davis. “Two degrees is starting to look equally bleak.”¶That hasn’t quite sunk in amid the fanfare surrounding the Paris Agreement, which entered into force with record pace.¶Temperatures have already risen by about 1 degree C since the industrial revolution, when countries started burning fossil fuels for energy.¶In 2010 Davis and others estimated that the world’s existing energy infrastructure had locked in 496 billion tons of CO2 emissions if left to operate for their expected lifetime. By 2013, as hundreds of additional power plants had come online in Asia, the number rose to 729 billion tons.¶“By my latest calculations, we’re close to 800 billion tons now,” Davis says.¶That’s roughly what’s remaining of the so-called carbon budget for 2 degrees, according to recent estimates based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s latest assessment.¶That budget is significantly lower for 1.5 degrees. Joeri Rogelj of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Laxenburg, Austria, estimated that it’s 150 billion tons or somewhat higher, while researchers at the Climate Interactive group said it’s about 210 billion tons.¶There is uncertainty surrounding the estimates partly because it’s unclear exactly how sensitive the climate system is to increases in atmospheric CO2 levels.¶Davis’ research shows that, assuming an average lifespan of 40 years, the world’s coal-fired power plants will emit 280 billion tons of CO2, exceeding the budget for 1.5 degrees. And that doesn’t even count the hundreds more that are under construction or on the drawing board, primarily in China and other Asian countries.¶“Those things wouldn’t be able to operate over their normal 30, 40 year lifespan,” says Davis. “Instead they’d need to be closed down after 10 or 15 years. And so it’s a matter of paying for that. That’s a lot of life in those power plants that we’d basically have to throw away.”¶This is happening in some places like the United States where coal plants are being shut down because of competition from natural gas, which is cheaper and has lower emissions. But not fast enough to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, as globally more coal plants are built every year than are retired, according to a report this year by environmental groups CoalSwarm, Greenpeace and the Sierra Club.¶The report said there are 7,273 operating coal plants around the world this year, with 719 under construction and more than 1,000 in the planning stages.¶At U.N. climate talks in Morocco this week, governments and clean energy advocates noted that the world’s transition toward a low-carbon economy is well underway, with renewable sources like wind and solar expanding quickly.¶But global energy demand is also growing, meaning renewables are adding power capacity rather than replacing existing capacity from fossil fuels, said Glen Peters of the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research in Oslo.¶“There is a bit of displacement going on in U.S. and in China,” he said. “But for emissions to go down you need to not build any more fossil (fuel) infrastructure. And to go down faster you would have to close down existing infrastructure.”¶Very few of the scientific projections count on countries retiring fossil fuels fast enough to meet the Paris targets. Instead they assume the world will find a way to suck vast quantities of CO2 from the atmosphere in the latter half of the century.¶The story of Jaenschwalde helps explain why. When Vattenfall, which is owned by the Swedish government, decided to offload its coal plants and mines in Germany, it came under pressure from environmentalists to decommission them instead. But that would have been “financially burdensome,” says Vattenfall CEO Magnus Hall.¶“So we decided to divest it,” he says, adding that what to do with them is a question for the German government and people.¶Environmental groups protested the sale of the mines and plants to Czech investors, saying this just means their carbon footprint is passed on to someone else.¶But there was no appetite among German decision-makers for closing down the lignite industry, which employs 8,000 people in the eastern Lausitz region bordering Poland.¶The new Czech owners are considering expanding the mines, saying Germany’s decision to phase out nuclear power means the demand for lignite power “will remain stable.”¶That’s encouraging to Schirmer, a bookish man with a purple scarf. On the other side of the border, he says, Poland is planning to open new lignite mines, meaning Germany could end up importing electricity generated from Polish coal if it shuts down its own mines.¶He agrees that Germany needs to go “100 percent renewables,” but that’s still “a long way away” because until energy storage makes a quantum leap, coal power will be needed on days when there’s no wind or sunshine.¶“It wouldn’t be wise to sink the ship,” he says, “before you even have seen land.”",0

            Climate Diaries: Drought threatening African mountain gorillas - CBS News
    ",CBS News,"November 17, 2016, 6:52 PM","¶VOLCANO NATIONAL PARK, Rwanda -- There’s a population on the slopes of these volcanic peaks in central Africa that knows nothing of arguments in Washington about climate change.¶But the famous “gorillas in the mist” do know something is going on.  ¶They know the bamboo shoots that make up a major part of their diet, and which used to sprout like clockwork, are now less predictable. ¶The rains that produce them were a month late this year. The gorillas have had to adapt their roaming and foraging patterns because the old seasonal rhythms of food production have altered. Their world is changing.¶

According to David Greer of the World Wildlife Fund’s great apes program, when those people are forced up into the mountains they bring disease and other dangers with them.¶“They have to enter the park to access this clean water. And in the meantime they might want to set a snare for catching an ungulate for food,” Greer said, referring to a class of mammals that includes antelopes and other local fauna.¶But on some occasions, a gorilla can become ensnared in those same traps.¶That’s what happened to one gorilla, filmed by a “60 Minutes” team a few months ago. The snare was removed by one of the vets whose work has actually helped the ape population increase lately.¶Still, there are only about 880 mountain gorillas left in the world, confined to the mountain tops across Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda.

    ","¶MARRAKECH, Morocco -- French President Francois Hollande on Tuesday urged the United States to respect the “irreversible” Paris Agreement on climate change, and said France will lead a dialogue on the topic with President-elect Donald Trump “on behalf of the 100 countries that have ratified” the deal.¶Speaking to a U.N. climate conference in Morocco, Hollande praised President Barack Obama for his role in getting the landmark deal adopted by more than 190 countries in the French capital last year.¶“The United States, the most powerful economy in the world, the second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, must respect the commitments that were made,” he said. “It’s not simply their duty, it’s in their interest.”¶More in Climate Change¶Scientists say oil and other fossil fuels are the biggest contributors to man-made warming. Trump, however, has called global warming a “hoax” and pledged during his campaign to “cancel” the Paris deal.¶Earlier, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he hopes Trump will shift his course on global warming and “understand the seriousness and urgency” of addressing the problem.¶“As president of the United States, I’m sure that he will understand this, he will listen and he will evaluate his campaign remarks,” Ban told reporters in Marrakech.¶The Paris Agreement was signed by more than 190 countries and has been formally approved by more than 100 of them, including the United States and even oil-rich Saudi Arabia.¶Ban called international climate action “unstoppable” and said that no country, “however resourceful or powerful,” is immune from the impacts of global warming.¶“We have no right to gamble with the fate of future generations — or imperil the survival of other species that share our planet,” Ban told the conference.¶Trump’s election has created uncertainty about the U.S. role in the Paris deal, which calls on all countries to reduce or curb their greenhouse gas emissions and encourages rich countries to help poor ones deal with climate change.¶King Mohammed VI of Morocco urged delegates at the conference to translate their commitments into actions.¶“What’s at stake is the very existence of man,” the king said. “It is therefore our joint duty to work hand in hand to protect humanity.”",0
2016 set to break heat record despite slowdown in emissions,"

      / AP
    ","¶MARRAKECH, Morocco -- Global temperatures are soaring toward a record high this year, the U.N. weather agency said Monday, while another report showed emissions of a key global warming gas have flattened out in the past three years.¶The reports injected a mix of gloom and hope at U.N. climate talks in Marrakech this week.¶“Another year. Another record. The high temperatures we saw in 2015 are set to be beaten in 2016,” said Petteri Taalas, the head of the World Meteorological Organization.¶More in Climate Change¶WMO’s preliminary data through October showed world temperatures, boosted by the El Niño phenomenon, are 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels.¶That’s getting close to the limit set by the global climate agreement adopted in Paris last year. It calls for limiting the temperature rise since the industrial revolution to 2 degrees C or even 1.5 degrees C.¶WMO said 16 of the 17 hottest years have occurred this century. The only exception was 1998, which was also an El Nino year.¶Taalas said parts of Arctic Russia saw temperatures soaring 6-7 degrees C above average. “We are used to measuring temperature records in fractions of a degree, and so this is different,” he said.¶Environmental groups and climate scientists said the report underscores the need to quickly reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases blamed for warming the planet.¶Another report released Monday delivered some positive news, showing global CO2 emissions have flattened out in the past three years. However, the authors of the study cautioned it’s unclear whether the slowdown, mainly caused by declining coal use in China, is a permanent trend or a temporary blip.¶“It is far too early to proclaim we have reached a peak,” said co-author Glen Peters, a senior researcher at the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research in Oslo.¶The study, published in the journal Earth System Science Data, says global CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and industry is projected to grow by just 0.2 percent this year.¶That would mean emissions have leveled off at about 36 billion metric tons in the past three years even though the world economy has expanded, suggesting the historical bonds between economic gains and emissions growth may have been severed.¶“This could be the turning point we have hoped for,” said David Ray, a professor of carbon management at the University of Edinburgh, who was not involved with the study. “To tackle climate change those bonds must be broken and here we have the first signs that they are at least starting to loosen.”¶Chinese emissions were down 0.7 percent in 2015 and are projected to fall 0.5 percent in 2016, the researchers said, though noting that Chinese energy statistics have been plagued by inconsistencies.¶Peters said it remains unclear whether the Chinese slowdown was due to a restructuring of the economy or a sign of economic instability, but the unexpected reduction in Chinese emissions “give us hope that the world’s biggest emitter can deliver much more ambitious emission reductions.”¶China, which accounts for almost 30 percent of global carbon emissions, pledged to peak its emissions around 2030 as part of the global climate pact adopted in Paris last year. Many analysts say China’s peak is likely to come much earlier — and may already have occurred.¶“The continued decline of China’s CO2 emissions, combined with knowledge of structural change in the energy system, does indicate that CO2 emissions from China may have peaked, however a few more years of data is needed to confirm this,” said Bill Hare, of Climate Analytics, a separate group that monitors global emissions.¶Even if China’s emissions have stabilized, growth in India and other developing countries could push global emissions higher again. India’s emissions rose 5 percent in 2015, the study said.¶The election of Donald Trump as president of the United States — the world’s No. 2 carbon polluter — could also have an impact.¶U.S. emissions fell 2.6 percent last year and are projected to drop 1.7 percent this year, as natural gas and renewables displace coal in power generation, the study showed. But it’s unclear whether those reductions will continue under Trump, who has pledged to roll back the Obama administration’s environmental policies, including the Clean Power Plan to reduce carbon pollution from power plants.¶Other researchers not affiliated with the study stressed that it’s not enough for global emissions to stabilize; they need to drop toward zero for the world to meet the goals of the Paris deal.¶“Worryingly, the reductions pledged by the nations under the Paris Agreement are not sufficient to achieve this,” said climate scientist Chris Rapley of University College London.",0

            Supermoon elevates flooding in South Florida - CBS News
    ",CBS News,"November 14, 2016, 7:46 AM","¶The extra-bright “supermoon” has been lighting up the sky all over the world. The full moon is currently the closest it has been to Earth since 1948, and will reach the peak of its full phase at 8:52 a.m. Eastern. ¶But the supermoon’s stronger gravitational pull is amplifying the seasonal “king tide,” and creating heightened flood risks in places like South Florida.¶In Fort Lauderdale, king tides happen once or twice a year, bringing seawater into low-lying neighborhoods. While the supermoon is making this tide more extreme, flooding has become a persistent problem throughout South Florida, leading to aggressive and expensive solutions.¶On  South Bayshore Lane in Coconut Grove, the bay came ashore at high tide Sunday night, with six inches of water in the street. ¶“By 2030, we expect up to another six inches of sea level rise to occur,” Dr. Tiffany Troxler, director of Florida International University’s Sea Level Solutions Center, told correspondent David Begnaud. “We might see another six inches on top of this.”¶With rising sea levels, seasonal king tides are swamping storefronts and submerging city streets.  But scientists say this month’s flooding is expected to be even worse, thanks to the so-called supermoon -- when the moon is closer to the Earth than normal. ¶“That additional gravitational pull has caused our high tides to be a little bit higher than they would have been without that supermoon,” Dr. Troxler said. ¶Infrastructure director Ray Coley, who manages the waterway and sewer systems in Miami Beach, said, “We’re at the point that the waters are rising high enough that it’s interfering with public safety.”¶Scientists say flooding incidents in Miami Beach have increased at least 400 percent in the last 10 years. ¶“A year ago, we were having to close the road twice a day because the water was about a foot taller than the ground,” said Coley. “If we have to close this road, that affects our police, our fire, our ambulance service.”¶If Miami Beach’s sea level were to rise just two feet, the area would undergo a radical transformation. ¶Desperate times lead to desperate measures: The city is spending at least $400 million trying to keep the tourist mecca higher and drier.  ¶Fifty temporary pump stations have been installed, and more permanent ones are on the way, similar to those in New Orleans. And Miami Beach is actually raising the city streets and elevating flood walls.  ¶Dr. Troxler says this has gone beyond a debate over climate change.¶“What’s happening is that we have sea level rising in our neighborhoods and we need to do something about it now,” she told Begnaud. ¶Most people in Fort Lauderdale live about five feet above sea level. According to one study, South Florida could see a six-inch increase in sea level by 2030 -- four years before the next supermoon.",0

    ","¶MCMURDO STATION, Antarctica — U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry became the highest-ranking American official to visit Antarctica on Friday when he landed for a two-day trip during which he’ll hear from scientists about the impact of climate change on the frozen continent.¶Kerry left from New Zealand after being held up for about a day by bad weather. Kerry and his entourage left the Christchurch airport at 6 a.m. aboard a C-17 Globemaster military cargo plane and landed in Antarctica about 11 a.m.¶Kerry, an experienced pilot, spent much of the flight in the cockpit of the huge jet, chatting with the pilots. After a smooth trip of about five hours, the group landed on the Pegasus Ice Runway, the strip of ice that serves McMurdo. The large base is the hub for U.S. operations.¶Kerry made no public remarks on the initial leg of the trip. In Christchurch a day earlier, he congratulated President-elect Donald Trump for winning a “momentous election” and said he had reminded State Department staff of the “time-honored tradition of a very peaceful and constructive transfer of power.”¶More in Climate Change¶In Antarctica, Kerry’s plans called for his entourage to transfer immediately at the airstrip to a smaller military transport plane for a three-hour flight to the research station the U.S. government operates near the South Pole. Kerry planned to visit that station for about two hours before returning to McMurdo for the night.¶Kerry’s aides described the trip as a learning opportunity for the secretary of state. He planned to receive briefings from scientists working to understand the effects of climate change on Antarctica. Kerry has made climate change an intensive focus of American diplomacy during his term, and had previously spent decades working on the issue as a U.S. senator.¶However, that legacy could be less lasting than he might have hoped, if the Trump administration moves to pull out of the Paris Agreement on reducing emissions and climate change, which the U.S. and more than 100 other countries signed onto last year.¶Trump has also vowed to reverse Obama administration environmental policies encouraging clean energy.¶Kerry planned to return to New Zealand on Saturday for meetings with Prime Minister John Key. He plans to fly next week to the Middle East for talks, and then onward to a global climate conference in Morocco, where he will give a major speech.",0
Trump likely to take aim at Obama environment initiatives,"

    ","¶GAINESVILLE, Fla. -- President-elect Donald Trump has not minced words about his approach to environment and energy policy: He loathes regulation and wants to increase the use of coal, offshore drilling and fracking.¶Trump has said he believes climate change is a hoax and that he would “cancel” U.S. involvement in the landmark Paris Agreement on global warming.¶While he’s been vague about precise policies, Trump’s election likely means trouble for some of President Barack Obama’s signature environmental initiatives, environmentalists and policy analysts say.¶More in Climate Change¶In a signal of how he plans to approach the issue as president, Trump has selected a skeptic of climate change to lead his Environmental Protection Agency transition team.¶Myron Ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute’s (CEI) is also viewed by many as a top candidate to become the next head of the EPA. Ebell’s research focuses on questioning what he calls “global warming alarmism” and opposing energy rationing policies, according to his biography on CEI’s website.¶Analysts say it’s probable that Trump’s administration will seek to weaken or kill the Clean Power Plan, a cornerstone Obama policy meant to reduce carbon pollution from the nation’s power plants as part of an effort to combat climate change.¶The Clean Power Plan is being challenged in federal court, and if it survives, Trump could move to scuttle it. But not without a fight.¶“We don’t consider the CPP dead. We have many tools to help preserve it,” said David Goldston, director of government affairs for the Natural Resources Defense Council. “He can’t just snap his fingers and wish away regulations. There’d be a backlash, which would make Congress think twice.”¶Any move to back out of the Clean Power Plan or the Paris Agreement could be extremely unpopular moves, environmentalists argue. Polls have shown a majority of voters in at least two states surveyed believe global warming is a serious problem.¶An exit poll conducted for The Associated Press and television networks found that about half of Trump voters in Florida, a state he carried, agreed that climate change was a serious problem. In Maine, just over half of Trump supporters also agreed, while about four in 10 disagreed.¶Trump also has vowed to tap into America’s coal reserves in an effort to put the shrinking energy sector back to work. In a speech in the Bakken shale fields of North Dakota, he also said he would increase hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, in the nation’s shale and natural gas reserves to further remove any dependence on foreign energy sources.¶Industry advocates are buoyed by the possibilities presented by Trump’s win.¶“We look forward to working with the new administration” on issues such as opening more public land and offshore areas to oil and gas drilling, building more energy infrastructure and reducing environmental regulations, American Petroleum Institute President Jack Gerard said Thursday. He would not say whether he supported a U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement.¶Likewise, the coal industry believes Trump “understands the urgent need to rein in the Washington bureaucracy and sweeping, excessive regulations” to protect coal jobs in an industry where sharply falling demand for coal has led to permanent plant closures, the American Coal Council said.¶“The coal sector has been devastated by lower demand and job loss in recent years due to the mounting impact of regulations pointed squarely at our industry,” American Coal Council CEO Betsy Monseu said.¶Some question whether it would make economic sense for the U.S. to attempt to increase the use of coal, a fuel being phased out of the energy picture due to its pollution and falling prices of renewables such as solar and wind.¶“Coal is not coming back,” said Michael Brune, Sierra Club executive director. “Ask investors on Wall Street, or regulators at the state and local level who are choosing solar and wind because of basic economics.”¶As for offshore drilling, Trump could target the Atlantic and Arctic: two areas the Obama administration had made off-limits for oil leases in the immediate future. While the Obama administration has moved to restrict drilling in waters off the Eastern Seaboard and Alaska, Trump has been vague on whether he would support reopening these areas to drilling, saying he backs it when it “can be done responsibly.”¶Environmentalists said Wednesday they hope Trump concludes opening the Atlantic and Arctic to offshore drilling is a bad business decision.¶“In the Atlantic, we hope he will recognize the strong opposition from the business community, which has mounted a concerted campaign to protect its fishing and tourism industries against the interest of the oil industry,” said Jacqueline Savitz of Oceana, a group opposed to offshore drilling. “In the Arctic, it’s impossible to respond to an oil spill, with extreme cold, floating ice, darkness much of the year and no response facilities.”¶Concerns over the incoming administration’s environmental approach were not confined to policy.¶Some climate scientists expressed concern that the Trump administration could reduce government’s efforts to study climate change. For example, some Republicans have long wanted to stop NASA’s role in studying earth science and climate change — a key contribution to scientific understanding of the issue that helps drive policy decisions.¶Waleed Abdalati, a former NASA chief scientist, said in an email that the agency’s contributions are extremely important to the nation’s success.¶“Part of this investment includes trying to better understand how and why our environment is changing and the implications for the American people, as well as people all over the world,” Abdalati wrote. “No one can argue that there is tremendous value in knowing what tomorrow will bring.”",0

Trump has referred to climate change as a “hoax.” And his “America First” vision on energy and climate change includes revitalizing the coal industry, lifting regulations on oil and gas industries, as well as nullifying the international landmark agreement dedicated to halting the effects of climate change because they’re “bad for US business.”¶The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.¶Not only are wind farms disgusting looking, but even worse they are bad for people's health http://t.co/2G8YrOUZ (cont) http://t.co/NujHgnXU¶Former Alaska Gov.

    ","¶In less than a decade, the record-breaking hot temperatures we’ve seen lately may have become the “new normal” around the world, climate scientists say. New research predicts that the unusually warm temperatures that made 2015 the hottest year on record by a wide margin will be standard by 2025 if carbon emissions continue to increase at their current rate.¶The research was published in the Bulletin of American Meteorological Society. ¶“If we continue with business-as-usual emissions, extreme seasons will inevitably become the norm within decades and Australia will be the canary in the coal mine that will experience this change first,” lead author Dr. Sophie Lewis, from the Australian National University hub of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science (ARCCSS), said in a press release. ¶More in Climate Change¶The climate trends outlined in the report look worrisome. Lewis said that regardless of whatever actions we take to curb emissions today, the planet was already locked into a pattern of rising temperatures. That being said, the researchers believe that if aggressive action was taken now, record-breaking seasons could be stopped from becoming the norm, at least at the regional level. ¶If not, summers in some areas could become unbearable within decades.¶“That means the record hot summer of 2013 in Australia — when we saw temperatures approaching 50°C [122° Fahrenheit] in parts of Australia, bush fires striking the Blue Mountains in October, major impacts to our health and infrastructure and a summer that was so hot it became known as the ‘angry summer’ — could be just another average summer season by 2035,” Lewis said. ¶However, she added, that fate could still be avoided “if we reduce emissions drastically to the lowest pathway recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change” — a U.N.-sponsored panel of experts which has developed a plan to keep global temperature increases below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6°F) by the end of the century.¶What exactly would it mean to establish a “new normal?” Lewis and her team developed a definition which specifies this would occur when “at least half of the years following a record year were cooler and half warmer.”¶The researchers then used a supercomputer that ran climate models to project when a “new normal” would occur based on four different scenarios laid out by the U.N. panel, depending on how much carbon emissions were reduced.¶Following this, they looked at seasonal temperatures from December to February throughout Europe, Asia, Australia, and North America. Global average temperatures would hit this “new normal” designation when the climate models were put through all four carbon emission scenarios. This was not the case on a smaller scale when it came to seasonal and regional levels.¶Lewis said that if we took strong steps to reduce greenhouse gases globally, seasonal extremes “might never enter a new normal state in the 21st century at regional levels for the Southern Hemisphere summer and Northern Hemisphere winter.”¶She used Australia’s “angry summer” of 2013 as a cautionary tale. ¶“If If we don’t act quickly Australia’s ‘angry summer’ of 2013 may soon be regarded as mild,” she added. “Imagine for a moment, if a summer season like 2013 became average. The likely impacts of an extremely hot year in 2035 would beyond anything our society has experienced.”",0

However, the transition toward cleaner energy is so entrenched in the U.S. it would continue without federal money, she added.¶The U.S. under the Bush administration declined to join the previous climate deal, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which greatly reduced its impact on global emissions.

Ebell’s research focuses on questioning what he calls “global warming alarmism” and opposing energy rationing policies, according to his biography on CEI’s website.¶On the campaign trail, Trump called for stripping regulations to allow unfettered production of fossil fuels — a key source of emissions — and rescinding the Clean Power Plan, an Obama administration strategy to fight climate change.¶In May, Trump told an oil and gas conference in North Dakota he would “save the coal industry” and stop all payments of U.S. tax dollars to global warming programs.¶“Trump will try and slam the brakes on climate action, which means we need to throw all of our weight on the accelerator,” said May Boeve, leader of the 350.org environmental group.¶The pro-fossil fuels American Energy Alliance said Trump’s victory presents a chance to reset “harmful energy policies” in the United States.¶“He has laid out an energy plan that puts the needs of American families and workers first,” the group’s president, Thomas Pyle, said.¶While shell-shocked American climate activists in Marrakech cried and embraced, U.S. negotiators declined to speak to reporters about the election’s outcome.¶However, before the two-week conference, U.S. officials said they expect other countries to stay the course irrespective of what Washington decides, because they see it is in their national interests.¶Li Shuo, a climate policy expert at Greenpeace in China, said his nation — the world’s top polluter — would continue to work on climate change “out of its own very genuine concern on air pollution, water pollution and food security.”¶The withdrawal process would take four years — an entire presidential term — under the terms of the agreement. However, Trump could also decide to simply ignore the Obama administration’s Paris pledge to reduce U.S. emissions by 26-28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025. The pledges are self-determined, and there is no punishment for countries that miss their targets.¶Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists, a veteran U.S. observer of the climate talks, said he hopes Trump will adopt a more “responsible” view in office.¶“Even he does not have the power to amend and change the laws of physics, to stop the impacts of climate change, to stop the rising sea levels,” Meyer said.¶Several analyses have shown that the world is not on track to keep the global temperature rise below 2 degrees C (3.6 degrees F) compared with preindustrial times, the goal of the Paris Agreement. Temperatures have already gone up by half that amount.¶Many climate scientists who feel countries aren’t doing enough to reduce emissions were dismayed by the Trump’s victory.¶“Can the world do climate stewardship without the U.S.? It has to,” said Jason Box, a glacier expert at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland.¶Among the minority of researchers who disagree that global warming is a major threat, Trump’s win sparked hopes that a new administration would somehow change the way science looks at the issue.¶“Expect some long-awaited, rigorous examination of the theory/models,” John Christy, of the University of Alabama, Huntsville, wrote in an email. “The danger just isn’t there.”",0

    ","¶MARRAKECH, Morocco — Climate negotiators started work Monday on implementing the Paris Agreement on global warming amid uncertainty over how the U.S. election will impact the landmark deal as temperatures and greenhouse gases soar to new heights.¶U.N. climate chief Patricia Espinosa told delegates in the rain-soaked Moroccan city of Marrakech that “no politician or citizen, no business manager or investor” can doubt that the world is determined to shift toward a “low-emission, resilient society.”¶So far, 100 countries have formally joined the agreement adopted last year in Paris, including top polluters China, the United States, the European Union and India.¶More in Climate Change¶However, U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has said he would “cancel” the deal if he wins the election this week. His opponent, Hillary Clinton, backs the climate policies of President Barack Obama’s government.¶The upcoming election seemed to be on everyone’s mind at the start of the two-week conference in Marrakech, where even security guards at the sprawling conference center were overheard discussing the potential implications for the world and efforts to fight climate change in particular.¶“Trump becoming President? I personally don’t have problem with it. But what does the guy want to do?” said Adjo Bokon, a delegate from the West African nation of Togo. “Is he conscious of what is going on with climate change?”¶Gabriela Fischerova, a Slovak official representing the European Union, said the 28-nation bloc is “open to any result. We will continue our discussions with any administration that will be in place.”¶The Paris Agreement marks the first time all countries have pledged to fight global warming by curbing the rise in greenhouse gas emissions, primarily carbon dioxide from fossil fuels.¶The U.N. says global emissions rise every year, reaching 52.7 billion tons in 2014, primarily driven by the rapid expansion of China, India and other Asian economies.¶Meanwhile, global average temperatures keep hitting new records. Last year was the hottest since reliable record-keeping began in the 19th century and this year is expected to be even hotter.¶On a per-capita basis, rich countries like the United States, Australia and oil-rich Gulf nations, have the highest emissions.¶“The wealthiest countries live as if there were three planets,” said French Environment Minister Segolene Royal. Meanwhile, poor countries in Africa who have contributed very little to the problem are suffering the consequences with fertile land turning into desert, she said.¶Delegates will meet for two weeks in the Moroccan city to work on the rules for implementing the Paris deal, including how to measure and report emissions so that countries can be held accountable.¶The goal of the agreement is to keep the global temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) compared with pre-industrial times, and “pursue efforts” to try to hold it to 1.5 degrees Celsius.¶The lower threshold was introduced on demand from vulnerable countries such as low-lying island nations who fear they will be washed away by rising seas as global warming melts glaciers and ice sheets.¶Temperatures have already risen about 1 degree C (1.8 degrees F) since the industrial revolution and analyses of the emissions cuts that countries have pledged so far show they put the world on a path to about 3 degrees C (5.4 degrees F) of warming.¶“Decisions made in the next few years will largely determine if we’re able to achieve the 1.5 C warming threshold agreed in Paris,” said Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, Peru’s former environment minister who now leads environmental group WWF International’s work on climate change. “Or if we take the unthinkable option of blowing right past it.”",0
Paris climate deal goes into effect sooner than expected,"

      / AP
    ","¶STOCKHOLM — The Paris Agreement on climate change enters into force Friday – faster than anyone had anticipated – after a year with remarkable success in international efforts to slash man-made emissions of carbon dioxide and other global warming gases.¶It means the world has moved a little closer to fixing what scientists say is the root cause of the world’s rising temperatures.¶But only a little.¶More in Climate Change¶In the Paris Agreement, countries agreed to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) and do their best to keep it below 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), compared with pre-industrial times.¶But agreeing on those goals was the easy part. Achieving them will require a transformational shift in our energy system, which despite strong gains by clean energy sources such as wind and solar power still depends on fossil fuels.¶Here are some of the things that need to be worked out before the Paris Agreement’s ambitious goals can be met:¶First, countries need to specify the rules for transparency and accountability to make sure countries fulfill their commitments.¶The wording on that was left vague in the Paris deal, which says all countries must report on their emissions and their efforts the reduce them, but allows for some “flexibility” for developing countries.¶That was because China and others insisted on softer requirements for developing countries that don’t have the same capacity to measure and report on emissions as rich nations.¶Work on the “rulebook” will start at a two-week U.N. climate conference starting Monday in Marrakech, Morocco. U.N. climate chief Patricia Espinosa said Friday that it should be completed by 2018 to ensure that “everyone is involved in the effort and is delivering to the best of their abilities.”¶The science is clear: Even if implemented in full, the emissions reductions that countries pledged for the Paris deal won’t keep global warming below 2 degrees C. Several independent analyses project warming of around 3 degrees C or more.¶To stay within reach of the 2-degree goal, countries will have to find ways of cutting an additional 12 billion to 14 billion metric tons from their annual emissions by 2030, according to a U.N. report released this week.¶That’s why the Paris deal calls for countries to review their individual emissions targets every five years, to see if they can find ways to achieve deeper cuts as renewable energy technologies become better and cheaper. The first review is set for 2018.¶The Paris Agreement deals with emissions after 2020. But climate models show that the world’s emissions curve needs to stop rising before then or it’s going to be really hard to achieve the 2-degree target and virtually impossible to stay below 1.5 degrees.¶Therefore, environmental groups and the most vulnerable countries insist that governments in high-polluting countries must deepen their emissions cuts now – not wait until 2020. So far that’s not happening.¶Money is always at the center of the climate talks. The U.S., Europe and other rich parts of the world have promised to collectively raise $100 billion a year by 2020 in so-called climate finance.¶The money is meant to help poorer nations shift from fossil fuels to clean energy and adapt to climate impacts that can’t be avoided, such as rising seas in some places and intensifying heat waves and droughts in others.¶Last month the rich countries came up with a “road map” showing they are on track to reach $100 billion in public and private finance. However, critics said the plan doesn’t make sure that existing development aid won’t be double counted – a key demand by poor countries.¶The “road map” is likely to be one of the most contentious issues in Marrakech.¶It’s not likely to play a major role in Morocco, but given the gap between where emissions are and where they should be to hit the Paris goals, governments will soon have to start paying serious attention to technologies that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.¶That’s known as negative emissions in climate lingo.¶Most climate models show negative emissions will be required in the latter half of the century to limit warming to 2 degrees. The technologies exist but it’s unclear whether they can be deployed on the massive scale required to make an impact.¶Besides the Paris Agreement, there have been several important developments recently in the fight against climate change, including record growth in renewable energy and the number of electric cars worldwide passing the symbolic milestone of one million. ¶Also, countries reached a deal on phasing out super-potent greenhouse gases used as coolants for refrigerators and freezers and another on limiting aviation emissions.¶But the climate system is hitting its own milestones, raising doubts over whether the 2-degree and 1.5-degree targets are even feasible.¶Last year was the hottest on record and this year is expected to be even hotter. Meanwhile, carbon dioxide levels in the Earth’s atmosphere have passed the symbolic level of 400 parts per million, which the U.N. weather agency last week said marks the “start of a new era of climate reality.”",0
Study: 90 miles in your car melts a foot of Arctic sea ice,"

      / AP
    ","¶WASHINGTON -- Driving a gas-powered car about 90 miles – the distance between New York and Philadelphia – melts about a square foot of Arctic sea ice in the critical month of September, according to a new study that directly links carbon pollution to the amount of ice that’s thawing.¶At current carbon emission levels, the Arctic will likely be free of sea ice in September around mid-century, which could make weather even more extreme and strand some polar animals, a study published Thursday in the journal Science finds.¶The study calculates that for every ton of carbon dioxide put in the air, there’s 29 square feet less of sea ice (for every metric ton, there’s 3 square meters less) during the crucial month when the Arctic region is least frozen. Using observations, statistics and 30 different computer models, the study authors show heat-trapping gases cause warming and the melting of sea ice in a way that can be translated into a simple mathematical formula.¶More in Climate Change¶There’s “a very clear linear relationship” between carbon dioxide emissions and sea ice retreat in September, especially at the southern boundary edges, said study lead author Dirk Notz, a climate scientist at Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Germany.¶“It’s very simple. Those emissions from our tailpipes and our coal-fired power plants are all going into the atmosphere,” said study co-author Julienne Stroeve, a climate scientist at both the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado, and University College, London. “It just increases the warming at the surface. So the ice is going to respond to that. The only way it can do that is to move further north.”¶Rutgers University marine scientist Jennifer Francis, who wasn’t part of the study, said the link is so clear and direct that “we know beyond a shadow of a doubt that Arctic sea ice is disappearing because of increased carbon dioxide.”¶Stroeve and Notz calculated that the average American each year is responsible for carbon emissions that lead to melting around 538 square feet of September sea ice.¶“I’ve stood on sea ice many times, and the idea that I’m responsible for 500 square feet of its destruction each year is devastating,” University of Washington climate scientist Cecilia Bitz, who wasn’t part of the study but also praised it, said in an email. “That is the size of my front yard!”¶On average, each September, there’s about 33,670 square miles less Arctic sea ice than the year before, although it varies year to year, according to a 37-year trend line calculated by the National Snow and Ice Data Center.¶From 1979 to 2000, the lowest sea ice amount of the year averaged about 2.6 million square miles, but this year it was down to the second lowest ever, 1.6 million square miles. That’s a loss about the size of the United States east of the Mississippi River.¶Sea ice does build back up over the winter even with man-made warming, although this year Arctic sea ice level set a record low for October. The study focuses on late summer minimum levels, which is what most affects animals and climate further south, Notz and Stroeve said.¶Notz and Stroeve calculated that if people put 1,000 billion more metric tons of carbon dioxide in the air, the Arctic will be free of sea ice for pretty much the entire month of September. At the current rate, that means in about 29 years, the Arctic will be ice free during that month.¶An increasing number of studies find a connection between shrinking sea ice in the Arctic and extreme weather, including the wandering polar vortex that brings frigid air south in the winter.¶“It’s not just that we care about polar bears and walruses,” Stroeve said. “We all depend on the ice being there for the climate to be the way it is.”",0
Global warming could turn southern Spain into a desert,"

    ","¶BERLIN — Southern Spain will become desert and deciduous forests will vanish from much of the Mediterranean basin unless global warming is reined in sharply, according to a study released Thursday.¶Researchers used historical data and computer models to forecast the likely impact of climate change on the Mediterranean region, based on the targets for limiting global warming 195 countries agreed to during a summit in France last year.¶“The Paris Agreement says it’s necessary to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), if possible 1.5 degrees,” Joel Guiot, a researcher at the National Center of Scientific Research in France who co-wrote the study, said. “That doesn’t seem much to people, but we wanted to see what the difference would be on a sensitive region like the Mediterranean.”¶The authors examined the environmental changes the Mediterranean has undergone during the last 10,000 years, using pollen records to gauge the effect that temperatures had on plant life.¶More in Climate Change¶They came up with four scenarios pegged to different concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Three of the scenarios are already widely used by scientists to model future climate change, while the fourth was designed to predict what would happen if global warming remains at or below 1.5 degrees Celsius this century.¶The fourth scenario is particularly ambitious because average global temperatures have already risen by 1 degree Celsius since pre-industrial times. It is, however, the only one under which Mediterranean basin ecosystems would remain within the range of changes seen in the past 10,000 years, the researchers found.¶At the other extreme – the scenario in which global warming hits 2 degrees – deserts would expand in Spain, North Africa and the Near East, while vegetation in the region would undergo a significant change from the coasts right up to the mountains, the study states.¶The region is considered a hotspot for biodiversity and its landscape also has long been cultivated by humans, making it a particularly interesting case study for the researchers, whose work was published online in the journal Science.¶“Climate has always been important there,” said Guiot, noting that numerous civilizations – from the ancient Egyptians to the Greeks and the Romans – emerged around the Mediterranean over the past millennia.¶While their demise probably resulted from social and political changes, climate conditions may have played a role in the past and could do so again in the future, he said.¶Current flows of migrants are being driven largely by political unrest, but prolonged periods of drought could spark mass migrations of people due to climate change, Guiot said.¶The researchers acknowledged that their study did not factor in the environmental impact of human activity in the Mediterranean basin. Some areas already are experiencing severe water shortages made worse by intensive agriculture and tree clearance.¶“If anything, human action will exacerbate what the study projects, and it could turn out to be too optimistic,” Guiot said.¶The Paris climate agreement comes into effect next week.",0

Last month’s average level at a key Hawaii monitoring station was 401 parts per million, up from 313 in 1958.¶U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Monday that the rise was fueled by El Niño, a weather pattern caused by the warming of the Pacific Ocean. El Niño leads to droughts in tropical regions and reduces the capacity of forests and oceans to absorb carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas blamed for global warming.¶More in Climate Change¶Methane and other heat-trapping gases are also spiking.

    ","¶The third and final presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton Wednesday night in Las Vegas covered a wide range of issues from abortion to foreign policy to the national debt, but there was one glaring omission — climate change. ¶Six months after world leaders signed the Paris Agreement, a sweeping accord designed to combat global warming, climate change was only brought up tangentially, in one brief moment, on the debate stage. It was mentioned early on as “a real issue” by Clinton in her answer to an unrelated question. Other than that, moderator Chris Wallace, of Fox News, did not pose any questions about climate policy and neither of the candidates brought up specific proposals about how they would handle the challenges it presents — despite this being a year of record-breaking temperatures, drought, and destructive storms. ¶On social media, some observers decried the absence of climate change discussion at any of this year’s debates. Paul Krugman of the New York Times called the oversight “really disgraceful.”¶So, four debates; four shout-outs by moderators to deficit scolds; not one question about climate change. It's really disgraceful.¶We're at the final question of the last debate and climate change has not come up in a serious way once. Criminal negligence. #debatenight¶It’s been 8 years since a debate question about climate change.¶This is bigger than individual moderators. @debates needs new leadership.¶Not a single presidential #debate asked a question about #climatechange, which touches all parts of running our country. Disgusting.¶Oddly enough, the closest question to touch on the issue of climate change came from the red sweater-wearing, meme-worthy audience member Ken Bone at the second presidential debate. An undecided voter, Bone asked the candidates, “What steps will your energy policy take to meet our energy needs while at the same time remaining environmentally friendly and minimizing job layoffs?”¶More in Campaign 2016¶In response, Trump said: “I will bring our energy companies back ... They’ll pay off our national debt. They’ll pay off our tremendous budget deficits, which are tremendous. But we are putting our energy companies out of business. We have to bring back our workers.” ¶Clinton specifically used the term “climate change” in her answer: “So I have a comprehensive energy policy, but it really does include fighting climate change, because I think that is a serious problem,” she said. “And I support moving toward more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can, because I think we can be the 21st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses.”¶Beyond that exchange, climate change has largely been left out of discussion.¶So, with less than three weeks to go until Election Day, where do the two candidates stand on climate change? Here’s an overview:¶Back in a January interview with Fox News, before he clinched the Republican nomination, Trump said, “Climate change is just a very, very expensive form of tax. A lot of people are making a lot of money. I know much about climate change.” ¶He added, “I often joke that this is done for the benefit of China — obviously I joke — but this is done for the benefit of China.” ¶On his official campaign website, Trump does not have a section focused on climate change listed under “Positions.” There is, however, a section on the candidate’s energy policy.¶The Trump campaign website says the presidential hopeful will “make America energy independent, create millions of new jobs, and protect clean air and clean water.” ¶It says he “will conserve our natural habitats, reserves and resources,” and “will unleash an energy revolution that will bring vast new wealth to our country.”¶Trump’s team writes that his administration would “rescind all job-destroying Obama executive actions,” including that “Mr. Trump will reduce and eliminate all barriers to responsible energy production, creating at least a half million jobs a year, $30 billion in higher wages and cheaper energy.”¶The word climate change appears nowhere on the page.¶Trump has previously suggested he considers global warming a hoax “created by and for the Chinese,” as he put it in an oft-referenced 2012 tweet. ¶The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.¶In March he also told The Washington Post that he is “not a big believer in man-made climate change.” ¶But despite his public skepticism, Trump applied for a permit to build a seawall next to his golf course and hotel in County Clare, Ireland, to prevent erosion, according to a Politico report from earlier this year. In his application, he included an environmental impact statement that mentions “global warming and its effects.” ¶Trump’s stance on climate change would make him unique among world leaders if elected. A study from The Sierra Club that compiled statements from leaders of 195 countries found that Trump would be the only head of state to declare climate change a hoax. ¶“I believe in science. I believe that climate change is real and that we can save our planet while creating millions of good-paying clean energy jobs,” Clinton said during her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in July. ¶On her official campaign website, Clinton has a section devoted to climate change under “Issues.” On the page, the campaign writes, “Climate change is an urgent threat and a defining challenge of our time. It threatens our economy, our national security, and our children’s health and futures.” ¶The page also states that the former secretary of state will “deliver on the pledge President Obama made at the Paris climate conference” and will not rely on “climate deniers in Congress to pass new legislation.” Her campaign says a Clinton administration would aim to “reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 30 percent in 2025 relative to 2005 levels and put the country on a path to cut emissions more than 80 percent by 2050.”¶Clinton would likely have a lot of high-level help in fulfilling Mr. Obama’s climate change initiatives, given that one of the key actors on climate in his administration was her own campaign chairman, John Podesta.¶Among the policies highlighted on the site, Clinton announces that she will launch a $60 billion “Clean Energy Challenge” that would partner with rural communities, states, and cities to cut carbon pollution “and expand clean energy, including for low-income families.” ¶""I believe that climate change is real and that we can save our planet while creating millions of good-paying clean energy jobs."" —Hillary¶Clinton supports cutting tax subsidies on oil and gas companies. ¶The campaign also says she would create an Environmental and Climate Justice Task Force to focus on the “health, economic, and environmental impacts of pollution and climate change in vulnerable communities.” ",0
Rising seas could threaten $1 billion Air Force radar site,"
","
October 18, 2016 / 4:48 PM
      / AP
    ","¶WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- The U.S. Air Force is spending nearly $1 billion to build a radar installation that will help keep astronauts and satellites safe by tracking pieces of space junk as small as a baseball. That is, if global warming doesn’t get in the way.¶The Space Fence is being constructed on a tiny atoll in the Marshall Islands that scientists say could be regularly swamped by rising seas within a couple of decades as a result of climate change. The salt water could play havoc with the equipment, the scientists say.¶And The Associated Press found that neither the military nor its contractor, Lockheed Martin, gave serious consideration to that threat when designing the installation and choosing a site, despite warnings from the island nation’s environmental agency.¶More in Climate Change¶The future “does not look good for a lot of these islands,” said Curt Storlazzi, an oceanographer with the U.S. Geological Survey who is leading a study at Kwajalein Atoll, where the Space Fence complex is being built.¶Dana Whalley, a civilian who is managing the Space Fence program, said that the radar installation has a projected lifespan of 25 years and that he doesn’t expect sea levels to rise enough over that period to cause a problem. But if necessary, he said, the base could take steps to improve its seawalls.¶Still, because of budget pressures, military equipment is often used well beyond its projected lifespan. In fact, a key part of the radar tracking system that the Space Fence replaces was built during the dawn of the space age and was badly outdated by the time it was shut down 50 years later in 2013.¶Midway between Hawaii and Australia, the Marshall Islands are specks of land that typically poke just a few feet above the Pacific Ocean, making them some of the world’s most vulnerable places to rising seas.¶The U.S. military has a longstanding connection to the islands. Bikini Atoll was used as a nuclear test site after World War II. Kwajalein Atoll, a battle site during the war, is now an Army base, a ballistic missile test site and an important part of the military’s space surveillance network.¶The growing problem of space debris was highlighted in 2009, when an old Russian satellite smashed into a commercial U.S. satellite, creating hundreds of pieces of orbiting junk. The 2013 movie “Gravity” dramatized the threat to astronauts, who need to be safe from debris whether they’re traveling on the International Space Station or in a rocket.¶Lockheed Martin won the $915 million Space Fence contract in 2014 and broke ground last year. When the radar system becomes operational in late 2018, it should increase the number of objects that can be tracked tenfold to about 200,000 and provide more precise information on their orbits.¶The Space Fence installation will include digital transmitters and receivers as well as power and cooling facilities. About 15 people will operate and maintain it around the clock.¶The military chose the Marshall Islands because the Space Fence works best near the equator. But it means the installation is being built just 10 feet above sea level, or the height of a basketball hoop.¶Storlazzi said his study explored the point at which storms will cause the sea to wash clear across an island, completely submerging it, at least once a year. He said that’s when an island will no longer be able to sustain most plant or animal life.¶He examined one island within Kwajalein Atoll and found that it will probably reach its tipping point within a few decades. He said the island on which the Space Fence is being built faces a similar threat.¶The flooding there will probably damage power cables, sewer lines and other electronics and hardware, he said. The seawater will erode land, he said, and eat away at everything from concrete to cars.¶“When you get to the point where water is going over the top of the island annually, it will affect a lot of daily life, whether it’s related to the Space Fence or other operations, like moving food around,” he said.¶The study, funded primarily by the Defense Department, has not yet been peer-reviewed or published. But it paints a much more dire future for the atoll than earlier studies.¶“We are talking the next couple of decades, not centuries, as previously thought,” Storlazzi said.¶He said his team studied the underwater contours of the islands and showed how coral reefs will become less effective as breakwaters when sea levels rise.¶The Marshall Islands base is among dozens of U.S. military sites threatened by climate change. A July report by the Union of Concerned Scientists analyzed 18 military installations along the U.S. East and Gulf coasts. It found that with just a moderate rise in sea levels, 16 could flood 100 times a year by 2050.¶Last October, strong winds and waves battered Kwajalein Atoll. Ferries were canceled and a dock was damaged, forcing the base to take the unprecedented step of hosting 845 Marshallese day workers overnight.¶Whalley said the military investigated threats, including ocean flooding, in an environmental assessment of the site before beginning construction. “The over-wash threat, if you will, is built into the government requirements of the site,” he said.¶Yet that 2014 assessment, which runs over 100 pages and addresses everything from sea turtles to the island’s archaeological history, makes no mention of climate change, noting only that the Space Fence would be able to withstand a small earthquake-generated tsunami.¶A single line reads: “Based on historical data, there are no anticipated issues with ocean tide and/or wave flooding.”¶Lockheed Martin did not investigate the issue either. Bruce Schafhauser, Lockheed’s program director for the Space Fence, said the Air Force asked it to design the system to withstand earthquakes but not rising seas.¶“We don’t have any insight into that,” Schafhauser said. “It has not been something that has been required from the Air Force.”¶Schafhauser said the responsibility for finding a suitable location for the installation fell to the military.¶The Marshall Islands Environmental Protection Authority wrote a response to the environmental assessment, describing the U.S. military’s overall treatment of the climate change threat to Kwajalein as “wholly inadequate.” It questioned whether the military was overstating the atoll’s elevation and criticized its reliance on historical data when the problem is rising seas, a more recent phenomenon.¶The military responded in its final report: “Detailed study of sea-level rise risks are beyond the scope of this document.”¶Since then, leaders from the Marshall Islands say they have been working with the U.S. to improve environmental standards and ensure climate effects are seriously addressed in future military projects.¶Whalley said he plans to find out more about the USGS research at Kwajalein.¶“It’s the first I’ve heard about the study,” he said. “When they give you a billion dollars, you tend to focus on getting the radar built.”",0
Earth had 16 straight months of record high temperatures,"

    ","¶WASHINGTON Earth’s 16-month sizzling streak of record high temperatures is finally over, according to one group of federal meteorologists.¶The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said last month’s 60.6 degrees was merely the second hottest September on record for the globe. That’s ever so slightly cooler – a few hundredths of a degree – than the record set in 2015. But it was quite a bit warmer – 1.6 degrees – than the 20th century average.¶Global average temperatures include both land and sea surface readings. And while oceans were cooling off a tad, global land temperatures in September still set a record high, NOAA climate scientist Jessica Blunden said. It was an unusually hot month in much of Europe, Asia, Africa and North America.¶More in Climate Change¶NASA, which averages global temperature differently, considers last month as record hot. But the space agency didn’t have a big consecutive hot streak because it didn’t consider last June as record hot.¶“It’s kind of nice to see it cool down a little bit even though it will go back up again,” Blunden said. “It may not be a record now because we have natural variations in weather and climate. There’s always going to be ups and downs but that doesn’t mean global warming isn’t happening.”¶The fact that despite the end of El Nino – a warming of the central Pacific that tends to spike global temperatures – the world came close to setting another heat record “is quite a feat and offers evidence that global climate change is contributing to these monthly records/near records,” University of Oklahoma meteorology professor Jason Furtado said in an email.¶The end of El Nino will “just give us a brief respite, since the global trend will continue mercilessly until we stop it by getting off fossil fuels,” said climate scientist Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute in Germany.¶Burning coal, oil and gas puts heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the air, a main contributor in climate change.¶Blunden said this year is still on pace to be the hottest on record, beating the mark set in 2014 and then broken last year. Meteorologists said three record hot years in a row would be unprecedented.¶Through September, this year is 1.6 degrees warmer than the 20th century average and nearly a quarter of a degree warmer than the first nine months of 2015.¶Records go back to 1880.",0
Powerful greenhouse gases in focus at global climate meeting,"
","
October 13, 2016 / 3:44 PM
      / AP
    ","¶JOHANNESBURG  Greenhouse gases that are more powerful than carbon dioxide are the focus of a global gathering this week in Africa. Experts say cutting hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, is the fastest way to reduce global warming. The United States is among the countries that want the world to quickly phase out the use of HFCs, and Secretary of State John Kerry is arriving Thursday to encourage a deal. Here’s a look at a potential global climate agreement that has been described by the Natural Resources Defense Council as “the world’s biggest climate protection achievement in the year after Paris.”¶It’s not about the ozone layer ¶The ozone layer has been healing for a while, thanks to the global agreement known as the Montreal Protocol. In 1987, countries alarmed by the discovery of a huge hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica signed the treaty to eventually end the use of chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, which at the time were used in refrigerators and aerosols like hair spray. ¶HFCs were introduced to replace CFCs, and scientists realized only later that they have a strong effect on global warming. Although HFCs don’t harm the ozone layer, their ability to trap the heat radiating off the Earth is hundreds or thousands of times more potent than that of carbon dioxide. ¶More in Climate Change¶The U.N. Environment Program says that reducing HFCs under the treaty could reduce global warming by .5-degree Celsius by the end of this century and environmental groups say the step is essential to meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change.¶Where the U.S. and China agree ¶The United States and China have their difficult issues, but the world’s two worst polluters have pushed to fight climate change. The two heavyweights agreed in 2013 to pursue a deal to phase out HFCs, which are used in air conditioners, refrigerators and insulating foams. The U.S. and China are urging the countries gathered this week in Kigali, Rwanda, to extend the Montreal Protocol to include HFCs. They also want agreement on an “early freeze date” for when countries must cap their use of them. The U.S. and India, the world’s third worst polluter, also have agreed to try to use the treaty to phase out the chemical.¶A threat as urgent as extremists? ¶HFCs have been called the world’s fastest-growing climate pollutants, though they are less plentiful than carbon dioxide. The growth comes as more people in developing countries make enough money to buy appliances. Last month, Kerry said HFCs currently emit as much pollution as 300 coal-fired power plants. At an international climate meeting in July for state parties to the Montreal Protocol, Kerry stressed the urgency of fighting climate change, saying it is as dangerous as the threat posed by ISIS and other extremist groups, if not more so.¶African, island states in a hurry¶Small island states and other countries, including many in Africa, that say they face the biggest threat from climate change are urging action on HFCs, and soon. At the July meeting by states parties to the treaty, many countries favored capping the growth of HFCs in 2021. China was said to prefer later in the decade, with India aiming at the end of it or beyond. Whatever the timing, less-developed countries are seeking help from richer ones to help them implement the treaty.",0

European Union ratifies landmark climate change deal,"

      / AP
    ","¶BRUSSELS  The European Union’s environment ministers on Friday approved the ratification of the landmark Paris climate change pact, paving the way for the agreement to take effect in November.¶“It’s really a historic result,” French Environment Minister Segolene Royal told reporters after the ministers agreed unanimously to ratify the deal at talks in Brussels, tweeting “Victory!” in delight.¶“It was not was a sure thing,” she added, given the different energy requirements and concerns among the EU’s 28 member nations.¶More in Climate Change¶After years of negotiations, governments agreed in Paris last December to curb emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that scientists say are warming the planet.¶More than 170 world leaders have signed the deal, but it won’t take effect until 55 countries, accounting for at least 55 percent of global emissions, have ratified or accepted it through their domestic procedures. Sixty-one parties have already ratified it but they only account for 48 percent of emissions.¶The EU’s ratification, which is expected to take about a month to complete, would take the Paris Agreement past the 55 percent threshold. The European Parliament is expected to approve it next week.¶The EU prides itself on being a leader in the fight against global warming, and it came under heavy criticism after the U.S. and China beat the bloc to enact the accord.¶The EU, which accounts for 12 percent of global emissions, originally planned to wait for its member states to approve the deal domestically, but given the slow pace of progress it is moving on their behalf. It is now almost certain the deal can enter into force at next U.N. climate conference, which starts Nov. 7 in Marrakech, Morocco.¶The environmental group Greenpeace welcomed the EU’s move.¶“While the formal ratification by all arms of the EU will take one or two weeks, it makes it almost certain that the historic agreement will enter into force within a year of its adoption in December 2015,” the group said.",0
"Study: Earth now the warmest it's been in 120,000 years","
","
September 26, 2016 / 4:39 PM
      / AP
    ","¶WASHINGTON  A new study paints a picture of an Earth that is warmer than it has been in about 120,000 years, and is locked into eventually hitting its hottest mark in more than 2 million years.¶As part of her doctoral dissertation at Stanford University, Carolyn Snyder, now a climate policy official at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, created a continuous 2 million year temperature record, much longer than a previous 22,000 year record. Snyder’s temperature reconstruction, published Monday in the journal Nature, doesn’t estimate temperature for a single year, but averages 5,000-year time periods going back a couple million years.¶Snyder based her reconstruction on 61 different sea surface temperature proxies from across the globe, such as ratios between magnesium and calcium, species makeup and acidity. But the further the study goes back in time, especially after half a million years, the fewer of those proxies are available, making the estimates less certain, she said.¶These are rough estimates with large margins of errors, she said. But she also found that the temperature changes correlated well to carbon dioxide levels.¶More in Climate Change¶Temperatures averaged out over the most recent 5,000 years – which includes the last 125 years or so of industrial emissions of heat-trapping gases – are generally warmer than they have been since about 120,000 years ago or so, Snyder found. And two interglacial time periods, the one 120,000 years ago and another just about 2 million years ago, were the warmest Snyder tracked. They were about 3.6 degrees warmer than the current 5,000-year average.¶With the link to carbon dioxide levels​ and taking into account other factors and past trends, Snyder calculated how much warming can be expected in the future.¶Snyder said if climate​ factors are the same as in the past – and that’s a big if – Earth is already committed to another 7 degrees or so of warming over the next few thousand years.¶“This is based on what happened in the past,” Snyder said. “In the past it wasn’t humans messing with the atmosphere.”¶Scientists give various reasons for past changes in carbon dioxide and heat levels, including regular slight shifts in Earth’s​ orbital tilt.¶Four outside scientists praised the study’s tracking of past temperatures, with caveats about how less certain it is as it gets deeper in the past. Jeremy Shakun of Boston College said “Snyder’s work is a great contribution and future work should build on it.”¶But many of the same scientists said Snyder’s estimate of future warming seems too high. Shakun called it unrealistic and not matching historical time periods of similar carbon dioxide levels​.¶A fifth scientist, Michael Mann of Pennsylvania State University, called the study provocative and interesting but said he remains skeptical until more research confirms it. He found the future temperature calculations “so much higher than prevailing estimates that one has to consider it somewhat of an outlier.”",0
Study: U.S. falling short on pollution-cutting goal,"
","
September 26, 2016 / 2:19 PM
      / AP
    ","¶WASHINGTON Unless it does more, the United States probably will fall short of goals set under last year’s Paris agreement to dramatically reduce emissions of heat-trapping gases, according to a new study.¶The U.S. pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions in 2025 by 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels. But taking into account current efforts by state and local governments, the nation will only reach about four-fifths of that goal, according to a study in Monday’s issue of Nature Climate Change.¶Looking at all types of greenhouse gases from energy and other sources- carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and various fluorocarbons -  two scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Lab figure the U.S. will have to cut about 1,660 million tons of annual emissions. But current, proposed and even less concrete policies would only reduce about 1,330 million tons, leaving a gap around 330 million tons, they calculated.¶More in Climate Change¶The statistics have large margins of errors of plus or minus of hundreds of million tons.¶“We can’t get there with our current set of policies,” said study lead author Jeffrey Greenblatt, a senior scientist at the national lab. “We would fall short of the target if there is no further action.”¶That doesn’t mean that the U.S. can’t reach its goal, it’s just it has to do more and it can, Greenblatt said. He said he was optimistic that with more action the U.S. could come close to the 26 percent goal, if not achieve it.¶The biggest reduction that Greenblatt and his colleague Max Wei calculate would come from the Obama administration’s clean power plan that would cut carbon pollution from power plants, mostly coal. But that plan is on hold in the courts. If it doesn’t go into effect, it will be even harder for the U.S. to reach its Paris goal, Greenblatt said. It’s also a policy that Republicans, including Donald Trump, have vowed to repeal if they win.¶Greenblatt and Wei have counted on gains from that policy, but it’s still not enough.¶So how could the U.S. get to its goal? Greenblatt and Wei briefly looked at a dozen possible ways, but none of them individually would bring huge reductions.¶“I think it’s going to be a variety of smallish efforts to get there,” Greenblatt said.¶By looking at sectors besides energy, and at all greenhouse gases - not just carbon dioxide, which has fallen dramatically because of a switch from coal power to natural gas for electricity, mostly because of lower gas prices - Greenblatt’s reaches conclusions that are less optimistic than some advanced by others.¶Six outside experts said the study’s conclusions are both correct and not surprising.¶Even if the courts uphold the Obama power plan, the delay makes it more difficult to cut carbon pollution in time, said MIT management professor John Sterman, who also founded a program that models climate emissions and goals. And the low cost of gasoline is prompting more driving, making it harder to reduce pollution.¶“The U.S., states and cities will need to adopt more ambitious policies and soon to be able to fulfill our commitment under the Paris agreement,” Sterman wrote in an email. But he said what is even more important is that the Paris deal “is not strong enough.”¶“To avoid the worst consequences of climate change, the U.S. and an all nations must cut emissions sooner and by more than called for under the Paris agreement,” Sterman wrote. “There’s simply no time to lose.”¶Nigel Purvis, a top environmental diplomat in the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations and president of the non-governmental organization Climate Advisers , said that’s why the U.S. goals are ambitious: “We didn’t know how to get to the moon when JFK declared the moonshot but we worked hard, innovated and succeeded. The next administration will need to do the same to make sure the United States meets its climate goals.”",0
"2016's hellish summer weather: A ""told-you-so"" climate moment?","
","
September 20, 2016 / 6:40 PM
      / AP
    ","¶WASHINGTON This summer’s weather was relentless and hellish, crowded with the type of record-smashing extremes that scientists have long warned about.¶The season ends Wednesday, and not a moment too soon. Summer featured floods that killed hundreds of people and caused more than $50 billion in losses around the globe, from Louisiana and West Virginia to China, India, Europe and the Sudan. Meanwhile, droughts parched croplands and wildfires burned from California to Canada to China and India. Toss in unrelenting record heat.¶From June to August, there were at least 10 different weather disasters that each caused more than $1 billion in losses, according to insurance industry tallies . With summer weather now seemingly stretching from May to September, extreme weather in that span killed well more than 2,000 people. And that’s without a major hurricane​ hitting a big U.S. city, although the Pacific had its share of deadly and costly storms, among them Typhoon Nepartak, which killed 111 people in Asia.¶More in Climate Change¶“It is representing I think a notch up for the impacts we have had to deal with,” U.S. National Weather Service​ Director Louis Uccellini said. “We’ve experienced an increasing number and a disturbing number of weather extremes this summer.”¶While flooding made the news, the “sneaky” thing about the summer was heat that did not even ease at night, said Deke Arndt, climate​ monitoring chief at the federal National Centers for Environmental Information in Asheville, North Carolina. When temperatures drop to below 72 degrees at night it allows the body to recharge, plants to grow and air conditioners to be shut off. But this year that didn’t happen enough.¶The U.S. as a nation set a record for the hottest nighttime temperatures on average this summer, Arndt said. Tallahassee, Florida, for example, went 74 consecutive days where the nighttime temperature didn’t dip below 72.¶From May 1 to Sept. 12, nearly 15,000 daily records for warmest nighttime lows were set in the United States, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration​ data.¶“This is one of the clearest signals we expect for climate change​,” said Mark Bove, a New Jersey-based senior research meteorologist for re-insurance giant Munich RE, which tracks natural disasters . “It keeps a blanket on you particularly at night. We cannot radiate the heat away at night as the planet used to.”¶While records were broken, the summer has “been more notable for the consistency of the heat than individual high-impact heatwaves,” said Blair Trewin of the Australian Bureau of Meteorology and the World Meteorological Organization.¶For example, Savannah, Georgia, had a record 69 days in a row of 90 degrees or higher.¶Twelve U.S. cities had their warmest​ summers ever, including Las Vegas, New Orleans, Cleveland and Detroit. The globe had its hottest month on record (July) and hottest summer on record. August was the 16th consecutive month Earth set a monthly heat record, according to NOAA.¶Temperatures of 129 degrees were recorded in Mitribah, Kuwait, and Basra, Iraq. If verified, these would be not only the hottest temperatures recorded for Asia, but the hottest recorded outside a much-debated record in Death Valley, according to weather historians.¶The extra heat - both in the air and oceans - puts significantly extra moisture in the air, which then comes down as more extreme downpours, said Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. And when an area is already dry, droughts worsen because warmer air takes more water out of the ground, like “levying a larger tax on the plants and soil moisture,” Arndt said.¶Baton Rouge and South Bend had their wettest summers, while Boston and Jacksonville had their driest summers.¶Climate scientists say what’s happened pretty much fits with what they’ve been saying would occur as the world warms. For most of the extreme events, they haven’t done the precise and detailed studies that can show that man-made climate change​ is to blame for certain extreme weather events. But they did do that for the Louisiana flooding, which NOAA​ said had its chances boosted by 40 percent because of heat-trapping gasses.¶NASA​ chief climate scientist Gavin Schmidt said the records keep showing the planet warming and “since we kind of predicted these things we know what we’re talking about.”¶Perhaps the most noticeable case of this being predicted was in a 1988 study by James Hansen, Schmidt’s predecessor as head of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies .¶In that study, using what scientists now call a crude computer model, Hansen forecast what would likely happen to Earth’s climate​. With one of his scenarios, Hansen not only got the global temperature rise about right, he forecast big changes in the number of days when the overnight temperatures would not go below 75 and the daytime highs would exceed 95 in four cities by the 2010s.¶He was right - or underestimated how hot it would be - in six of eight categories.¶“The fact it’s come out with more or less around what was predicted is not surprising,” Hansen said. “The summer is when things show up easiest because the natural variability is the least in the summer. You notice the change more readily in the warm season.”",0
Paris climate deal expected to receive major boost at the United Nations,"

    ","¶STOCKHOLM — At least 20 countries are expected to formally join the Paris Agreement on climate change this week, greatly improving the pact’s chances of coming into force just a year after it was negotiated in the French capital, U.N. officials say.¶That’s considered a blistering pace in the world of international diplomacy, reflecting a sense of urgency in the fight against global warming and a desire to seal the deal before the Obama administration leaves office.¶Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Morocco are expected to hand over documents at the U.N. in New York on Wednesday to formally complete the ratification process. At least half a dozen small island nations including Papua New Guinea, Tonga and Kiribati will also follow suit.¶More in Climate Change¶“We are ready. We will announce it in New York,” Moroccan Environment Minister Hakima el-Haite told The Associated Press.¶After years of negotiations, governments agreed in Paris last December to curb the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that scientists say are warming the planet.¶More than 170 world leaders have signed the deal, but it won’t take effect until 55 countries accounting for at least 55 percent of global emissions have ratified or accepted it through their domestic procedures. That was initially expected to take several years, but 28 countries accounting for 39 percent of emissions are already done, including China and the United States, the world’s top two greenhouse gas emitters.¶U.S. diplomats are now pushing other countries to accelerate their ratification efforts so that the deal can enter into force this year. The White House says President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry plan to corner foreign leaders in the hallways during the U.N. gathering to personally pressure them to join this week.¶“We’re very anxious to have it move forward quickly,” U.S. climate envoy Jonathan Pershing told the AP. “We are talking to everybody about the urgency.”¶It’s possible that more than 55 countries will have joined by the end of Wednesday. It will likely take a bit longer to reach 55 percent of world emissions.¶Pershing said the haste comes down to the fact that “this is a problem that can’t wait.”¶Others say another factor is the potential of a shift in U.S. climate policy depending on the outcome of the presidential election in November. Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton has said the U.S. must implement the Paris Agreement, but Republican candidate Donald Trump has said he will cancel the deal.¶“The Obama administration clearly would like to see this done before they leave office,” said Alden Meyer, a veteran observer of the U.N. climate talks at the Union of Concerned Scientists.¶“That doesn’t guarantee that the next president will fully implement Paris,” Meyer said. “But it would take at least four years for the U.S. to formally withdraw.”¶The Paris Agreement asks both rich and poor countries to take action to curb the rise in global temperatures that is melting glaciers, raising sea levels and shifting rainfall patterns across the globe. It requires governments to present national plans to reduce emissions, though the targets themselves aren’t internationally binding.¶The European Union, which considers itself as one of the architects of the Paris deal, is trying to fast-track its ratification process to avoid the embarrassment of sitting on the sidelines when it comes into force.¶The EU, which accounts for 12 percent of global emissions, originally planned to wait for its 28 member states to approve the deal domestically, but now wants to ratify it on their behalf.¶“It’s technically possible,” said Anna-Kaisa Itkonen, a spokeswoman for EU Climate Commissioner Miguel Arias Canete. “But politically it’s a decision of the member states.”¶With or without the EU, there’s a chance that the deal can enter into force as early as the next U.N. climate conference, which starts Nov. 7 in Marrakech, Morocco.¶U.N. officials said last week that at least 20 countries had indicated they would join on Wednesday and that they were “absolutely certain” that the deal will come into force this year.¶For some the timing is mostly symbolic, because the first round of emissions targets doesn’t start until 2020. For others, like the island nations who face an existential risk from rising seas, it’s imperative that countries prepare to implement - and improve - their targets as soon as possible.¶“We cannot wait,” said Maldives Environment Minister Thoriq Ibrahim, who chairs an alliance of small island states. “We are at the forefront of climate change and we are the people who will suffer if there is no action taken early.”",0
"California law targets greenhouse gases from cows, landfills","
","
September 19, 2016 / 5:27 PM
      / AP
    ","¶SACRAMENTO, Calif. Gov. Jerry Brown signed a bill Monday that regulates for the first time greenhouse-gas emissions tied to dairy cows and landfills, an escalation of California’s efforts to fight climate change beyond carbon-based gases to include methane and other pollutants.¶The move by the Democratic governor targets a category of gases known as short-lived climate pollutants, which have an outsize effect on global warming despite their relatively short life in the atmosphere. Environmentalists hope that tackling short-lived pollutants now would buy time to develop new and more affordable technology to reduce carbon emissions.¶The legislation will require steep reductions in a variety of pollutants, including methane; HFC gases used in aerosols and air conditioning refrigerants; and soot, known as black carbon. It’s tied to $90 million in funding for the dairy industry and garbage collectors.¶More in Climate Change¶“This bill curbs these dangerous pollutants and thereby protects public health and slows climate change,” Brown said in a statement.¶Republicans said the strict regulations will hurt agricultural businesses, despite concessions made to dairy farmers.¶They will be required to reduce methane emissions from manure to 40 percent below their 2013 levels by 2030, with the help of $50 million from the state’s fee charged to polluters, known as cap-and-trade.¶The money will help a handful of them buy dairy digesters, which use methane from manure to generate energy that’s sold to electrical utilities.¶The legislation also allows the Air Resources Board to regulate cow flatulence if there’s viable technology​ to reduce it.¶Lawmakers approved the measure on the last day of the legislative session after Brown negotiated a compromise with dairy farmers, some environmental groups and the bill’s author, Democratic Sen. Ricardo Lara of Bell Gardens, almost exclusively with Democratic support.¶“With these bold and ambitious goals, we’ll continue to set the standard for climate policy​ worldwide,” Lara said in a statement.¶While some environmental groups​ supported the legislation, others were angry that Brown and Lara made concessions to ease the transition for the dairy industry, including postponing mandates until 2024.¶The new law also pushes for a significant increase in composting to reduce organic waste, which emits methane when it breaks down in landfills. It calls for a boost of 50 percent within four years.",0
Wave-powered electricity makes U.S. debut in Hawaii,"
","
September 19, 2016 / 1:17 PM
      / AP
    ","¶KANEOHE BAY, Hawaii In the waters off the coast of Hawaii, a tall buoy bobs and sways in the water, using the rise and fall of the waves to generate electricity.¶The current travels through an undersea cable for a mile to a military base, where it is fed into Oahu’s power grid - the first wave-produced electricity to go online in the U.S.¶By some estimates, the ocean’s endless motion packs enough power to meet a quarter of America’s energy needs and dramatically reduce the nation’s reliance on oil, gas and coal. But wave energy technology lags well behind wind and solar power, with important technical hurdles still to be overcome.¶More in Climate Change¶To that end, the Navy has established a test site in Hawaii, with hopes the technology can someday be used to produce clean, renewable power for offshore fueling stations for the fleet and provide electricity to coastal communities in fuel-starved places around the world.¶“More power from more places translates to a more agile, more flexible, more capable force,” Joseph Bryan, deputy assistant secretary of the Navy, said during an event at the site. “So we’re always looking for new ways to power the mission.”¶Hawaii would seem a natural site for such technology. As any surfer can tell you, it is blessed with powerful waves. The island state also has the highest electricity costs in the nation - largely because of its heavy reliance on oil delivered by sea - and has a legislative mandate to get 100 percent of its energy from renewables by 2045.¶Still, it could be five to 10 years before wave energy technology can provide an affordable alternative to fossil fuels, experts say.¶For one thing, developers are still working to come up with the best design. Some buoys capture the up-and-down motion of the waves, while others exploit the side-to-side movement. Industry experts say a machine that uses all the ocean’s movements is most likely to succeed.¶Also, the machinery has to be able to withstand powerful storms, the constant pounding of the seas and the corrosive effects of saltwater.¶“The ocean is a really hard place to work,” said Patrick Cross, specialist at the Hawaii Natural Energy Institute at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, which helps run the Hawaii test site. “You’ve got to design something that can stay in the water for a long time but be able to survive.”¶The U.S. has set a goal of reducing carbon emissions by one-third from 2005 levels by 2030, and many states are seeking to develop more renewable energy in the coming decades.¶Jose Zayas, a director of the Wind and Water Power Technologies Office at the U.S. Department of Energy, which helps fund the Hawaii site, said the U.S. could get 20 to 28 percent of its energy needs from waves off the U.S. coasts without encroaching on sensitive waters such as marine preserves.¶“When you think about all of the states that have water along their coasts ... there’s quite a bit of wave energy potential,” he said.¶Wave energy technology is at about the same stage as the solar and wind industries were in the 1980s. Both received substantial government investment and tax credits that helped them become energy sources cheap enough to compete with fossil fuels.¶But while the U.S. government and military have put about $334 million into marine energy research over the last decade, Britain and the rest of Europe have invested more than $1 billion, according to the Marine Energy Council, a trade group.¶“We’re about, I’d say, a decade behind the Europeans,” said Alexandra De Visser, the Navy’s Hawaii test site project manager.¶The European Marine Energy Centre in Scotland, for example, has 14 grid-connected berths that have housed dozens of wave and tidal energy devices from around the world over the past 13 years, and Wave Hub in England has several such berths. China, too, has been building and testing dozens of units at sea.¶Though small in scale, the test project near Kaneohe Bay represents the vanguard of U.S. wave energy development. It consists of two buoys anchored a half-mile to a mile off the coast.¶One of them, the Azura, which stands 12 feet above the surface and extends 50 feet below, converts the waves’ vertical and horizontal movements into up to 18 kilowatts of electricity, enough for about a dozen homes. The company working with the Navy, Northwest Energy Innovations of Portland, Oregon, plans a version that can generate at least 500 kilowatts, or enough to power hundreds of homes.¶The other buoy, a 50-foot-wide, doughnut-shaped device called the Lifesaver, was developed by a Norwegian company. The 3-foot-tall ring is anchored to the ocean floor with cables; when the buoy is moved by the sea, the cables move, turning the wheels of a generator. It is producing on average of just 4 kilowatts but is capable of generating more.¶Test sites run by other researchers are being planned or expanded in Oregon and California to take advantage of the powerful waves that pound the West Coast. One of those projects, Cal Wave, run by California Polytechnic State University, hopes to provide utility-scale power to Vandenberg Air Force Base.¶The Hawaii buoys are barely noticeable from shore without binoculars, but developers envision dozens of machines working all at once, an idea that could run into the same kind of opposition that wind turbines have faced from environmentalists, fishermen and tourist groups.¶“Putting 200 machines on the North Shore of Oahu within a mile or two off the coast might be difficult, said Steve Kopf, CEO of Northwest Energy Innovations. “Nobody wants to look out and see wind turbines or wave machines off the coast.”",0
"""No evidence of recovery"" as Arctic sea ice sinks to near record lows","

    ","¶WASHINGTON — Arctic sea ice this summer shrank to its second lowest level since scientists started to monitor it by satellite, with scientists saying it is another ominous signal of global warming.¶The National Snow and Ice Data Center in Colorado said the sea ice reached its summer low point on Saturday, extending 1.6 million square miles. That’s behind only the mark set in 2012, 1.31 million square miles.¶Center director Mark Serreze said this year’s level technically was 3,800 square miles less than 2007, but that’s so close the two years are essentially tied.¶More in Climate Change¶Even though this year didn’t set a record, “we have reinforced the overall downward trend. There is no evidence of recovery here,” Serreze said. “We’ve always known that the Arctic is going to be the early warning system for climate change. What we’ve seen this year is reinforcing that.”¶This year’s minimum level is nearly 1 million square miles smaller than the 1979 to 2000 average. That’s the size of Alaska and Texas combined.¶“It’s a tremendous loss that we’re looking at here,” Serreze said.¶It was an unusual year for sea ice in the Arctic, Serreze said. In the winter, levels were among their lowest ever for the cold season, but then there were more storms than usual over the Arctic during the summer. Those storms normally keep the Arctic cloudy and cooler, but that didn’t keep the sea ice from melting this year, he said.¶“Summer weather patterns don’t matter as much as they used to, so we’re kind of entering a new regime,” Serreze said.¶Serreze said he wouldn’t be surprised if the Arctic was essentially ice free in the summer by 2030, something that will affect international security.¶“The trend is clear and ominous,” National Center for Atmospheric Research senior scientist Kevin Trenberth said in an email.  “This is indeed why the polar bear is a poster child for human-induced climate change, but the effects are not just in the Arctic.”¶One recent theory divides climate scientists: Melting sea ice in the Arctic may change the jet stream and weather further south, especially in winter.¶“What happens in the Arctic doesn’t stay in the Arctic,” Pennsylvania State University climate scientist Michael Mann said. “It looks increasingly likely that the dramatic decrease in Arctic sea ice is impacting weather in mid-latitudes and may be at least partly responsible for the more dramatic, persistent and damaging weather anomalies we’ve seen so many of in recent years.”",0
Americans willing to pay to fight climate change (but only a little),"

      / AP
    ","¶WASHINGTON Most Americans are willing to pay a little more each month to fight global warming - but only a tiny bit, according to a new poll. Still, environmental policy experts hail that as a hopeful sign.¶Seventy-one percent want the federal government to do something about global warming, including 6 percent who think the government should act even though they are not sure that climate change is happening, according to a poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago.¶And those polled said they’d be willing to foot a little of that cost in higher electric bills.¶More in Climate Change¶If the cost of fighting climate change is only an additional $1 a month, 57 percent of Americans said they would support that. But as that fee goes up, support for it plummets. At $10 a month, 39 percent were in favor and 61 percent opposed. At $20 a month, the public is more than 2-to-1 against it. And only 1-in-5 would support $50 a month.¶“I feel we need to make small sacrifices - and money is a small sacrifice - to make life better for future generations, “ said Sarah Griffin, a 63-year-old retired teacher in central Pennsylvania. “Surely I have enough money to spend on something that’s worthwhile.”¶Greg Davis, a 27-year-old post-graduate student in Columbus, Ohio, agreed: “It’s far more important to protect the environment than to save money. I think that’s true for businesses as well as individuals.”¶That a majority is willing to pay more is a new phenomenon, said Tom Dietz, professor of sociology and environmental science and policy at Michigan State University.¶“While the amounts may seem small, the willingness to take action, even if there are some out-of-pocket costs, is encouraging,” Dietz said in an email.¶Dana Fisher, director of the Program for Society and the Environment at the University of Maryland, said it’s noteworthy that a majority was “willing to pay at all,” and added that the levels of support for $10 a month and $20 a month are significant.¶But so was the opposition to higher costs.¶James Osadzinski, 52 of Rockford, Illinois, said simply: “I have a set budget. I don’t have the money,” while for 26-year-old nurse Marina Shertzer of Pensacola, Florida, it doesn’t make sense because she doesn’t see climate change as a threat, but something cyclical and normal.¶Of those polled, 77 percent said climate change is happening, 13 percent weren’t sure, and only 10 percent said it wasn’t happening.¶There remains a partisan divide in how Americans view climate change. While 84 percent of Democrats and 55 percent of independents view global warming as a fact and a problem that the government needs to address, only 43 percent for Republicans agree. And 18 percent of Republicans said they think climate change is happening but don’t think the government should address the issue.¶Slightly more than half of Americans - 54 percent - said they approved of Obama administration rules to cut pollution from coal power plants​, the biggest emitter of heat-trapping carbon dioxide. When the question also mentions that thousands of jobs may be eliminated while reducing coal use by one-third, only 45 percent favor the policy; 29 percent are opposed.¶Last December, 190 nations in the world signed an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions​. Two-thirds of those polled were at least moderately confident that the United States could meet its obligations. But about the same number of Americans weren’t that sure that China​ - the No. 1 polluter - and India could meet their goals.¶Davis, the Ohio student, wasn’t very optimistic about the future¶“I think as the younger generation starts displacing the older people, I think we’ll get somewhere,” he said. “But I’m afraid that may be too late.”¶The AP-NORC poll of 1,096 adults was conducted Aug. 11-14 using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 3.6 percentage points.¶The survey was paid for by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago.¶Respondents were first selected randomly using address-based sampling methods, and later interviewed online or by phone.",0

    ","¶It’s a bleak revelation — a new study reveals that about a tenth of the Earth’s wilderness has been lost since the 1990s. Over the last 20 years, a total area half the size of the Amazon and twice the size of Alaska has been depleted. ¶The researchers behind the study, published in the journal Current Biology, say they hope that the sobering revelation that rich natural habitats like the Amazon have been decimated in a relatively short amount of time will act as a wakeup call to global leaders to emphasize conservation efforts in their environmental protection policies.¶When asked why these important, at-risk areas haven’t been better protected, study lead author James Watson points the finger at government leaders around the world.¶“Put simply — no international treaty talks about the importance of wilderness or has any targets that nations must follow that limit their (wilderness areas’) loss,” Watson, an associate professor at the University of Queensland in Australia, wrote in an email to CBS News. ¶More in Climate Change¶The study shows that, right now, only about 23 percent of the world’s land area remains wilderness. The majority of this wilderness is found in North Asia, North Africa, Australia, and North America (primarily in northern Canada). Since the 1990s, the area that has witnessed the most wilderness loss has been South America, which has seen a 30 percent decline. Africa follows, with a 14 percent decrease in wilderness area.¶“The wilderness decline around the world is most in the tropical biomes​, the tropical rain forests​ have lost a lot of wilderness,” study co-author Oscar Venter, of the University of Northern British Columbia, told CBS News. “A lot of the Amazon has been lost, the mangrove ecosystems, which are really important wilderness areas have been hit. They are a nursery ground for a lot of the world’s wildlife — young fish are reared in these mangrove ecosystems​, they are a base for a lot of the fisheries. Now, there is almost no wilderness left in the mangroves.”¶They key is protect what is left. Watson stressed that people all over the world need to safeguard natural habitats that remain and “restore those areas that can still hold viable populations of some species.” ¶Venter praised “grassroots movements” for raising awareness of the wilderness’s importance. ¶“What can happen in the near-term is to encourage major policy mechanisms to actually speak to wilderness values and wilderness protection. Speak to your local officials, make sure you can set values on wilderness preservation​ that can occur through actual policy, where we set targets for wilderness protection areas,” Venter added.¶Watson said that it is crucial to keep clear that deforestation, pollution, the impacts of climate change​​ — all of the various factors that contribute to habitat loss ultimately have a negative effect on future generations. ¶These wilderness areas and accompanying wildlife could be lost for good, ultimately impacting the communities that depend on these natural resources, Venter said.¶“These areas really are the refuges for many threatened
species. A lot of the biodiversity​ around us is driven into the wilderness areas
that is where they persist, this is why conservation is important,” Venter asserted. “I’m thinking about the
world’s most economically and politically marginalized people — a lot of them are
living in and using these wilderness areas. For the poorest most marginalized people on the
planet, the wilderness is crucial to their lives.”",0
California to extend nation's most ambitious climate change law,"
","
September 8, 2016 / 3:53 PM
      / AP
    ","¶LOS ANGELES — Gov. Jerry Brown is set to extend the nation’s most ambitious climate change law by another 10 years on Thursday as California charts a new goal to reduce carbon pollution.¶The Democratic governor chose an urban natural park on the edge of downtown Los Angeles as the setting to sign the legislation, SB32, into law.¶The bill expands on California’s landmark 2006 law, which set the goal of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. The state is set to meet or exceed that benchmark, Brown said, with steps including restricting the carbon content of gasoline and diesel fuel, encouraging sales of zero-emission vehicles and imposing a tax on pollution.¶The new measure by Sen. Fran Pavley, D-Agoura Hills, sets a new goal of reducing emissions 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030, which Brown called the most aggressive target enacted by any government in North America.¶More in Climate Change¶He says the ultimate goal is to cut climate-warming pollution by 80 percent under 1990 levels by 2050, though legislation that would have enacted that target was watered down.¶Supporters overcame strong opposition from oil companies and other industry interests to pass the bill a year after business-friendly Democrats in the Assembly derailed an even more ambitious proposal to limit the use of oil in the state. Republicans say California’s efforts have raised consumer costs without noticeably affecting global emissions.¶Brown told a gathering a day earlier in Sacramento that critics have long tried to scuttle reforms by saying they aren’t feasible.¶“It wasn’t too many years ago that our electric utilities said they could not get to 20 percent renewable electricity,” Brown told a meeting hosted by the California Independent System Operator, which oversees the state’s power grid. “Well, this month it’s been over 26 percent. They said they couldn’t get there by 2020. Now, they’re all saying – all the major privately owned utilities – they can get to 50 percent by 2030.”¶Brown also plans to sign another bill, AB197, by Assemblyman Eduardo Garcia, D-Coachella, that provides more legislative oversight of the appointed Air Resources Board, which is responsible for implementing the law, and gives aid to poorer areas that lawmakers say have suffered the most harm from climate change​​.¶The governor, who has traveled the world promoting greenhouse-gas reduction efforts, issued an executive order last year setting the 2030 goals contained in SB32.¶But his signing leaves in jeopardy the state’s best-known emissions reduction measure. The California Chamber of Commerce has a pending legal challenge to the tax on carbon known as cap-and-trade, which requires polluters to buy permits to emit greenhouse gases​. The last two permit sales also have fizzled.¶The chamber warned that SB32 will require severe new restrictions that could make the state’s energy supply less affordable.",0
"U.S., China formally enter climate change deal","

    ","¶HANGZHOU, China -- Setting aside their cyber and
maritime disputes, President Obama and China’s
President Xi Jinping on Saturday sealed their nations’ participation in last
year’s Paris climate change agreement. They hailed their new era of climate
cooperation as the best chance for saving the planet.¶At a ceremony on the sidelines of a
global economic summit, Mr. Obama and Xi, representing the world’s two biggest carbon
emitters, delivered a series of documents to U.N. Secretary-General Ban
Ki-moon. The papers certified the U.S. and China have taken the necessary steps to join
the Paris accord that set nation-by-nation targets for cutting carbon
emissions.¶“This is not a fight that any one
country, no matter how powerful, can take alone,” Mr. Obama said of the pact.
“Some day we may see this as the moment that we finally decided to save
our planet.”¶Xi, speaking through a translator,
said he hoped other countries would follow suit and advance new technologies to
help them meet their targets. “When the old path no longer takes us far,
we should turn to innovation,” he said.¶More in Climate Change¶The formal U.S.-Chinese announcement
means the accord could enter force by the end of the year, a faster than
anticipated timeline.¶The Paris
deal is the world’s first comprehensive climate agreement, but it will only
come into force legally after it is ratified by at least 55 countries, CBS
Radio News reporter Shannon Van Sant reports from Hong Kong. China’s efforts are
cruical to the fight against climate change. It is the world’s biggest polluter
and responsible for about 25 percent of global carbon emissions.¶The nations that have joined must also
produce at least 55 percent of global emissions. Together, the U.S. and China produce 38 percent
of the world’s man-made carbon dioxide emissions.¶The White House has attributed the
accelerated pace to an unlikely partnership between Washington and Beijing. To
build momentum for a deal, they set a 2030 deadline for China’s emissions to stop rising and
announced their “shared conviction that climate change is one of the
greatest threats facing humanity.” The U.S. has pledged to cut its
emissions by at least 26 percent over the next 15 years, compared to 2005
levels.¶The meeting of the minds on climate
change, however, hasn’t smoothed the path for other areas of tension. The U.S.
has criticized China
over cyberhacking and human rights and voiced increased exasperation with Beijing’s
growing assertiveness in key waterways in the region. Most recently, the U.S.
has urged China to
accept an international arbitration panel’s ruling that sided with the
Philippines in a dispute over claims in the South China Sea.¶China
views the South China
Sea as an integral part of its national territory. The U.S. doesn’t take
positions in the various disputes between China and its Asian neighbors, but is
concerned about freedom of navigation and wants conflicts resolved peacefully
and lawfully.¶Meeting Xi after the climate
announcement, Mr. Obama
said thornier matters would be discussed.¶The ceremony opened what is likely Mr.
Obama’s
valedictory tour in Asia. The president stepped off Air Force One onto a red
carpet, where an honor guard dressed in white and carrying bayonets lined his
path. A young girl presented Mr. Obama with flowers and he shook hands with officials before
entering his motorcade.¶But the welcome didn’t go entirely
smoothly. A Chinese official kept reporters and some top White House aides away
from the president, prompting a U.S. official to intervene. The Chinese
official then yelled: “This is our country. This is our airport.”¶Throughout his tenure, Mr. Obama has sought to
check China’s
influence in Asia by shifting U.S. military resources and diplomatic attention
from the Middle East. The results have been mixed.¶The Trans-Pacific Partnership, a
massive trade deal the White House calls a cornerstone of the policy, is stuck
in Congress. Mr. Obama
planned to use the trip to make the case for approval of the deal before he
leaves office.¶Climate represents a more certain
piece of his legacy.¶Under the Paris Agreement, countries
are required to set national targets for reducing or reining in their
greenhouse gas emissions. Those targets aren’t legally binding, but countries
must report on their progress and update their targets every five years.¶The state-run Xinhua News Agency
reported Saturday that China’s
legislature had voted to formally enter the agreement. In the U.S., no Senate ratification
is required because it is not considered a formal treaty.¶Li Shuo, Greenpeace’s senior climate
policy adviser, called Saturday’s declarations “a very important next
step.”¶If the deal clears the final hurdles,
he said, “we’ll have a truly global climate agreement that will bind the
two biggest emitters in the world.”",0
Cool clothes! Engineers create fabric for a warmer world,"
","
September 2, 2016 / 11:13 AM
      / AP
    ","¶WASHINGTON — Engineers have created clothing for a warming world - a fabric that allows your body heat to escape far better than other materials do.¶It hasn’t been worn or tested by humans, so outside experts caution this is far from a sure thing, but a team at Stanford University engineered a fabric using nano technology that not only allows moisture to leave the body better, but helps infrared radiation escape better. As a result, they say in Thursday’s journal Science, the body should feel around 4.8 degrees cooler than cotton and 3.8 degrees chillier than commercially available synthetics.¶This is designed for a warmer world - not just because climate change is making temperatures hotter, but because it takes a lot of energy to heat and cool people’s offices and homes, said study lead author Yi Cui, a professor of materials and engineering.¶More in Climate Change¶“What we need is heating or cooling of individual human beings. How do you do personal thermal management?” Cui said.¶Existing fabrics already do a good job of taking moisture away from the body, but the issue is more “how do you control the infrared radiation coming out of the human body,” he said. Material does a good job of trapping that heat energy to warm you, but letting it go is another matter. That’s where clear clingy plastic kitchen wrap comes in.¶Plastic wrap - polyethylene - does a good job of allowing infrared radiation to escape the body. The trouble is it also allows visible light to escape, Cui said. That means, you can see through it, which isn’t exactly what most people want from clothing.¶So the engineering team worked at changing the pore size of the material and added other chemicals, allowing the heat and moisture out, but not visible light. And it is cheaper than cotton, Cui said.¶But that material felt too flat, so the next step was to weave it, to feel like regular fabric, Cui said.¶“You touch, it feels very soft,” Cui said.¶They’ve used devices to mimic human skin and monitor skin temperatures, but strict scientific testing rules have prevented them from testing clothing on actual humans, Cui said. That’s the next step and outside scientists said there are all sorts of potential pitfalls. And after that, another three years would pass before mass production could proceed so people could buy and wear it, he said.¶“There are many factors relating to the compatibility and feel of the fabric in contact with the skin - washability, durability, compatibility with coloring materials and how they impact radiative properties that remain completely unexplored,” Yogendra Joshi, a professor of mechanical engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology who wasn’t part of the study, said in an email. “Replacing fabrics such as cotton that have been around for over 8,000 years is a tall order.”",0
Man-made warming may have started decades earlier,"
","
August 24, 2016 / 3:36 PM
      / AP
    ","¶WASHINGTON -- Man-made global warming may
have started a few decades earlier than scientists previously figured, a new
study suggests.¶Instead of the late 1800s, a slight almost
imperceptible warming can now be tracked to around the 1850 in North America,
Europe and Asia, according to a new study based on coral, microscopic
organisms, ice cores, cave samples, tree rings and computer simulations.¶And that happened when heat-trapping gases
from burning fossil fuels were tiny compared to now, which means “the
speed at which the climate responds to even a small change in greenhouse gases
appears to be quite fast,” said study lead author Nerilie Abram, a
paleoclimate scientist at the Australian National University. The study is in Wednesday’s journal
Nature.¶More in Climate Change¶From about 1850 to 1880, Earth​ probably warmed
around a third of a degree Fahrenheit (about .2 degrees Celsius). Still, that
pales compared to about nine-tenths of a degree (half a degree Celsius) in the
last 30 years or so, Abram said.¶Determining when warming started is more than
just a historical question. An early heating could mean either worse future
climate than previously predicted if heat trapping gases aren’t controlled or,
more optimistically, faster recovery by Earth if international efforts to cut
greenhouse gases​ succeed, Abram said.¶Abram’s results differ from past studies,
including the iconic “hockey stick” , that didn’t show a dramatic
spike in warming until around the start of the 20th century, and other studies
that even showed unusual cooling around the late 1800s. Abram said computer
simulations are better and go back centuries longer in their calculations than
they used to, and she uses more proxy data - tree rings, coral and the like -
to get temperatures before historical temperature records started being kept
regularly in the 1880s.¶But Pennsylvania State University climatescientist​ Michael Mann, who is credited with the hockey stick concept, said
Abram makes unsupported claims. In an email, he wrote that the Abram team
misinterprets the cooling of the early 1800s from two giant volcanic eruptions
as a cooler baseline instead of something unusual. That makes it look like
human-forced warming started earlier than it did instead of climate naturally
recovering from volcanoes putting cooling particles in the air, Mann wrote.
John Fasullo, a climate scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric
Research, agreed.¶Abram said her team initially thought they saw
a bounce back from the volcanic eruptions​, but their reconstruction and computer
simulations showed that wasn’t the case. The only way the computer model
simulated the proper temperature was with the man-made greenhouse gas effect,
she said.¶Jonathan Overpeck, a University of Arizona
climate​ scientist who wasn’t part of the Abram team, said he found the study’s
combination of proxy data and computer simulations convincing and the concept
of an early start to warming intriguing and significant.",0
"Melting Arctic ice is the ""new normal,"" NASA says","

              ","

    ","¶It is by now a familiar headline -- the Arctic sea ice is melting at increasingly rapid rates. This year’s melt season started at an alarming pace, with a record-low maximum ice extent in March, the melt slowed down by June. While this summer won’t be setting a melt record, NASA scientists now say we have to consider this kind of melt “the new normal.”¶“A decade ago, this year’s sea ice extent would have set a new record low and by a fair amount. Now, we’re kind of used to these low levels of sea ice -- it’s the new normal,” Walt Meier, a sea ice scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, said in a press release. ¶Meier stressed that while we won’t be seeing a record low for the year, “the sea ice is not showing any kind of recovery.” The melt was not as extreme this year because the Arctic weather conditions overall were not as extreme as they have been. ¶But the longer-term trend paints a bleak picture. Arctic ice watchers see the melting ice as a visceral example of the impact of accelerated climate change. The ice cover over the Barents and Kara Seas, north of Russia, opened up early back in April. This left the surface ocean waters exposed to the sun’s penetrating rays weeks ahead of the normal schedule. ¶More in Climate Change¶In May, the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) reported that May saw the Arctic sea ice recede to its lowest levels in 38 years. ¶Similarly, in April, the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI) reported that spring thaw would be coming earlier than in past years. The institute predicted that the melt area would make up 12 percent of Earth’s northernmost ice sheet.¶DMI climate​ scientist Peter Langen wrote in a blog post that the findings were so surprising, his team had to check and see if their “models were still working properly.”¶While we’re in the dog days of summer, we can expect to see continued ice loss​. The melt rate accelerated again during the first two weeks of August, exceeding the average for this time of the season. ¶“This year is a great case study in showing how important the weather conditions are during the summer, especially in June and July, when you have 24 hours of sunlight and the sun is high in the sky in the Arctic,” Meier said. “If you get the right atmospheric conditions during those two months, they can really accelerate the ice loss. If you don’t, they can slow down any melting momentum you had. So our predictive ability in May of the September minimum is limited, because the sea ice cover is so sensitive to the early-to-mid-summer atmospheric conditions, and you can’t foresee summer weather​.”",0
Global warming means smoggier autumns in U.S. Southeast,"
","
August 22, 2016 / 7:30 PM
      / AP
    ","¶GAINESVILLE, Fla. -- The drier, warmer autumn weather that’s becoming more common due to climate change may extend summer smog well into the fall in the Southeastern U.S. in the years ahead, according to a study published on Monday.¶Research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences also suggests a culprit for the smog that many people might not expect: It’s the lush woodlands that give much of the South a lovely green canopy. That’s because of a natural defense mechanism trees use to protect their leaves from drought conditions.¶And since climate models predict more hot, dry Octobers in coming decades, we should expect these late-season smog, or ozone, events to happen more often, according to climatologists at the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology.¶More in Climate Change¶“It’s not going to happen every year, but when it happens it will be worse than in the summer time,” said Yuhang Wang, who co-authored the study with Yuzhong Zhang. “We are likely to have record ozone days in the fall, and we need to prepare for that.”¶The research isn’t conclusive, but it presents enough evidence to raise concerns about the indirect consequences of global warming, said other scientists who weren’t involved in the study.¶“Climate change​ is about more than sea ice and polar bears,” Laura Rehrmann, a fellow at the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, said in an email. “It is also about whether the air will be safe so your children can go play outside.”¶The climatologists​ looked deeply into a rare October smog spike in the Southeast in 2010. That was a drought year, with unseasonably high fall temperatures, and smoggier in October than it had been in July, when smog usually peaks.¶Discovering what caused that spike was important to public health: A longer season for smog raises health risks for millions of people, especially the elderly and children whose lungs are more vulnerable. Smog also can stunt crops.¶It has been known for decades that trees and other plants send more smog-causing emissions​ into the atmosphere than the pollution humans send directly from tail and factory pipes. This study points to an indirect consequence of the global warming humans have caused.¶During hot Southern summers, trees usually have humidity to help them cope. But after the humidity breaks in the fall, they’re more vulnerable to hot days, which used to be more rare, they found.¶The October 2010 smog spike, seen in bright red and orange splotches on an air pollution​ map, confused Wang and Zhang at first.¶“We used to do all this research focusing on the summer, and this October case was very intriguing because we didn’t expect to see the red and oranges in the Southeast, with not nearly as much in the Northeast and in California,” Wang said.¶Moreover, smog-causing emissions from cars and industry have actually declined in recent decades in the Southeast and elsewhere because of tighter emissions requirements under the Clean Air Act​. So why were the region’s ozone numbers that month higher than nearly everywhere else in the nation?¶They looked at all the sources they could think of, and couldn’t find the culprit until they turned to the trees. Trees emit isoprene to protect their leaves during warm, dry weather. Isoprene combines with sunlight to produce smog. Only when they plugged this factor into their computer simulation did the results add up.¶Chris Field, director of the Department of Global Ecology at the Carnegie Institution for Science at Stanford University, said the study doesn’t prove the cause of the October 2010 smog spike, but it does suggest that climate change threatens air quality in ways few people expected.¶“The argument is that climate change affects the trees, the trees release a chemical that may help them cope with harsh conditions, and the chemical produced by the trees leads to an increase in ozone,” Field said in an email.¶“For me, the most interesting feature of the results is something we see quite often, that the risks of damages from a changing climate​ often come through indirect mechanisms.”",0

    ","¶WASHINGTON -- Earth's fever got worse last year, breaking dozens of climate records, scientists said in a massive report nicknamed the annual physical for the planet.¶Soon after 2015 ended, it was proclaimed the hottest on record. The new report shows the broad extent of other records and near-records on the planet's climatic health. Those include record heat energy absorbed by the oceans and lowest groundwater storage levels globally, according to Tuesday's report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.¶""I think the time to call the doctor was years ago,"" NOAA climate monitoring chief Deke Arndt, co-editor of the report, said in an email. ""We are awash in multiple symptoms.""¶More in Climate Change¶The 2015 State of the Climate report examined 50 different aspects of climate , including dramatic melting of Arctic sea ice and glaciers worldwide. A dozen different nations set hottest year records, including Russia and China. South Africa had the hottest temperature ever recorded in the month of October: 119.1 degrees Fahrenheit (48.4 degrees Celsius).¶""There is really only one word for this parade of shattered climate records: grim,"" said Georgia Tech climate scientist Kim Cobb, who wasn't part of the report, but called it ""exhaustive and thorough.""¶But it's more than just numbers on a graph. Scientists said the turbo-charged climate affected walrus and penguin populations and played a role in dangerous algae blooms, such as one off the Pacific Northwest coast. And there were brutal heat waves all over the world, with ones in India and Pakistan killing thousands of people.¶Much of the intense record-breaking and record-flirting weather was because of a combination of a natural El Nino - the periodic warming of parts of the Pacific that changes weather globally - and ever increasing man-made global warming.¶This past year's El Nino, nicknamed ""Godzilla"" by NASA climatologist Bill Patzert, was one of the strongest El Ninos on record.¶The weather phenomenon, which lasted for 15 months beginning in March 2015, ""had a powerful impact,"" Patzert told CBS News in February. ""All the volatile weather we've had across the United States - the fingerprint of El Niño is on all these events.""¶In addition to heavy rain, flooding and warmer-than-average temperatures across the western United States, El Nino triggered droughts in parts of Africa and India and added to man-made global warming. El Nino also played a part in a record hurricane season in the Pacific.¶""This impacts people. This is real life,"" said NOAA climate scientist Jessica Blunden, co-editor of the report published Tuesday in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.¶Oklahoma University meteorology professor Jason Furtado said in an email that the report, which he wasn't part of, illustrates the combined power of nature and humans on Earth's climate: ""It was like injecting an already amped-up climate system with a dose of (natural) steroids.""¶About 450 scientists from around the world helped write the report and in it NOAA highlighted one of the lesser-known measurements, ocean heat content. About 93 percent of the heat energy trapped by greenhouse gases - such as carbon dioxide from the burning of coal, oil and gas - goes directly into the ocean, the report said. And ocean heat content hit record levels both near the surface and deep.¶NOAA oceanographer Gregory C. Johnson, a study co-author, said the oceans are storing more heat energy because of man-made climate change with an extra El Nino spike.¶Johnson summed up Earth's climate in a haiku, published deep inside the report:¶""El Niño waxes,¶warm waters shoal, flow eastward,¶Earth's fever rises.""",0
EPA moves to regulate climate-warming jet pollution,"

    ","¶WASHINGTON -- The government has found that jet engine exhaust is adding to climate change and endangering human health, and needs to be regulated.¶The Environmental Protection Agency announced Monday that it will use its authority under the Clean Air Act to impose limits on aircraft emissions.¶Jet engines spew significant amounts of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane, into the upper atmosphere, where they trap heat from the sun. But proposed rules such as imposing fuel-efficiency standards have faced stiff opposition from aircraft makers and commercial airlines.¶More in Climate Change¶Aircraft emissions were not addressed as part of the landmark global climate agreement agreed to in Paris in December.¶""Addressing pollution from aircraft is an important element of U.S. efforts to address climate change,"" said Janet McCabe, EPA's acting assistant administrator for air and radiation. She said aircraft are the third largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. transportation sector, and that is expected to increase. Cars and trucks already are regulated.¶The EPA's findings do not apply to small piston-engine planes or to military aircraft.¶A U.N. panel in February recommended new emissions standards for international flights that require an average 4 percent reduction in fuel consumption during the cruising phase of flight. The new regulations from the International Civil Aviation Organization require that new aircraft designs meet the standards beginning in 2020, and that designs already in production comply by 2023.¶Environmental groups have criticized the new international standards as too weak to actually slow global warming. Planes burn the most fuel during takeoffs and landings, while cruising at high altitudes is the most fuel-efficient period.¶Environmentalists say aviation accounts for about 5 percent of global greenhouse emissions, though the U.N. and EPA cite studies concluding it's actually less than 2 percent.¶The EPA finding announced Monday is expected to result in similar limits on domestic carriers, which critics say is long overdue.¶""People should not have to choose between mobility and a healthy climate,"" said Marcie Keever, legal director for the environmental group Friends of the Earth. ""The EPA's nine-year delay on regulating aircraft emissions failed the American people. Now it's time for the Obama administration to issue a strong rule, to hold the aviation industry accountable.""",0
"NASA: Temperatures rising, sea ice melting at record rate","

    ","¶Global temperatures have been rising and sea ice has been melting at unprecedented rates since the start of 2016.¶Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York said that each month in the first half of this year set a record as the warmest month globally since temperature records began in 1880. The analysis is based on ground-based observations and satellite data for global surface temperatures and Arctic sea ice extent. The period of January-June 2016 saw average temperatures 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.4 degrees Fahrenheit) higher compared to the late 19th century.¶And as temperatures continue to warm, global sea ice continues to melt. Five of the first six months in 2016 showed the smallest sea ice extent -- the area of the sea covered with ice -- since satellite tracking began in 1979. March was the only exception, recording the second smallest extent for that month.¶Currently, sea ice at its peak during the summer season melt covers 40 percent less area than it did in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The seasonal low point in Arctic sea ice extent in September is also declining at a rate of 13.4 percent per decade.¶More in Climate Change¶Together, global warming and sea ice melt -- key climate indicators -- are part of a warming trend that scientists say has been fueled by rising greenhouse gases in the atmosphere in recent decades. The interaction between warmer temperatures and sea ice melt is a dangerous cycle: when polar ice melts it can't reflect as much sunlight back into space, so more heat gets absorbed into the oceans and land, thus raising temperatures further to cause more melting.¶This winter's El Niño is in part responsible for boosting global temperatures. But as Goddard director Gavin Schmidt said in a statement, ""It is the underlying trend which is producing these record numbers.""¶Dr. Compton Tucker, a climate scientist at NASA, said the rising temperatures pose growing risks to the Earth's population.¶""This is really important because if it is hot and if it's dry, then we have problems like forest fires, like droughts,"" Tucker told CBS News. ""This is what really concerns us.""¶Along with 19 Earth-observing satellites that orbit the planet, NASA has researchers travel the globe to conduct on-the-ground investigations of climate change.¶Last week NASA's Operation IceBridge campaign began conducting airborne measurements on how large and deep melting pools in the Arctic have become, to better understand how fast the ice is melting. Ice is ""nature's best thermometer,"" Tucker said. ""It's a big deal.""¶NASA researchers have also begun a decades-long field study called the Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE), which will investigate how climate change is affecting various ecosystems in the Arctic, where climate change is occurring at the fastest rate on the planet.",0
Donald Trump would stand alone among world leaders: Sierra Club,"

    ","¶WASHINGTON -- If elected president, Donald Trump would be the only head of state in the world to contend that climate change is a hoax, according to a study.¶The Sierra Club compiled public statements from the leaders of the 195 nations recognized by the State Department. An advance copy of the group's report, to be released Tuesday, was provided to The Associated Press.¶In contrast to public statements by the presumptive Republican presidential nominee calling climate change a ""con job"" and a ""myth,"" the leader of every U.S. ally urges action to reduce climate-warming carbon emissions, including Great Britain, Germany, France, Japan and Canada.¶More in Campaign 2016¶Chinese President Xi Jinping, head of the Earth's most populous country and the No. 1 global emitter of carbon, has called for eventually phasing out dirty coal-fired power plants and is leading an ambitious national effort to build massive arrays of solar panels and wind turbines.¶The regime of reclusive North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un signed on to the Paris accord last year and is implementing a 10-year push to plant new forests as part of a ""national effort to mitigate climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.""¶Even the leaders of nations economically dependent on oil production also accept the reality that the world's climate is warming, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and Saudi King Salman.¶""Being highly vulnerable to climate change and actions and plans to address it, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will be engaged in several actions to address climate change and make its development more sustainable,"" the Saudi state said in a statement issued last year.¶Trump, meanwhile, has pledged to ""renegotiate"" U.S. commitments under the Paris accord and has suggested that the science of climate change is part of a plot to weaken the American economy.¶""The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive,"" Trump tweeted in 2012.¶He has also cited cold winter weather as evidence the world is not really warming.¶""The entire country is FREEZING - we desperately need a heavy dose of global warming, and fast! Ice caps size reaches all-time high,"" Trump tweeted during a 2014 blizzard.¶While Trump's climate-change denial has become orthodoxy within the Republican Party, it is at odds with the overwhelming consensus of the world's scientific community and rejects reams of data about how the Earth's climate is changing.¶According to NASA, 97 percent of the climate scientists agree that the world is getting hotter and that man-made carbon emissions are to blame. Ten of the warmest years in history have occurred in the past 12. Studies show the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have decreased in mass, while the world's oceans have risen on average nearly 7 inches in the last century.¶Despite his public stance, there is evidence that Trump the businessman may be hedging his bets. Earlier this year, the Trump International Golf Links and Hotel in Ireland cited the threat of sea level rise in a permit application to build a nearly two-mile-long stone wall between it and the Atlantic Ocean.¶Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not respond Monday to requests for comment.¶John Coequyt, the Sierra Club's director for global climate policy, said Trump's failure to acknowledge basic climate science would leave him isolated on the world stage as president, adding, ""Trump's climate science denial would make him a global laughingstock if it wasn't so dangerous.""",0
"""Hot, wet and wild"" weather as U.S. has warmest June","

    ","¶WASHINGTON -- America's warm, wild and costly weather broke another record with the hottest June, federal meteorologists say. And if that's not enough, they calculated that 2016 is flirting with the U.S. record for most billion-dollar weather disasters.¶The month's average temperature in the Lower 48 states was 71.8 degrees, 3.3 degrees above normal, surpassing the Dust Bowl record set in 1933 by a couple tenths of a degree, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported Thursday. Every state in the nation was warmer than normal in June, with Utah and Arizona having their hottest Junes.¶""2016 has been hot, wet and wild for the contiguous U.S.,"" NOAA climate scientist Jake Crouch said Thursday.¶More in Climate Change¶The nation had its third hottest first half of the year. June's record heat is from a combination of natural variability and long-term global warming, Crouch said. Records go back to 1895.¶But there's been a wet and wild aspect of the year, too.  So far, NOAA calculates that there have been eight billion-dollar weather disasters in the first half of this year, not counting the West Virginia flooding, which is still being calculated. They've been a combination of severe storms with tornadoes and heavy rains and downpours that cause damaging flooding. Seven of those have hit Texas.¶NOAA calculates billion-dollar disasters , adjusting for inflation, to show trends in the most extreme and damaging weather. Since 1980, the U.S. has averaged five billion-dollar disasters a year, but in the last five years the country has averaged nearly 11 a year. There were eight in 2015. The record is 16 different billion-dollar disasters in 2011.¶""The main lesson is that it shows us how vulnerable we are to climate change,"" Texas A&M climate scientist Andrew Dessler said in an email. ""People frequently think that, 'Oh, we'll just adapt to climate change.'  But we're learning that it's going to be a lot harder than people realize to do that.

First signs Antarctic ozone hole is healing,"

    ","¶An MIT-led team of researchers has pinpointed what they call the ""first fingerprints of healing"" of the Antarctic ozone layer. They report that the ozone hole, which occurs each September-October in the Antarctic spring, has shrunk by more than 4 million square kilometers since 2000.¶The findings were published Thursday in the journal Science.¶""We can now be confident that the things we've done have put the planet on a path to heal,"" lead author Susan Solomon, the Ellen Swallow Richards Professor of Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Science at MIT, said in a press release. ""Which is pretty good for us, isn't it? Aren't we amazing humans, that we did something that created a situation that we decided collectively, as a world, 'Let's get rid of these molecules'? We got rid of them, and now we're seeing the planet respond.""¶More in Climate Change¶While the ozone hole seems to be healing, the researchers did find that this ozone recovery has slowed at certain times, depending upon volcanic eruptions taking place from year to year.¶What human actions contributed to the rebound? The scientists determined that the shrinking was due to a decline in atmospheric chlorine that comes from chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), the chemicals that once seeped out of aerosols, cleaning products, or refrigerators. In 1987, these chemical compounds were banned thanks to the Montreal Protocol, an agreement signed by many countries around the world.¶The large ozone hole was first pinpointed from ground-based data that started being collected back in the 1950s. Since the 1980s, when British Antarctic survey scientists found that total October ozone levels were dropping, researchers made a point to use data from that month to track Antarctic ozone measurements.¶Typically, scientists have found that the ozone depletion process starts in late August each year, with the hole forming completely by the beginning of October. Solomon's team decided to look earlier in the year -- at September ozone levels -- just as the hole is opening up. The researchers found that as chlorine levels from CFCs decreased, the hole expansion rate slowed down considerably.¶From 2000 to 2015, Solomon and her team examined the Antarctic ozone hole for the month of September. They sent up weather balloons and satellites to examine ozone levels, in addition to studying satellite measurements of sulfur dioxide from volcanic emissions, which also plays a role in ozone depletion. Weather changes were also taken into account.¶The team then applied computer model simulations to compare September ozone measurements year-to-year and ultimately predict what ozone levels would be in the future. The ozone hole was at its largest in 2000, but shrank by more than 4 million square kilometers over the course of the next 15 years. These changes ended up matching the predictions of the computer models.¶""It's been interesting to think about this in a different month, and looking in September was a novel way,"" co-author Diane Ivy, a researcher at MIT's Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences, said in the release. ""It showed we can actually see a chemical fingerprint, which is sensitive to the levels of chlorine, finally emerging as a sign of recovery.""¶Solomon views the future of the ozone hole with optimism. She stressed that the ozone hole could shrink and even close permanently by the mid-21st century, as long as there aren't any major volcanic eruptions in the region.¶""What's exciting for me personally is, this brings so much of my own work over 30 years full circle,"" Solomon added. ""Science was helpful in showing the path, diplomats and countries and industry were incredibly able in charting a pathway out of these molecules, and now we've actually seen the planet starting to get better. It's a wonderful thing.""¶The research team also included scientists from the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado and at the University Leeds in the United Kingdom. The research was supported partially by the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Energy.",0
Historic New England fishing industry faces warming world,"
","

    ","¶SEABROOK, N.H. -- The cod isn't just a fish to David Goethel. It's his identity, his ticket to middle-class life, his link to a historic industry.¶""I paid for my education, my wife's education, my house, my kids' education; my slice of America was paid for on cod,"" said Goethel, a 30-year veteran of these waters that once teemed with New England's signature fish.¶But on this chilly, windy Saturday in April, after 12 hours out in the Gulf of Maine, he has caught exactly two cod, and he feels far removed from the 1990s, when he could catch 2,000 pounds in a day.¶More in Climate Change¶His boat, the Ellen Diane, a 44-foot fishing trawler named for his wife, is the only vessel pulling into the Yankee Fishermen's Co-op in Seabrook. Fifteen years ago, there might have been a half-dozen. He is carrying crates of silver hake, skates and flounder - all worth less than cod.¶One of America's oldest commercial industries, fishing along the coast of the Northeast still employs hundreds. But every month that goes by, those numbers fall. After centuries of weathering overfishing, pollution, foreign competition and increasing government regulation, the latest challenge is the one that's doing them in: climate change.¶Though no waters are immune to the ravages of climate change, the Gulf of Maine, a dent in the coastline from Cape Cod to Nova Scotia, best illustrates the problem. The gulf, where fishermen have for centuries sought lobster, cod and other species that thrived in its cold waters, is now warming faster than 99 percent of the world's oceans, scientists have said.¶The warming waters, in the gulf and elsewhere, have caused other valuable species, such as clams, to migrate to deeper or more northern waters. Others, such as lobsters, have largely abandoned the once-lucrative waters off the southern New England states of Connecticut and Rhode Island, having become more susceptible to disease or predators.¶Lobster catches in Maine are booming as the species creeps northward, but as the warming continues, that's a good thing bound to end. A federal report from 2009 said that half of 36 fish stocks studied in the northwest Atlantic Ocean have been shifting northward over the past 40 years, and that the trend is likely to continue.¶Fish aren't the only ones moving on, and not just in the Northeast. The U.S. fishing fleet has dwindled from more than 120,000 vessels in 1996 to about 75,000 today, the Coast Guard says.¶For the fishermen of the northeastern U.S. - not all of whom accept the scientific consensus on climate change, and many of whom bristle at government regulations stemming from it - whether to stick with fishing, adapt to the changing ocean or leave the business is a constant worry.¶Waving the white flag¶Robert Bradfield was one of the East Coast's most endangered species, a Rhode Island lobsterman, until he pulled his traps out of the water for the last time about a decade ago.¶Bradfield, of Newport, started in the fishery in the mid-1970s and stayed in it for some 30 years, sometimes catching 2,000 pounds of lobster a day. During his final years, he was lucky if he caught 100 pounds, not even enough to pay for bait, fuel and deckhands.¶He now works on a pilot boat, guiding larger ships in and out of the harbor. He is glad he's still on the water, but he misses lobstering and the community of fishermen he used to see in Newport.¶""There's probably 95 percent attrition out of that fishery in this area,"" Bradfield said. ""Of all the guys I fished with, I was a lobsterman for 30 years, and there's maybe three left.""¶The number of adult lobsters in New England south of Cape Cod slid to about 10 million in 2013, according to a report issued last year by an interstate regulatory board. It was about 50 million in the late 1990s. The lobster catch in the region sank to about 3.3 million pounds in 2013, from a peak of about 22 million in 1997.¶Bradfield's take on the role of warming oceans is nuanced and reflects the many years he spent on the water. Shell disease, he said, has taken a toll on southern New England's lobster stock, something scientists say is a result of rising temperatures.¶Bradfield also agrees with scientists who say the increase in predatory fish, such as black sea bass, is bad for the lobster population. Warming oceans are responsible for the increase in those fish species off New England, scientists say.¶But Bradfield, a father to three grown children, also said his decision to leave the fishery was more about economics than science. He thinks some published studies are inconsistent. And he laments that Newport's docks, once home to dozens of lobster boats, are now down to a few.¶""It tore me up to do something else,"" he said.¶Others in the lobster business dispute the science that lays the blame on climate change. Nicholas Crismale, a former lobsterman and president of the Connecticut Commercial Lobstermen's Association, is one of many lobstermen in his state who believes pesticide runoff is to blame.¶Connecticut researchers found no pesticides in lobsters collected in Long Island Sound in late 2014. But Crismale, out of the business for four years and helping to run his wife's restaurant, Lobster Shack in Branford, sticks to the hypothesis, even in the face of science.¶""The warming stuff is a lot of baloney,"" he said. ""All that is is another scientist looking for a grant.""¶Crismale said it's a shame that lobstering, often a multigenerational enterprise in New England, is reaching its end in Connecticut. He used to bring his daughters out fishing with him, but they've grown up to be a lawyer and a teacher, and another generation isn't taking their place.¶""I'm never going to be able to take a grandchild out on my boat,"" Crismale said. ""And some of the other fishermen were second and third-generation fishermen. And they lost all that.""¶Connecticut's lobster fishery, based on Long Island Sound, has been hit especially hard by warming water and has been reduced to nearly nothing.¶A power plant on the sound recorded more than 75 days with an average water temperature above 68 degrees Fahrenheit in each of the years 2012, 2013 and 2014, according to a regulatory board's report. Between 1976 and 2010, that happened only twice. Lobsters prefer temperatures in the high 50s and low 60s.¶There were nearly 300 lobstermen in Connecticut in 1999, and now there are maybe a dozen full-timers left.¶Some in the Rhode Island lobster fishery said it's still possible to make a living in the business.¶Greg Mataronas, the president of the Rhode Island Lobstermen's Association, who fishes out of Little Compton, said regulations and territoriality prevent members of the state's fleet from moving to more fertile grounds. But the few remaining lobstermen in Rhode Island are still able to pull lobsters from the state's waters, he said.¶""There's a real disconnect between what the guys are seeing on the water and what the scientists are saying,"" he said.¶Bradfield isn't buying it. He is glad he left the business, as painful as it was to leave a piece of his identity behind.¶""There's a saying: Behind every successful fisherman is a wife with a good job,"" he said. ""You go down to the State Pier in Rhode Island now, guys hate what they're doing right now.""¶Hanging on, getting by¶David Goethel has spent most of his life fishing for New England cod, and he doesn't want to stop now.¶""I could catch the entire quota for the Gulf of Maine in eight days,"" Goethel said in a bit of bravado he swears is not an exaggeration. ""I wouldn't break a sweat doing it.""¶Fishing is in Goethel's blood. He paid his way through Boston University by taking thrill-seekers out on ""party boat"" fishing trips in Boston Harbor and segued into commercial cod fishing in 1982.¶Today, he operates a trawler that leaves from New Hampshire, its nets scouring the Gulf of Maine for fish. But the catch these days is different - with the cod in jeopardy and quotas that limit his ability to catch them at all-time lows, cod fishermen like Goethel try to eke out a living by supplementing cod with just about anything else they can catch.¶Goethel is making much less money. In the 1980s and '90s, he could bring in $120,000 in a year, but is now making about $60,000, without subtracting a health insurance bill over $27,000. He and his wife, who is up every day at 4 a.m. for a far-flung teaching job, haven't taken a vacation in three years.¶Retirement isn't in the cards for the 62-year-old Goethel - at least, not soon.¶""My wife is working far more than she used to,"" he said. ""I have to work more to make less.""¶The challenges climate change have brought to commercial fishing are perhaps most noticeable in New England's cod fishery, which has dwindled from more than 1,200 boats in the 1980s to only a few dozen today. In that time, the catch of cod has also plummeted, from more than 117 million pounds in 1980 to just over 5 million in 2014.¶Most consumers haven't noticed the collapse, with cod still readily available at restaurants and markets because of foreign sources like Iceland and Norway.¶Scientists said late last year that the impact of climate change on Atlantic cod might be worse than previously thought. Fishermen pursue the fish in the Gulf of Maine and, farther off New England, the shallows of Georges Bank, both of which have experienced dramatic temperature rise. Around 2004, the gulf began warming about 10 times faster than previously.¶""This is what global warming looks like in the Gulf of Maine,"" said Andrew Pershing, a Maine-based marine scientist who co-authored the paper last year in the journal Science.¶Goethel, also a marine scientist and a former member of a regional regulatory board, doesn't bemoan the ocean's changing temperature as much as the rules he must play by. Because of the tight quotas, he must avoid fishing around areas where cod live, he said. That is because cod are a ""choke species,"" and when fishermen reach their quota for cod they aren't allowed to pursue other fish.¶Like others in the cod fishery, Goethel has had to adapt, but at his core he remains a cod fisherman. The experience has left him frustrated and more than a little bitter.¶He doesn't dispute the scientific consensus about climate change, but he does think government regulators apply that science in a manner unnecessarily punitive to fishermen. He plastered a sticker on his boat declaring, ""Who says there's no fish?""¶For the most recent fishing year, he was allotted 3,600 pounds of cod. He caught his allotment of 60,000 pounds in 2010, and leased and caught an additional 50,000. He believes that the cod have moved and not died off, and that he could easily continue catching high totals without strict regulations.¶Scientists have said warming waters have indeed motivated some young cod to seek deeper, colder waters - some of which are closed to fishing.¶The cuts to catch limits represented the first and biggest blow to the industry, and they stemmed from overfishing and subsequent regulations designed to stop fishermen from taking too much from the sea. They were meant to preserve the fishery for future generations, and it made earning a living difficult.¶Climate change has only exacerbated that trouble.¶Other obstacles, such as the government-imposed cost of on-board monitors to collect data to inform future fishing quotas, have rankled Goethel, who lawsuit seeking to block the charges is pending. But he perseveres.¶""The future of the cod fishery is not that it's in jeopardy,"" Goethel said. ""It needs to be recalibrated.""¶Government regulators, such as John Bullard, a regional administrator for fisheries for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, have said the quota cuts that irk fishermen are necessary to rebuild the stock. But he has acknowledged the rebuilding effort comes with an ""economic price.""¶The changes have been difficult emotionally for Goethel, whose sons, Daniel and Eric, are a fisheries biologist and a tugboat captain. He instilled a love of fishing in everyone in his family, and old traditions are hard to part with.¶""Eric would get rolled out of bed to go fishing,"" Ellen said. ""He did the same thing to me.""¶Adapting, commuting¶Michael Mohr harvested surf clams for almost 30 of his 55 years, and his desire to stay in the only business he has ever known now takes him far from his family.¶The clams he caught for decades feed tourists and locals alike in towns all along the coast. Now, those clams, which he once caught off New Jersey, are found northward or farther out to sea.¶Mohr has also moved on. About 10 years ago, he started commuting six hours each way from his home in Mays Landing, New Jersey, to the former whaling port of New Bedford, Massachusetts. He has also switched clam species; he got his start fishing for Atlantic surf clams but now pursues the ocean quahog.¶The quahog is well known to New England diners as a stuffed clam or in its own kind of chowder. Both quahogs and surf clams populate supermarket seafood sections.¶The reason for Mohr's decision has been documented by published science, as well as on the decks of the boat he fishes from, the ESS Pursuit. Moving north for quahogs was a way to remain a clammer.¶""We're finding clams in deeper water instead of inshore water, where we used to work 25 years ago,"" Mohr said. ""It's just affecting everything.""¶Mohr leaves behind his wife of 20 years and makes the drive to New Bedford so he and his 29-year-old son, Danny, can spend 20 days out of 30 aboard the Pursuit. Mohr has two other adult children who live in New Jersey.¶He has missed his children's first days at school, their sports events, and weddings of loved ones while out chasing clams, and, later, quahogs. Missing out on family life is worse these days because of his long commute on Interstate 95.¶Whether Mohr can make holidays like Thanksgiving is ""hit-and-miss,"" said his wife, Melanie.¶Mohr's migration story is common in the clamming business, said Dave Wallace, a Maryland-based consultant in the industry. It was once based largely off Atlantic City, near Mohr's home, but has shifted northward along with the clams, he said.¶Some fishermen have decided to instead pursue quahogs, as Mohr has, while others now travel farther out to sea to harvest surf clams. The surf clam fishery has slipped somewhat in the face of the changes, with a little less than 41 million pounds caught in 2014, the second-lowest total since 1980.¶Mohr is undaunted. Clamming has been good to him, and if he has to spend more time on the road as he nears 60, so be it.¶""It's just a way of life,"" Mohr said. ""You've got to go where the money is at, and you're happy. Right now, I'm happy.""",0

    ","¶Climate change might have one of its biggest casualties to date. A study published this month out of Australia reveals that the disappearance of the Bramble Cay melomys, a small rodent, from its habitat along the Great Barrier Reef may be the first recorded extinction of a mammal as a result of climate change brought on by humans.¶The sobering study was co-authored by Ian Gynther from Queensland's Department of Environment and Heritage Protection and Natalie Waller and Luke Leung from the University of Queensland. The comprehensive survey of the missing small mammal population was carried out from August through September 2014.¶The Bramble Cay melomys -- also known as the ""mosaic-tailed rat"" -- lived on a cay, a reef island made up of coral rubble and sand, located in the eastern Torres Strait. It was known as the only mammal species native to the Great Barrier Reef area. According to the study, a limited March 2014 survey was unable to detect the species in the region. This prompted the team to carry out the more extensive survey to see if the animals were indeed wiped out.¶More in Climate Change¶The survey involved a combination of day and nighttime searches and the use of traps and cameras to try to detect any physical or visual evidence that the mammals still lived in the area.¶The team reported that a professional fisherman who visited the bay annually for the past decade stated that the last recorded sighting of the Bramble Cay melomys was in late 2009.¶""For low-lying islands like Bramble Cay, the destructive effects of extreme water levels resulting from severe meteorological events are compounded by the impacts from anthropogenic climate change-driven sea-level rise,"" the researchers wrote.¶The impact of climate change on the area was pretty drastic -- the Bramble Cay melomys lost 97 percent of its habitat in a mere 10 years.¶However, officials held out hope that the species may still have a foothold on some neighboring islands, although no proof has been found so far. Queensland's Department of Environment and Heritage Protection's website reported that there ""has been speculation that the species may also occur on other islands in the Torres Strait or in Papua New Guinea.""¶""Consequently, at this stage, it may be premature to declare the Bramble Cay melomys extinct on a global scale,"" it said.",0
Scientists turn chief global warming gas into harmless stone,"

    ","¶WASHINGTON -- Scientists have a found a quick way - but not a cheap one - to turn heat-trapping carbon dioxide gas into harmless rock.¶Experts say the results of a two-year, $10 million experiment called CarbFix , conducted about one-third of a mile deep in the rocks of Iceland, offer new hope for an effective weapon to help fight man-made global warming.¶When an international team of scientists pumped a carbon dioxide and water mix into underground basalt rocks, basic chemistry took over. The acidic mixture dissolved the rocks' calcium magnesium and formed limestone, a permanent natural jail for the heat-trapping gas, according to Juerg Matter of the University of Southampton in England. He is the lead author of a study detailing the experiment published Thursday in the journal Science.¶More in Climate Change¶""It's no longer a gas,"" Matter said. ""Basically carbon dioxide is converted into stone.""¶Scientists, who had done this before in the lab, thought the process could take thousands or even hundreds of thousands of years. But after just two years, 95 percent of the gas was captured and converted, the study said.¶""It's what we hoped for ... and in some ways better,"" said David Goldberg, a Columbia University geophysicist who wasn't part of the team but praised it. ""What's going on here is a natural process being accelerated.""¶One of the methods to battle climate change, in addition to reducing fossil fuel emissions, is to capture carbon dioxide from the air or power plants.¶""Carbon capture is not the silver bullet, but it can contribute significantly to reducing carbon dioxide emissions,"" Matter said.¶However, carbon capture however can be expensive - especially the capturing part.  Once the gas is grabbed from the air, storing it is another issue. It can be stored underground and is sometimes injected in depleted oil wells, but there are concerns about monitoring it and preventing it from escaping.¶Injecting it into basalt and letting nature take its course can solve that problem. But at $17 per ton of carbon dioxide, it can cost a couple times more than injecting it into old wells, Matter said.¶There's basalt all over the world, in places like the Pacific Northwest, India and South America, Matter said.¶But even more promising is the ocean floor, which is full of basalt and a good place to store the carbon dioxide, Goldberg said.¶CarbFix is just a small scale test - using about the equivalent of the annual carbon dioxide emissions of 15 Americans - but if it can be scaled up at a low cost, ""it would be very good news,"" said climate scientist Ken Caldeira of the Carnegie Institution for Science, who wasn't part of the study.",0

    ","¶The National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) reports that May saw the Arctic sea ice recede to its lowest levels in 38 years. The figures are particularly bleak in that they set the stage for what could ultimately be the smallest Arctic sea ice extent ever.¶While these numbers are still tentative given that the center used preliminary satellite data, the figures were backed up by other data sources. On its website, the center's researchers wrote that these below-average conditions have been pushed primarily by an abnormally sea ice retreat in the Beaufort Sea and warm air  pockets flowing into the Arctic from northern Europe and eastern Siberia.¶""We just didn't break the old May record, we're way below the previous one,"" Mark Serreze, the center's director, told Climate Central.¶More in Climate Change¶The center reported that May's average ice extent is about 224,000 square miles below the previous record-low for May that was set back in 2004. It is also 537,000 square miles below the long-term average from 1981 to 2010.¶The NSIDC satellite and survey data revealed that ice thicknesses in parts of the Arctic aren't very different from those that were recorded in 2015, but what is shocking is that the entire Arctic region is thinner compared to the last five years.¶These latest findings are in keeping with a year that has seen exceptional melting in the Arctic. Back in April, the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI) reported that spring thaw would be coming earlier than normal. This was expected to bring a melt area that makes up 12 percent of Earth's northernmost ice sheet.¶Those findings were so alarming, DMI climate scientist Peter Langen wrote in a blog post that he and his team had to check and see if their ""models were still working properly.""¶Serreze stressed to Climate Central that what is being observed right now could be a prelude to even more examples of global warming's impact on Arctic ice melt throughout the remainder of the year.¶""Will we end up with very low sea ice extent this September?

Earth's hot streak continues for record 12th month,"

    ","¶WASHINGTON -- Earth's heat is stuck on high.¶Thanks to a combination of global warming and an El Nino, the planet shattered monthly heat records for an unprecedented 12th straight month, as April smashed the old record by half a degree, according to federal scientists.¶The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's monthly climate calculation said Earth's average temperature in April was 56.7 degrees (13.7 degrees Celsius). That's 2 degrees (1. 1 degrees Celsius) warmer than the 20th century average and well past the old record set in 2010. The Southern Hemisphere led the way, with Africa, South America and Asia all having their warmest Aprils on record, NOAA climate scientist Ahira Sanchez-Lugo said. NASA was among other organizations that said April was the hottest on record.¶The last month that wasn't record hot was April 2015. The last month Earth wasn't hotter than the 20th-century average was December 1984, and the last time Earth set a monthly cold record was almost a hundred years ago, in December 1916, according to NOAA records.¶More in Climate Change¶""These kinds of records may not be that interesting, but so many in a row that break the previous records by so much indicates that we're entering uncharted climatic territory (for modern human society),"" Texas A&M University climate scientist Andrew Dessler said in an email.¶At NOAA's climate monitoring headquarters in Asheville, North Carolina, ""we are feeling like broken records stating the same thing"" each month, Sanchez-Lugo said.¶And more heat meant record low snow for the Northern Hemisphere in April, according to NOAA and the Rutgers Global Snow Lab. Snow coverage in April was 890,000 square miles below the 30-year average.¶Sanchez-Lugo and other scientists say ever-increasing man-made global warming is pushing temperatures higher, and the weather oscillation El Nino - a warming of parts of the Pacific Ocean that changes weather worldwide - makes it even hotter.¶The current El Nino, which is fading, is one of the strongest on records and is about as strong as the 1997-1998 El Nino. But 2016 so far is 0.81 degrees (0.45 degrees Celsius) warmer than 1998 so ""you can definitely see that climate change has an impact,"" Sanchez-Lugo said.¶Given that each month this year has been record hot, it is not surprising that the average of the first four months of 2016 were 2.05 degrees (1.14 degrees Celsius) higher than the 20th-century average and beat last year's record by 0.54 degrees (0.3 degrees Celsius).¶Last year was the hottest year by far, beating out 2014, which also was a record. But 2016's start ""is unprecedented basically"" and in general half a degree warmer than 2015, Sanchez-Lugo said.¶Even though El Nino is fading and its cooler flip side La Nina is forecast to take hold later this year, Sanchez-Lugo predicted that 2016 will end up the hottest year on record for the third straight year. That's because there's a lag time for those changes to show up in global temperatures and because 2016 has started off so much hotter than 2015, she said.",0
More acidic seawater eating away at Florida Keys reef,"
","
May 3, 2016 / 3:31 PM
      / AP
    ","¶WASHINGTON -- Seawater, increasingly acidic due to global warming, is eating away a tiny part of the limestone framework for coral reef in the upper Florida Keys, according to a new study. It's something that scientists had expected, but not so soon.¶This is one of the first times scientists have documented long-term effects of ocean acidification on the foundation of the reefs, said study author Chris Langdon, a biological oceanographer at the University of Miami.¶""This is what I would call a leading indicator; it's telling us about something happening early on before it's a crisis,"" Langdon said. ""By the time you observe the corals actually crumbling, disappearing, things have pretty much gone to hell by that point.""¶The northern part of the Florida Keys reef has lost about 14 pounds of limestone over the past six years, according to the study published in the journal Global Biogeochemical Cycles. The water eats away at the nooks and crannies of the limestone foundation, making them more porous and weaker, Langdon said.¶More in Climate Change¶So far the effect is subtle, not noticeable to the eye, and can only be detected by intricate chemical tests. But as ocean acidification increases, scientists expect more reefs to dissolve and become flatter, and that fish will leave, Langdon said. Also, increasing acidity eats away at the shells of the shellfish, making them easier prey for other fish and harder for humans to harvest.¶Acidification occurs when oceans absorb more carbon dioxide from the air, altering seawater chemistry. Scientists expected limestone to dissolve, but not until the second half of this century. It's about 40 years early, Langdon said.¶""This is another one of those cases where we're finding that we're underestimate the level of damage caused by excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,"" said National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reef watch coordinator Mark Eakin, who wasn't part of the research.¶Eakin and two other outside experts said the study made sense. But NOAA's Derek Manzello, a scientist in the ocean acidification program who studied the same area earlier, said it is difficult to blame the foundation loss just on ocean acidification, because long-term coral bleaching and death will also cause the limestone to dissolve.¶There's a natural cycle of limestone production on reefs. Limestone generally grows faster in the summer as the water become less acidic and ocean life absorbs carbon from the ocean. But in the winter and fall, life dies off, carbon is released and the water becomes more acidic naturally, slowing or stopping limestone growth.¶But ""to actually see a negative was a big surprise,"" Langdon said. Extra, man-made carbon dioxide is being absorbed by the water and adding to its acidity. And it's worse in the northern parts of the Keys, because the colder the water, the more carbon dioxide dissolves into it, Langdon said.¶Reefs provide $2.8 billion a year to the Florida economy, mostly from tourists who come to dive and fish but also from commercial fishing, Langdon said.",0

    ","¶The excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has created a greener planet, a new NASA study shows.¶Around the world, areas that were once icebound, barren or sandy are now covered in green foliage. All told, carbon emissions have fueled greening in an area about twice the size of the continental United States between 1982 and 2009, according to the study.¶While lush forests and verdant fields may sound like a good thing, the landscape transformation could have long-term, unforeseen consequences, the researchers say.¶More in Climate Change¶The radical greening ""has the ability to fundamentally change the cycling of water and carbon in the climate system,"" lead author Zaichun Zhu, a researcher from Peking University in Beijing, said in a statement. [Video: See Global Warming Make Earth Greener]¶Fuel for plants¶Green leafy flora make up 32 percent of Earth's surface area. All of those plants use carbon dioxide and sunlight to make sugars to grow -- a process called photosynthesis. Past studies have shown that carbon dioxide increases plant growth by increasing the rate of photosynthesis.¶Other research has shown that plants are one of the main absorbers of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Human activities, such as driving cars and burning coal for energy, account for about 10 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year, and half of this CO2 is stored in plants.¶""While our study did not address the connection between greening and carbon storage in plants, other studies have reported an increasing carbon sink on land since the 1980s, which is entirely consistent with the idea of a greening Earth,"" said study co-author Shilong Piao, of the College of Urban and Environmental Sciences at Peking University.¶However, it wasn't clear whether the greening seen in satellite data over recent years could be explained by the sky-high CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere (the highest the planet has seen in 500,000 years). After all, rainfall, sunlight, nitrogen in the soil and land-use changes also affect how well plants grow.¶To isolate the causes of planetary greening, researchers from around the world analyzed satellite data collected by NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer instruments. They then created mathematical models and computer simulations to isolate how each of these variables would be predicted to influence greening. By comparing the models and the satellite data, the team concluded that about 70 percent of the greening could be attributed to atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, the researchers reported Monday (April 25) in the journal Nature Climate Change.¶""The second most important driver is nitrogen, at 9 percent. So we see what an outsized role CO2 plays in this process,"" said study co-author Ranga Myneni, an earth and environmental scientist at Boston University.¶Warming still worrisome¶While green shoots may be good, excess CO2 emissions also bring a host of more worrisome consequences, such as global warming, melting glaciers, rising sea levels and more dangerous weather, according to accumulating research.¶What's more, the greening may be a temporary change.¶""Studies have shown that plants acclimatize, or adjust, to rising carbon dioxide concentration and the fertilization effect diminishes over time,"" said Philippe Ciais, associate director of the Laboratory of Climate and Environmental Sciences in Gif-sur-Yvette, France.¶Follow Tia Ghose on Twitter and Google+.

Volcanoes linked to Earth climate shifts over past 720 million years: study,"

    ","¶Over the past 720 million years, the Earth has gone through periods of global warming and cooling, which new research ties to volcanic activity related to plate-tectonic movements. The new study, published in the journal Science, points to this combination of natural phenomena as causes for gradual climatic shifts over hundreds of millions of years over the course of the planet's history.¶The study out of the University of Texas at Austin School of Geosciences examined long-term shifts in the planet's baseline climate and not human-induced or short term examples of climate change, according to a press release.¶""Our study provides evidence that major changes in Earth's climate over the past ~700 million years were driven by changes in the emission of carbon dioxide from volcanoes,"" Ryan McKenzie, the study's lead researcher, wrote in an email to CBS News. ""The rates of change in the volcanic emissions that we tracked are extremely slow and the amount of carbon dioxide produced by volcanoes is remarkably minor in comparison to modern human-induced emissions, yet these processes are capable of, over long time scales, driving dramatic changes in climate state. Today, volcanic emissions pale in comparison to the magnitude of human-induced emissions.""¶More in Climate Change¶McKenzie, who started the research as a postdoctoral researcher in Texas and then finished the study at Yale, said that the team found that volcanoes along continental arcs were most active during periods of warmer conditions over the last 720 million years. On the flip side, these continental arc volcanoes were less active during colder conditions.¶ What's a continental volcanic arc system, you might ask? Well, the Andes Mountains are a good example. They were created at active continental margins when two tectonic plates met, with the oceanic plate descending underneath the continental plate, creating what is known as a subduction zone. During this process, magma mixes with carbon from the Earth's crust, releasing carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere when volcanoes along the arc start erupting.¶While carbon dioxide has long been known to alter Earth's climate, researchers have been trying to understand what exactly caused non-man-made fluctuations in CO2 levels throughout history. The study pinpoints CO2 releases into the atmosphere through these volcanic ruptures being a main driver behind previous climate shifts.¶The research team took data from about 200 previous studies as well as their own fieldwork to create a large global database used to recreate volcanic activity along the continental margins over the course of 720 million years.¶""We studied sedimentary basins next to former volcanic arcs, which were eroded away over hundreds of millions of years,"" co-author Brian Horton, said in the release. ""The distinguishing part of our study is that we looked at a very long geologic record -- 720 million years -- through multiple greenhouse-icehouse events.""¶They were able to trace this past Earth behavior by looking at the uranium-lead crystallization ages of zircon, a mineral created during continental volcanic arc activity. This mineral is found less commonly in other kinds of volcanic scenarios. The researchers examined about 120,000 grains of zircon collected from thousands of samples globally.¶The team found that during periods of high zircon production, there was evidence of greenhouse conditions, while during lower times of zircon production, there was a global shift to cooler, icehouse conditions.¶Horton explained that cooler icehouse periods coincided with the assemblage of the planet's supercontinents, which were tied to less volcanic activity. Conversely, warmer greenhouse period coincided with periods of upheaval -- during continental breakup and increased volcanic activity.¶So, what does this past global climate behavior indicate about the future of the planet?¶""Overall, these results support a direct link between the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the global state of Earth's climate. If we've learned anything from these past records, it is that continued output of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere will likely drive Earth to a greenhouse climate.""¶Funding for the team's research came from the National Science Foundation.",0

    ","¶WASHINGTON --Global warming has mostly made the weather more pleasant for Americans over the last 40 years, which may explain why much of the public doesn't rank climate change as big a threat as do scientists and the rest of the world, a new study suggests.¶But that perceived benefit of global warming -- mostly milder winters -- will soon be outweighed by more oppressive summer heat, according to a study in the journal Nature that's dividing the scientific community.¶""Americans are getting the wrong signal from year-round weather about whether they should be concerned about climate change,"" said study lead author Patrick Egan, a public policy professor at New York University. ""They're getting the good parts and haven't had to pay the price of the bad part.""¶More in Climate Change¶At least, not yet.¶If heat-trapping gases aren't controlled, nearly nine out of 10 Americans will have noticeably worse weather -- not better -- by the end of the century, especially in the summer, the study found.¶To try to understand America's reluctance to tackle climate change, Egan and Megan Mullin, an environmental policy professor at Duke University, created a weather preference index for Americans based on past studies that look at where people move, taking employment and other factors into account. It is essentially calculated on where people choose to live.¶And all things being equal, the average American prefers the weather to be warmer in the winter and less hot and humid in the summer. In other words, Miami, San Diego and Phoenix, which topped the chart of the new index. At the bottom are Pittsburgh, Cleveland and Detroit.¶Over the past 40 years, America's weather has trended closer toward Miami than Pittsburgh.¶""For the average American, the daily weather has gotten better,"" Mullin said. They like going coatless in December, as many did this past year.¶For 99 percent of Americans, winters have warmed by 1 degree Fahrenheit a decade in the winter and only a seventh of a degree a decade in the summer, the study found.¶America ""may have been lulled into complacency when it comes to the impacts of climate change,"" said Penn State climate scientist Michael Mann, who wasn't part of the study but called it a solid analysis. He and other scientists said the study raises interesting points, but climate change has other major impacts on people. It can trigger droughts, floods and heavy rainfalls; increase sea levels; make food and water scarce; and spread insect-borne diseases.¶Other scientists dismissed the study. Matthew Nisbet, who studies climate communications at Northeastern University, said it was seriously flawed. He said looking at where people live is a not a good indicator of the weather people prefer.¶Nisbet and University of Oklahoma meteorology professor Renee McPherson said politics, more than weather, colors people's perception of climate change, according to studies and surveys.¶Critics also noted that the study doesn't deal with extreme weather like this week's downpours in Houston, California's four-year drought or Superstorm Sandy. George Mason University professor Ed Maibach said surveys show that nearly 40 percent of Americans say extreme weather hit their community in the past year.¶""People moved from New Orleans because of Katrina, not because they thought Houston, Dallas or Oklahoma City had better evening temperatures,"" McPherson said.¶Mullin and Egan said their study could not incorporate the effect of extreme weather on people's preferences, adding that a key message is that scientists should talk more about extreme weather than average temperatures.¶According to Kevin Trenberth, climate analysis chief at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, hot summers are more of a problem than the study suggests. The fires, droughts and heat waves of a record hot 2012 cost $75 billion. In an email, he added: ""It is unconscionable to say the climate has improved when the only reason is because one can use air conditioning.""",0

            Samso Denmark model for world in renewable energy vs. climate change, global warming with sustainable solar, wind power - CBS News
    ",CBS News,"April 20, 2016, 7:05 AM","¶SAMSO, Denmark-- It's an out-of-the-way place that takes some getting to, but the little Danish island of Samso -- a 20-mile-long squiggle of farms and tidy villages -- is providing answers to some of the biggest questions facing our warming world.¶Samso's residents have already found ways to reduce their greenhouse gas output to effectively zero.¶They haven't done it using magical new technology, they've used what they have readily available; power from the wind, power from the sun and power from crop waste.¶On Samso, it's not just what they've done, it's how they've done it that has caught the world's attention.¶Soren Hermansen has led the island's climb to new heights of clean energy sustainability, and you've got to go a long way up -- right to the top of a mammoth wind turbine -- to understand how it works.¶The turbines weren't put up by some big conglomerate in search of government subsidies and profit. They were erected by local farmers and shareholders who saw that the island's economy could be improved -- and that they could cash in -- by investing in the environmental action.¶""We like the turbines better now because we own them!"" proclaimed Hermansen, surveying the landscape from atop one of the giant machines. ""We don't have the discussion about 'they are ugly on the landscape,' we don't have noise problems and the birds, for some reason, don't die around these turbines!""¶Farmer Jorgen Tranberg was one of the first to do well out of doing good. Half his income now comes from the power he sells from his wind turbine, and from the solar cells which cover his barns.¶""The wind turbine there will pay back two, three times,"" Tranberg told Phillips. ""Therefore I will build a new house.""¶The good news for the fewer than 4,000 people who live on Samso goes back almost two decades to when they started this project. Then it seemed unlikely that a speck of an island off the cold north coast of Europe could keep itself warm and prosperous on renewable energy alone.¶But when Phillips first visited Samso nine years ago, he found the plan was already working. Despite the lack of fossil fuels, his morning shower was exactly what it was supposed to be -- hot.¶Almost a decade later, it's still hot. But other things have changed around Samso. Once at the cutting edge of the response to climate change, Samso has now become a model for how it can be done.¶Politicians and environmental scientists from across Europe, Asia and the U.S. now come to the Energy Academy on the island to study the Samso model.¶And the islanders aren't done yet.¶The ferry to get you to Samso currently runs on natural gas, but there are plans to convert it to run on the methane produced from the back end of the island's pig population.¶""In Japan, they call it Viking leadership,"" laughs Hermansen, boasting of his tiny island's reputation in some of the world's most advanced societies.¶And with their knowledge and experience spreading fast, it does appear to be a whole new kind of Viking invasion.",0

    ","¶WASHINGTON --Earth's record monthly heat streak has hit 11 months in a row - a record in itself.¶The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced Tuesday that March's average global temperature of 54.9 degrees was not only the hottest March, but continues a record streak that started last May.¶According to NOAA climate scientist Jessica Blunden, the 11 heat records in a row smashes a streak of 10 straight months set in 1944. Climate scientists say this is a result of El Niño, along with relentless, man-made global warming.¶More in Climate Change¶Blunden and Michael Mann at the University of Pennsylvania worry that people will be desensitized to the drumbeat of broken records and will not realize the real affect they have on weather -- for example, massive changes in what is supposed to be winter in the Arctic. Greenland had a record early start for its ice sheet melting. The Arctic had its smallest winter maximum for sea ice and it was the second smallest March snow cover for the Northern Hemisphere.¶""It's becoming monotonous in a way,"" said Jason Furtado, a meteorology professor at the University of Oklahoma. ""It's absolutely disturbing ... We're losing critical elements of our climate system.""¶March was 2.2 degrees warmer than the 20th-century average. That's a record amount above average for any month, breaking the mark set only the month before. Africa and the Indian Ocean were especially warm, Blunden said.¶The first three months of the year were 2.07 degrees warmer than normal and half a degree warmer than the previous record start, set last year.¶This all came in the midst of a winter -- December through February -- that was also the warmest on record. That beat the previous record by more than half a degree.¶Georgia Tech climate scientist Kim Cobb commented on how unusual these heat increases have been lately. ""I feel like I'm looking at something out of a sci-fi movie,"" she wrote in an email earlier this year. ""In a way we are: it's like someone plucked a value off a graph from 2030 and stuck it on a graph of present temperatures. It is a portent of things to come, and it is sobering that such temperature extremes are already on our doorstep.""¶The record measurements are not just coming from NOAA. NASA, the Japanese weather agency and satellite tracking measurements have all reported that March was a record hot month. Blunden said there's a good chance April will mark a solid year of records. Eventually, she said, the record setting streak will come to an end as the El Niño dissipates.¶El Niño, a warming of parts of the Pacific which changes weather worldwide, tends to push global temperatures up. La Niña, its cooling flip side, is forecast for later this year.¶During this particularly strong El Niño, scientists have observed the six highest monthly global ocean temperature departures ever, which have all occurred over the past six months.¶Jeffrey Kluger, editor-at-large for Time magazine and Time.com, told ""CBS This Morning"" in January that the Earth has been suffering a ""chronic fever.""¶""We're already coming off of what's the hottest year on record, 2015,"" Kluger said. ""Now on top of that chronic fever comes the acute fever of El Niño.""¶What's to come from the transition from El Niño to La Niña? NOAA prediction center deputy director Mike Halpert said we could expect dry weather for the U.S. Southwest and parts of California. Of course, these areas haven't recovered from a debilitating four-year drought, suggesting that ""a dry winter next year won't be good, I can assure you of that.""¶Of course, warming temperatures have even more implications worldwide.¶""As the planet warms, the poles warm even faster, raising important questions about how ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica will respond,"" Andrea Dutton, a University of Florida geochemist and lead author of a study on rising sea levels published in Science last July, told CBS News in November. ""While this amount of sea-level rise will not happen overnight, it is sobering to realize how sensitive the polar ice sheets are to temperatures that we are on path to reach within decades.""¶For NOAA, this is the 37th time monthly heat records have been broken since the year 2000, but it has been more than 99 years since the last time a global cold record has been set.¶NOAA records go back to 1880.",0

    ","¶Spring thaw is coming exceptionally early in Greenland this year, with 50-degree Fahrenheit temperatures creating a melt area that makes up 12 percent of Earth's most northern ice sheet, according to data released this week by the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI).¶The scientists behind the report were shocked by what they found.¶""We had to check that our models were still working properly,"" Peter Langen, a climate scientist at DMI, said in a blog post.¶More in Climate Change¶This amount of ice melt is taking place about a month earlier than normal. The previous top three earliest dates for a melt area larger than 10 percent all took place in May. The researchers reported that those dates were May 5, 2010, and May 8 in 2006 and 1990.¶""Even weather stations quite high up on the ice sheet observed very high temperatures on Monday,"" said Robert Fausto, a scientist at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland who maintains melt data.¶At one site 1,850 meters (6,069 feet) above sea level, for example, the temperature reached 3.1 degrees Celsius, or 37.5 degrees Fahrenheit -- hardly tropical, but warm enough to start melting. ""This would be a warm day in July, never mind April,"" Fausto said.¶Other monitoring sites had daily average temperatures between 5 and 10 degrees Celsius (41 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit).¶It's only the latest example of the impact of accelerated global warming in recent years. 2015 was the hottest in recorded history. NASA data from this year shows that the Arctic experienced one of the mildest winters on record. The Arctic sea ice peaked at a record low of 5.607 million square miles this winter.¶Back in November, a NASA-funded report published in the journal Science revealed that Zachariæ Isstrøm, a giant glacier in the northeast of Greenland, is melting at such a rapid rate that it could lead to a continuous sea level rise for decades to come.¶According to the Danish study, the ice melt occurring now was driven by warm air that advanced from the southwest, bringing rain with it along the coast. The researchers said this was similar to an extreme ice melt in 2012, when an astonishing 95 percent of the ice sheet surface experienced melt.¶Usually at this time of year, rainfall and ice sheet meltwater encounters snow and re-freezing.¶""Meltwater refreezing releases heat into the snow at depth, reducing the amount of heating needed for melt to start and forming ice layers that can help meltwater run off the ice sheet earlier with climate warming,"" said Jason Box of the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland.¶""It is a very unusual situation, especially so early in the year, with very cold air and deep low pressures system to the west and east of Greenland and very warm air forming a 'cap' over the island,"" Martin Stendel, a DMI climate scientist, said on the organization's website. ""This helped to force a frontal system with very warm air up the west coast bringing rain over the ice sheet.""",0
"Global warming changing Earth's wobble, NASA says","

    ","¶WASHINGTON -- Global warming is shifting the way the Earth wobbles on its polar axis, a new NASA study finds.¶Melting ice sheets - especially in Greenland - are changing the distribution of weight on Earth. And that has caused both the North Pole and the wobble, which is called polar motion, to change course, according to a study published Friday in the journal Science Advances.¶Scientists and navigators have been accurately measuring the true pole and polar motion since 1899 and for almost the entire 20th century they migrated a bit toward Canada. But that has changed with this century and now it's moving toward England, said study lead author Surendra Adhikari at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab.¶""The recent shift from the 20th-century direction is very dramatic,"" Adhikari said.¶More in Climate Change¶While scientists say the shift is harmless, it is meaningful. Jonathan Overpeck, professor of geosciences at the University of Arizona who wasn't part of the study, said ""this highlights how real and profoundly large an impact humans are having on the planet.""¶Since 2003, Greenland has lost on average more than 600 trillion pounds of ice a year and that affects the way the Earth wobbles in a manner similar to a figure skater lifting one leg while spinning, said NASA scientist Eirk Ivins, the study's co-author.¶Ivins said he likes to think of it as a billion trucks each year dumping ice out of Greenland. On top of that, West Antarctica loses 275 trillion pounds of ice and East Antarctica gains about 165 trillion pounds of ice yearly, helping tilt the wobble further, Ivins said.¶They all combine to pull polar motion toward the east, Adhikari said.¶Jianli Chen, a senior research scientist at the University of Texas' Center for Space Research, first attributed the pole shift to climate change in 2013 and he said this new study takes his work a step further.¶""There is nothing to worry about,"" said Chen, who wasn't part of the NASA study.

    ","¶WASHINGTON --  Warmer air, less frigid water and gravity may combine to make parts of Antarctica's western ice sheet melt far faster than scientists had thought, raising sea levels much more than expected by the end of the century, according to a new study.¶New physics-based computer simulations forecast dramatic increases in melting in the vulnerable western edge of the continent. In a worst case scenario, that could raise sea level in 2100 by 18 to 34 inches more than an international panel of climate scientists predicted just three years ago.¶And even if the countries of the world control heat-trapping gases at the moderate levels they pledged in Paris last year, it would still mean three to 12 inches higher seas than have been forecast thought, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal Nature.¶More in Climate Change¶By the year 2500, in the worst case scenario, the simulations predict seas 42 feet higher -- purely from Antarctic melt.¶""You're remapping the way the planet looks from space with those numbers, not just subtle changes about which neighborhoods are going to be susceptible to storm surge,"" said study lead author Robert DeConto, a climate scientist at the University of Massachusetts.¶This is all because Antarctica is one of the biggest wild cards when scientists try to assess the effects of man-made climate change in upcoming decades. Scientists were caught by surprise when the western portion of the continent started showing signs of rapid ice loss in the last decade or so.¶The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has not forecast much sea level rise from Antarctica -- just seven inches by 2100 in their last report. For this century, the panel saw water expanding from heat, glacier melt and Greenland ice sheet loss as bigger factors.¶Instead of 7 inches, DeConto's simulations forecast sea level rise from Antarctica's melt alone as 2 to 3 feet in the worst case scenario and 10 to 19 inches if greenhouse gas emissions are moderately controlled. And if the world cracks down more dramatically on heat-trapping gases, Antarctica would essentially not add anything to sea level rise, the study said.¶But those figures are just worldwide averages. In many places on the East Coast, like Boston, it could be 25 percent more than that because of geological conditions, DeConto said.¶""North America has a lot to fear from ice loss from West Antarctica, which is where it all begins,"" DeConto said.¶While other studies have looked at the effect of warming from water below ice sheets and the air that melts from above, DeConto adds in the effect of pooling water and giant ice cliffs. Those ice cliffs, which can be dozens and even hundreds of feet high, can then collapse from the sheer weight of ice and that hastens glacier and ice sheet retreat, he said.¶Ted Scambos at the University of Colorado, who wasn't part of the new study, said it was plausible and used ""a few simple yet under-appreciated factors regarding ice retreat.""¶Carnegie Institute climate scientist Chris Field said the study drives home the difference the world can make by controlling its greenhouse gas emissions. It's the difference between rising seas that can be managed and conditions that are ""dangerously risky,"" he said.",0

""There's also extensive bleaching in the soft corals, and it is also affecting anemones and giant clams.""¶What exactly is coral bleaching? It occurs when unusual environmental conditions, like increased sea temperatures, result in corals expelling small photosynthetic algae -- zooxanthellae -- which normally provide oxygen and nutrients. The loss leaves the corals to turn white. The corals are able to recover if temperatures drop and the structures can then be re-settled by zooxanthellae. But otherwise the corals will die.¶It is one of the more visible, worrying results of climate change on the world's oceans.¶Terry Hughes, who led the study, told the broadcasting company ""it is too early"" to determine how many of the bleached corals observed in the aerial survey will die, but he didn't sound optimistic.¶""Judging from the extreme level even the most robust corals are snow white,"" he said.

    ","¶More than 13 million Americans could become climate refugees by 2100 if the worst sea-level rise comes to pass, new research suggests.¶Rising seas caused by climate change could permanently flood hundreds of U.S. counties, according to the study. The hardest-hit county will be Miami-Dade, Florida, where 2 million people could be forced to relocate. In fact, Florida is home to about half of these potential U.S. climate refugees.¶""The Great Migration of southern African-Americans from the South into the North is pretty much the same kind of magnitude we're talking about it if we don't adequately address sea-level rise,"" said study co-author Mathew Hauer, a demography doctoral candidate at the University of Georgia in Athens. [See Which Counties Could House the U.S. Climate Refugees]¶More in Climate Change¶However, city, county, state and local governments can take steps to mitigate some of these effects, while global work to stem climate change could mean the worst-case scenario never comes to pass, the researchers wrote in the paper, which was published March 14 in the journal Nature Climate Change.¶Growing coastal population¶Past studies have provided estimates, based on current population levels, of how many people climate change would affect. However, some of the fastest-growing areas of the country are situated on the coasts, in low-lying areas vulnerable to climate change.¶To get a better sense of how many people would be affected in the future if current growth rates are sustained, Hauer and his colleagues analyzed census data from counties around the continental United States. The team looked at historical growth rates in coastal regions, and then used those numbers to project future population levels. Based on the projections, the study found that population in coastal areas could be up to three times that of current levels.¶The team then combined those estimates with estimates of sea-level rise from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).¶In the NOAA's worst-case scenario, the oceans will rise about 6 feet (1.8 meters), on average, by 2100. These NOAA estimates account for permanent coastal flooding but not other potential hazards of climate change, such as increased hurricane numbers and intensity or storm surges.¶If there is no climate change mitigation, 13 million people would be forced to move because their homes become partially submerged under water, the researchers found. In a better scenario, with only 3 feet (0.9 m) of sea-level rise, only 4.2 million people would be forced to move, the study found.¶Mitigation¶Of course, the millions displaced are not a foregone conclusion. For one, historical growth rates may not be a good predictor for future growth rates; some low-lying coastal areas are already so densely populated that they are unlikely to grow in the future, while others may be actively discouraging growth in vulnerable areas or taking steps to mitigate climate impacts, Hauer said.¶Right now, climate change policy is often driven from the bottom up, by county- and city-level zoning laws, Hauer said.¶Still, counties, cities and states can take a variety of steps to avoid a forced mass-migration, he said.¶""You have protection, you have accommodation and you also have retreat,"" Hauer told Live Science.¶For instance, in some areas, sea walls or marsh restoration may be sufficient to prevent the worst effects of sea-level rise, while in other places, zoning laws that discourage future building altogether may be the smartest approach, Hauer said.¶""New York City is going to be able to adapt differently than, say, New Orleans,"" Hauer said.¶Follow Tia Ghose on Twitter and Google+.

Sea levels rising at a rapid pace,"

    ","¶WASHINGTON -- Sea levels on Earth are rising several times faster than they have in the past 2,800 years and are accelerating because of man-made global warming, according to new studies.¶An international team of scientists dug into two dozen locations across the globe to chart gently rising and falling seas over centuries and millennia. Until the 1880s and the world's industrialization, the fastest seas rose was about 1 to 1.5 inches (3 to 4 centimeters) a century, plus or minus a bit. During that time global sea level really didn't get much higher or lower than 3 inches above or below the 2,000-year average.¶But in the 20th century the world's seas rose 5.5 inches (14 centimeters). Since 1993 the rate has soared to a foot per century (30 centimeters). And two different studies published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, said by 2100 that the world's oceans will rise between 11 to 52 inches (28 to 131 centimeters), depending on how much heat-trapping gas Earth's industries and vehicles expel.¶""There's no question that the 20th century is the fastest,"" said Rutgers earth and planetary sciences professor Bob Kopp, lead author of the study that looked back at sea levels over the past three millennia. ""It's because of the temperature increase in the 20th century which has been driven by fossil fuel use.""¶More in Climate Change¶To figure out past sea levels and rates of rise and fall, scientists engaged in a ""geological detective story,"" said study co-author Ben Horton, a Rutgers marine scientist. They went around the world looking at salt marshes and other coastal locations and used different clues to figure out what the sea level was at different times. They used single cell organisms that are sensitive to salinity, mangroves, coral, sediments and other clues in cores, Horton said. On top of that they checked their figures by easy markers such as the rise of lead with the start of the industrial age and isotopes only seen in the atomic age.¶When Kopp and colleagues charted the sea level rise over the centuries - they went back 3,000 years, but aren't confident in the most distant 200 years - they saw Earth's sea level was on a downward trend until the industrial age.¶Sea level rise in the 20th century is mostly man-made, the study authors said. A separate, not-yet-published study by Kopp and others found since 1950, about two-thirds of the U.S. nuisance coastal floods in 27 locales have the fingerprints of man-made warming.¶And if seas continue to rise, as projected, another 18 inches of sea level rise is going to cause lots of problems and expense, especially with surge during storms, said study co-author Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany.¶""There is such a tight relationship between sea level and temperature,"" Horton said. ""I wish there wasn't, then we wouldn't be as worried.""¶The link to temperature is basic science, the study's authors said. Warm water expands. Cold water contracts. The scientists pointed to specific past eras when temperatures and sea rose and fell together.¶The Kopp study and a separate one published by another team projected future sea level rise based on various techniques. They came to the same general estimates, despite using different methods, said Anders Levermann, a co-author of the second paper and a researcher at the Potsdam Institute.¶If greenhouse gas pollution continues at the current pace, both studies project increases of about 22 to 52 inches (57 to 131 centimeters). If countries fulfill the treaty agreed upon last year in Paris and limit further warming to another 2 degrees Fahrenheit, sea level rise would be in the 11 to 22 inch range (28 to 56 centimeters).¶Jonathan Overpeck at the University of Arizona, who wasn't part of the studies, praised them, saying they show a clear cause and effect between warming and sea level rise.",0

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which calculates temperatures differently, said last month was 1.87 degrees, which is the second biggest margin in history. NOAA said the greatest was this past December.¶More in Climate Change¶January's average global temperature was a record 55.5 degrees Fahrenheit, easily beating the old January record set in 2007, according to NOAA. Records go back to 1880.¶There were colder-than-normal patches in parts of the United States, Europe and Asia in January, but they were overwhelmed by incredible ""off our chart"" warming in the Arctic region, according to NOAA climate scientist Jessica Blunden. Siberia, northwest Canada, and a lot of Alaska were at least 9 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal, she said.¶That heat was why there was record low sea ice in the Arctic for this time of year, when sea ice grows, Blunden said.¶January Arctic sea ice averaged only 5.2 million square miles in January, which is 90,000 square miles below the previous record set in 2011, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. It's also 402,000 square miles - about the size of Texas and New Mexico, combined - less than the 30-year normal.¶The string of nine consecutive record hot months matches June 1997 to February 1998, which was the last time Earth had a large El Nino. It is still behind the 10 straight months of record heat in 1944, Blunden said. It's likely we'll tie that record in February, she said.¶The current El Nino - an occasional natural warming of parts of the Pacific that changes weather around the world and spikes global temperatures - is tied with 1997-1998 for the strongest on record, according to NOAA. And while it has been predicted to ease soon, it has not lessened yet, said NOAA Climate Prediction Center deputy director Mike Halpert.¶NASA chief climate scientist Gavin Schmidt blamed the record heat mostly on man-made climate change, with an assist from El Nino.",0

    ","¶An unexpected impact of climate change could result in longer, more expensive, and more turbulent transatlantic flights from London to New York. A new study published in Environmental Research Letters suggests that warming global temperatures are affecting atmospheric wind patterns, which, in turn, affects air travel routes.¶""When we think of global warming, we're usually thinking about the fact that it's getting warmer at ground level, but in fact the temperatures are changing higher up in the atmosphere, too, including where planes fly at 35,000 feet,"" the lead author, atmospheric scientist Paul Williams, said in a video included with the study.¶Williams and colleagues at the University of Reading in the UK found other impacts of climate change on air travel include increased turbulence, increased take-off weight restrictions, and additional fuel burning as a result of longer flight times.¶More in Climate Change¶To determine exactly how warming temperatures would affect flights, the researchers fed synthetic atmospheric wind fields that were generated from climate model simulations into the kind of routing algorithm that would normally be used by flight planners. This created a series of flight scenarios under different temperature conditions.¶The researchers wanted to find out what would happen to flights between the two cities when the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide is doubled from pre-industrial levels -- something that is projected to happen by the year 2050 unless efforts are made to aggressively curb current emissions.¶The scientists determined that the resulting strengthening of jet-stream winds would shorten eastbound flights slightly, while westbound flights got significantly longer -- an overall increase of about one minute in flight time roundtrip. According to the study, aircraft would be collectively airborne for an additional 2,000 hours each year, which would result in burning 7.2 million extra gallons of fuel, an additional cost estimated at $22 million a year.¶And of course, burning this amount of jet fuel would release even more harmful carbon emissions into the atmosphere -- an estimated 70 million kilograms (154.3 million pounds) of carbon dioxide, which is equivalent to the annual emissions of 7,100 average British homes, the researchers said.",0

However, the scientists say this view is too narrow and that policy-makers and the public need to consider longer-term effects of climate change.¶""Much of the carbon we are putting in the air from burning fossil fuels will stay there for thousands of years -- and some of it will be there for more than 100,000 years,"" Peter Clark, a professor in the College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences at Oregon State University and lead author on the article, said in a statement. ""People need to understand that the effects of climate change on the planet won't go away, at least not for thousands of generations.""¶More in Climate Change¶Scientists gathered evidence of global temperatures and sea levels dating back to the last Ice Age, some 10,000 years ago, to help model the results of burning fossil fuels and project the impact 10,000 years into the future.¶In the most conservative scenario, they estimated an output of 1,280 billion tons of carbon over the next few centuries -- far below estimated reserves of at least 9,500 billion tons. The projected consequences for this level of carbon output looked disastrous:¶Scientists also calculated three other scenarios with total carbon emissions output of up to 5,120 billion tons, which resulted in even graver consequences.¶""Carbon is going up, and even if we stop what we are doing in the relatively near future, the system will continue to respond because it hasn't reached an equilibrium,"" co-author Shaun Marcott, an assistant professor of geoscience at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said in a statement. ""If you boil water and turn off the burner, the water will stay warm because heat remains in it.""¶By reconstructing data from the last Ice Age, scientists were able to see, for example, that the sea-level rise of 130 meters (426 feet) took nearly 10,000 years to retreat, stabilizing the climate enough for human civilization to flourish.¶""This sort of side-by-side comparison of the long past and the long future has not been shown before, but is useful for seeing the geological scale to the consequences of carbon emissions since the dawn of industrialization until our actions today,"" said Boston College paleo-climatologist Jeremy Shakun, a co-author of the report.¶The paper argues that just lowering emissions is not enough -- it says the goal should be total elimination of carbon emissions.¶""Taking the first steps is important, but it is essential to see these as the start of a path toward total decarbonization,"" Daniel Schrag, the Sturgis Hooper Professor of Geology at Harvard University, said. ""This means continuing to invest in innovation that can someday replace fossil fuels altogether. Partial reductions are not going to do the job.""¶""To spare future generations from the worst impacts of climate change, the target must be zero -- or even negative carbon emissions -- as soon as possible,"" Clark said.",0

This was the first sighting of gray whales in the Atlantic in more than 200 years; they are normally found only in the Pacific.¶Using ancient DNA and predictive habitat modeling, Alter and colleagues also found that gray whales traveled between ocean basins during climate warming that occurred in the late Pleistocene and early Holocene time period around 11,000 years ago. ¶Alter said that there would be ecosystem effects if gray whales recolonized the Atlantic. ""Gray whales are ecosystem engineers,"" she told CBS News. ""They scoop up mouthfuls of mud and act like bulldozers, moving around mud and resuspending nutrients so they can be used by other marine creatures and seabirds.""¶Killer whales¶Killer whales, or orcas, are the most widely distributed marine mammal, found in all parts of the oceans except for the Arctic, where they were restricted by thick ice. In recent years however, killer whales have been found in ice-free areas of Hudson Bay, in northeast Canada.¶""They're showing up in inlets and channels that a lot of marine mammals will avoid because the areas freeze,"" Alter told CBS News. Alter noted that killer whales populating the Arctic would ""have a major ecological impact"" because they might chase prey species out of their habitats. Killer whales have already been documented preying on beluga, narwhal, bowhead and at least four species of seal in Hudson Bay.¶Shearwaters¶The Manx shearwater is a small relative of the albatross. The known breeding range of this seabird is limited to the North Atlantic. However, the species has been increasingly observed in the North Pacific. Numbers increased so much in the 1990s that researchers think they might be breeding in the North Pacific now, too. Another species, the great shearwater, has also been seen, mostly in the summer months, including two sightings off the coast of California in the summer of 2013.¶""While shearwaters are long-range migrants that may be capable of a southerly passage, the increasing frequency of out-of-range observations and the fact that they occur during the summer when sea ice is at a minimum suggest movement across the Northern Passages and Arctic Ocean,"" the paper stated.¶The Northern Gannet¶The northern gannet is a migratory seabird which spends winters off the southern coast of the United States and summers farther north. In March they migrate north to breeding grounds on northern sea cliffs along the coast of Atlantic Canada and the United States. This seabird's range is normally limited to the North Atlantic Ocean. ""Sea ice presents an effective barrier because this species feeds on fish and needs access to open water when flying long distances,"" the paper stated. However, a northern gannet was observed in Alaska on two separate occasions in 2011. Then in April 2012, another northern gannet was spotted in the Farallon Islands off Northern California.¶Due to its mode of feeding, researchers suggest that the bird most likely entered the Pacific via the Northwest Passages or the Arctic Ocean.¶Auks¶Auks are any of 22 species (21 still living) of diving birds in the Northern Hemisphere. Sea ice can impact the feeding of these birds so some are restricted to the Pacific. However, a number of Pacific species of auk, including long-billed murrelets, have been observed in the Atlantic in recent years. A tufted puffin was seen in European waters and Maine. ¶The bridled morph of the common murre, a seabird that represents nearly 50 percent of individuals at some North Atlantic colonies, was recorded in the Pacific for the first time in 2008. ¶""It is natural for animals to move into new areas that are available to them,"" Nathaniel E. Seavy, Ph.D., research director of the Pacific Coast and Central Valley Group for Point Blue Conservation Science, told CBS News in an email. ""Biologists think that sometimes this happens because they are lost, and sometimes it happens deliberately as animals are searching for food or other resources.  This process of moving into areas is called dispersal, and it is one ways that animals can survive as conditions change.""¶ Seavy did however, note that the movement of species between ocean basins raises some questions. ""My greatest concern is what these movements mean for how we conserve and manage our environment.""¶Seaducks¶Subspecies of seaducks have also been recorded moving between opposite ocean basins. The Pacific subspecies of common eider was observed in Norway in 2014 and Newfoundland in 2005 while the Atlantic subspecies of that bird was found in Del Norte County, California.¶""This is an example of how climate is changing the distribution of wildlife,"" Seavy said.  ¶Researchers will continue to monitor changes in the wildlife community and to investigate the ecological and evolutionary consequences of ocean-basin exchanges. Researchers note that it is possible that some species may be able to establish themselves in new environments with relatively little disruption to other wildlife. But there will be cases where the arrival of new species will have a negative effect on ecosystems if they compete for food or other resources.¶""That makes it important to continuing monitoring these changes,"" Seavy said. ""And we will use this information to develop climate-smart strategies for conserving wildlife in a rapidly changing world.""",0

            ​Wild December weather, thanks to El Niño - CBS News
    ",CBS News,"December 27, 2015, 9:23 AM","¶Tornadoes ripping through Texas yesterday. Earlier in the week, there were some 18 deaths from twisters and flooding in the Southeast; and of course, there were record highs in the East. What's going on with all this MOSTLY STRANGE weather?  Our Cover Story is reported by Mark Strassmann:¶Last Christmas, Buffalo, N.Y., looked like the North Pole. This year? Santa wore shorts. A few flakes finally fell last week -- smashing a 116-year record for the longest streak with no snow.¶In cities up and down the East Coast, Christmas Eve was the warmest ever. It felt like summer in the Big Apple, with temperatures in the 70s.¶""Oh, this is awesome,"" said one boy. ""Being able to see 70 degree weather in New York City on Christmas Eve, is something really cool to experience.""¶""Where's the nearest beach?"" one guy said. ¶This month's wacky warm weather has broken more than a thousand records from coast to coast. ¶""This December has been exceptional for a lot of areas of the country,"" said Eric Fisher, chief meteorologist for CBS Station WBZ in Boston. ""You look into the Northwest where the rain and snow has been nonstop. You look into the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, upper Midwest -- winter completely on pause, and temperatures that are so far above average they'll be smashing records before we're done.¶""To me, this is the most staggering thing: In the Boston area we're going to see the coldest winter month ever recorded and the warmest winter month ever recorded in the same year in 144 years of records.""¶The nation's weather map essentially is divided in half: In many Eastern cities, temperatures are as high as 30 degrees above normal.¶Out West, it's colder and wetter than it's been in years. Two weeks ago, dangerous floods in Oregon swallowed homes and prompted terrifying rescue missions.¶So what's up? Scientists say what's behind this weather madness, in part, is a phenomenon that goes back millennia: El Niño. It's a year-long warming that takes place along the equator in the eastern half of the tropical Pacific, related to changes in the trade winds.¶Nate Mantua, a climatologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Santa Cruz, California, has been studying the effects of El Niño for 30 years. Every four to seven years, he says, those Pacific trade winds weaken. ""And when that happens, there's a massive shift in rainfall patterns in the tropics. So wet places end up being really dry, and normally dry places end up getting lots of rainfall.""¶Mantua says the current El Niño is among the three strongest since 1950, at least. ""So it's among the strongest in the historical record."" ¶So strong that the effects of this El Niño can be seen on every weather forecaster's radar the world over. ¶Louis Uccellini, director of the National Weather Service, says El Niño causes the temperature of the Pacific Ocean to increase up to ten degrees -- and triggers a ripple effect across the globe. ¶""Wetter than normal [in the West],"" he said, ""and as we see the El Niño pattern evolve, we should see a more active storm track along the South, so wetter and warmer [there].""¶And as if right on cue, over the last five days, killer tornadoes swept across the South, killing more than 20 people from Texas to Tennessee.¶Strassmann asked, ""So what, to you, is worrisome about all this?""¶""There are parts of the globe that are impacted by El Niño that do suffer form those impacts,"" Uccellini replied. ""Increased drying in Brazil and Indonesia with possibility of forest fires. Increased precipitation over Africa, central Africa and east Africa, which lends itself to the the increased likelihood of disease outbreaks like malaria and dengue fever.""¶But can these alarming weather events also be blamed on climate change? Scientists say, not so fast. ¶""Maybe climate change adds a couple more warm days, or makes the warmest temperatures a little bit warmer,"" said Eric Fisher. ""I don't think that you can just say that because it's a warming world, we're seeing a record warm December. You might be enhancing the normal pattern that would have happened anyway by a little bit.""¶In California, oceans that were already warming are getting even hotter. And that has created a crisis for creatures who live in it.",0
Paris climate goals mean emissions need to drop below zero,"
","
December 24, 2015 / 5:27 PM
      / CBS/AP
    ","¶STOCKHOLM -- If governments are serious about the global warming targets they adopted in Paris, scientists say they have two options: eliminating fossil fuels immediately or finding ways to undo their damage to the climate system in the future.¶The first is politically impossible -- the world is still hooked on using oil, coal and natural gas -- which leaves the option of a major cleanup of the atmosphere later this century.¶""The problem's not solved because of this accord, but make no mistake, the Paris agreement establishes the enduring framework the world needs to solve the climate crisis,"" President Obama said in a speech from the White House's Cabinet Room. ""It creates the mechanism, the architecture, for us to continually tackle this problem in an effective way.""¶Yet the landmark Paris Agreement, adopted by 195 countries on Dec. 12, makes no reference to that, which has left some observers wondering whether politicians understand the implications of the goals they signed up for.¶More in Climate Change¶""I would say it's the single biggest issue that has to be resolved,"" said Glen Peters of the Cicero climate research institute in Oslo, Norway.¶Scientists refer to this envisioned cleanup job as negative emissions - removing more greenhouse gases from the atmosphere than humans put in it.¶Right now we're putting in a lot -- about 50 billion tons a year, mostly carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels for energy.¶There are methods to achieve negative emissions today but they would need to be scaled up to a level that experts say could put climate efforts in conflict with other priorities, such as eradicating hunger. Still, if the Paris climate goals are to be achieved, there's no way to avoid the issue, said Jan Minx of the Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate change in Berlin.¶""My view is, let's have this discussion,"" he said. ""Let's involve ourselves in developing these technologies. We need to keep learning.""¶The Paris Agreement was historic. For the first time all countries agreed to jointly fight climate change, primarily by reducing the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.¶Governments vowed to keep global warming ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) compared with preindustrial times. But even 2 degrees of warming could threaten the existence of low-lying island nations faced with rising seas. So governments agreed to try to limit warming to 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F), which is just half-a-degree above the global average temperature this year.¶That goal is so ambitious - some would say far-fetched - that there's been very little research devoted to it. In Paris, politicians asked scientists to start studying how it can be done.¶Minx and others said it's clear the goal cannot be reached without negative emissions in the future, because the atmosphere is filling up with greenhouse gases so fast that it may already be too late to keep the temperature rise below 1.5 degrees C.¶""We are late with climate policy. We need to buy back some time,"" Minx said.¶That means allowing warming to exceed 1.5 degrees temporarily and then bringing it down by removing carbon dioxide, which traps heat in the atmosphere.¶The deal also commits countries to deliver $100 billion a year in aid for developing countries by 2020, with a promise to increase financing in the future.¶The task would be enormous. One recent study said hundreds of billions of tons of carbon dioxide would have to be removed in the second half of this century.¶That has led some scientists to consider controversial geoengineering solutions like fertilizing the oceans with iron to make them absorb more carbon.¶But the more viable methods being discussed today include planting more forests, which absorb carbon dioxide naturally as they grow, and combining bioenergy with carbon capture technologies.¶Bioenergy comes from burning biological sources such as trees or crops. That results in zero net emissions, if the carbon dioxide released when one tree is burned is offset by the carbon dioxide absorbed when a new tree grows up.¶However, if you also capture the emissions from the bioenergy plant and bury them underground, you are actually removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.¶Although the technology exists, it has received very little attention from policy makers, advocates say. There's only one large-scale biomass facility worldwide using the method: a bioethanol plant in Decatur, Illinois.¶""It's been treated as an esoteric, maybe unnecessary field of research,"" said Henrik Karlsson, who heads Biorecro, a Swedish company that specializes in the process.¶The obstacles are many. Carbon capture technology is very expensive. And then there's the issue of finding places to store the carbon dioxide once you've captured it.¶Typically it is injected into rock formations deep underground, but ""people don't like carbon stored under them,"" said Peters. ""It's not just a few tons. It's billions of tons a year.""¶Another problem is that to reach a point where the method actually generates enough negative emissions to enable the 1.5-degree target, bioenergy would need to be much a bigger part of the global energy mix. It's just 10 percent today.¶Critics say that could mean converting millions of acres of farmland used for food production to grow biocrops, which could clash with Article 2 of the Paris Agreement, which says the battle against climate change must be carried out ""in a manner that does not threaten food production.""¶Right now the idea of achieving negative emissions may seem like a pipe dream. Governments are still trying to stop record emissions from growing even higher, while allowing developing countries including India and China to expand their economies.¶Oliver Geden of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs said the temperature goals governments adopted in Paris don't match the actions nations are taking to limit emissions.¶""It's so easy to have this kind of target,"" he said. ""I don't understand that given the history of the (U.N. climate talks), everyone is taking this seriously.""¶Peters said achieving the 1.5-degree C target is ""pretty unlikely"" and that even the higher temperature target would be difficult and most likely require negative emissions.¶¶""It's really hard to see that 2 degrees will remain on the table unless you have some fundamental technological breakthrough,"" he said. ""There are just too many competing interests.""",0
Loss of Arctic ice may mean more precipitation,"
","
December 21, 2015 / 5:41 PM
      / AP
    ","¶ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- The Arctic is seeing more precipitation as sea ice diminishes from climate warming, according to a research paper by U.S. and Canada scientists.¶The study by three Dartmouth College researchers and one from Carleton University in Ottawa, Ontario, concludes the effects from a changed hydrologic cycle is a potential major component of climate change that could create uncertainty in climate predictions. They also say it's too soon to tell whether more precipitation will slow warming or add to it.¶Scientists have generally assumed that less sea ice would mean more evaporation and more precipitation, said Ben Kopec, a Dartmouth earth sciences doctoral student and lead author of the paper published Monday in the journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.¶""Our goal with this work was to try to actually use observations of precipitation around the Arctic to get at this question of how much does sea ice influence precipitation, and if we lose sea ice, how much precipitation do you think will increase?"" he said in a phone interview.¶More in Climate Change¶Arctic precipitation is composed of moisture from local and distance sources, he said.¶""Most of the world gets its moisture from the warm waters in the subtropics,"" Kopec said. As moisture moves north from lower latitudes, including the North Pacific in Alaska's case, much of it falls before reaching the Arctic.¶An increase in moisture from local sources, Kopec said, though small in comparison to evaporation in warmer oceans, could disproportionately affect Arctic sites.¶""In terms of the entire proportion that will reach a site in, say, Alaska, that local moisture becomes more important,"" he said.¶The scientists studied precipitation data collected between 1990 and 2012 at three sites in the Canadian Arctic and three in the Greenland Sea, looking for changes in the source of precipitation as sea ice has diminished. Moisture from a warm source can be distinguished from a cold source through measurements of isotope compositions, Kopec said.¶As sea ice diminished over two decades, precipitation at the Arctic sites increased and the percentage from local sources grew. The researchers concluded that when sea ice decreases by 100,000 square kilometers, or 38,610 square miles, the percentage of local-sourced moisture increased by 18.2 percent in the Canadian Arctic and 10.8 percent in the Greenland Sea.¶""We can say that with less sea ice, more of that moisture that fell was sourced from the Arctic,"" Kopec said.¶Julienne Stroeve, senior research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado in Boulder, said previous studies have suggested a link between less September sea ice and an increase in snow in the Siberian Arctic.¶""At least statistically there's a correlation between less sea ice and more precipitation in certain parts of the Arctic,"" she said.¶Before the ocean can refreeze, she said, it has to release heat it gained in summer. If it's shown that additional precipitation is from a local source, it would match other studies suggesting additional precipitation from waters formerly covered by ice at that time, Stroeve said.¶Kopec said if precipitation falls as snow, it could increase the days that land reflects solar energy, providing a cooling effect.¶If the additional precipitation falls as rain, it could cause earlier spring melt or later onset of autumn snow coverage, contributing to more warming.¶""It's important for us in the future to nail down whether this is going to be more snow or more rain,"" Kopec said. ""But we were able to say, 'This could have a large impact on the energy balance.""",0

    ","¶NEW YORK -- The warming Arctic has set another record.¶The average air temperature over Arctic land reached 2.3 degrees F (1.3 degrees C) above average for the year ending in September. That's the highest since observations began in 1900.¶The new mark was noted in the annual Arctic Report Card, released Tuesday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Arctic centers on the North Pole and reaches into North America and Eurasia.¶More in Climate Change¶""Warming is happening more than twice as fast in the Arctic than anywhere else in the world. We know this is due to climate change,"" NOAA chief scientist Rick Spinrad told reporters in San Francisco at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union.¶Another record emerged for sea ice, which appears when Arctic Ocean water freezes. When it reached its peak coverage in February, it was the lowest maximum extent since records began in 1979. The minimum ice coverage, reached in September, was the fourth lowest on record.¶""We are increasing greenhouse gases, the planet is heating up, the ice is melting, and this means we should expect new records to be set,"" Jennifer Kay, an atmospheric scientist at the Cooperative Institute for Research and Environmental Science at the University of Colorado, told CBS News last spring. ""The record-low Arctic sea ice extent this winter is not surprising to me from a scientific standpoint.""¶The retreat of sea ice is considered a threat to animals like walruses, which use it for mating, giving birth and getting out of the water.¶Walruses can use land instead to leave the water, but they are crowding onto beaches where a stampede can be devastating for calves, two editors of the report card told AP.¶Walruses have been hauling themselves out on land in northwest Alaska, a recent phenomenon, Martin Jeffries of the federal Office of Naval Research and Jackie Richter-Menge of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers wrote in a joint email.¶Snow cover in June in both the North American and Eurasian parts of the Arctic was at the second lowest level since records began in 1967. Reduced snow cover lets more sunlight through to the land, which absorbs the energy and gets warmer. Since 1979, the extent of June snow cover has been dropping by 18 percent per decade, the study said.",0

    ","¶Melting ice triggered by global warming may make Earth whirl faster than before and could shift the axis on which the planet spins, researchers say.¶This could also affect sunset times, as the length of Earth's day depends on the speed at which the planet rotates on its axis. Prior research found the rate at which Earth spins has changed over time.¶For instance, ancient Babylonian, Chinese, Arab and Greek astronomers often recorded when eclipses occurred and where these phenomena were seen. This knowledge, in combination with astronomical models that calculate what the positions of the Earth, sun and moon were on any given date and time, can help reveal how fast Earth must have been spinning. To do so, researchers calculate the speed necessary for the planet to face the sun and moon in ways that allowed those astronomers to observe the eclipses. [50 Amazing Facts About Earth]¶More in Climate Change¶In general, the gravitational pull of the moon and sun on Earth is relentlessly slowing the planet's rate of spin. However, in the short term, a variety of different factors can also speed up and slow down how fast Earth whirls.¶Previous research has found that melting glaciers triggered by global warming helped cause a significant amount of global sea-level rise in the 20th century. In theory, rising sea levels -- once estimated to be climbing at a rate of about 0.06 to 0.08 inches (1.5 to 2 millimeters) per year -- should also have slightly shifted Earth's axis and increased the rate at which the planet spins.¶When polar ice caps melt, they remove weight off underlying rock, which then rebounds upward. This makes the poles less flat and the planet more round overall. This should in turn cause Earth to tilt a bit and spin more quickly.¶However, previous research mysteriously could not find evidence that melting glaciers were triggering a shift in either Earth's rotation or axis that was as great as predicted. This problem is known as ""Munk's enigma,"" after oceanographer Walter Munk at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California, who first noted the mystery, in 2002.¶Now, in a new study, researchers may have solved this enigma and shown that rising sea levels are indeed affecting Earth's spin and axis.¶""The rise of sea level and the melting of glaciers during the 20th century is confirmed not only by some of the most dramatic changes in the Earth system -- for example, catastrophic flooding events, droughts [and] heat waves -- but also in some of the most subtle -- incredibly small changes in Earth's rotation rate,"" said study lead author Jerry X. Mitrovica, a geophysicist at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.¶First, the scientists noted that recent studies suggested 20th-century glacial melting was about 30 percent less severe than Munk assumed. This should significantly reduce the predicted amount of shift in Earth's spin and axis.¶Moreover, the research team's mathematical calculations and computer simulations found that prior research relied on erroneous models of Earth's internal structure. This meant previous studies did not correctly account for how much glaciers would deform underlying rock and influence Earth's spin.¶Furthermore, interactions between Earth's rocky mantle and the planet's molten metal outer core should have helped slow the planet's spin more than was previously thought.¶Altogether, these adjustments helped the scientists find that ongoing glacial melting and the resulting sea-level rise are affecting the Earth in ways that match theoretical predictions, astronomical observations, and geodetic or land-survey data.¶""What we believe in regard to melting of glaciers in the 20th century is completely consistent with changes in Earth's rotation [as] measured by satellites and astronomical methods,"" Mitrovica told Live Science. ""This consistency was elusive for a few years, but now the enigma is resolved.¶""Human-induced climate change is of such pressing importance to society that the responsibility on scientists to get things right is enormous,"" Mitrovica said. ""By resolving Munk's enigma, we further strengthen the already-strong argument that we are impacting climate.""¶The scientists detailed their findings online Dec. 11 in the journal Science Advances.¶Follow Live Science @livescience, Facebook & Google+.

            John Kerry: Climate deal is a ""breakaway agreement"" - CBS News
    ",Face The Nation,"December 13, 2015, 10:04 AM","¶Secretary of State John Kerry hailed the COP21 climate deal finalized in Paris this weekend as a ""break away agreement"" that will change the way countries think about carbon emissions.¶""The business community of the entire world is receiving a message of countries now moving towards clean, alternative, renewable energy and trying to reduce their carbon footprint. That is going to spur massive investment,"" Kerry said in an interview with CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that aired Sunday. ¶""People expect somewhere in the vicinity of $50 trillion to be spent over the course of the next 30, 40 years. That is going to be an enormous transformation of our economy and all to the better because it will reduce our dependency on foreign fuel, it will increase our security, it will provide for our environment, cleaner air, healthier, healthier people. They're just all kinds of pluses. And in the end it's going to be a job creator,"" Kerry added.¶One hundred ninety-five nations and the European Union adopted the plan Saturday. Nearly all of the countries that signed on - representing close to 100 percent of global carbon emissions - has set targets of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in order to slow global warming. ¶One of the biggest criticisms of the deal a lack of enforcement. While Kerry admitted that ""it's possible that a country will slip,"" he said it was ""essential"" that the final deal be very ambitious but also have ""flexibility"" for the countries who have signed on.¶And it won't mean an end to the coal, oil and gas markets.¶""We're going to continue to be pumping gas and using gas and oil for years to come. But what it does is it signals that there is a transformation taking place and people need to diversify, people need to look for cleaner ways of doing things,"" Kerry said.¶The secretary of state also weighed in on the 2016 presidential race, saying that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the U.S. is a ""very dangerous foreign policy.""¶""I believe that that kind of a ban is contrary to American values. It's contrary to our Constitution,"" Kerry said. ""But I also think it's a very dangerous foreign policy because it says to those in Islam who are trying to exploit people and recruit foreign fighters and otherwise, it says 'look, look at America. Here they've got a guy running for president who is waging war against Islam. That's their impression. It's exploitable, whether he intended it or not. And it allows for recruitment.¶""It allows for America to seem like it is indeed discriminatory against Islam, against Muslims. And it is highly discriminating against many Americans and others who are Muslim. And many people in the world who know that their religion has been hijacked and who want to recoup it,"" he added.

    ","¶After negotiators from nearly 200 countries struck a sweeping deal meant to combat the effects of climate change, President Obama praised the agreement as ""historic"" and attributed its passage to ""American leadership.""¶""The problem's not solved because of this accord, but make no mistake, the Paris agreement establishes the enduring framework the world needs to solve the climate crisis,"" the president said late Saturday in a speech from the White House's Cabinet Room. ""It creates the mechanism, the architecture, for us to continually tackle this problem in an effective way.""¶But who benefits from the new ""architecture"" the accord creates? And what will the deal cost for others? ¶On its face, the plan agreed to on Saturday affects just about every nation. It requires countries to limit the rise in global average temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius by the year 2100. It also sets an even more ambitious goal to slow the warming further -- down to just 1.5 degrees Celsius. (In the years since global industrialization, the world's temperature has already risen 1 degree Celsius.)¶To achieve this goal, countries that signed on to the agreement promised that they would focus on cultivating clean, renewable energy sources and shift from the use of fossil fuels. They will also be required to report on their progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions every five years. ¶More in Climate Change¶The deal also commits countries to deliver $100 billion a year in aid for developing countries by 2020, with a promise to increase financing in the future.¶According to President Obama, the targets are bold, but they also empower ""businesses, scientists, engineers, workers, and the private sector -- investors -- to work together."" ¶So there may be many vested parties with a stake in the climate change deal -- but there are also a few key winners and losers. We take a look at them here: ¶According to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre's (IDMC) 2015 Global Estimates report, ""an average of 26.4 million people per year have been displaced from their homes by disasters brought on by natural hazards"" since 2008. These threatened populations are largely found in developing countries, which tend to be more vulnerable to rises in sea level, droughts, and floods.¶The climate accord in Paris, however, have many in the developing world cheering.¶In a preamble, the deal doubles down on a pledge made six years ago, that richer, industrialized countries will contribute at least $100 billion of aid a year to poorer nations to help them battle the effects of climate change by 2020. It also promises that countries will consider increases to that amount in the future.¶Mohamed Adow, senior climate change adviser from the disaster relief agency Christian Aid, told CBS News that this is one of the most important aspects of the COP21 accord: the promise provides poorer nations with the ""assurance that the international community will not leave developing countries to deal with climate impact."" ¶Some nations were not entirely satisfied with the final language -- there is still, after all, no legally binding provision that holds industrialized countries to this pledge for ""adaptation"" funds -- but nonetheless, Adow said, it gives significant hope to those countries hit especially hard with the threat of displaced citizens.  ¶In fact, the aid money already seems to be flowing in light of the Paris negotiations: early this week, the U.S. promised to double its own aid to affected countries to $861 million as part of last-ditch efforts to push the climate deal through. ¶The effects of climate change in poor and developing nations also pose an increasing terror threat to the United States -- a connection that President Obama has made in the past, when he called global warming ""an economic and security imperative"" just weeks after the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris.  ¶As Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders explained it on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" in November: ""If we are going to see an increase in drought, in flood, and extreme weather disturbances as a result of climate change, what that means is that people all over the world are going to be fighting over limited natural resources... When people migrate into cities and they don't have jobs, there's going to be a lot more instability, a lot more unemployment, and people will be subject to the types of propaganda that al Qaeda and ISIS are using right now."" ¶Military reports have also viewed climate change as a ""catalyst for conflict,"" and the Pentagon's Quadrennial Defense Review last year dubbed its effects as ""threat multipliers"" that ultimately lead to ""conditions that can enable terrorist activity and other forms of violence."" ¶But the climate change deal seeks to mitigate these possible conflict catalysts so that ""countries that don't have the resources to address these problems head on, now will,"" Jon Powers, who served the Federal Chief Sustainability Officer and Special Advisor on Energy to the U.S. Army in the Obama Administration, told CBS News. ¶Of the promised $100 billion of aid yearly, Powers points out, ""that type of funding is going to the most vulnerable folks"" that would otherwise be prime targets of radicalization.¶One important target put forth by the deal was to ensure that parties would ""undertake rapid reductions thereafter in accordance with best available science, so as to achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century."" ¶Here, the deal aims to strangle heavy carbon-emitting industries -- the ""anthropogenic emissions"" -- and cut down on total fossil fuels burned worldwide. Importantly, it's also a nod to investment in and development of new technologies that would remove carbon dioxide from the air. ¶After leaving the Paris talks, U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz told CNBC in an interview, ""We recognize fossil fuels will continue to be a part of the portfolio for quite a long time,"" but that the popularity of other power sources are on the rise.¶""Wind energy has gone up by several fold just in the last five to six years,"" Moniz said, ""and now (wind) provides about 4.5 percent of our electricity. You add that with solar, we're talking 5 percent.""¶Mindy Lubber, whose non-profit Ceres gathered together a host of business leaders and investors in Paris to lobby for a strong climate deal, told CBS News that for businesses, the deal exacts ""a price on carbon"" and thus gives markets ""certainty of more investment in a green-energy future.""¶Ceres lobbyists were in Paris with large financial institutions like Bank of America and Citigroup -- companies that, according to Lubber, ""are seeing that investing in a fossil fuel economy is no longer viable."" ¶And even if they're not directly involved in renewable fuel markets, other global brands have have shown their support of the climate deal as well. ¶Rob Bernard, the Chief Environmental Strategist for Microsoft, said the Paris negotiations provide some assurance for ""corporations around the world to accelerate their low-carbon investments and foster the creation of a true low-carbon global economy.""¶Kathleen McLaughlin, the chief sustainability officer for Walmart, said in a statement that the company would ""support the U.N.'s call for the U.S. corporate sector to commit to science-based targets to reduce emissions.""¶Ahead of the Paris summit, China -- the world's biggest coal consumer -- said it would aim to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by nearly two-thirds of its 2005 levels. In the past, international monitoring of those numbers would have been difficult to do, but the COP21 deal changes that.¶The agreement holds nations accountable for reporting their progress on their climate goals in a global ""stocktake"" every five years starting in 2023. It also means countries will be monitoring, verifying and reporting their greenhouse gas emissions in a single accounting system.¶According to one report released last month by the carbon investment think tank Carbon Tracker, fossil fuel companies could risk over $2 trillion dollars of current and future projects being left valueless as the market for fossil fuels narrows with recent global climate change action.¶""We're going to see limitations in high fossil-fuel emitting industries immediately because of the market signals,"" Lubber said. ""Large fossil fuel companies would have liked to see a different agreement -- a much weaker one, but we now have the will of the world.""",0

""And no country, no matter how small, can sit on the sidelines. All of us had to solve it together.""¶He warned, however, that ""even if all the initial targets set in Paris are met, we'll only be part of the way there when it comes to reducing carbon from the atmosphere.""¶More in Climate Change¶""We cannot be complacent because of today's agreement,"" Mr. Obama said. ""The problem's not solved because of this accord, but make no mistake, the Paris agreement establishes the enduring framework the world needs to solve the climate crisis.""¶On Saturday morning in France, 195 nations and the European Union adopted a new climate change plan, one with the ambitious goals of slowing global warming by reducing greenhouse gases and aiding poor countries adjusting to the negative impact.¶""Together we've shown what's possible when the world stands as one,"" Mr. Obama said at the White House after the agreement was finalized.¶The plan requires countries to keeping the rise in the global average temperature ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) and ""endeavor to limit"" them even more, to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the year 2100, compared with pre-industrial levels.¶In the days and hours before the agreement was finalized, the president played a major role in bringing it to fruition, notably, with a Thursday call to China's President Xi Jinping, which followed earlier calls to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff.¶The president tweeted his response earlier Saturday.¶This is huge: Almost every country in the world just signed on to the #ParisAgreement on climate change-thanks to American leadership.¶Under the climate accord, most of the world's countries committed to pledging to meet targets for reducing their greenhouse gas emissions and reporting on their progress every five years using a standardized review.¶The agreement also establishes a framework for ratcheting up targets in the coming decades. It's meant to send a message to the markets and private sector that the world is transitioning from one powered by fossil fuels to a new world running on clean energy, meaning new technologies will need to be developed and new jobs created.¶The U.S. is the world's second largest climate polluter, and Mr. Obama has pledged that the U.S. will cut its overall emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent by 2030.¶The climate talks already had run into opposition from Republicans who control Congress. They say Obama's commitment to reduce emissions from U.S. power plants would cost thousands of American jobs and raise electricity costs.¶""We can expect the administration to cite this 'agreement' as their excuse for establishing emission targets for every sector of the U.S. economy not only including utilities, but petroleum refining, all manufacturing, agriculture and others,"" said Sen.

    ","¶LE BOURGET, France -- With the tap of a gavel and thunderous applause, 195 nations and the European Union adopted a new climate change plan, one with the ambitious goals of slowing global warming by reducing greenhouse gases and aiding poor countries adjusting to the negative impact.¶As president of the Conference of Parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP21, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius presented delegates with the final text, and a few hours later the ""Paris Agreement"" was approved by consensus of all the countries involved. The product: an agreement on a plan to slow global warming.¶The adoption of the plan to slow global warming was announced Saturday. The takeaway was a shift from dependence on fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy, with the hope of averting dangerous climate effects.¶""Nobody will get 100 percent of what they want,"" Fabius said. ""What I hope is that everyone remembers the message of the first day, when 150 heads of state and government came from all around the world to say, 'The world needs a success.'""¶More in Climate Change¶There was little doubt that high-level arm-twisting made the deal happen, most notably a Thursday call by President Obama to China's President Xi Jinping, which followed earlier calls to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff.¶Janos Pasztor, the U.N. assistant secretary-general on climate change, told CBS News that the message of the plan is to ""send a strong signal to the markets, the private sector that this is the direction we are going, to a low-carbon, low-emissions world, so investing in new technology is the way to go.""¶""What it means is, for example,"" Pasztor said, ""is get your act together, oil and gas industry, and develop these carbon capture storage systems.""¶""What we want is zero emissions at some point in the future; from a climate point of view, it is perfectly OK to continue oil and gas for some time to come,"" Pasztor said.¶U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that 186 countries, representing close to 100 percent of global carbon emissions, had submitted their national climate plans, called the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs).¶""This is quite encouraging,"" he said, adding that municipal and business leaders as well as civil society organizations were also at the conference to play a role.¶An agreement would be judged, delegates and U.N. officials say, on its ability to send a message to the markets if investors shift from fossil fuels and put it into low or zero-carbon energy sources.¶""I have absolute confidence in the ability of capital to move where the signal of the marketplace says 'go' after Paris,"" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said to the ""Earth to Paris"" summit earlier in the week.¶Not everyone is thrilled with the final compromise result; during the negotiations some scientists said that the final agreement is too weak and that sections that were deleted in the intense, often politically motivated negotiations, leading to an agreement that will not avert the dangerous warming of the world. Others believed it will restrict the U.S. and other developed countries too much.¶Crafting the mechanism to submit the reports on reducing carbon emissions proved to be difficult. India wanted a voluntary measure. Locking horns with the U.S. and European Union countries, the China delegation wanted ""differentiation,"" what its deputy chief, Liu Zhenmin, said meant that rich countries, which does not include China or India, would make deeper emissions cuts and pay more into the fund.¶But in the end, delegates and civil society groups were visibly pleased that the summit ended in the approval of an agreement.¶""The agreement requires the world to wean itself off of fossil fuels by the middle of the century,"" said Alden Meyer, the director of strategy and policy of the Union of Concerned Scientists. ""We have to get to net zero of greenhouse gases by 2060 or so. That can be through a combination of reducing emissions and increasing uptake of carbon dioxide by forests and agriculture by natural syncs. There is no way to meet this goal without phasing out fossil fuels over that time.""¶""We would have liked to see a requirement that all countries revise the level of ambition in their proposed post-2020 commitments based on the science by the end of the decade,"" Meyer said.¶Included in the deal is a temperature goal to keep warming to a limit, but that, along with who would pay for damages brought on by global warming and what countries would contribute to fundraising to be raised annually, were the contentious issues, resulting in the negotiations dragging into an extra day.¶The final agreement reads, ""the Parties to the Paris Agreement shall set a new collective quantified goal from a floor of USD 100 billion per year, taking into account the needs and priorities of developing countries.""¶After a briefing by Fabius on Thursday evening, Ségolène Royal, the French minister of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy, met with reporters and told CBS News, ""The financial sector should bear the responsibility of gathering the necessary funds, help countries transition to a low-carbon economy.""¶The plan requires countries to keeping the rise in the global average temperature ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) and ""endeavor to limit"" them even more, to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the year 2100, compared with pre-industrial levels.¶Emma Ruby-Sachs, acting executive director of Avaaz, a global civil action group concerned with the climate, said: ""This deal will represent a turning point in history, paving the way for the shift to 100 percent clean energy that the world wants and the planet needs. By marching in the streets, calling leaders and signing petitions, people everywhere created this moment, and now people everywhere will deliver on it to secure the future of humanity.""¶""It will be a big step forward for all of humanity,"" Fabius said Friday.¶""The agreement is a mechanism for how countries will behave - the new rules of the game,"" Pasztor told CBS News. ""Whatever they commit to is not legally binding but they have to report ... it is not name and shame, it is name and encourage.""¶Ban, reacting to the final agreement, said, ""Nature is sending urgent signals. The solutions to climate change are on the table. They are ours for the taking.""",0
Paris climate talks go into overtime,"

    ","¶LE BOURGET, France -- High-stakes climate talks outside Paris are dragging into an extra day as diplomats try to overcome disagreements over how - or even whether - to share the costs of fighting climate change and shift to clean energy on a global scale.¶Negotiators from more than 190 countries are aiming at something that's never been done: agreeing for all countries to reduce man-made carbon emissions and cooperating to adapt to rising seas and increasingly extreme weather caused by human activity.¶U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Friday that negotiators are still in disagreement over how far-reaching the accord should be and who should pay for damages wrought by global warming.¶More in Climate Change¶U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry zipped in and out of meetings on his fifth straight day in France trying to iron out differences with developing countries such as India. Kerry said he's ""hopeful"" for an accord and has been working behind the scenes to reach compromises.¶""There was a lot of progress made last night, a long night, but still a couple of very difficult issues that we're working on,"" Kerry told reporters Friday at the talks outside Paris. He wouldn't elaborate on which issues.¶The talks had been scheduled to wrap up Friday. But after tense overnight negotiations, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius postponed and said he is aiming to have a final draft Saturday morning that could be adopted by Saturday afternoon.¶""We are almost at the end of the road,"" Fabius said.¶""There are still outstanding issues,"" Ban told reporters Friday in Le Bourget, outside Paris. Among them are ""ambitions, climate financing"" and so-called differentiation - whether big emerging economies like China and India should pitch in to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions and help the poorest countries cope with climate change.¶Ban said he's ""convinced and confident"" that negotiators will reach an ""ambitious, strong accord.""¶The two-week talks are the culmination of years of U.N.-led efforts for a long-term climate deal. U.N. climate conferences often run past deadline, given the complexity and sensitivity of each word in an international agreement, and the consequences for national economies.¶Analysts said the delay is not necessarily a bad sign.¶""This needs consensus,"" said Michael Jacobs, an economist with the New Climate Economy project, speaking to reporters outside Paris. ""There's a lot of negotiating to do.""¶Sam Barratt of advocacy group Avaaz, added: ""We would rather they take their time and were patient with the right deal than rush it and get a breakdown. ... Getting 200 countries to agree on anything is tough. Getting them to agree on the future of the planet and a deal on climate change is probably one of the toughest pieces of negotiation they'll ever get involved in.""¶Some delegates said a new draft accord presented late Thursday by Fabius allowed rich nations to shift the responsibility to the developing world.¶""We are going backwards,"" said Gurdial Singh Nijar of Malaysia, the head of a bloc of hardline countries that also includes India, China and Saudi Arabia.¶They have put up the fiercest resistance against attempts by the U.S., the European Union and other wealthy nations to make emerging economies pitch in to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions and help the poorest countries cope with climate change. The issue, known as ""differentiation"" in United Nations climate lingo, was expected to be one of the last to be resolved.¶Nijar said it was unreasonable to expect countries like Malaysia to rapidly shift from fossil fuels - the biggest source of man-made greenhouse gas emissions - to cleaner sources of energy.¶""We cannot just switch overnight ... and go to renewables,"" he said, on a coffee break between meetings at 1:30 a.m. ""If you remove differentiation you create very serious problems for developing countries.""¶This accord is the first time all countries are expected to pitch in - the previous emissions treaty, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, only included rich countries.¶The latest, 27-page draft said governments would aim to peak the emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases ""as soon as possible"" and strive to reach ""emissions neutrality"" by the second half of the century.¶That was weaker language than in previous drafts that included more specific emissions cuts and timeframes.¶The biggest challenge is to define the responsibilities of wealthy nations, which have polluted the most historically, and developing economies including China and India where emissions are growing the fastest.¶The draft didn't resolve how to deal with demands from vulnerable countries to deal with unavoidable damage from rising seas and other climate impacts. One option said such ""loss and damage"" would be addressed in a way that doesn't involve liability and compensation - a U.S. demand.",0

            Atlantis' tidal power project underway in Scotland for new clean energy - CBS News
    ",CBS News,"December 9, 2015, 7:43 AM","¶A lot of the talk at the Paris climate conference is on the need to develop new, clean energy technologies. What we have now -- wind and solar power -- are not enough.¶But there's a new kind of power that's about to come on stream that may be part of the answer, reports CBS News correspondent Mark Phillips. ¶ In the north coast of Scotland, the world's most ambitious tidal power project is well underway. Engineers are working to tap the immense energy potential of the oceans, and a network of cables have already been laid on the sea floor. ¶Soon, the first underwater turbines will be lowered into position, where the massive tidal forces will turn their rotors to make electricity.¶The tidal currents on this bit of coast called the Pentland Firth are ferocious. The Atlantic tide rushes through the channel as it forces its way to the North Sea. And then, when the tide turns, it rushes back again.¶The plan is for a full field of turbines to be installed on the sea bed here, where they will produce as much power as a conventional shore-side coal, gas or nuclear fired plant.¶""It's a wonder people haven't looked at this site and other sites like it before,"" said David Taaffe, the site project manager.¶The tidal plant -- its backers say -- will not suffer from the pitfalls of other renewable sources. Solar power only works when the sun shines, so not at night. And wind farms only work when the wind blows. ¶""Tidal has one very distinct benefit. It's virtually 100 percent predictable,"" said Tim Cornelius, CEO of Atlantis, the company building the new tidal plant. ¶Cornelius said another advantage is that it is ""very environmentally benign."" Unlike windfarms, which are criticized for spoiling the view on land or for being hazards to shipping at sea, ""you don't see it and you don't hear it,"" Cornelius said.¶That there's been power in the ocean has always been known. The tidal currents move back and forth here like clockwork. But the trick has been to develop technology as reliable as the tides. The developers say that is where we are now.¶The technology, however, is expensive -- about twice the cost of wind generated power. But backers say the costs will come down quickly because tidal is adapting technology already used in the wind and the offshore oil industries. ¶""The best sites around the world are yet to be developed, and so we'll have a real boom over the next 10 to 15 years of sites around the world being developed,"" said Cornelius.¶Among the North American sites being looked at is The Bay of Fundy off Nova Scotia -- where the world's strongest tides run -- and San Francisco Bay and its famous tidal race under the Golden Gate Bridge.¶Both are untapped and waiting. With wind and solar power near their saturation point, tidal is being billed as the next big thing in clean, renewable power. ",0
Study sees possible dip in world carbon emissions,"
","
December 8, 2015 / 1:44 PM
      / AP
    ","¶PARIS -- Global carbon dioxide emissions may be dropping ever so slightly this year, spurred by a dramatic plunge in Chinese pollution, according to a surprising new study released Monday.¶The unexpected dip could either be a temporary blip or true hope that the world is about to turn the corner on carbon pollution as climate talks continue in Paris, said the study's authors, a scientific team that regularly tracks heat-trapping pollution.¶One skeptical scientist offered a $10,000 bet that world emissions will keep rising despite the findings, which were published on the same day that Beijing issued its first ever red alert for smog, urging schools to close and invoking restrictions on factories and traffic.¶More in Climate Change¶Still, some leaders cheered the study, published in the journal Nature Climate Change.¶""That shouldn't tell us we don't need to do anything, but that shows there is action,"" Janos Pasztor, the United Nations assistant secretary general for climate change, told The Associated Press. ""Things are going in the right direction. All we need is a strong agreement.""¶Using preliminary data through October 2015, the international team of emission trackers project that worldwide emissions of carbon dioxide this year will be down by 220 million tons. Last year, the world pumped an estimated 39.6 billion tons into the air by burning coal, oil and gas, along with making cement.¶Still, the change is so small - 0.6 percent - that it may not be a decrease at all because of the margin of error. As a result, the change could range from a slight increase of 0.5 percent to a decrease of as much as 1.6 percent.¶If it is indeed a decrease, however, study authors said this would be the first time global carbon dioxide emissions have dropped, even if only slightly, while the world economy grows. Global emissions fell during the last big recession.¶While total emissions have been climbing, the rate of increase has slowed in recent years. Still, this year's figures could be a blip, with emissions going right back up, said study co-author Corinne Le Quere of the University of East Anglia.¶""We have a mountain (of emissions) in front of us,"" Le Quere said. ""Maybe the mountain is a bit less and steep than we thought. But it's still a mountain.""¶U.S. Environmental Protection Administrator Gina McCarthy said: ""I will take the blip any day; it's much better than saying it's increasing. But I think it may just represent a strategy that will be more long term.""¶Greenpeace's international climate politics chief, Martin Kaiser, said this is not enough of a reason to celebrate or be complacent, as emissions have to come down fast in order to save the planet.¶Stanford University's Ken Caldeira expressed even deeper caution: He offered to bet the authors $10,000 that emissions haven't peaked yet, a bet the authors weren't quite willing to take.¶Le Quere said she also thinks world emissions, including China's, will go back up and 2014 will not end up being the peak year. She said emissions could go up or down a bit from now on.¶The whole apparent drop is driven by China, said study co-author Glen Peters of the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research in Oslo. Their study shows a nearly 4 percent drop in emissions for the first eight months of the year when compared to the same time last year. China's plans don't have the country hitting carbon dioxide peak emissions until 2030, which is 15 years from now.¶One factor may be issues concerning emissions reporting accuracy with China - and the monitoring and verification of emissions is a major hurdle in climate talks. Peters is confident that his figures based on industrial activity are good. But when asked if he trusts Chinese official emissions reporting figures, Peters paused for a long time and said, ""You certainly have your doubts.""¶On the positive side, China has dramatically increased its renewable energy and is capping its coal burning, much of it driven by the effort to clean up traditional air pollution that is choking cities like Beijing, said study co-author Dabo Guan of the University of East Anglia.¶Those efforts are aimed at coal because ""coal is the criminal for that and they are reducing lots of coal consumption in the urban areas where most of the industry is based,"" he said.¶Peters said in China, three-quarters of the carbon dioxide emissions come from the burning of coal. And the problem is so bad that even recent reductions haven't helped the smog and soot that on Monday choked the capital. The smog and soot are different pollutants than invisible heat-trapping carbon dioxide, but they usually come from the same source.¶U.S. emissions in 2015 dropped by about 1.5 percent. Le Quere only had 2015 estimates for China and the U.S. But in 2014, Europe's emissions went down 6 percent or by 200 million metric tons - which was the same amount by which India's emissions rose, Peters said.¶Princeton's Michael Oppenheimer, who wasn't part of the paper, said we need to wait a few years to see if this is a trend. But if it is, ""we may be in the early stages of revolutionary change"" mostly thanks to renewable energy.¶He said it shows emissions can stop increasing even as the economy continues to grow.",0

    ","¶PARIS -- Boosted by the encouraging comments of U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, negotiators from more than 190 countries, whose mandate was to fill in the brackets on a global climate accord in just two weeks -- and whose energy was beginning to wane -- started to see an agreement emerging.¶""Even without a fixed number and a legal shell, we are going to see an enormous amount of movement,"" Kerry said to an enthusiastic, cheering audience at the ""Earth to Paris"" summit in the Petit Palais, the City of Paris Museum of Fine Arts.¶""I have absolute confidence in the ability of capital to move where the signal of the marketplace says 'go' after Paris,"" he said, adding that there would be a final draft to distribute by Thursday, to complete on Friday. However, he conceded that these types of negotiations have a history of adding a few days to get to the final product. ¶More in Climate Change¶Kerry returned to Paris for hands-on negotiations, which are taking place at Le Bourget -- near where Charles A. Lindbergh landed after his triumphant transatlantic flight in 1927 -- and to speak at the ""Earth to Paris"" summit sponsored by the U.N., the  U.N. Foundation, Mashable, the City of Paris, Facebook and other agencies and businesses to help involve people around the world who are concerned about the environment.¶With Paris still stunned by the terror attacks and tourism down dramatically, Kerry returned to the French capital for a second appearance at the climate talks, after accompanying President Obama last week to the opening sessions along with 149 other heads of state and government.¶""During my nine years as Secretary-General, I have never seen so many world leaders gathered at one time,"" Ban Ki-moon told reporters at a press conference at Le Bourget. ""That showed strong political will.""¶The talks are formally known as the Conference of Parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP21.¶The Secretary General said that 186 countries, representing close to 100 per cent of global carbon emissions, have submitted their national climate plans. ""This is quite encouraging,"" he said, adding that municipal and business leaders as well as civil society organizations were also there to play a role. ¶He said that the voluntary climate plans that nations submitted were a good start, but ""fall short of our goal to limit global temperature rise to less than 2 degrees Celsius,"" adding that the clock is ticking.¶Divisions have surfaced among delegates about many issues, most notably, whether or not the agreement will be legally binding.  Billed initially by the sponsors as a meeting to negotiate an enforceable agreement that would hold countries to their pledges reduce their carbon emissions, several regional groups, including the European Union and the Group of 77 development nations were dismayed when President Obama made clear that the outcome would not be a treaty at all, although it might have some enforceable monitoring and reporting mechanisms. ¶Irina Bokova, the Director General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), which plays a role in educating the public about climate change and which protects heritage sites, told CBS News,  ""I wish we had a legally binding document, but the measurement of success of Paris will depend on the type of document and the way it will be monitored, this is an important message; there is already success because we have seen such commitment from the U.S., China, and the European Union, which came with strong national commitments ... and we've seen more commitment from the private sector, which is key.""  ¶As the negotiations entered their second and final week, diplomats said that the European Union appeared ready to forge a compromise. ""In principle, this will be a binding agreement,"" Ban Ki-moon said, but added that compromises are being made and that the country targets will be reviewed in 2020 and every five years after.¶The other major division was whether or not the largest carbon emitter countries should pay more. India's Environment Minister, Prakash Javadekar said on Sunday that rich countries must ""pay back their debt for overdraft that they have drawn on the carbon space.""¶The driving force behind COP21, the Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC, Christiana Figueres, appeared to believe that the agreement that is moving forward will tackle the big problems. ""The draft agreement that is on the table and that will be finalized throughout this week will point toward the process of decarbonizing the global economy"" she said, adding that the agreement will also address deforestation issues to protect the forest cover. ""So together,"" she said on Monday,  ""those are the two major causes of climate change."" ¶The agreement, Figueres said, will be ""judged on whether we can move toward that decarbonization in time to still stay below the 2-degree window, and that remains to be seen.""",0

            President Obama: ""You can't build a border wall"" to stop climate change - CBS News
    ",CBS News,"December 4, 2015, 8:16 AM","¶Negotiators from around the world are now in the middle of two weeks of talks in Paris, trying to reach an agreement to limit global warming.¶Last month, President Obama pledged a $3 billion U.S. contribution to an international fund for developing countries - such as India -- to cope with the effects of climate change.¶He spoke to ""CBS This Morning"" co-host Norah O'Donnell about his effort to take historic action.¶""Keep in mind, these are pledges over a number of years. And this is in our interest. Let's take a country like India that's got over a billion people. If they are to develop, using let's say, coal as their main way of generating electricity, with a billion people... you're looking at an amount of carbon that would mean South Florida's gone, because the ocean's would have risen too high,"" Mr. Obama said. ""You can't build a border wall when it comes to carbon emissions or global temperatures or the oceans. We've got to make sure that people have incentives to work with us.""¶The president has pushed the issue of climate change more aggressively as he nears his last days in office. But he is receiving backlash from opponents for suggesting that climate change, not terrorism, is the world's greatest threat. ¶""No challenge poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change,"" the president said in his State of Union address. ¶GOP candidate Donald Trump called the president's remarks, ""one of the dumbest statements I've ever heard in politics.""¶""What I mean by that is that-- we're going to get ISIL. They will be defeated. There will be ongoing efforts to disrupt the world order from terrorists, from rogue states... and we have to be vigilant in going after them,"" the president clarified. ""But if you start seeing the oceans rise by five, six, seven feet, if you see major shifts in weather patterns so that what have been previously bread baskets to the world suddenly can no longer grow food, then you're seeing the kind of crisis that we can't deal with through the deployment of the Marines. We can't deal with it through pouring money at it.""¶The president also responded to Trump's criticism of his climate change remarks. ¶""Mr. Trump should run back a tape or quote on some of the stuff he's said -- 99.5 percent of scientists in the world say this is a really urgent problem,"" Mr. Obama said. ""Political parties around the world. The only people who are still disputing it are either some Republicans in Congress or folks on the campaign trail.""¶Despite the backlash from opponents, the president expressed hopes that he would be able to leave behind a legacy with his climate change priorities, especially thinking about his family's future. ¶""I don't think any president ends the presidency saying, 'I got everything done.' You're always a little dissatisfied,"" Mr. Obama said. ""But Malia is 17. Sasha's 14... and I do picture that if I'm lucky and I have enough years left that 20 years from now... I've got some grandkids, I want to be able to take my little grandson or granddaughter on a walk to the park and know that the planet's in pretty good shape.

    ","¶Suppose the gathering of world leaders at the Paris climate change conference fails to reach a consensus? Or the meeting, which concludes next week, does forge an agreement but it proves ineffective?¶The fear, warned Cambridge University researcher David MacKay in an interview with German broadcaster Deutsche Welle, is that a toothless pact would mean that many countries will end up doing nothing. To some, the talks are a last-gasp attempt to craft a coordinated global approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The European Union's climate chief, Manuel Canete, warned in an interview with Britain's The Guardian that no ""Plan B"" exists if the talks falter.¶While an official air of optimism pervades the Paris event, a workable plan to head off global warming could founder for several reasons:¶More in Climate Change¶The GOP scotches any U.S. climate pledges. President Barack Obama, who went to Paris to lend gravity to the conclave, is foursquare behind achieving an international framework to curb global warming. The U.S. is the world's No. 2 greenhouse gas producer, following China. ¶Trouble is, for him, that the Republican-controlled Congress is dedicated to thwarting any treaty or any funding addressing what many in the GOP think is a hoax. And should Republicans win the White House next year, Obama's plans may well end up in the dumper. The House of Representatives this week voted to block his administration's proposed new limits on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. (The president aims to veto the measure.)¶Fearful that carbon restrictions will hamper the economy, American lawmakers in the past have thwarted climate-control efforts. The 1997 Kyoto Protocol mandated a reduction in emissions. But the Senate voted 95-0 to condemn the treaty, and President Bill Clinton gave up on getting it ratified. ¶Developing world reluctance. Under this scenario, the poorer nations will ignore any Paris accord because they need to grow economically, and the easiest way to do that involves burning fossil fuels. India, which heavily depends on coal-fired electricity generation, is reluctant to consent to an emissions cap by a certain date, as the U.S., which has pledged to do so by 2025, and China (2030) have done. ¶Meanwhile, efforts to help developing nations foot the bill are underwhelming. In 2009, industrialized countries agreed to raise $100 billion by 2020 for a Green Climate Fund to benefit emerging economies. This kitty would subsidize clean-energy technologies and other methods to curb global warming. Thus far, the fundraising is behind schedule with U.S. foot-dragging a big factor, thanks to Republican bids to hold down spending on it. Republicans say the money will only go into corrupt officials' pockets. ¶China will not meet any emissions goals. In the past, China has undermined climate negotiations. Generating a quarter of the world's carbon dioxide output, it did not want to crimp its pell-mell growth. President Xi Jinping, however, lately has promised to reduce emissions in 15 years and is boosting solar power and natural gas, which burns cleaner than other carbon-based energy sources.  ¶Can the Chinese leader be trusted? Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump doesn't think so, saying that Beijing is ""laughing at us because China doesn't obey any of these rules."" While you can write that off as typical Trump bluster, he may have a point.¶The Chinese economy has slowed down from its double-digit pace. And although Xi's government surely wishes to reduce the horrible smog in its big cities, would it want to do that at the expense of its economy? The U.S. Energy Information Administration concluded recently that China's coal consumption was 14 percent higher over the past decade. Although the data show emissions dipped 2 percent last year, the finding underscores how unreliable official Chinese statistics can be and raises questions about how readily the nation can lower its carbon production.¶Non-governmental endeavors are falling short. Certainly, private enterprise is key to any climate palliative.Many companies around the globe are working to limit their greenhouse gas outlays, but still have a long way to go. CDP Worldwide, an organization dedicated to fighting climate change, reports that 71 percent of corporations in its survey are using energy efficiency standards, up from 61 percent in 2011. Nevertheless, it admits, this is not enough to restrain emissions from increasing.¶Pope Francis said Monday that the Paris climate conference was the world's last chance to avert environmental catastrophe. Otherwise, he said, humanity is ""at the limits of suicide."" Whether that comes true or not, expecting a world-changing pact coming out of Paris might just be a lot to ask.",0
How climate change became so politicized,"

    ","¶During a news conference at the COP21 climate conference in Paris on Tuesday, President Obama had some words for the Republicans hoping to win his job: ""Everyone else is taking climate change really seriously."" In other countries, he said, ""They think it's a really big problem. It spans political parties.""¶But in the United States, everything about climate change is politically divisive. There appears to be little common ground on what causes it, what to do about it -- or even, in the case of some Republicans, whether the problem exists at all. While the president noted that ""99.5 percent of scientists and experts [and] 99 percent of world leaders"" agree human-caused climate change needs to be reckoned with, some Republican leaders have called it a ""hoax"" and a ""contrived, phony mess.""¶""While the world is in turmoil and falling apart in so many different ways especially with ISIS, our President is worried global warming -- what a ridiculous situation,"" GOP frontrunner Donald Trump said in a video post on Instagram.¶ What is Obama thinking?¶A video posted by Donald J. Trump (@realdonaldtrump) on Dec 1, 2015 at 8:12am PST¶Similarly, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie -- who has acknowledged in the past that climate change is real -- said during a press conference that Obama ""is struggling mightily to be relevant in a dangerous world, and he's focused on the wrong climate.""¶More in Climate Change¶This sharp back and forth is nothing new, but it underscores just how divisive and dirty a term ""climate change"" has become in the U.S. political arena.¶Just ask one of Christie's predecessors, former New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, a Republican who served as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency during Pres. George W. Bush's first term. That background gives her a unique perspective on the political controversy raging over environmental issues today. How did something that the overwhelming majority of climatologists agree on become a point of political debate?¶""It's probably because science is never exact -- I mean you can find that over 97 percent of scientists say 'this is real,' but then there are those three who say 'no, it's not.' It's an easy issue to demonize. They can say, 'well it's not 100 percent,' "" Whitman told CBS News.¶Whitman is a moderate Republican who has long been critical of the sharp partisan nature of American politics. In 2005, she published ""It's My Party, Too: The Battle for the Heart of the GOP and the Future of America."" The book drew on her past experience in elected office and time serving in the Bush administration. To Whitman, the growing move to political extremes -- on both the left and right -- is not in the best long-term interests of the country.¶""Everything has gotten so partisan. In many ways, climate change now has become one of those signature issues -- like what taxes has been for Republicans for years,"" Whitman added. ""The truth, of course, is somewhere in between. Yes, the Earth has been changing since it was formed, we don't 'cause' climate change, but we do impact it. It's all in the nuances, which makes it so easy to demonize.""¶Whitman stressed that taking something like climate change, which bears serious ramifications for future generations, and turning it into fodder for political spin is dangerous for the public at large, especially heading into a presidential election year.¶""Right now, you are kind of torn in terms of how much you want to see (politicians) do. Obama, right now, has to lay the framework for the future, but can't get a whole lot done. Again, I don't want to see the various presidential candidates get pushed into positions that they can't come back from,"" Whitman said. ""I mean you don't want to see Hillary (Clinton) pushed so far left that she would rule out something like nuclear energy, but she'll have a lot of Democrats pressuring her to do that. On the right, it's the same -- you have people saying they don't believe in climate change. You will find yourselves at the end of the day where we just can't move forward and that is not where we want to be."" ¶The future of nuclear energy has been Whitman's focus for the past decade. She has served as co-chair of the Clean and Safe Energy Coalition (CASEnergy Coalition) -- which advocates for nuclear energy options -- since it was formed in 2006. Whitman said that CASEnergy ""doesn't lobby,"" but is designed to offer information and ""answer people's questions"" about nuclear, ""clean"" energy. The coalition is funded by the Nuclear Energy Institute, a nuclear energy lobbying group.¶What does Whitman think of the energy and climate policies of those currently running, on either side?¶""From what I've heard, Hillary Clinton has a broad energy plan. (Ohio Gov. John) Kasich does, as well. Jeb Bush doesn't believe in climate change, but he has more moderate proposals,"" Whitman said of the 2016 field. ""But this is absolutely the wrong time to be looking at policy because, unfortunately, it's so hyper partisan during the presidential campaign that you are not going to get a serious discussion about any policy until next November.""¶The trend over the past decade has been for liberals and conservatives to push further to their respective sides. A 2011 paper from Aaron M. McCright of Michigan State University and Riley E. Dunlap of Oklahoma State University analyzed data from 10 national Gallup polls between 2001 and 2010 to examine how liberals and conservatives receive and respond to information on climate change. The results show that over that decade, liberals grew much more likely to report believing climate change has already begun, while conservatives became increasingly likely to say the opposite.¶The study also pointed out the role of the media in fueling this split. ""Such polarization likely has continued in recent years given the heightened balkanization of news media (e.g., MSNBC on the Left and FOX News on the Right), allowing Americans to obtain their news from outlets that reinforce their political beliefs,"" the authors write.¶In the latest CBS News/New York Times poll, released Monday, almost three-quarters of Democrats (72 percent) and half of independents (52 percent) said they believe global warming is caused by human activity, but less than a third of Republicans (32 percent) agreed.¶However, some views on this issue are shifting. The poll found that the number of Americans who believe global warming is caused by human activity has risen 11 points since 2011.¶For a seasoned politician like Whitman, could she ever see herself voting for a Democrat if, say, a nominee on the left had a more aggressive climate change policy than his or her counterpart on the right?¶Not necessarily. ¶""The way I would base my vote would not be on a single issue,"" she said. ""It's not the only issue I would bet on. It  is based on a lot of factors.""",0

    ","¶When President Obama spoke at a news conference at the end of his two-day appearance at the COP21 climate conference in Paris, he stressed the need to seek innovative solutions to combat climate change.¶""I actually think we're going to solve this thing,"" he said. ""We have to push away fear and have confidence that human innovation, our values, our judgment, our solidarity, it will win out.""¶Many experts believe seeking innovative solutions is key to making a dent in carbon emissions and ensuring that Earth doesn't eventually warm to catastrophic levels, commonly considered anything beyond the threshold of 2 degrees Celsius above the average temperature from before the Industrial Revolution.¶More in Climate Change¶It won't be easy. The U.S. Energy Information Administration's 2013 Internal Energy Outlook reported that, if new policies are not put into place, global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions will total up to 36.4 billion metric tons in 2020 and could shoot as high as 45.5 billion metric tons by 2040.¶What could possibly turn the tide? In ""Climate 101: Introduction to Climate Change,"" a 2015 paper from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the authors explain two main approaches to the problems posed by climate change: mitigation and adaptation. Mitigation refers to efforts to limit further global warming, while adaptation refers to implementing policies and innovations to respond to the warming conditions.¶""You absolutely have to have both (mitigation and adaptation),"" Sarah Ladislaw, one of the paper's authors and the director and senior fellow at the CSIS Energy and National Security Program, told CBS News. ""For a long time, people thought about those things as separate issues.""¶Electric vehicles, already increasingly common on the roadways, and rows of wind turbines generating clean energy are two of the more recognizable technological solutions for climate change, but there are other, still developing options that could make a difference in the years ahead.¶Here are three technologies that aim to be disruptors in the energy world, creating sustainable solutions to re-route the path of climate change.¶Advanced solar innovations¶Solar and wind-harnessed power sources have been growing in popularity over the past few years, and the cost of producing solar power has come way down. As the push for solar has grown, researchers have been looking for ways to more widely distribute the technology. For instance, scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, developed a material with a nanostructure that absorbs as much light as the standard solar cells currently, but uses less semiconductor material. This could lead to lower-cost, more accessible solar cells. ¶From cheaper cells to solar panels that could produce energy at any time of the day -- not just during sunlight -- Boston College chemist Dunwei Wang developed a structure called a nanonet that converts sunlight into hydrogen gas that can be stored and then used for energy from day to night. How does it work? The nanonet, which consists of silicon and titanium, absorbs light and uses it to split water at a molecular level. The oxygen is released while the hydrogen is essentially harvested for later use.¶Carbon capture and storage (CCS) ¶Facilities like power plants and refineries are some of the largest, most damaging emitters of carbon dioxide. What if there was a way to capture up to 90 percent of carbon emissions from one of these energy generators, taking them out of the atmosphere, and then essentially burying them deep within the ground? Enter carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, which aims to replicate how nature stores carbon dioxide. ¶This kind of technology separates carbon dioxide from the other gases produced from electricity generation, and then funnels that carbon through a pipeline or transports it by way of a ship and deposits it miles below the planet's surface in rock formations. ¶CCS is not without its critics. There are so many carbon-producing industrial sites around the world that the technology would have to be far more widely dispersed globally than it is now to have a tangible effect. Another criticism rests in the fact that the system that might essentially keep industrial carbon producers in business. If it's possible to just capture carbon and then bury it in the ground, there isn't as much pressure to reduce carbon emissions or do away with the structures that produce it. And so far, the system has only been tested at a handful of sites.¶""It's necessary to prove that the economics of CCS make sense,"" Ladislaw said. ""It's pretty large scale. So far it's so cost-prohibitive. You have to actually move the carbon dioxide around a pipeline, which on its own would inject an added cost on top of everything.""¶Solar radiation management¶More theoretical than the others, solar radiation management is an approach that aims to block some of the sun's rays to reduce global warming.¶The concept was inspired by a natural phenomenon. Back in 1991, the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines saw 20 million tons of sulfur spew into the atmosphere, blocking sunlight so much that global temperatures dropped by about a half a degree Celsius in one year. That's right: a single volcanic eruption temporarily helped cool the planet one quarter of the fabled 2-degree benchmark climatologists are so wary of watching the planet cross. ¶How would this be volcanic phenomenon be replicated? Researchers envision spewing aerosols into the sky that could reflect damaging rays back toward the sun. Such schemes are also known as ""albedo modification,"" albedo being the scientific term for the amount of sunlight reflected back to space.¶A 2015 National Academy of Sciences report looked at the proposals to essentially give Earth's atmosphere some heavy-duty sunscreen and raised some grave concerns. For instance, the report notes that ""present-day observational capabilities lack sufficient capacity to monitor the environmental effects of an albedo-modification deployment."" In other words, we have no way of knowing what this might do to the Earth.¶The report suggests that such a plan could only be considered in tandem with other steps to remove carbon dioxide or cut back on emissions, and could not be a solution by itself.¶Moving forward¶So what will define a successful approach to developing new energy technology and innovations to combat climate change?¶""Cleary, in the current Paris climate change negotiations that are going on this week, you need to look out for two things, the first being policies that pull technologies that exist today into the market and the second involving investing more heavily in research and development in clean energy technologies that bring costs down and bring the (energy) market into the future,"" Ladislaw said.¶""You need to do both of those things. There's a place for both of those things, and it's nice to see in the negotiations the scope of those approaches at least being looked at on the table.""",0

    ","¶President Obama said Tuesday that climate change is ""an economic and security imperative that we have to tackle now,"" as he justified why world leaders went ahead with a summit on the issue just weeks after a major terror attack in Paris.¶""The reason is because this one trend, climate change, affects all trends,"" Mr. Obama said, arguing that failing to address the problem will force the world to devote more economic and military resources to the problem later on. ""Great nations can handle a lot at once.""¶The president spoke to reporters at the conclusion of his two-day visit to the COP21 climate conference in Paris. He said he has ""high hopes"" that the 195 nations gathered there will be able to accomplish a lot in the coming weeks.¶More in Climate Change¶""All of this will be hard. Getting 200 nations to agree on anything is hard. And I'm sure there will be moments over the next two weeks where progress seems stymied, and everyone rushes to write that we are doomed. But I'm convinced we are going to get big things done here,"" he said.¶Ahead of the conference, 181 nations announced pledges to combat man-made carbon dioxide pollution. Although those pledges will not be legally binding, negotiators hope to make some provisions of an agreement enforceable.¶Mr. Obama told reporters that at least parts of any agreement reached in Paris should be legally binding, such as periodic reviews of the carbon-cutting targets and any measures to ensure transparency. ¶He fielded a number of questions from reporters about his ability to ensure the U.S. follows through on its pledge to cut carbon emissions between 26 and 28 percent by 2025. As Mr. Obama met with world leaders in Paris, Republicans back home have publicly declared their intent to undermine his efforts. In particular, they are targeting his Clean Power Plan, which aims to help the U.S. achieve its carbon emissions reductions by forcing existing power plants to slash their emissions by more than 30 percent by 2050.¶A Republican successor could easily revoke the regulations in the Clean Power Plan, even if it survives an ongoing court challenge.¶""I'm anticipating a Democrat succeeding me. I'm confident in the wisdom of the American people on that front,"" Mr. Obama said. ¶The president is offering to help poor, reluctant countries like India to convert to clean energy and urging business leaders like Microsoft founder Bill Gates to also pick up the tab.¶There are two big impediments to a deal: getting countries to shoulder the expense of converting to cleaner energy and convincing Republicans to fund it. White House officials think they can overcome both and argue that other countries won't cut back on pollution unless America does so first, CBS News Correspondent Margaret Brennan reports.¶He tried to portray the Republicans as out of step with world leaders and even their opponents abroad, who ""are not arguing about is whether the science of climate change is real,"" he said.¶Overall, though, his message after the first two days of the climate summit - which will continue for another two weeks - was one of optimism.¶""I actually think we're going to solve this thing,"" he said, noting that many people would not have predicted so many world leaders would gather to work on finding a solution so soon. ""We have to push away fear and have confidence that human innovation, our values, our judgment, our solidarity, it will win out and I guess I've been at this long enough where I have some cause for confidence.¶The president also addressed the recent shooting at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado. After noting the steps the U.S. takes to prevent terror attacks, he added, ""We have the power to do more to prevent what is just a regular process of gun homicides.""¶The shooting has started a debate about whether the rhetoric of those who oppose abortion contributes to violence. Mr. Obama said, ""it's fair to have a legitimate, honest debate about abortion,"" but added, ""How we talk about it, factually, accurately and not demonizing organizations like Planned Parenthood I think is important.""¶The conference has also been partially overshadowed by tensions after a Turkish fighter jet downed a Russian warplane it said violated Turkey's air space. Mr. Obama said he used a meeting with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan Thursday morning to discuss ways to ""deescalate tensions and find a diplomatic path to resolve this issue,"" but he also said the U.S. supports Turkey's right to defend itself and its airspace.¶""We all have a common enemy and that is ISIL. And I want to make sure we remain focused on that threat and the resolution in Syria,"" he said Tuesday.¶The president also met with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sideline of the climate talks where he offered his regrets for the loss of the Rusisan pilot and crew member. Mr. Obama also continues to press Russia to stop supporting Syrian President Bashar Assad and step up its actions in the fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) but said it would take time.¶""I don't expect that you're' going to see a 180-degree turn on their strategy over the next several weeks,"" the president said. ""They have invested for years now in keeping Assad in power. Their presence there is predicated on propping him up. That's going to take some time for them to change how they think about the issue.""",0

    ","¶The more than 190 countries that have gathered in France for worldwide climate talks did much of their work in advance. Before the summit, at least 181 nations had already announced their plans to lower their carbon emissions in order to help slow the pace of global warming.¶That means the real work will come after the meeting is over, when all of the world leaders have gone home. And one of the leaders facing the toughest road ahead is President Obama.¶""The climate accord is essentially a done deal,"" Jeff Nesbit, the former director of legislative affairs for the National Science Foundation wrote in a U.S. News and World Report story. ""There will be no urgent race to the finish line to increase the ambitions of countries. Those ambitions have been set. There will be a race to determine what we will do after Paris, and that's what matters.""¶More in Climate Change¶The challenges for the world leaders gathered in Paris are not small. One, Nesbit wrote, is whether Western, developed countries take responsibility for raising money to help developing countries combat global warming.¶Another is whether that financing can spur the development of an economy reliant on new low-carbon technologies. ¶President Obama is certainly aware of the challenges. At the opening session of the conference Monday, he said, ""I've come here personally, as the leader of the world's largest economy and the second-largest emitter, to say that the United States of America not only recognizes our role in creating this problem, we embrace our responsibility to do something about it.""¶Much of what he plans to do is summed up in his administration's Clean Power Plan, which sets a goal for the U.S. to cut carbon emissions 26 to 28 percent by 2025. Unveiled in August, the plan would require existing power plants to reduce emissions by 32 percent from 2005 levels by 2030.¶""That's where that starts, the rubber hits the road, and things start to happen in terms of investment"" in renewable energy, Amy Grace, an analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, told CBS News.¶The plan will first have to survive challenges from both Congress and the courts. When the president said that  ""we embrace our responsibility to do something,"" he wasn't exactly talking about everyone in the U.S. The Republican-led Congress is far from embracing his initiatives to limit carbon emissions and spur investment in renewable energy. GOP lawmakers are, in fact, doing what they can to stop Mr. Obama.¶House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-California, said the House will pass two resolutions disapproving of the new energy regulations. The disapproval resolutions have already been passed by the Senate.¶""They will be sent straight to the President's desk, making it clear to the Administration and the world that President Obama doesn't have support at home to continue on his economically harmful agenda,"" McCarthy said in a statement.  ¶But a CBS News/New York Times poll released Monday found the opposite -- that 66 percent of Americans think the U.S. should join an international treaty requiring nations to reduce carbon emissions in an effort to fight global warming. Nearly nine in 10 Democrats (86 percent) and two-thirds of independents support such a move, while a slight majority of Republicans (52 percent) oppose it.¶Further, 63 percent of Americans favor limiting the carbon emissions from U.S. power plants, including 44 percent who strongly favor such a move.¶Helping poorer countries combat climate change has also been a concern for nations attending the Paris summit. Some GOP lawmakers oppose giving U.S. dollars to the U.N. Green Climate Fund for these countries in need of help in adopting renewable technologies. Republicans may seek to block Mr. Obama from giving any of the $3 billion the U.S. has pledged for the fund in the next spending bill, which they must pass by Dec. 11.¶They do, however, plan to put forward a bill later this week that updates energy infrastructure like pipelines and electrical grids. The White House says President Obama would veto the bill because it would undermine plans to modernize the nation's energy infrastructure and increase energy efficiency.¶The bigger challenge to the Clean Power Plan: Half of states are suing to block the rules from taking effect, arguing the administration has overstepped its authority. The first hearing on the lawsuit - whether to stay the regulation while the court battle takes place - is not scheduled until after the Paris talks have concluded. ¶And should a Republican wins the 2016 presidential election, the entire plan could be rolled back. While many of the GOP candidates say they believe global warming is real, they are not sure whether humans have contributed to it. Nearly all of the Republican presidential candidates object to taking major action to slow carbon emissions because they are concerned that the economy could be adversely affected.¶If the U.S. abandons the Clean Power Plan, that could mean trouble for any agreement reached at the Paris summit, Frank Incropera, a professor emeritus of engineering at Notre Dame, told CBS News.¶""I think there would be a loss of credibility to the United States in exercising global leadership in the environment, and I think there would be a reason for other nations then to back off their commitments,"" he said. ¶It was an agreement to limit carbon emissions between the U.S. and China in November 2014 that spurred other countries to make their own commitments. The two powers combined are responsible for more than 40 percent of the world's carbon emissions.¶Incropera argued that the Clean Power Plan will accelerate investments in carbon-free power production technologies like wind and solar, and attract more investment, research, and development into those sectors.¶Grace, the renewable energy analyst, said that the Paris summit is more important for setting the direction of individual countries' legislation and for momentum. ¶""The transition to a renewable energy economy is going to happen simply on the basis of cost"" in the long run, she said, because the technologies have become cheaper. The Clean Power Plan and other incentives like the renewable energy production tax credit make far more of a difference in short-term investment and renewables.¶ The tax credit has some bipartisan support, but faces some Republican opposition in the House because of its cost and must be renewed at the end of the year. ¶""Your high-level targets that you hope to agree to in Paris are meaningless for renewable energy investment unless they translate into some sort of domestic legislation that provides investment for renewables,"" Grace said.",0
What is COP21? The mysterious acronyms of the Paris climate talks,"
","
Updated on:  November 30, 2015 / 6:35 PM
      / CBS/AP 
    ","¶PARIS -- It sounds like English. Yet to the untrained ear some of the language used in the U.N. climate talks is about as comprehensible as Klingon.¶Sometimes you wonder whether the negotiators are trying on purpose to make a simple idea sound more complex than it is. But it's also a matter of international law.¶Many delegations have teams of lawyers that analyze every syllable for potential hidden meanings. Before everyone's comfortable with the wording of a concept or idea, it's often turned into an acronym.¶More in Climate Change¶Here's a guide to help you decipher some of the most commonly used terms in the Paris talks:¶COP 21: COP stands for Conference of the Parties, referring to the countries that have signed up to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The COP in Paris is the 21st such conference.¶UNFCCC: The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is an international treaty now signed by 195 parties, with the aim of reducing global greenhouse gas emissions to rein in climate change. To sound like an insider, pronounce this U-N-F-triple-C. Or just say ""the framework convention.""¶INDC: This acronym first appeared in U.N. climate talks in Warsaw in 2013. It stands for Intended Nationally Determined Contribution and refers to the climate pledges that countries have made ahead of the Paris conference. Every word has legal implications indicating that the INDC isn't a binding promise. The pledges are ""intended,"" not set in stone, and they are ""nationally determined,"" not imposed from the outside. The ""C'' at one point was for ""Commitment,"" but that sounded too much like promise for some countries.¶ADP: This is perhaps the most useful abbreviation in the talks, considering the time it takes to read out the full name of The Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action. The ADP is a subsidiary body created in Durban, South Africa, in 2011 for negotiations on the universal climate agreement that's supposed to be adopted in Paris. The Paris conference will deal with other things as well, like pre-2020 ambition.¶PRE-2020 AMBITION: This refers to actions taken by countries to limit greenhouse gas emissions before the Paris agreement would take effect in 2020. This part of the discussions is meant to remind big polluters that the Paris deal doesn't mean they're off the hook for another five years.¶CBDR: This acronym lies at the core of the most difficult issue left to resolve in Paris. The principle of ""Common But Differentiated Responsibilities"" is enshrined in the 1992 framework convention. It recognizes that countries in different stages of development have different obligations in dealing with climate change. Until recently it's been implemented as a strict division between rich and poor countries, where only the former are obliged to reduce their emissions. The U.S. and other developed countries want to scrap that firewall in the new deal, while many developing countries including India insist that it live on in some form.¶REDD-PLUS: Not the prettiest of acronyms, it refers to efforts to protect forests, which when destroyed release carbon into the air, contributing to climate change. REDD stands for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation. The plus sign was added in 2010 to indicate that three more elements had been inserted into the discussions: conservation of forest carbon stocks, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks. Just imagine what that the REDD acronym would have looked like if someone hadn't thought of the plus.¶SIDS and AOSIS: These acronyms refer to the Small Island Developing States and the Alliance of Small Island States, two groups made up of countries most vulnerable to rising sea levels. Many of these island nations are poor, making it even more difficult for them to cope with flooding or invest in adapting their infrastructure. Cuba, Haiti and the Dominican Republic, and the Bahamas are among the members from the Caribbean and Atlantic, while those in the Pacific region include Fiji and Papua New Guinea.¶LULUCF: This stands for ""land use, land-use change and forestry,"" which is often abbreviated to just ""land use,"" explain the experts from Climate Central. Scientists say deforestation accounts for about 10 percent of the pollution that's escaping into the atmosphere every year, but it is unclear what, if anything, the Paris talks will do to try to change that.",0
World leaders kick off Paris climate summit,"

      / CBS/AP
    ","¶ LE BOURGET, France -- Addressing the twin threats of global warming and extremist violence, the largest group of world leaders ever to stand together kicked off two weeks of high-stakes climate talks outside Paris on Monday, saying that by striking an ambitious deal to cut emissions they can show terrorists what countries can achieve when they are united.¶ 	The meeting -- which includes more than 150 heads of state and representatives of 195 governments -- comes just two weeks after militants linked to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) killed 130 people around Paris. Fears of more attacks have prompted extra-high security and a crackdown on environmental protests - and threaten to eclipse longer-term concerns about rising seas and increasingly extreme weather linked to man-made global warming.¶ 	""The challenge of an international meeting has never been so great because it's the future of the planet, the future of life,"" French President Francois Hollande said after a moment of silence for attack victims in France, Lebanon, Iraq, Tunisia and Mali.¶More in Climate Change¶ 	""There are two big global challenges that we must face,"" he added, urging leaders to create a world free from both environmental destruction and extremist violence.¶ 	President Obama was among the many leaders to pay respects to the victims of the attacks on his way to the conference, visited the Bataclan concert hall after he arrived in Paris Sunday evening and placed a single flower at the makeshift memorial to mark where dozens were killed.¶ 	""We stand with Paris,"" said U.N. climate change agency chief Christina Figueres said at talks near Le Bourget airfield, just north of the city. ""The city of light, now more than ever, is a beacon of hope for the world.""¶ 	On Sunday, hundreds of thousands of people rallied around the world, calling on the leaders to make real progress at the talks. Violence erupted after one peaceful demonstration in Paris, and hundreds of people were arrested. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon took note of the protests in his opening remarks.¶ 	""The future of the people of the world, the future of our planet, is in your hands,"" Ban told negotiators. ""We cannot afford indecision, half measures or merely gradual approaches. Our goal must be a transformation.""¶ 	Nations are working toward a global, legally binding agreement that will lower greenhouse gas emissions in order to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius (35.6 degrees Farenheit) - the critical number identified by scientists. Once global warming climbs beyond that threshold, they say, the earth's land, food and water supply would be harmed, endangering the planet's population.¶ 	The 2014 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said the planet has already warmed by 0.85 degrees Celsius from 1880 to 2012 and could increase by another 1.5 to 4 degrees by the end of the century, compared to 1850. Ban, Hollande and other leaders called for a binding agreement and emphasized the role of private industry and money in solving what Hollande called ""the climate crisis"" and said the world must try to limit warming to an additional half a degree if possible half that to spare island nations threatened by rising seas.¶ 	Ahead of the conference, 181 nations announced pledges to combat man-made carbon dioxide pollution. Although those pledges will not be legally binding, negotiators hope to make some provisions of an agreement enforceable.¶ 	""We just have 11 short days before us,"" French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said as he took over as president of the negotiations. ""Success is not yet assured, but it is within our grasp... The eyes of the world are upon us and there are great hopes.""¶ 	Added the outgoing president, Peruvian Environment Minister Manuel Pulgar-Vidal: ""We can show to the world that we can work together against climate change and against global terrorism.""¶At the opening session, Mr. Obama said that the assembled countries seek ""not simply an agreement to roll back the pollution we put into our skies, but an agreement that helps us lift people from poverty without condemning the next generation to a planet that's beyond its capacity to repair.""¶""Here, in Paris, we can show the world what is possible when we come together, united in common effort and by a common purpose,"" he said.¶ 	Wide Paris-area highways usually packed with commuters were cordoned off to clear the way for all the VIPs. Riot police vans and plainclothes officers were stationed around the capital and by the national stadium, one of the targets of the Nov. 13 attacks that is near the climate conference venue.¶ 	The conference is aimed at the most far-reaching deal ever to tackle global warming. The current climate agreement, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, came under scrutiny because it never required China and other developing nations to make cuts. As a result, the U.S. did not sign onto the agreement, and it covers only about 14 percent of global emissions. Another meeting in Copenhagen in 2009 failed to produce a meaningful agreement¶ 	Among several sticking points is money - how much rich countries should invest to help poor countries cope with climate change, how much should be invested in renewable energy, and how much traditional oil and gas producers stand to lose if countries agree to forever reduce emissions.¶ 	With that in mind, at least 19 governments and 28 leading world investors were announcing billions of dollars in investments to research and develop clean energy technology, with the goal of making it cheaper.¶ 	Backers include Obama, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, billionaires George Soros and Saudi Prince Alaweed bin Talal, and Jack Ma of China's Alibaba.¶ 	Under the initiative, 19 countries pledge to double their spending on low- or no-carbon energy over the next five years. They currently spend about $10 billion a year, about half of that from the U.S., Brian Deese, senior adviser to Mr. Obama on climate and energy issues, told reporters in Washington.¶ 	Gates, the ""intellectual architect"" of the effort, committed $1 billion of his own money, U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz said.¶ 	""We'll work to mobilize support to help the most vulnerable countries expand clean energy and adapt to the effects of climate change we can no longer avoid,"" the president wrote on his Facebook page.¶On Monday, the United States announced it would contribute $51.175 million to help the least developed countries fight climate change and its effects in 2015 and 2016, part of a $248 million pledge announced by the U.S., Canada and nine European countries.¶""I've come here personally, as the leader of the world's largest economy and the second-largest emitter, to say that the United States of America not only recognizes our role in creating this problem, we embrace our responsibility to do something about it,"" Mr. Obama said Monday at the opening session of the conference.¶The money will be made available to a fund for the least developed countries hosted by the Global Environment Facility, a major funder of environment projects worldwide. Other countries that contributed include Denmark, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Sweden and Switzerland.",0

            Americans in Norwegian islands to research effects of climate change - CBS News
    ",CBS News,"November 30, 2015, 8:06 AM","¶World leaders may be negotiating what to do about climate change in Paris, but some of the most important new research on the subject is being done about as far away from civilization as you can get, reports CBS News correspondent Mark Phillips.¶Svalbard is a collection of Norwegian islands just 800 miles from the North Pole. One young American climate scientist has come here to try to unlock some of the secrets of climate change that have been frozen into this landscape for tens of thousands of years.  ¶The 22-year-old Californian, Sarah Strand, won't see the sun again until mid-February. The polar night has set in and darkness isn't the only thing to worry about up here. ¶This is polar bear country, where Strand and her Swedish colleague Norbert Pirk, are required by law to pack protection.¶The bears are more of a threat in summer when the melt-back of their sea-ice hunting ground has made them more desperate for food -- even to the point of attacking a research boat.¶But they're still a threat in winter and it's in winter that this research must be done.¶""It definitely has to be running if we're going to get any data,"" said Strand. ¶ Every day Strand comes out here to check instruments that are measuring a worrying trend -- the release of greenhouse gases, which scientists used to think were safely locked into the frozen ground.  ¶""The main thing we are looking at is the gas exchange with ground carbon dioxide, methane,"" said Strand. ""But then we are comparing that to other parameters that we are measuring here.""  ¶And the more those greenhouse gases are released -- even from frozen places like this -- the more warming there will be. ¶There are concerns of that, yes, especially with the permafrost thawing, that there is now old carbon that is becoming available again to possibly be released into the atmosphere. ""We're trying to shine some light on this,"" Pirk said laughing.¶Strand has been here a year-and-a-half, working in these conditions because the arctic is ironically - and worryingly -- where the Earth appears to be warming most.¶They call it ""arctic amplification,"" because the arctic is warming sooner, faster and more than anywhere else. Why that is happening and what that means for the rest of us is why this little speck in the arctic has become the major center of climate research. ¶""You can't just measure one thing and say, 'I found climate change!'"" said Strand. ""It's more about having all these monitoring projects and understanding how the system is working.""¶Another American -- Hannah Miller -- a 21-one year old from Vermont -- is here too. She came here to study how glaciers are shrinking and their melt-water is contributing to sea-level rise.  Climate change decisions, she says, have to be based on science. ¶""The frustration comes in when climate change deniers use any of the uncertainties to say that your argument is false.  You can have uncertainties and still have solid argument,"" said Miller.¶Miller and Strand have joined a small, dedicated and brave community in Svalbard. It's cutting-edge science up there on the edge of the world.",0

    ","¶BEIJING -- Dealing with smog has become so much a part to daily life in China that it's a regular feature in weather forecasts. ¶On Monday, while world leaders converge in Paris for a U.N. conference on climate change, the air quality index for Beijing exceeds 500; categorized as officially ""beyond index,"" right above ""hazardous.""¶The World Health Organization says a safe level of airborne particulate matter -- that which the air quality index measures -- is 25 micrograms per cubic meter. That line is crossed so often in cities like Beijing that even a government official called it unbearable.¶By 4 p.m. in the capital city on Monday the index hit 608 -- more than 24 times the safe level dictated by the WHO.¶More in Changing China¶The local government issued an orange pollution alert -- only its second highest in a four-tier system, under red. The move requires work at construction sites and factories to halt. ¶Coal supplies two thirds of China's energy consumption, and the northern half of the country relies on it to heat buildings in winter months.¶The issue wasn't fully recognized by China's leaders until 2010, when the U.S. Embassy in Beijing published a tweet calling the air quality readings in Beijing ""crazy bad.""¶The ensuing media coverage pushed it onto the main national stage. Beijing's local government rolled out their own monitoring system and began publishing its findings from 2013.¶The grey-brown-yellow sky has become an embarrassment to hide on occasions that shine a spotlight on China's choked capital city.¶For events like the massive parade celebrating the end of WWII, and the APEC summit last year, drastic measures are put in place, and strictly enforced, to clear the skies if for but a few days.¶Companies compensate expats for it and tourists run away from it.¶If there's a silver lining to the thick layer of smog, it has given birth to a host of creative gimmicks, from a bicycle with a filters to canned fresh air.¶The government says a cold front will likely push into the area in the middle of this week to help clear the air.¶Until then, for Beijingers it's the usual routine: shut the door and wait it out inside.",0

Nearly nine in 10 Democrats (86 percent) and two-thirds of independents support such a move, while a slight majority of Republicans (52 percent) oppose it.¶More in CBS News Polls¶A majority of Americans -- 53 percent -- think global warming is caused mostly by human activity, while fewer -- 31 percent -- think global warming is caused mostly by natural patterns in the earth's environment.  Just 9 percent don't think global warming exists at all.  Belief that global warming is caused by human activity has risen 11 points since 2011.¶While majorities of Democrats (72 percent) and independents (52 percent) believe global warming is caused by human activity, this is true of less than a third of Republicans (32 percent).¶One out of every two Americans thinks global warming is an environmental problem that is having a serious impact now -- up from 38 percent in 2010.  Another 25 percent of Americans thinks the impact of global warming won't happen until sometime in the future, while 19 percent don't think global will have a serious impact.¶In 2007 even more Americans thought global warming was having a serious impact now, but that percentage had dropped considerably by 2010.¶Sixty-eight percent of Democrats and 50 percent of independents think global warming is having a serious impact now.  Just 29 percent of Republicans agree.¶On specific measures, 63 percent of Americans favor limiting the carbon emissions from U.S. power plants, including 44 percent who strongly favor such a move.¶ Americans are more divided on limiting drilling for oil and national gas on public lands, as well as putting limits on logging and mining:  49 percent favor while 45 percent oppose.  Most Americans oppose increasing taxes on either gasoline (60 percent) or electricity (79 percent) in order to reduce global warming.¶But 55 percent Americans would be willing to pay more for electricity if it were generated by renewable sources like solar or wind energy.  Most Democrats and independents would be willing, while most Republicans (58 percent) would not.¶On a personal level, 45 percent of Americans are personally worried about climate change at least a fair amount, while 56 percent are either only a little worried (32 percent) or not at all worried (24 percent).  ¶A majority of Americans -- 54 percent -- now think protecting the environment is more important than stimulating the economy; just 34 percent think stimulating the economy is more important.  While these numbers are similar to those found in April 2007, in December 2009 - amidst the depth of the recent economic recession - nearly two-thirds of Americans thought stimulating the economy was more important.¶Looking ahead, many Americans remain pessimistic that they will leave a better environment for future generations.

Why 2 degrees are so important to the climate,"

    ","¶As the United Nations conference on climate change gets underway Monday in Paris, one temperature that will be on everyone's minds is 2 degrees Celsius (or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). Although it might not sound like a big number, climatologists predict that if the planet warms a total of 2 degrees more than its average temperature before the Industrial Revolution  -- when humans started burning fossil fuels -- the results could be catastrophic.¶What could happen? Think events like greater sea level rise submerging the coasts, more pervasive droughts and wildfires, and plant and animal extinctions across the board. Scientists say this amount of temperature increase could leave us with a significantly different Earth. And unless something changes, we're heading in that direction: U.N. and U.K. climate analysts recently concluded that the Earth has already warmed by 1 degree Celsius, with 2015 the hottest year ever recorded.¶Yale economist William Nordhaus first defined the 2-degree benchmark in a 1977 paper, ""Economic Growth and Climate: The Carbon Dioxide Problem."" Since then, the figure has stood as a rallying cry for those advocating for cutting back on carbon emissions. For others, 2 degrees is still too high -- to allow the Earth to warm even that much would be dire for life on the planet. ¶More in Climate Change¶""Those who study the possible impacts of warming think that there is a threshold before we can start to get much more changed in the world -- like the flooding of low-lying countries, and things like that,"" said Eric Larson, a senior scientist at Climate Central, a nonprofit news organization that provides analysis and information on climate science.¶""Science has established for quite a while that we need to respect a threshold of 2 degrees, that being the limit of the temperature increase that we can afford from a human, economic and infrastructure point of view,"" the top U.N. official on climate change, Christiana Figueres, told CBS News in an interview earlier this fall. Beyond that, ""we would be moving into exceedingly dangerous zones of abrupt interruptions to our economy, to our livelihood, to our infrastructure that frankly we wouldn't even know how to deal with.""¶Moreover, she noted, ""quite recently the insurance industry has come out to say that a world that goes beyond a 2-degree increase is not insurable.""¶At the Paris summit -- known as COP21 since it is the 21st annual Conference of the Parties (COP) on the U.N. Convention on Climate Change -- delegates from more than 190 countries will seek a legally binding agreement to reduce global carbon emissions enough so that the 2-degree threshold is not crossed.¶Measures such as more fuel-efficient cars and households that rely more on renewable energy sources like solar power rather than fossil fuels would help. But Larson told CBS News that studies of the various carbon reduction pledges made by countries including the U.S. over the past few years reveal that if efforts move at their current pace, the planet will easily surpass that 2-degree benchmark . Various estimates project it could reach a disastrous 3 to 5 degree increase by the end of this century.¶Part of the problem of using the 2-degree threshold to spur progress is the fact that the figure sounds pretty insignificant to the average person, Larson added.¶""It's hard to visualize. I mean 2 degrees sounds like not that much, and for instance, climate change will vary depending on geography. The temperature change at the North Pole is going to be much greater than 2 degrees more,"" Larson said.¶Is the goal of holding temperatures to no more than a 2-degree increase even feasible at this point? Larson said yes, it is possible, but it would require nations to completely reorient how they approach energy consumption.¶""It would involve a major changing of the way we produce and use energy today and worldwide. I mean, let's just put in context that the average American emits about 18 tons of carbon dioxide per year. So, for us to get to a world that doesn't tip over 2 degrees and keep it there, we would have to do all sorts of changes that will be difficult for other countries in other places in the world that aren't at the same standard of living (as the U.S. and other developed nations),"" he added. ""To improve their nations' standings, those folks want to use more energy, which of course increases emissions. It's a big challenge."" ¶Larson said that to emphasize the importance of staying below this threshold, it helps to have visceral reminders of the costs at stake. For instance, look at the World Wildlife Fund's 2013 Australia initiative, the ""2 Degrees Project."" Hoping to raise awareness about the temperature's importance, the WWF reported that if global temperature rose between 1.5 and 2.5 degrees Celsius, about 20 to 30 percent of the planet's animals and plants would disappear.¶To drive the point home, WWF-Australia cited iconic examples of the continent's biodiversity -- from the Great Barrier Reef to koalas -- as life forms severely at risk if temperatures continued to rise.¶So, is it time to be nervous about progress to stay below 2 degrees? Are we already too late? Well, you could look at as a glass being either half empty or half full. ¶""It depends on whether you are a pessimist or an optimist. I mean human ingenuity amazes one all the time. We can send a man to the moon, we can develop computers that are twice as fast as they were months ago,"" Larson said. ""So, if we take that ingenuity and build a new style of power plant, switch our car fleet over to electric vehicles -- well, then those sorts of changes take a long time to filter through all of society, and on top of that you have competing desires of the developing world to achieve a certain standard of living."" ¶We've gotten used to living with a great deal of unnecessary waste, he noted. About 95 percent of the energy needed to light a conventional bulb is lost. It starts with one unit of primary energy, like coal or natural gas, and by the time it goes through all of the series of conversions needed to produce light, only five percent is actually put to use. So there's plenty of opportunity for improvement.¶The U.N.'s Figueres points out that making such changes is becoming much more affordable, and that nations and industries increasingly see the economic advantages of investing in clean energy. ""Renewable energy technology, in particular solar, have come down in their cost remarkably. Solar is 80 percent cheaper, 40 percent more efficient"" than just a few years ago, she said. ""In the United States there are two times as many jobs in renewable energy as there is in coal ... Where you see the growth of job creation, that is where the future is.""¶Scientists have been unsure when modern society is likely tip over that 2-degree mark. But those concerned about the state of the environment are pinning great hopes on the Paris talks.¶""I think in some fashion, what comes out of the discussions at the climate meetings should be a communication among all over the world that carbon is a pollutant, and essentially, like all pollutants we have traditionally come to know and love and use, it is something that will be harmful. You want to -- need to -- minimize it,"" Larson said. ""There's so much obfuscation out there and untruths floating around. Out of the talks it would be great to see people realizing we are all in this together -- everyone has to be a part of cutting (carbon) emissions.""",0

Here's what you need to know.¶The meeting goes by several names - the United Nations Climate Summit, the 2015 Paris Climate Conference, or COP21, which stands for the 21st meeting of the Conference of Parties that are part of the United Nations Framework on Climate Change. The first COP meeting took place in Berlin in 1995, and the most famous of these was COP3, which resulted in the 1997 Kyoto Protocol to limit greenhouse gas emissions. ¶A 2009 conference in Copenhagen failed to produce a meaningful agreement, so world leaders are trying again to jumpstart the negotiations.¶More in Climate Change¶About 150 world leaders and than more than 40,000 delegates representing 195 countries will attend the conference in Paris.¶The conference begins less than three weeks after the Paris terror attacks that left 130 people dead and scores more injured. Paris and other European cities are still on high alert, and concerns about a repeat attack led the authorities to ban thousands of demonstrators and environmental activists who are urging their governments to make steep cuts to emissions and help poor countries deal with global warming.¶During a press conference with French President Francois Hollande earlier this month, President Obama said going ahead with the climate summit in spite of the heightened alert levels would send ""a powerful rebuke to the terrorists.""¶At another news conference, he said, ""I think it is absolutely vital for every country, every leader to send a signal that the viciousness of a handful of killers does not stop the world from doing vital business."" ¶The president left Washington, D.C. Sunday to attend the talks. After he arrived, on Sunday evening, he went with French President Francois Hollande and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo to the Bataclan, the site of one of the attacks, to pay his respects to the victims. According to the network pool accompanying him, Mr. Obama stood for a long minute of silence before the many candles and flowers and wordlessly laid a single rose at the makeshift memorial.¶Nations are working toward a global, legally binding agreement that will lower greenhouse gas emissions in order to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius (35.6 degrees Farenheit) - the critical number identified by scientists. Once global warming climbs beyond that threshold, they say, the earth's land, food and water supply would be harmed, endangering the planet's population.¶The 2014 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said the planet has already warmed by 0.85 degrees Celsius from 1880 to 2012 and could increase by another 1.5 to 4 degrees by the end of the century, compared to 1850.¶At the COP20 meeting in Lima last year, governments agreed to submit their pledges to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Climate negotiators are pushing for stronger commitments in Paris as a necessary step toward building the world's economic future.¶""It would also show investors that the world is firmly committed to a low-carbon future, which is exactly the signal the private sector needs to go all-in on renewable energy technologies, create new markets and new jobs,"" Paul Bodnar, the National Security Council's senior director for energy and climate change, told reporters.¶Bodnar also said that the negotiators will look for ways to have countries regularly update their greenhouse gas emission reduction targets.¶The U.S. is looking to get major emerging countries more involved, as shown by President Obama's scheduled meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian President Narendra Modi on his first day at the conference.¶President Obama is also meeting with island nations that are most susceptible to changes in sea level because of climate change, including Seychelles, Kiribati, St. Lucia and Barbados.¶Will they achieve their goal?¶The year leading up to the Paris climate talks was preceded by some significant actions that suggest there is momentum headed into the talks.¶During a summit in Beijing last year, Mr. Obama announced a U.S. pledge to cut emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent by 2025, compared to 2005 levels. China did not give a specific amount it would cut, but set a target for its emissions to peak by 2030 or earlier if possible. ¶The two nations combined are responsible for nearly half the world's carbon emissions.¶Just before that agreement, the European Union also agreed to cut emissions 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. ¶The current climate agreement, known as the Kyoto Protocol, came under scrutiny because it never required China and other developing nations to make cuts. As a result, the U.S. did not sign onto the agreement, and it covers only about 14 percent of global emissions.  ¶The White House said last week that that 170 countries, representing 90 percent of global emissions, have put forward their post-2020 targets for reducing carbon emissions ahead of the climate conference. And they pointed to an independent analysis that said the commitments would limit the rise in warming to 2.7 degrees by the end of the century. This would be 0.7 degrees higher than the critical 2-degree number, but it's a marked improvement over the 4-degree rise researchers said would occur without action.¶Timmons Roberts, a senior fellow in Global Economy and Development at the Brookings Institution, said the Paris negotiations are promising because now people can see the effects of climate change in their lives: they feel the hotter, longer summers; ""spring comes earlier, and major weather events are becoming more frequent,"" he said.¶He also argued that improvements in the American economy, the low price of solar and wind power and a push from Pope Francis to act on climate change make success more likely. ¶Experts are less certain the countries will be able to reach an agreement on how to finance the fight against climate change. At previous meetings, the richer countries pledged $100 billion by 2020 to help poorer countries move away from carbon-fueled growth.¶What challenges does Obama face?¶While world leaders may be moving toward an agreement on climate change, the Republican-led Congress is looking for ways to block the promises Mr. Obama has made.¶The House will vote this week to repeal rules by the Environmental Protection Agency to cut carbon emissions from power plants, according to the Wall Street Journal. The rules are the major vehicle through which the president was hoping to achieve a reduction in U.S. carbon emissions.¶Nearly half of states are also suing to block the rules from taking effect, arguing the administration overstepped its authority.¶Some Republicans also oppose giving U.S. dollars to the U.N. Green Climate Fund, which would help poorer countries combat climate change. They may seek to block Mr. Obama from giving any of the $3 billion the U.S. has pledged for the fund in the next spending bill, which they must pass by Dec. 11.¶White House officials have not outlined a strategy to work with Republicans on the issue, aside from calling it a ""priority"" for Mr. Obama. In a speech on the Senate floor, Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Oklahoma, accused the president and State Department of ""recklessly leading the world to believe we will live up to emission reductions the administration can't substantiate and won't even defend before congressional committees.""¶U.S. officials have indicated that any agreement from the climate talks should not be called a treaty, which would need ratification from the Senate.",0

""Something game-changing massive would have to happen for it not to be a record.""¶Records go back to 1880.¶Jarraud also said it is likely that the world has now warmed by 1 degree Celsius, or 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit, over pre-industrial times. That's a symbolic milestone: International leaders have set a goal of keeping global warming within 2 degrees C, 3.6 F, of pre-industrial times.¶""It's a fair summary of where we are,"" said Gavin Schmidt, head of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. ""2015 is going to be exceptional in many ways.""¶The world is warming because of heat-trapping gases that come from the burning of coal, oil and gas. On top of that, El Nino, a naturally occurring climate event that starts with warm water in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific, makes the world even warmer, scientists say.¶The report is an atlas of extreme weather, from heat waves in Pakistan and India, where high temperatures broke 45 degrees Celsius, or 113 degrees F, to a record strong Hurricane Patricia in Mexico.

"If Antarctica is gaining ice, why is the Earth still warming?","

    ","¶NASA recently released a study suggesting that the Antarctic Ice Sheet is gaining more ice than it is losing -- a finding that, at first blush, seems to contradict the idea of global warming. So, how can Antarctica be gaining ice mass in a warming world where ice sheets are collapsing and the melting is predicted to increase sea levels across the globe?¶It turns out that the two phenomena -- a growing ice sheet and warming-related melting -- are not mutually exclusive. Moreover, the NASA study, which was published Oct. 30 in the Journal of Glaciology, does not disprove global warming.¶Rather, the researchers found that snow accumulation is adding more ice to East Antarctica (the huge chunk of the continent to the east of the Transantarctic Mountains) and the interior region of West Antarctica than is being lost as glaciers across Antarctica thin out. More snow accumulation is, counterintuitively, a sign of global warming; more precipitation happens when there is more moisture in the air, and more moisture in the air is a product of higher temperatures, said Elizabeth Thomas, a glaciologist with the British Antarctic Survey. [Infographic: Your Guide to Antarctica]¶More in Climate Change¶Ice elevation¶The NASA researchers made their observation on the current state of the Antarctic Ice Sheet -- which covers an area roughly the size of the United States and Mexico combined -- by taking altitude measurements using data collected by the European Remote Sensing (ERS) satellites between 1992 and 2001 and using the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) between 2003 and 2008.¶The ERS satellites were equipped with radar altimeters, whereas the ICESat had a laser altimeter. An altimeter measures elevation by shooting a beam of radio waves (radar) or a beam of light (laser) to the ice surface. The altimeter records the time it takes the waves to bounce off the surface and back to the satellite. The higher the elevation, the quicker the return time, and vice versa. [See Stunning Photos of Antarctic Ice]¶Then, the researchers mapped out how ice elevation had changed over time. They found that, although certain areas of Antarctica, such as the Antarctic Peninsula and the coastal parts of western Antarctica, are losing more ice than they are gaining, overall, the continent's ice is growing.¶Specifically, between 1992 and 2001, snow accumulation added about 121 gigatons of ice per year, on average, where 1 gigaton equals about 1 billion U.S. tons. That number dropped to 82 gigatons per year between 2003 and 2008.¶Controversy over the study¶However, although the findings don't negate climate change or suggest warming is slowing down, they have been met with some pushback from the scientific community.¶For example, the study doesn't include current data, leading some scientists to question whether the results are meaningful.¶The most recent data in the study was from 2008, noted Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University. Many of the recent studies that demonstrate the range of ice loss take more recent data into account, Mann told Live Science. The study ""is making a statement about the way things are today [using] a data set that is seven years out of date,"" he said. ""If they used data that was up-to-date, they would find a higher rate of loss,"" Mann noted.¶Mann also mentioned that he knows of several ice experts who are a little skeptical of the elevation measurements in certain regions, such as the region surrounding Lake Vostok. Regions near large bodies of water have highly variable elevations because of the presence of liquid water, and it's not clear whether the NASA study accounted for this. [See Photos of a Subglacial Lake in Antarctica]¶The results also contradict a finding detailed last year in the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters, in which Christoper Harig, a geoscientist at Princeton University, and his colleagues found a net loss of ice covering Antarctica. They relied on GRACE measurements for their study.¶Jay Zwally, a glaciologist with NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and colleagues said in their Journal of Glaciology paper that the new results are more accurate than those in Harig's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite study because they are based more on ICESat measurements, which according to Zwally, are better at adjusting for the rise and fall of land that happens when ice has been removed or added to it, respectively -- a phenomenon called glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA). When ice melts, the land beneath it rebounds slightly as the weight is removed. It's critical to account for that rebound when measuring elevation, scientists say.¶""This paper, which uses laser altimetry, claims the discrepancy between our results is due to recent GIA model corrections being incorrect, and that GRACE is more sensitive to error,"" Harig wrote in an email to the Washington Post, according to this WaPo report. ""If we added back the GIA corrections, and compare our results, then their estimates should agree with ours because we measure mass directly. Instead, they are still very far away.""¶However, Mann said that, although the consensus among climate scientists is that Antarctica is, indeed, losing more ice than it is gaining, the new NASA study still demonstrates good science. ¶""This is the way science works; the scientific community is doing its best to understand and reconcile [the NASA study data],"" he said. Even if the results can't be verified, Mann said, the research was conducted in good faith and shouldn't be dismissed as unimportant to the greater body of work.¶Is Antarctica warming?¶So, what is actually happening in Antarctica? The Antarctic is not warming as fast as the Arctic is, said Zwally, who led the NASA study. ""It's more like the global change [rates],"" Zwally said. In other words, the Antarctic region is seeing a regional temperature rise that matches the temperature rise seen on average around the world, instead of the much higher temperature rise in the Arctic regions noted by NOAA. Scientists think the Antarctic region is experiencing a slower temperature rise than the Arctic, because the ozone hole over Antarctic has created weather trends, specifically in East Antarctica, that has slowed it down.¶""East Antarctica is not warming as fast as West Antarctica -- that's the part of Antarctica that is the most susceptible to ice loss,"" Mann said. In 2007, researchers reported in the journal Geophysical Research Letters that they had found a link between this phenomenon and the ozone hole over Antarctica. Depleting ozone in the upper atmosphere changes wind dynamics there, Mann said. That change causes a strengthening of the jet stream and the polar winds, but it also traps the cold air in the regions around East Antarctica, creating a cooling effect.¶As the ozone hole has gotten smaller, this cooling effect has mostly disappeared, Mann said, meaning that even East Antarctica will have warming rates comparable to global warming rates soon.¶Zwally also noted that if the warming were to continue at current rates, the ice gains that the NASA study found would not continue. In other words, the melting would increase enough to offset the large amounts of snow building on the surface.¶Trends over time¶Other research has started to look at older records of Antarctica's climate, in order to place current data into historical context. Doing so can help scientists better understand how current observations fit into the larger story of Antarctica's climate. In a separate study, published Nov. 4 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, researchers studied the climate of West Antarctica over the past three centuries by looking at ice core records. The researchers found that snow accumulation in the 20th century had been significantly higher than in the previous two centuries looked at in the study.¶""It looks as though [this trend] is related to there being more storms [in West Antarctica],"" said Thomas, of the British Antarctic Survey. ""Just because [West Antarctica] is getting more snow doesn't mean that [the ice sheet is] getting thicker.""¶She explained that both higher snow accumulation and thinning ice sheets are results of the same regional warming phenomenon. The amount of precipitation is tied to the amount of sea ice in the region. ""When we had a lot of sea ice, we don't have so much moisture,"" she said.¶Going forward¶It's clear that studying climate change is a complicated endeavor, but any climate scientist will stress the importance of understanding what's happening to Antarctica. ""In terms of climate, [the process] is hugely complex, and [there is] a lot going on,"" Thomas said. It will take a lot of research to get a better understanding of what's happening there because records of the region date back only decades.  ¶Moreover, further research should investigate the smaller changes happening in Antarctica that contribute to regional climate change, scientists say.¶Follow Elizabeth Newbern @liznewbern.

            Bernie Sanders doubles down on climate change-terrorism link - CBS News
    ",CBS News,"November 15, 2015, 1:51 PM","¶Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders doubled down on the link between terrorism and climate change Sunday in defense of his stance that global warming presents the greatest national security threat to the United States.¶""If we are going to see an increase in drought, in flood, and extreme weather disturbances as a result of climate change, what that means is that people all over the world are going to be fighting over limited natural resources,"" the Vermont senator said Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" elaborating on an arugment he made during the CBS News Democratic debate Saturday night. ""If there is not enough water, if there is not enough land to grow your crops, then you're going to see migrations of people fighting over land that will sustain them.  And that will lead to international conflict.""  ¶Pressed by moderator John Dickerson over the explicit link between a drought and the Paris attacks this weekend, Sanders took the connection one step further.¶""When people migrate into cities and they don't have jobs, there's going to be a lot more instability, a lot more unemployment, and people will be subject to the types of propaganda that al Qaeda and ISIS are using right now,"" he said.¶Sanders spent much of the debate talking about income inequality and the dangers of big banks, two signature issues of his campaign. On that issue, he said, ""good public policy is good politics.""¶""The six large banks have assets equivalent to 56 percent of the GDP of the United States of America.  For me, it is obvious,"" he said. ""We have got to break them up so that we don't go through another economic meltdown.""¶He rejected arguments that a Democratic president won't be able to make much headway on financial regulation because there will almost certainly be a Republican Congress re-elected in 2016. He argued once again that he is trying to create a ""political revolution"" of millions of people who have never been involved in the political process before or who have been ""so alienated by big money and politics that they've kind of tuned out.""¶A new CBS News/New York Times poll showed that Democratic primary voters actually see former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as the best candidate to bring about change. Sixty-two percent of those voters said she could bring about real change in the way things are done in Washington, whereas 51 percent said the same of Sanders.¶Sanders conceded that he needs to draw the distinction with Clinton more starkly for voters. But he still believes his campaign has had great success so far.¶""We started this campaign at something like 3 percent or 4 percent in the polls.  We have come a long way in the six months that I've been in this race,"" he said. ""I think the more people are familiar with Bernie Sanders and the programs that I'm advocating and what I've been trying to do in Congress, the better we are going to do.""¶In the CBS News/New York Times poll, 52 percent of Democratic primary voters said they want to see Clinton as the nominee.

    ","¶Zachariæ Isstrøm is a giant glacier in the northeast of Greenland. It is one of the three main glaciers that feeds into the roughly 373-mile-long Northeast Greenland Ice Stream that drains 12 percent of the island's interior ice sheet. Right now, the glacier is melting at such a rapid rate that it could lead to a continuous sea level rise for decades to come.¶In a new NASA-funded report published in the journal Science, researchers report that the large glacier entered this ""phase of accelerated retreat"" in fall 2012. The rate of its ice velocity tripled. Warming temperatures, hotter air and water temperatures are causing the glacier to detach from the stabilizing sill that anchors it to the island's coastline. ¶The glacier drains ice from an area of 35,440 square miles, which is around 5 percent of the ice sheet. On its own, this glacier holds enough ice to raise global sea levels by more than 18 inches, according to a NASA press release. ¶""North Greenland glaciers are changing rapidly,"" lead author Jeremie Mouginot, an assistant researcher in the Department of Earth System Science at the University of California, Irvine, said in the release. ""The shape and dynamics of Zachariæ Isstrøm have change dramatically over the last few years. The glacier is now breaking up and calving high volumes of icebergs into the ocean.""¶More in Climate Change¶Similarly, the glacier's equally massive neighbor, Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden, is also melting, but retreating at a slower rate. Together, these melting giants could increase the global sea levels by more than 39 inches.¶In order to observe these changes, the research team used data from aerial surveys from NASA's Operation IceBridge as well as imagery from multiple international space agencies. The team used a sensitive radar sounder, gravimeter, and laser-profiling systems in addition to radar and optical images sent from space. All of these tools were used to measure changes in the size, position, and shape of the region's glacial ice. ¶""Zachariæ Isstrøm is being hit from above and below. The top of the glacier is melting away as a result of decades of steadily increasing air temperatures, while its underside is compromised by currents carrying warmer ocean water, and the glacier is now breaking away into bits and pieces and retreating into deeper ground,"" study senior author Eric Rignot, chancellor's professor of Earth system science at UCI, said.¶Rignot, also a joint faculty appointee at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, added that researchers have long been curious what a massive melt of the planet's large glaciers would do to sea levels. He said the possible results of this melting are ""staggering.""¶""We no longer need to wonder,"" he said. ""We've been able to directly observe the results of climate warming on polar glaciers.""",0

    ","¶NASHVILLE, Tennessee -- After decades of raising alarms about global warming, former Vice President Al Gore is now raising hopes.¶As a top-level international climate summit starts later this month in Paris, Gore - who helped negotiate the 1997 climate treaty that didn't control the problem - is sure this time will be different.¶""I'm optimistic,"" Gore said in a sit-down interview this week with The Associated Press. ""We're going to win this. We need to win it faster because a lot of damage is being done day by day. We continue to put 110 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere every 24 hours as if it's an open sewer.""¶More in Climate Change¶In 35 minutes, Gore - portrayed by critics as a preacher of doom and gloom - uses versions of the words ""optimistic"" or ""hopeful"" or ""positive"" at least 16 times.¶Even when he ticks off the alarming impacts of global warming, he finishes with a note of confidence.¶""The number of extremely hot days has multiplied dramatically,"" Gore said. ""The large downpours, floods, mudslides, the deeper and longer droughts, rising sea levels from the melting ice, forest fires, there's a long list of events that people can see and feel viscerally now. Every night on the television news is like a nature hike through the Book of Revelation.""¶But he added: ""Increasingly people are connecting those dots. And even if they don't use the phrase climate crisis or global warming, more and more people are feeling that this is going to have to be addressed.""¶On Friday, Gore will take his mixed message of alarm and hope to Paris, a bit ahead of world leaders. He will host a 24-hour-telethon of sorts from the Eiffel Tower to raise awareness about global warming, featuring Elton John, French President Francois Hollande, actor Jared Leto, Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, former United Nations chief Kofi Annan, actor Ryan Reynolds and California Gov. Jerry Brown.¶But he said it's no longer just about convincing people to act - it now makes sense economically, too. He says solar and wind energy is dirt cheap - even free in Texas at certain hours. Businesses and developing countries are taking climate change seriously, he said.¶""There really is a wave in corporate America moving rapidly toward a low carbon economy,"" Gore said.¶Unlike the Kyoto treaty in 1997, which mandated emission cuts for rich nations but not poor, what's likely out of Paris won't require ratification by the U.S. Senate and is based on countries setting their own goals. And that, Gore insisted, is ""more productive.""¶But is Gore, himself?¶Dana Fisher, director of the Program for Society and the Environment at the University of Maryland, said Gore's ""role is limited at this point. There was a moment in time when he was pushing a wave of attention."" But now, she says, she didn't even know that Gore was organizing his Paris telethon.¶""I never thought of him as central person in the climate movement,"" Fisher said.¶Gore insists that he is. He said he's trained ""many thousands"" of activists and still consults with leaders in the U.S. and other governments at all levels. He plans to be at the Paris climate talks ""until the last dog dies.""¶Some experts suggest Gore's stint as the public face of climate change activism - especially with his 2006 documentary ""An Inconvenient Truth"" - may have turned off some people because the messenger was so associated with Democratic politics.¶""Climate change science is demonized because of Al Gore,"" said Erik Conway, a NASA historian who co-wrote the book ""Merchants of Doubt."" Conway doesn't fault Gore, but said, ""If John McCain had become the titular leader of the climate change movement instead of Al Gore, we might have a different world.""¶But Naomi Oreskes, a Harvard historian who is a co-author of the book with Conway, disagrees. ""He's become demonized because he is effective,"" she said.¶For his part, Gore said, ""Whoever becomes highly visible as a spokesman for change gets the slings and arrows and all of the anger directed at the messenger to try to get at the message.""¶In addition to his Climate Reality Project, his main advocacy group (which is co-producing the telethon), Gore is chairman of Generation Investment Management, a boutique investment managing firm. He is on Apple's board of directors and is a senior partner at a Kleiner Parkins Caufield & Byers, a major Silicon Valley venture capital fund.¶Fifteen years later, the 67-year-old Gore claims he doesn't dwell on 2000 election, when he won the popular vote but lost the Electoral College: ""I started moving forward the day after the Supreme Court decision and I'm excited about the future.""¶So was losing the presidency was all for the best?¶""No, I wouldn't say that,"" Gore said, laughing. ""I don't think there's any position with as much potential to create positive change as much as president of the U.S., but that was not to be. I feel very fortunate other ways to make a positive difference.""¶Then he returned to the subject of his telethon. Hozier will be among the performers; Gore whips out his iPhone to play the singer's 2014 hit, ""Take Me To Church.""¶He closed his eyes and listened. The song's final verse: ""In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene, only then I am human, only then I am clean.""",0

Officials said the El Nino weather phenomenon is having a strong impact this year, although it is not the only factor.¶""We've had similar natural events in the past, yet this is the first time we're set to reach the 1 degree C marker and it's clear that it is human influence driving our modern climate into uncharted territory,"" said Stephen Belcher, director of the Met Office Hadley Centre for climate science.¶The agency noted it doesn't mean every year from now will be at least 1 degree warmer ""as natural variability will still play a role.""¶Meanwhile, the U.N. weather agency reports that levels of carbon dioxide and methane, the two most important greenhouse gases contributing to climate change, reached record highs last year.¶CO2 levels rose to nearly 398 parts per million, from 396 ppm in 2013, the World Meteorological Organization said.¶The CO2 level fluctuates throughout the year and the monthly average crossed the symbolic 400 ppm threshold in March 2015. The WMO said the annual average ""is likely to pass 400 ppm in 2016.""¶Pushed by the burning of coal, oil and gas for energy, global CO2 levels are now 143 percent higher than before the industrial revolution. Scientists say that's the main driver of global warming.¶WMO said methane levels reached a new high of about 1,833 parts per billion in 2014. About 40 percent of methane emissions come from natural sources and about 60 percent from human activities, like cattle breeding, rice agriculture and the extraction of fossil fuels.¶""Every year we report a new record in greenhouse gas concentrations,"" WMO Secretary-General Michel Jarraud said. ""We have to act now to slash greenhouse gas emissions if we are to have a chance to keep the increase in temperatures to manageable levels.""¶World governments are meeting in Paris later this month to craft a new U.N. pact to rein in greenhouse gas emissions. More than 150 countries including top greenhouse gas polluters China, the United States, the European Union and India have pledged to cut or curb their emissions in the next decade.¶Meanwhile, climate change is already transforming the Earth, melting Arctic sea ice, intensifying heat waves, and warming and acidifying the ocean.¶The U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has predicted that sea levels could rise as much as 21 feet in the next century if global warming continues unchecked, partly due to melting ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica and shrinking glaciers triggered by the rise in heat-trapping, greenhouse gas emissions.¶""As the planet warms, the poles warm even faster, raising important questions about how ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica will respond,"" Andrea Dutton, a University of Florida geochemist and lead author of a study on rising sea levels published in Science last July, told CBS News. ""While this amount of sea-level rise will not happen overnight, it is sobering to realize how sensitive the polar ice sheets are to temperatures that we are on path to reach within decades.""¶Dangerous effects could include flooding of coastal cities and island nations, disruptions to agriculture and drinking water, and the spread of diseases and the extinction of species.",0
Renowned beer brewer says it's a victim of climate change,"

    ","¶BRUSSELS -- One of the most renowned Belgian beer brewers said Friday it is a victim of climate change because increasingly high temperatures have shortened the brewing season by about a month compared with the 1950s.¶The Cantillon gueuze brewery needs to cool its hot brew in open tanks so that the natural yeasts in the air can help produce the sour beer that has developed a niche following throughout the world. However, with temperatures staying as high as 15 C (59 F) at night during the past days, Cantillon has stopped brewing since it doesn't want to use artificial refrigeration.¶""It is totally abnormal. We have those night temperatures in the summer and with such a temperature it is totally impossible to brew,"" Cantillon brewer Jean Van Roy said.¶Scientists say the global average temperature has risen by about 0.8 degrees C since the industrial revolution. The issue will be discussed at a major U.N. climate conference in Paris that opens Nov. 30.¶In the Cantillon brewery in the center of Brussels, the unusually warm weather means the copper vessels that should be steaming with golden brew are empty.¶More in Climate Change¶""The goal was to brew yesterday, so if we did it (the vessel) would be totally full,"" he said. ""But as you can see: totally empty,"" Van Roy said.¶Cantillon is renowned for its traditional methods and refuses to use  artificial refrigeration, which some other brewers have switched to. It  makes Van Roy's brewing season totally dependent on the seasonal  temperatures.¶In his grandfather's days, the season would run from  mid-October to early May. ""We are beginning right now, mainly in  November, to end in the end of March or early April,"" Van Roy said.¶""We are losing more than one month and if it continues we will lose maybe two months and that is certainly do to the global warming,"" he said.¶Even Brazilians are hunkering for a dip in temperatures. ""I am hoping that we get cold, so that they can start the production very soon,"" said Brazilian visitor Francisco Romanini.¶The Belgian brewer's claims come after U.S. government scientists  said that 14  extreme weather events  in 2014 were made worse by climate change caused by pollution.¶Extreme heat events were one focus of the U.S. government's  report on the impact of climate change around the world. The study  found that in 2014, extreme heat waves, like one that gripped South  Korea, were made worse by human-caused climate change which includes  things such as car emissions, burning coal and methane gas.",0

            Report: Human-caused climate change exacerbates extreme weather events - CBS News
    ",CBS News,"November 5, 2015, 7:27 PM","¶SAN FRANCISCO-- Government scientists said Thursday that 14 of last year's extreme weather events were made worse by climate change caused by pollution -- examples include the 2014 California wildfires, and cyclones in Hawaii.¶In a recent development, California continues to feel the effects of climate change. Most years the Dungeness crab harvest in California is bountiful and worth close to $60 million, but this year there may not be any harvest. High levels of toxic algae in the ocean make the crab too dangerous to eat. The widespread algae bloom is because of unusually high temperatures in the Pacific. ¶""It's unbelievably warm. We have never had a warming event like this -- the extent of it, the different contributing factors, and how this going to play out this season leads scientists to have huge concerns,"" said Sarah Cohen who is a marine biologist at San Francisco State University.¶Extreme heat events are one focus of the report on the impact of climate change around the world. The study found that in 2014, extreme heat waves, like one that gripped South Korea, were made worse by human-caused climate change which includes things such as car emissions, burning coal and methane gas.¶The report studied 28 extreme weather events around the world last year. Fourteen of those --  including devastating floods in Australia and New Zealand -- were found to be made worse in part by climate change.¶But the impact of human activity can be complex, the report says. In the United States, record snowfall in the Northeast and Midwest was not a result of climate change -- rather, just cyclical weather patterns. ¶ However, the study says severe wildfires in California are becoming more likely because of global warming.¶""Climate change is causing a lot of unfortunate, disastrous impacts around the world,"" Cohen said.¶This is the 4th year scientists have studied whether human activity is at least partially to blame for such things as heat waves, droughts, and wildfires. Over those years, more than half the extreme weather events studied have been linked to human-caused climate change",0

    ","¶SEATTLE -- They can't vote yet, but dozens of young people want a say in the planet's future, so minors nationwide have been suing states and the federal government in recent years to push action on climate change.¶They say their generation will bear the brunt of global warming and that government at every level has an obligation to protect natural resources, including the atmosphere, as a ""public trust"" for future generations.¶The Oregon-based nonprofit Our Children's Trust has been leading efforts to file lawsuits or administrative petitions in every state and against the federal government. Some of the youth-led cases have been dismissed, while others are pending in states including Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Oregon.¶More in Climate Change¶""None of them have gotten to the finish line,"" said Michael Gerrard, a professor and director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. ""It's an uphill climb. The U.S. courts have so far not wanted to set climate policy.""¶Other experts say it's unclear how a state can combat a global problem.¶In Seattle, eight activists between ages 10 and 15 petitioned Washington state last year to adopt stricter science-based regulations to protect them against climate change. The case has been moving through a state court, and oral arguments are scheduled Tuesday.¶""We're the ones who have to live with it if the oceans are acidic and the planet is 5 degrees warmer,"" said Gabriel Mandell, 13, an eighth-grader and plaintiff in the case. ""The snowpack is melting. Ocean is acidifying. The Earth is warming. Everything that can go wrong is going wrong, and we need to fix it.""¶Mandell and other youths represented by the Western Environmental Law Center argue that Washington state has failed to reduce carbon emissions based on the best available science. They say the government has violated its duties under the state constitution and the legal principle called the public trust doctrine, which requires the government to protect shared resources.¶The state said in court documents that the Washington Department of Ecology department was working on adopting a rule to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.¶""Climate change is the most important environmental problem,"" said Stu Clark, Washington's air quality program manager. ""We need to do whatever we can. We are doing what we can with what we have.""¶Nationwide, the cases need to pass certain legal hurdles, such as establishing that the public trust doctrine applies to the Earth's atmosphere or that the children have standing to sue. The cases have cleared some hurdles but not all, said Gerrard, the professor.¶""I don't think this litigation is going to be successful because climate change is a global problem, and it's not clear what a state could do,"" added Richard Stewart, a law professor at New York University. ""A state could do certain things, but it can only make an infinitesimal contribution"" to a global problem.¶In Oregon, two Eugene teens are appealing after a state judge rejected their petition in May. The judge ruled that Oregon's public trust doctrine does not apply to the atmosphere, water, beaches and shorelines.¶In August, 21 youths across the country sued the federal government, alleging that approval of fossil fuel development has violated the fundamental right of citizens to be free from government actions that harm life, liberty and property.¶The EPA did not comment on specifics of the lawsuit but said in a statement that President Barack Obama and the agency have been taking action to ""give our kids and grandkids the cleaner, safer future they deserve.""¶Aji Piper, 15, a Seattle high school sophomore, is a plaintiff in that case and the one in Washington state.¶""The government isn't doing the best to assure that we have the best quality of life,"" he said. ""It holds more urgency for us. Our future is at hand.""¶The Washington case has gone the farthest because a judge in King County Superior Court will be hearing arguments on the petition's merits, rather than on a procedural or jurisdictional issue, said Julia Olson, executive director for Our Children's Trust.",0

    ","¶Climate change poses a rising global public health and safety threat, and children are particularly vulnerable, the American Academy of Pediatrics says in a new policy statement.¶The group is urging pediatricians and politicians to work together to solve the crisis and protect children from the immediate and long-term health consequences of climate change. ¶""There is nothing more important than protecting the health, welfare and future for our children and grandchildren,"" the statement's lead author, Dr. Samantha Ahdoot, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Virginia Commonwealth School of Medicine and member of the AAP's Council on Environmental Health Executive Committee, told CBS News. ""Climate change is about the world in which our children are living today and in which they will be raising their own families.  Their future is at stake, yet they do not vote and they have no voice in the debate. We have a moral obligation to act on their behalf.""¶More in Climate Change¶The AAP's policy statement breaks down the health consequences of climate change into direct and indirect effects.¶Storms and heat waves¶Direct effects include those that result from extreme weather events, including severe storms, floods and wildfires that scientists say are occurring more frequently and on a larger scale because of climate change. ""Children's unique needs place them at risk of injury, death, loss of or separation from caregivers and mental health consequences due to severe weather events,"" Ahdoot said. ¶For example, the report points out that after Hurricane Katrina, more than 5,000 children were separated from their families and it took six months to reunite the last missing child with her family. Between 200,000 and 300,000 children were evacuated and relocated as a result of the storm, temporarily or permanently, taking a toll on their academic performance, behavior and mental health.¶In addition, as heat waves have become more frequent and prolonged in many regions in recent years, heat-related illnesses and deaths among children have also risen. The report points out that infants and high school athletes are especially vulnerable.¶In fact, one study projects that heat-related deaths among infants will increase by 5.5 percent in females and 7.8 percent in males by the end of this century. And research has found heat-related illness is a leading cause of death and disability in high school athletes, with a national estimate of 9,237 cases annually.¶Wide-ranging impact¶The report also highlights a wide range of other climate-related health issues that are likely to have a disproportionate impact on children.¶Children may increasingly suffer from respiratory diseases and asthma due to decreased air quality, lengthened allergy seasons and smoke from wildfires, the report states.¶Climate also influences the spread of a number of infectious diseases that affect children across the world, including malaria, dengue fever, West Nile virus and Chikungunya, a mosquito-borne virus that has been spreading through the Caribbean in recent years.¶In addition, the authors point to the increased transmission risk of Lyme disease in the northeastern United States in recent decades, as they suspect rising temperatures have played a role.¶Changing weather patterns also threaten nutrition among children around the world, as severe storms, drought and loss of fertile land to rising seas challenges farmers' abilities to produce crops. The nutritional value of foods may be diminished by increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which impacts grain quality by lowering the protein, iron and zinc content of major crops like wheat, rice and barley.¶""Protein and micronutrient deficiencies are already big drivers of malnutrition globally, and so those changes in the plant composition translate into potentially worsening of malnutrition on top of the altered crop yields that we were already thinking would happen because of the changing weather patterns,"" Dr. Perry Sheffield, assistant professor in preventive medicine and pediatrics at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, told CBS News.¶Finally, the report emphasized that children in the world's poorest countries, where health burdens due to disease and malnutrition are already disproportionately high, are most affected by climate change.¶Call to action¶The American Academy of Pediatrics calls for pediatricians, the health sector and governments to take action to address these issues. It urges the promotion of energy efficiency and renewable energy production, surveillance and research on climate-associated health conditions, public awareness and education campaigns and funding for public transit and urban planning that supports open space, walkability and green building design.¶Experts say that focusing on the health effects of climate change, particularly as they relate to children, may resonate with the public and spur more action.¶""I think it makes it more real to people,"" Sheffield said. ""Sometimes it may be hard for people to relate to animals on other continents that they don't have a personal relationship with. But almost everyone knows a child who's asthmatic, so that can really drive it home.""¶Ahdoot said she is hopeful for the future, and sees signs that support is growing to address the issue of climate change. ""The tide is turning. Families are increasingly aware of the changes occurring today, and the threat that unchecked climate change poses to their children,"" she said. ""I am optimistic that humanity will rise to this challenge, and that the process is already underway.""",0
Climate change could push snow leopards to extinction,"

    ","¶Climate change could hurtle one of the world's most elusive big cats close to extinction.¶It is estimated that there are as few as 4,000 snow leopards left in Central Asia's high mountains. Poaching and habitat loss have contributed to a 20 percent population decline over the last 16 years, and a new study from the World Wildlife Fund warns that the habitat loss from the effects of climate change could wipe out the species.¶The report was released Friday on the first International Snow Leopard Day, which is meant to raise awareness for conservation of the endangered species. The WWF found that warming temperatures could cause a change in the cats' mountainous climates, leaving more than a third of the habitat unsuitable for snow leopards. Currently, less than 14 percent of the big cat's habitat has been studied by research or conservation activities, according to the report.¶""Climate change is a major risk, but we also need to concentrate on other factors,"" Sami Tornikoski, leader of the WWF's Living Himalayas Initiative, said in a press release. ""Snow leopards won't survive for long unless we tackle climate change alongside other threats such as poaching, retaliatory killings by herders, declining prey species, and poorly planned development.""¶More in Climate Change¶Snow leopards range over a large expanse of 12 countries -- Afghanistan, Bhutan, China, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. Despite this being a large land area, the animals' populations are segmented in tiny fragments, and it is estimated that there are a mere 2,500 breeding adults alive in the wild.¶Radical shifts in the region's climate would have a trickle-down effect, impacting not just the leopards, but the mountain communities that depend on the region's natural resources. More than 330 million people live within 6 miles of rivers that stem from the animal's habitat. Water contributed by monsoons, summer rains, melting glaciers, winter storms, and permafrost are part of a complex water system that forms the headwaters of more than 20 water basins that contribute to the water supplies of 21 countries, including China. ¶WWF researchers state that an increase in temperatures could shift the tree line -- or the furthest edge of a habitat where trees are capable of growth -- higher up the mountains, which would encourage plant species less appealing to the leopard's prey. This alteration in the tree line could increase aridity, or make the air dryer, shift the timing of water availability, and effectively melt the permafrost and glaciers.¶The study finds that the northern and eastern part of the animal's range would be most impacted by a changing climate, making China, which is home to the largest population of snow leopards, particularly vulnerable.¶While the statistics might look bleak, it is difficult to exactly quantify how climate change will impact the species, given that studies like those from the WWF are projections. ¶""It is bleak, but it's not hopeless. I think climate change is a new, emerging threat and it will definitely have an impact on snow leopards,"" Brad Rutherford, the executive director at the Snow Leopard Trust, the oldest organization working to protect the animal, told CBS News. ""It's hard to measure the precise impact that a rise in tree lines could have. It could change prey species availability for the cats, but the question is 'what happens above?' Does this open up new areas (in the mountains) for the prey species? It's difficult to know exactly what could happen in the long-term.""¶So, what can be done to protect the animals now? Rutherford said that conservation is difficult, given the wide expanse of land that the animals traverse. In 2013, President Almazbek Atambayev of the Kyrgyz Republic and officials representing the 11 other countries that contain snow leopard populations endorsed an ambitious conservation effort for the species. At the Global Snow Leopard Forum in Bishkek, Kyrgyz Republic, the countries pledged that 20 healthy landscapes would be officially secured for the snow leopard range by 2020. ¶Rutherford said that in addition to these efforts, technology like research cameras capturing real-time footage of the elusive animals have helped put a compelling face to the conservation efforts. ¶""Originally, you had cameras with just 48 exposures, which wasn't enough to capture the animals. You'd have a goat walk in front of the camera and never catch a glimpse of a snow leopard,"" he said. ""Now, you have cameras that can hold about 15,000 to 20,000 photos that can capture the cats. When I started (at the trust) in 2000, there were only 20 or 30 wild snow leopard photos available. Now, we have hundreds of photos thanks to research cameras, and we can bring those to the general population. They are incredible images of a very elusive cat.""¶Given the threat that human development and warming temperatures are having on the animals' habitat, Rutherford added that preserving the species is a net positive for both human and cat. ¶""I think sometimes with snow leopards and other species, people place it into a 'do we save people or wildlife?' question. They say 'why would you help cats when people are in trouble, when people are struggling around the globe?' "" Rutherford said. ""The big takeaway I have, after 15 years in this field, is that it's a false choice. Helping snow leopards means you are helping humans. People share that landscape with those cats. Helping snow leopards helps people.""",0

    ","¶Every year, leaf peepers totaling in the millions flock to New England to see the bright red and orange hues of the fall foliage. The timing of these tourist visits might have to change over the course of the next century, according to a new study out of the University of Connecticut that states that climate change could significantly change the timing of the region's autumn season.¶The researchers hypothesize that while northern New England would see leaves changes later in the year, the coastal southern part of the region would experience an earlier autumn. ¶The findings were published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.¶More in Climate Change¶""Many other studies have shown that autumn could come later each year based on rising temperatures,"" lead author and Ph.D. student Yingying Xie said in a press release. ""But this is the first study to show the interactions of a range of different climate variables on regional ecosystems.""¶While the season-to-season timing of life events in animals and plants is usually studied in the spring given how easy it is to measure the emergence of flower and leaf buds, the fall is more complex given that there is no protocol for measuring leaf color changes, Xie said.¶Generally, studies of plant phenology, or key seasonal changes in a plant's life cycle, examine temperature and day length, but the study aimed to look at extreme weather events that the researchers said are key indicators of global climate change. ¶The researchers analyzed satellite data from an area that extended from northeastern Vermont and northwestern New Hampshire, down to Central Massachusetts and eastern Connecticut. The satellite data was recorded from 2001 to 2012. Xie and her team studied leaf color change and drop, or an indication of when a plant will enter its dormant period. ¶After looking at data that suggested extreme wet conditions, cold, frost, and high heat stress could lead to earlier plant dormancy, the researchers used a mathematical model to predict dormancy onsets from the years 2041 to 2050 and then from 2090 to 2099. ¶The impact of a shifting New England autumn could have an effect on the global carbon cycle, Xie asserted. Forests greatly reduce greenhouse effect, given that they absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. If the fall started earlier in some locations, the growing season would be shorter and the region's trees would have less time to take in that extra atmospheric carbon dioxide. ¶""If more carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere, it could create a negative feedback loop that accelerates climate change,"" she added.",0

    ","¶When it comes to the survival of a species, humans can be more dangerous than a global ice age.¶A new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal poses the provocative argument that mankind did more damage to wildlife in the Caribbean than radical shifts in the area's climate thousands of years ago.¶The research team, lead by the University of Florida, examined 95 fossil species from a flooded cave on the Great Abaco Island, the third largest in the Bahamian Archipelago. They identified 17 species of birds that were casualties of the dynamic climate changes of the Ice Age 10,000 years ago and 22 other species of mammals, reptiles, and birds that survived. These animals adapted to their changing environment, thriving for another 9,000 years. But they disappeared once humans came to the island about 1,000 years ago.¶More in Climate Change¶""The main takeaway from this study would be for people to start making the distinction between natural extinction and human cause extinction,"" study lead author Dave Steadman, ornithology curator at the Florida Museum of Natural History, told CBS News.¶Steadman said that it might be surprising to hear that a larger percentage of species are more vulnerable to human-caused extinction than to extinction brought about by natural climate change, like an ice age.¶ ""It's amazing that a great majority of species persisted (after the Ice Age), and now, in just a 1,000 years' worth of human presence we've lost a bigger percentage of the remaining fauna,"" he added. ""Climate-driven extinction was pretty selective towards species that preferred dry open country. In the last 1,000 years, species of all different life history characteristics -- everything from lizards to bats to little birds to big birds and tortoises and crocodiles -- were resilient to natural climate change but once people got to Abaco there is a real dramatic impact on their terrestrial habitats."" ¶Steadman said that a balance existed on the island such as naturally occurring, seasonal wildfires. Once humans settled Abaco, suddenly fires were started during the dry season, burning huge land areas, which in turn affected local vegetation, and killed a large number of trees. Similarly, hunting large animals like tortoises caused a disturbance in the natural island ecosystem. ¶Sawmill Sink is the cave the researchers studied, a flooded sinkhole in the pine woodlands right in the center of the island. Brian Kakuk, one of the study co-authors and a former U.S. Navy diver, led the scuba team that gathered the fossil hoard, reportedly one of the most diverse collections of vertebrates from the last ice age -- in the late Pleistocene -- found on any island in the Caribbean.¶The team looked at changes in species composition over time related to climate change. They found 13 species of fish, 11 reptiles, 63 birds, and eight mammals. More than 5,000 fossils were retrieved from depths of about 29 to 38 yards below sea level. ¶Given that the bones were found submerged under water, the animals at the bottom of the cave were most likely there before sea levels rose. The team compared these fossils to those that were dated to the following Holocene era. From there, they compared these findings to the island's current species to see which ones survived human settlement. ¶Steadman asserted that it's important his team's research is not dismissing the impact of climate change -- he said he is ""no climate change denier."" The disappearance of species in a given place over time is the result of multiple factors, including shifts in climate, but is greatly exacerbated by human activity. ¶""If you look at Abaco, where we did this study, there's fires in the dry season started by people, there are invasive plants showing up like a Brazilian pepper that would never be there,"" Steadman said. ""These kinds of changes could have a stronger negative effect on the flora and fauna of a place than climate change itself, including the rise in sea level that comes with climate change."" ¶Janet Franklin, one of Steadman's co-authors and the Regents' Professor at the School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning at Arizona State University, said that one of the most surprising findings was observing just how many species endured radical environmental shifts from climate change. ¶""It was surprising how many species (especially birds) that were found on the island in the last ice age stuck around even when the climate warmed up and the islands shrank at the end of the ice age,"" Franklin wrote in an email to CBS News. ""It was dismaying to also find that, of those many species that are so adaptable they can live in the glacial or interglacial Bahamas, a whole bunch of them could not stand the pressures that accompanied people who arrived 1,000 years ago -- namely the big changes in habitat that happen when people burn to clear land for farming.""¶What's next for the team's research? A $375,000 National Science Foundation grant will enable further exploration of the area's caves starting in December. One positive confluence of events resulted in the Bahamian government designating the team's study area a national park two months ago. This means that 34,000 acres of land on Abaco is now protected not just for research, but for ""future generations to enjoy,"" Steadman added. ¶Franklin views the findings as a cautionary tale. She wrote that there are two main lessons to be learned form this kind of study.¶""First humans have had a big effect on biodiversity for a long time -- even prehistorically. So, we should not underestimate the impact of even small land developments and so forth,"" she said. ""Setting aside conservation land in these new national parks is a really important step."" ¶Secondly, she said it is important to take the findings from this kind of study and examine the living species currently around us with a new appreciation. ¶""The species we see around us today are only a set of those that occurred naturally even just a few thousand years ago when environmental conditions were pretty much the same as now,"" Franklin added. ""That means the wildlife species still with us are the ones most resilient to human activities. It does not mean they are immune to all human disturbances, but maybe with a bit of careful conservation management we can successfully preserve the wild nature we have for our grandchildren.""",0

    ","¶Sea turtles might be facing an unusual problem: too many girls.¶Unlike a human baby, whose X and Y chromosomes determine whether it will be born a boy or a girl, a sea turtle's sex is defined during egg incubation periods. Warmer temperatures lead to a higher proportion of females while cooler conditions result in more males.¶A new Florida Atlantic University study published by Endangered Species Research finds that conditions such as heavier rains and temperature shifts are impacting loggerhead sea turtle sex ratios, potentially influencing future reproduction rates for the species.¶More in Climate Change¶Over the past four years, study authors Alexandra Lolavar and Jeanette Wyneken examined the nesting beaches for loggerhead turtles in Boca Raton, in south Florida.¶""There are several takeaways from this research. The first one is that rising sea levels and changing climates affect more than human cities. In the case of sea turtles, they impact these animals' main resource in that they must nest on beaches, and beaches are vulnerable (to the effects of climate change),"" Wyneken, a professor of biological sciences at the university, told CBS News.¶Wyneken said that beaches have a temperature that is very specific to turtle incubation - they are cool, but not too cool, essentially. That delicate balance is changing, and she said that these shifts in weather and temperature are ""shifting the outcomes of developments in sea turtles.""¶""If an animal has this system when the egg is laid in which it is not destined to be male or female, but will instead be directed one way or another by the incubation environment, then that environment is really important,"" Wyneken said. ""If that environment becomes altered too much, then you could be left with too many of one sex and not enough of the other.""¶Wyneken stressed that what is troubling for the longevity of the species is that the majority of the hatchlings that were sampled were female.¶While researchers have long known that a turtle's sex determination is dependent on temperature, Wyneken said that this research gave a clearer sense of just how delicate the balance is between temperature and an even division of the sexes.¶Even without climate change factors, survival rates for individual sea turtles are pretty bleak on their own. Only about one in 2,500 to 7,000 infant sea turtles reach adulthood. Those who do make it can live 50 years or more.¶For this study, the researchers sampled nests during the 2010  through 2013 nesting seasons. The loggerhead nesting season goes from April through October, and Wyneken and Lolavar broke the season up into three categories -- April to mid-June, mid-June through July, and then August through September.¶Female loggerheads between about age 17 to 33 nest at intervals of about two to four years. While the average loggerhead female has about three to six nests in a season and produces roughly 105 eggs per nest, a mother turtle would need to lay eggs over the course of 10 seasons, or nearly 30 years, in order to simply replace herself and potentially one mate.¶""These animals have been around for 40 to 60 million years and we know that there have been ice ages and hotter periods and the Earth has gone through its ice house and hot house periods - this has definitely all happened before, but definitely not at the rate that we see now,"" she said. ""There has been resilience in these animals and changes in their biology, so we started to look at the question of, 'Well, OK, temperature is a nice director for sex determination, so what else could modify the sex of the embryos?'""¶Wyneken said she and Lolavar examined different weather constraints impacting turtle incubation. They examined local rainfalls and the temperature of the sand, the temperatures of the nests, and then sex ratios for the hatchlings. Wyneken said that she and the team inserted temperature data loggers in the sand during the nesting season at three locations and at three different sand depths to understand how the above sand column would directly impact the eggs.¶The results showed some irregularities in typical incubation patterns.¶""We would see eggs incubated in hot wet seasons that would yield more males, which is not keeping with the 'hot chicks, cool dudes' model that my students jokingly refer to. We'd be left with - and this sounds accidentally inappropriate - 'hot wet guys,' "" Wyneken added. ""It basically made us re-think where there's resiliency in these animals, where the mechanisms are? Our paper sets up the question of, 'Well, if we have animals that are resilient to climate change, where is the resilience, where does it come from, what is it?'""¶What's next for the research? Wyneken said that a deeper study would involve examining the genetics of the embryos - what genes are ""turned on"" by temperature changes and which ones are ""turned off."" ¶""People are starting to look at embryos as little worlds with their own ecosystem,"" she said. ""That isn't my area of expertise, I myself am focused on the nest conditions, but some of my students and colleagues are trying to get at the genetic mechanisms behind all of this.""¶Wyneken said that one big-picture impact of this kind of research is that it essentially gives a cute, nonthreatening face to the importance of combating the negative effects of climate change. ¶""There is this need for a big effort to cut down on our greenhouse gas emissions not just in the U.S. but worldwide,"" she said. ""I mean you have these babies with big brown eyes and big feet and they bring on the cute factor. It certainly has forced me to think about how I make my own footprint on the world.""",0
Spring could come three weeks early to the U.S.,"

    ","¶Winter might be getting cut about three weeks short - by the end of the century.¶A new study published in Environmental Research Letters projects that the onset of spring plant growth will shift up by an average of three weeks by the year 2100 due to climate change trends.¶ ""Our projections show that winter will be shorter - which sounds great for those of us in Wisconsin,"" said study author Andrew Allstadt, of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, in a press release. ""But long-distance migratory birds, for example, time their migration based on day length in their winter range. They may arrive in their breeding ground to find that the plant resources that they require are already gone."" ¶More in Climate Change¶In addition to interfering with the needs of wildlife, the shift could also impact crop yields.¶The research team examined data on the effects temperature and day lengths had on past spring onsets to determine future dates when plants'  leaves and flowers would start to appear. The study analyzed when spring started from 1950 on, and created projections through the year 2100.¶The researchers found that over the past several decades there have been significant shifts in plant phenology, or key seasonal changes in a plant's life cycle, like flowering, that take place in relation to climate and weather patterns. In some parts of the country, the emergence of leaves moved up about a day and a half every decade between 1950 and 2005.¶The largest changes were found in the Western U.S. and the North American desert area, temperate Sierra region, and the northwestern forested mountain areas. Predictably, the researchers found smaller changes in southern parts of the country, given that spring already arrives earlier there than in the rest of the U.S.¶Looking forward from the current trend, assuming continued emissions into the atmosphere, the study determined that, averaged across the country, leaves would sprout and flowers would bloom about 22 days earlier in the year 2100. In the West and Northwest, leaves in these regions to sprout about 28 days earlier than normal.¶The study also found that ""false springs"" -- when freezing temperatures return temporarily right after new spring plants start to sprout up, effectively decimating crops -- will remain stable or decrease in most areas nationwide, but are likely to increase in the Great Plains.¶This trend will have a significant impact in this region, Allstadt asserted, because false springs damage plant production cycles and can result in the loss of entire crops. ¶""We are expanding our research to cover all kinds of extreme weather, including droughts and heat waves,"" said Allstadt, whose team has made most of the study's data available free to the public on Silvis Lab's website. ""We are particularly interested in how these affect bird populations in wildlife refuges.""",0
California wants renewable energy for half its power by 2030,"
","

      / AP
    ","¶LOS ANGELES  -- Gov. Jerry Brown dramatically increased California's climate-change goals, committing the state to use renewable energy for half its electricity and make existing buildings twice as energy-efficient in just 15 years.¶Brown tried for an even stronger measure that also would have enforced a 50 percent drop in petroleum use by 2030, but was defeated by oil interests. He called that a short-term setback, and insisted that the world needs to wean itself off fossil fuels as quickly as possible.¶""What has been the source of our prosperity now becomes the source of our ultimate destruction, if we don't get off it. And that is so difficult,"" Brown said at a signing ceremony Wednesday at the hilltop Griffith Observatory, overlooking the haze of downtown Los Angeles.¶More in Climate Change¶California already has some of the world's toughest air quality standards, and set a mandate in 2006 to derive a third of its electricity from renewable sources such as solar, wind and geothermal by 2020. State regulators say they already hit 25 percent last year, as huge solar farms sprouted in the desert and towering windmills went up along mountain passes.¶""It's monumental,"" said Alex Jackson, an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council. ""For an economy the size of California to commit to getting half of its power needs from renewable energy resources, I think, is a game-changer.""¶Few question whether the new goal of 50 percent is achievable by 2030, but critics worry that the complex regulations needed to speed the transition from fossil fuels will add unknown costs for consumers and businesses.¶Republican state Sen. Jim Nielsen of Gerber predicts more expensive ""energy, food and all things that require abundant affordable energy to produce and transport, particularly hurting those California families least able to afford it.""¶Just how California will meet the new goal isn't clear. Brown left the details to the state's Air Resources Board, Energy Commission and Public Utilities Commission. These boards are led mostly by gubernatorial appointees and have broad influence over economic life.¶California's utilities favored the measure. They mostly use natural gas, nuclear energy and some coal, but solar, wind, geothermal and biomass are growing sources of electricity, and regulators are expected to allow them to pass some costs of the transition on to consumers.¶The new law also encourages utilities to expand by building many more charging stations for electric vehicles, and provides for fines or penalties if utilities don't meet the goals.¶Supporters say Californians can keep saving money through rebates and subsidies as they purchase electric vehicles, replace inefficient light bulbs and appliances, and install solar panels or double-paned windows.¶Brown, a Democrat, began this year with a vow to push the most aggressive greenhouse-gas emissions benchmark in North America through the Legislature. He took his campaign around the world, even meeting with the pope in July.¶But he lost a key political battle among moderate Democrats in Sacramento amid intense lobbying by the oil industry, which financed a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign that raised fears of job losses if cuts in petroleum use were imposed.¶Catherine Reheis-Boyd, president of the Western States Petroleum Association, thanked lawmakers who voted against the proposed cap for keeping California competitive.¶Some lawmakers were willing to accept forced cuts in petroleum use if the Legislature could have more power over the Air Resources Board, which has been implementing the greenhouse gas emissions law.¶But Brown refused to give up what he sees as his executive authority.¶Both houses are controlled by Democrats, but on Wednesday, Brown squarely accused Republicans of failing to do enough to reverse global warming. He recalled that Ronald Reagan was California's governor when the state created the Air Resources Board in response to the Los Angeles smog, and that President Richard Nixon signed the Clean Air Act.¶""That was a time when Republicans really got it. We hope they are going to come back to the good old days of Reagan and Nixon, when people cared about clean air and clean water,"" he said.¶California's new goal builds on landmark legislation signed by Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2006, which laid the groundwork for the first U.S. program to cap and trade emissions, aiming to reduce pollutants to 1990 levels by 2020.¶That program, second only to the European Union's in size, enables polluters to buy and sell credits on a market, generating billions in revenues since the state held its first carbon auction in 2012.¶Businesses will pay an estimated $2.2 billion in the current budget year to help fund mass transportation including a planned high-speed rail system and pay for appliance rebate programs, building upgrades and forestry and wetland conservation.¶Opponents say all this raises costs for consumers, but supporters say initial fears of economic harm have not come true. California's economy is relatively healthy, with an unemployment rate of 6.1 percent in August. That's above the 5.1 percent national average, but the lowest it's been since January 2008.",0

""As the momentum has continued to accelerate toward this moment, we've seen unprecedented climate action from not only the world's biggest economies but the grassroots activists who are driving the change.""¶After going on to highlight the manmade causes of climate change, the video goes on to underscore clean energy solutions that could be used to curb the negative impacts of climate change.¶""Stanford researchers estimate that the transition to 100 percent clean energy will save Americans $260 per year in energy bills and $1,500 per year in health care costs,"" Leto says.

    ","¶At 3:40 a.m. Wednesday morning, the South Carolina Emergency Management Division's official Twitter account warned residents in Richland County to seek shelter and move to higher ground.¶Richland officials urge residents around Beaver Dam and Pebble Creek Rds IMMEDIATELY seek shelter & move to higher ground #SCFlood #alert¶The warning came after days of rain and record floods that have killed at least 19 people in the Carolinas.¶So far, 10 dams have been breached. Out of those, half were previously classified as ""high hazards,"" while four were classified as ""significant hazards,"" according to records sent to CBS News by the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control. The hazard rating signifies the potential consequence of a dam's failure, not the actual condition of a dam itself, according to the department's guidelines.¶The ""thousand year"" flooding and dam failures in South Carolina highlight a growing concern: Is America's infrastructure - such as bridges, dams, highways, and levees - designed to withstand what many scientists predict will be a greater frequency of increasingly powerful storms?¶More in Climate Change¶Joel Smith, an expert on climate change and principal with Abt Associates, a consulting firm that aims to address social and environmental issues, doesn't think so. ¶""Obviously, we aren't ready to handle more extreme weather,"" Smith told CBS News. ""First of all, our current infrastructure is way underinvested. It has deteriorated across the board. Dams, roadways, you name it, are not up to standards already. When you add the results of climate change, you kind of expect to see more things like the dam failures in South Carolina right now.""¶Smith was the coordinating lead author of the North American chapter of the report on climate change impacts from the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. In Smith eyes, state and national governments are not doing nearly enough to address the problems precipitated by climate change, which scientists have linked to increasingly severe weather.¶""Oddly enough, sometimes when things become frequent enough, it's easier to ignore them. These weather events should be a warning sign,"" he said. ""For instance, in these kinds of events, like in South Carolina, on average, the raining keeps raining harder. If it snows, it will snow harder. We can expect more of these kinds of events."" ¶It's important to note that the current flooding can't decisively be called a product of climate change. Smith cautioned that it is difficult to verify whether individual weather events are the results of greater climate shifts. That being said, he added that the cumulative impact of severe weather poses a challenge to modern infrastructure. ¶So, what safeguards can local, state, and national governments put in place to protect against these kinds of storms? ¶""If the infrastructure is deteriorating anyway, these events lead to a great opportunity to just go back and build it better. In response to events like (Hurricanes) Sandy and Katrina, better roads were built,"" Smith said. ""For example, you can build bigger dams or a larger culvert to channel the flow of water. In a coastal event, where you have potential for more intense waves, there is a greater push for 'green' infrastructure - use natural systems and vegetation to help combat flooding rather than build concrete structures. It improves aesthetics, the plants capture carbon.""¶A 2012 study out of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Environmental Sciences Division looked at climate change and its impact on the infrastructure of urban areas. The study used two major cities - New York City and Boston - as case studies for urban centers adapting to threats posed by environmental changes. For instance, the study cites Boston's Public Works Department evaluating the impacts of increased heat and freeze-thaw cycles on road durability, while Grow Boston Greener is aiming to plant 100,000 trees in the city by 2020 in order to adapt to changes in rainfall and heat patterns. ¶The same study also looked at proposed infrastructure improvements in other countries. For instance, it cites the United Kingdom's environment agency planning for ""adaptive pathways"" for the Thames Estuary area, hypothetically placing each pathway in the context of a different ""sea level rise scenario.""¶Another example of an adaptive safeguard against climate change comes from the Dutch, whose Rotterdam Maeslantkering, a storm surge barrier, is one of the planet's largest movable structures. The barrier was created with two 800-foot-long fans of space-frame metal tubing that support a curved steel face wall that rotates into different positions. These fans are hydraulically powered, raising up to allow surging water to flood into their storage compartments and then rotating out, releasing it back out into the channel. ¶As far as the dams in South Carolina are concerned, it is much too early to assess what could be done to better protect against similar flooding in the future, according to the state's Department of Health and Environmental Control. ¶""It's better to deal with these kinds of things sooner rather than later,"" Smith asserted. ""We need to ensure that infrastructure is less vulnerable, less likely to give way if the same kind of event comes again. Especially if it comes again in a greater magnitude.""",0
Climate change could displace half a million people from islands,"

    ","¶Residents of the Marshall Islands in the North Pacific know they have it bad. Flooding is on the rise and many face the real possibility that their island homes will disappear by the end of the century.¶Now, a new study projects things could even be worse than previously thought for low-lying island atolls around the world, which are home to half a million people and also host several key U.S. military installations.¶Studying the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey and their colleagues at the Deltares Institute in the Netherlands and the Hawaii Cooperative Studies Unit at University of Hawaii concluded that combined effects of storm-induced, wave-driven flooding and sea level rise on coral islands called atolls may be more severe and happen sooner than previously estimated.¶""Many atoll islands will be flooded annually, contaminating the limited freshwater resources with saltwater, and likely forcing inhabitants to abandon their islands in decades, not centuries, as previously thought,"" USGS geologist and lead author of the study Curt Storlazzi, told CBS News.¶More in Climate Change¶Part of the reason, he and his time wrote in a study in Scientific Reports, is that most studies only factored in rising seas when concluding atolls like Tuvalu, the Maldives, and parts of the Gilbert Islands would be inundated anywhere between the years 2080 and 2150 due to climate change.¶Rising sea levels are clearly a factor - oceans are projected to rise as much as 21 feet (6.4 meters) in the next century. NASA scientists have found that the ocean's mass is increasing due to warming temperatures, leading sea levels to rise about 1.9 millimeters (0.07 inches) per year.¶But the scientists said atolls - ring-shaped reefs that often include islands large enough for human habitation - are also vulnerable to waves that would become worse as the seas rise.¶Currently, the reefs often serve as a buffer for communities living on the atolls, breaking up and weakening the waves as the make landfall. But as the seas rise, the wave heights are projected to be greater and thus they will run further up the beachfront, Storlazzi said.¶Climate change could also weaken these reefs, since warming water causes coral bleaching and makes them more susceptible to disease. Ocean acidification, another result of greenhouse gases going into the oceans, is also expected to cause some reefs dissolve because they no longer can absorb the calcium carbonate that they need.¶""A very healthy coral reef will have a lot of friction and attenuate a lot of wave energy,"" Storlazzi said. ""If coral reefs decay or die due to natural or human induced stressors, they are thus less effective as a buffer to the waves.""¶Storlazzi said scientists couldn't put an exact date on when these atolls will be inundated, partly because there remains a range of projections for sea level rises and atolls have a mix of elevations.¶But he warned that the impact will likely drive residents off these atolls long before the land itself goes underwater.¶""If you drive storm waves across islands, there is going to be a lot of impacts to the infrastructure, critical habitats as well as threatened and endangers species,"" he said.¶""The biggest issue is water availability. These islands have a limited freshwater lens,"" he said, using a term which refers to the layer of freshwater over the seawater that occurs when it rains. ""If all of sudden you overwash the islands so that it's flooded with seawater, you contaminate that freshwater lens ... If you don't have freshwater, you don't have human habitation.""",0

    ","¶Almost a decade ago, Al Gore scared the world with an Academy Award-winning documentary that argued climate change was real and inaction could destroy the planet.¶But as global leaders gear up to negotiate an agreement to limit greenhouse gas emissions in December, the doomsday scenario in ""An Inconvenient Truth"" has given way to campaign led by U.N. climate chief Christiana Figueres that plays up the economic benefits of taking action - whether that be shifting to an economy fueled by clean energy or getting into the business of selling this technology to countries looking to shift away from fossil fuels.¶""The United States or China or Tuvalu, to choose a tiny little economy - none of them are doing this to save the planet. Maybe it surprises you that I say that,"" Figueres, the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, told CBS News in an exclusive interview.¶More in Climate Change¶""Let's be realistic here,"" she continued. ""All of these countries are putting their best foot forward because they understand it's good for their economies. And that is the most powerful driving force - the self interest of every country is what is behind all of these measures.""¶Asked about a good number of Americans, including some Republican presidential candidates, who oppose government action on climate change, Figueres returned to the economy and the huge potential out there for solar, wind and other renewable technology.¶Figueres' comments come as the International Energy  Agency on Friday concluded that renewable energy will represent the largest single source of electricity growth over the next five years, driven by falling costs and aggressive expansion in emerging economies. In a new report, the IEA projected that the growth will top 700 gigawatts  - more than twice Japan's current installed power capacity - and will account for almost two-thirds of net additions to global power capacity.¶""Can the United States afford to stay out of the largest market that will exist this century? It's a pretty simple decision that needs to be taken,"" she said.¶""It would make me very sad were China and India increasingly to take the lead in being the developers and importers of these new technologies that everyone is going to be needing,"" she continued. ""This is not a small market. The global market is going to be demanding clean energy and the question is, who is going to be producing it? Who is going to be exporting it? If the United States wants to leave that export capacity to China and India, that is a choice that needs to be made. But it doesn't seem to make too much sense.""¶World leaders first seriously tackled climate change in 1997 with the Kyoto Protocol. But the United States never signed onto it and it has largely been panned for failing to require any emissions cuts from developing countries, including the world's largest emitter, China, and other big polluters like India.¶Since then, world leaders have been trying to get all nations to agree on a deal that would prevent temperatures from rising beyond 2 degrees C (3.6 degrees F) above what they were in preindustrial times. But the negotiations have often collapsed - most famously in Copenhagen in 2009 - in acrimony between rich and poor nations fighting over who should take the lead in solving the problem. More recently, talks have bogged down over who would pay for poor nations to transform their economies and adapt to a warmer world.¶Figueres, who has been around the negotiations since the 1990s when she was part of the Costa Rican negotiating team, said she expects things will be different this time around.¶""Yes, we are going to have an agreement in Paris,"" she said, noting that as many as 80 governments have submitted their own climate action plans ahead of the U.N.'s mandatory proposal deadline Thursday.  ""Of the 195 countries that need to agree to this, I haven't heard of a single one saying they are out of here, they are no longer interested.""¶Figueres said the availability of cheaper and more reliable renewable energy sources is one of the key factors explaining why countries are more willing now to put aside their own political ambitions in favor of a global agreement.¶ ""Renewable energy technology, in particular solar, have come down in their costs remarkably. Compared to where we were five to six years ago, solar is 80 percent cheaper, 40 percent more efficient... Solar and wind have become much, much more solutions that are possible,"" she said, noting that they attracted $270 billion in investments last year. ""Technology has definitely come to our rescue.""¶It also has helped that hundreds of regulations aimed at combating climate change have been adopted at the national levels, Figueres said, and that there has been a significant uptick in green financing. She cited a report from the U.N. and other institutions, out last week, which found $2.6 trillion of capital is ""shifting from old technologies to new and clean technologies.""¶Then, there is the climate itself.¶Not a day goes by without some news anywhere from the United States to Bangladesh to Antarctica showcasing how the world is becoming a hotter and more hostile place due to rising emissions in the atmosphere - whether that be a historic drought in California, melting ice sheets in the Arctic or raging wildfires in Alaska.¶""There is not a single country that has not already suffered some impact of climate change and that is increasing in scale and intensity,"" Figueres said.¶It also hasn't hurt that Pope Francis has called climate change action a moral imperative or that China and the United States last week came out with a joint statement on climate change that included support for reaching a new deal. ¶Earlier, the two countries together came out with a series of actions to cut their emissions - with the United States agreeing to reduce emissions by 26 to 28 percent by 2025, compared to 2005 levels. China, meanwhile, agreed to peak its emissions by 2030, or earlier if possible, and increase the share of energy that China will derive from sources other than fossil fuels.¶""It makes a big difference because the United States is the largest historical emitter and China is the largest current emitter,"" Figueres said. ""Therefore, it is really very crucial that both of these powers accept their own responsibility and their leadership individually but, even more important, that they come together and collaborate with each other.""¶Despite all this positive momentum, Figueres knows a lot can go wrong. Even if a deal is reached in Paris this December, she insists there won't be much to celebrate, since a lot will depend on countries honoring their pledges in the coming years and decades.¶""Frankly, I wouldn't pop the champagne bottle because we have really pushed this. We have pushed this beyond what is safe,"" she said. ""An agreement in Paris, I think, would tell us that we are finally, finally stepping up to the responsibility that we all share. I wouldn't use it as a huge celebration. I would be actually be humble about it and say, 'OK wonderful, we have finally stood up to our responsibility,' and then we have to start the hard task of actually getting on the ground everything we intend.""¶Still, Figueres, the mother of two grown daughters, hopes that a deal would send a signal to her children and  young people all around the world that political leaders have their best interests at heart.¶""I'm doing it for the next generation. Most people who are working on climate change are doing it because of that as well,"" said Figueres, who laughed off a suggestion this could be a good resume builder should she have presidential aspirations in Costa Rica. ""It's young people right now who are actually in dire straits if we don't get this solved, if we don't get this back on track.""",0

    ","¶As climate change kills off some of their favorite flowers, several bumblebee species in the Rocky Mountains have responded to those losses by evolving shorter tongues.¶There has long been evidence that two long-tongued alpine bumblebee species - which feed upon flowers with deep corolla tubes - were seeing their numbers drop. But with evidence lacking to explain the decline, Nicole Miller-Struthman, of SUNY College at Old Westbury, New York, and her colleagues decided to take a look at the tongues of the two species, Bombus balteatus and B. sylvicola.¶Comparing specimens of the bumblebees from three mountain peaks in Colorado from 1966 through 1980 and from 2012 to 2014, the researchers found that ""a significant shortening"" had occurred in the bees' tongues.¶Armed with field data on the bees and their host plants as well as bee specimens, they went looking for the cause of this change. The ruled out decreasing body size, competition from invaders, or co-evolution with flowers in the area before concluding that climate change was to blame.¶More in Climate Change¶They found warmer summers reduced numbers of the deep flowers these species preferred, forcing them to become ""generalists"" that forage on what was left in the wild, including many shallower flowers.¶""Our analyses suggest that reduced flower density at the landscape scale is driving this shift in tongue length,"" the authors wrote in the study, published Thursday in the journal Science.¶The impact of climate change is the latest setback for bees of all sorts, whose populations have suffered in the past decade due to habitat loss as well as increased pesticide use.¶Starting in 2006, the rates of dead bees almost tripled due to a condition called colony collapse disorder or CCD. A nationwide survey in May found that beekeepers across the United States lost more than 40 percent of their honeybee colonies between April 2014 and April 2015.¶Scientists have long struggled to identify the cause or causes of the bee die-off, which threatens the nation's $2.75 million of managed colonies and could one day impact the nation's food supply since bees are crucial to pollination. The economic value of bee pollination services ranges from $10 billion to $15 billion.¶Some of the deaths have been blamed on the varroa mite, a lethal parasite that can easily spread between colonies. Others have singled out a class of pesticide called neonicotinoids, or ""neonics,"" that have been shown to disrupt a honeybee's ability to seek out flowers. One study found that bumblebees in fields treated with the pesticide didn't grow, while those in pesticide-free fields did grow.¶Another study linking climate change to declines of bumblebees in Europe and North America warned a warmer world could drive some species to extinction.¶But the latest study concluded that the changes weren't necessarily all bad for the bumblebees.¶While these shorter-tongue insects probably won't be able to depend on the same half-dozen flowers as in the past, the researchers suggest they may be to feed on other varieties.¶""Although populations of long-tongued bees are undergoing widespread decline, shifts in foraging strategies may allow alpine bumblebees to cope with environmental change,"" the authors wrote. ""We see broader bumblebee foraging niches, immigration by short-tongued bumblebees, and shorter tongue length within resident bee populations as floral resources have dwindled. In remote mountain habitats - largely isolated from habitat destruction, toxins, and pathogens - evolution is helping wild bees keep pace with climate change.""¶More broadly, the authors said these bees could help shed light on how climate change disrupts the mutually beneficial relationship between insects - as well as long-tongued critters like bats and hummingbirds - and their hosts.¶""Changes that disrupt such matching can alter plant species recruitment and the trajectory of co-evolution,"" they wrote.",0

    ","¶In his first remarks on U.S. soil, Pope Francis on Wednesday commended President Obama for tackling the air pollution and made the case that Christians have an obligation to be responsible stewards of Earth. ¶""As Christians... we wish to commit ourselves to the conscious and responsible care of our common home,"" Francis said from the White House South Lawn, where he was greeted by President Obama, government officials, Catholic dignitaries and at least 11,000 others. ¶""Climate change is a problem which can no longer be left to a future generation,"" said the pope, speaking in English. ""When it comes to the care of our common home, we are living at a critical moment of history. We still have time to make the changes needed to bring about a sustainable and integral development, for we know that things can change."" ¶More in Pope Francis in America¶He added that the world's citizens are also obligated to improve the world that will be left to ""the millions of people living under a system which has overlooked them."" ¶He continued, ""To use a telling phrase of the Reverend Martin Luther King, we can say that we have defaulted on a promissory note and now is the time to honor it.""¶Pope Francis also stressed the importance of religious liberty, which he called "" one of America's most precious possessions."" He also noted that he's traveling to Philadelphia this week for the Eighth World Meeting of Families, ""to celebrate and support the institutions of marriage and the family at this, a critical moment in the history of our civilization.""¶ 	The pope's remarks on the White House South Lawn marked his first official stop on his three-day tour of the United States. President Obama hailed Pope Francis for setting a ""profound moral example"" for the world.¶ 	""You call on all of us, Catholic and non-Catholic alike, to put the 'least of these' at the center of our concern,"" Mr. Obama said. ""Our backyard is not typically this crowded - but the size and spirit of today's gathering is just a small reflection of the deep devotion of some 70 million American Catholics.""¶Yet the excitement surrounding Francis' first-ever visit to the United States, the president continued, ""must be attributed not only to your role as pope, but to your unique qualities as a person.  In your humility, your embrace of simplicity, the gentleness of your words and the generosity of your spirit, we see a living example of Jesus' teachings, a leader whose moral authority comes not just through words but also through deeds.""¶After the South Lawn ceremony, Francis and Mr. Obama are meeting privately in the Oval Office. Mr. Obama isn't going into the meeting with a ""political agenda,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest insisted Tuesday.¶ 	""This is an opportunity for two men who have so many values in common, to talk about the efforts that they are taking in their respective and quite different roles to advance those shared values,"" Earnest said.¶ 	While there is unlikely to be a ""robust"" discussion of any political agenda, Earnest added that it will be more than just a ""social meeting.""¶ 	""I think that the way that both of these men have dedicated their lives to advancing values related to social justice and prioritizing those who are less fortunate, and that they pursue those values with a sense of conviction, I think gives them a lot of serious things to talk about,"" he said.¶Welcome to the White House, @Pontifex! Your messages of love, hope, and peace have inspired us all.¶ 	Pope Francis has indeed put a strong emphasis on helping the poor, arguing that too much focus on issues like marriage and abortion could alienate people from the Catholic Church. The pope has also cooperated with Mr. Obama in matters of foreign policy, helping thaw relations between the United States and Cuba.¶ 	Even so, the church still strongly condemns abortion and same-sex marriage -- just two issues where Mr. Obama's political agenda may diverge from the pope's.¶ 	Earnest said that Mr. Obama will listen to whatever Francis has to say with ""a very open mind"" and with ""a spirit of respect.""¶ 	While the pope falls in line with liberals on some issues and conservatives on others, some conservatives have taken issue specifically with Francis' strong concerns about climate change. At least one Republican congressman is boycotting Francis' address to a joint session of Congress on Thursday over his position on climate change.¶ 	Asked about the political leanings of his teachings, Francis on Tuesday said, ""I have never said anything that was not in the social doctrine of the church."" To call him left-leaning, Francis told reporters on his flight from Cuba to the United States, ""would be an error of interpretation.""¶ 	Following his White House meeting, the pope's schedule includes a ride in the Popemobile in a parade in downtown Washington, D.C. Then he meets and prays with North American Bishops at St. Matthew's Cathedral. After that, the pope heads to the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, where he will deliver a full mass in Spanish and canonize Father Junipero Serra.",0

    ","¶Climate change, more than many other issues, lays bare a stark divide between the two parties: Democrats warn of the grave threat posed by global warming, stressing the need to reduce carbon emissions to prevent a catastrophe. Republicans, including most of the GOP's 2016 presidential candidates, either don't acknowledge climate change is happening, or they question whether it's caused by human activity.¶As far as President Obama is concerned, the matter is settled: climate change is real, it's caused largely by humans, and anyone who says otherwise is living in a dangerous state of denial.¶""On this issue - of all issues - there is such a thing as being too late,"" Mr. Obama said Monday during a speech at an Arctic climate summit in Alaska. ""And that moment is almost upon us."" Failure to act, he added, would ""condemn our children to a planet beyond their capacity to repair.""¶More in Campaign 2016¶On Tuesday, the president will visit one of the state's shrinking glaciers and visit communities in Alaska's Arctic region that are threatened by rising sea levels.¶Republicans, though, have long seen the president's environmental policies as an overreach of federal power and a danger to the economy. Nearly any Republican who succeeds him in the White House in 2016 can be expected to try to roll back some of the climate regulations he has instituted through executive order. Only some of the GOP candidates for president believe that climate change is real, and even fewer think humans are responsible. Hardly any say the U.S. should take steps to address it.¶ Here's a look at how the GOP candidates view global warming:¶Jeb Bush: Count Bush among those who acknowledge climate change but won't weigh in on its cause. He said recently, ""The climate is changing,"" but, he added, ""I don't think the science is clear on what percentage is man-made and...what percentage is natural. It's convoluted. And for the people to say the science is decided on this is just really arrogant.""¶He believes the U.S. needs to adapt, and he wants countries that have increased carbon emissions to cut back. But, he said, ""We're not one of them,"" thanks to the increase in U.S. natural gas production from fracking.¶Ben Carson: Carson actually volunteered his position on climate change in Iowa earlier this year without being asked.¶""I'll tell you what I think about climate change. The temperature's either going up or down at any point in time, so it really is not a big deal,"" he told a group of Republicans in Des Moines, Iowa in May, according to the Des Moines Register. ""What is a big deal is that the environment is under our control. We do have a responsibility to pass it on to those behind us in at least as good a condition as we found it, hopefully an improved condition.""¶Chris Christie: ""I think global warming is real. I don't think that's deniable. And I do think human activity contributes to it,"" Christie said at Republican dinner in Keene, New Hampshire in May. ""The degree to which it contributes to it is what we need to have a discussion about.""¶But he doesn't believe that programs intended to limit carbon emissions like cap and trade are effective. He called for a ""global solution,"" rather than unilateral cuts by the U.S.¶Ted Cruz: At an event sponsored by billionaire industrialist brothers Charles and David Koch in August, Cruz denied the existence of climate change.¶""If you look to the satellite data in the last 18 years there has been zero recorded warming. Now the global warming alarmists, that's a problem for their theories. Their computer models show massive warming the satellite says it ain't happening. We've discovered that NOAA, the federal government agencies are cooking the books,"" he said.¶In an interview with the Texas Tribune in March, he said, ""the global warming alarmists are the equivalent of flat-Earthers,"" recalling that Galileo was once branded a ""denier"" for saying the Earth was round when contemporary scientific wisdom held that it was flat.¶Carly Fiorina: ""There's a lot of consensus among scientists that climate change is real,"" Fiorina said at an event in New Hampshire earlier this year. But she also disputes that the U.S. can do anything about it.¶""[E]very one of the scientists that tell us that climate change is real and being caused by man-made activity also tells us that a single nation acting alone can make no difference at all,"" she told Yahoo News in an interview earlier this summer.¶Jim Gilmore: Speaking to WMUR in June, Gilmore said that if he were president he ""would look at this group of scientists and say, 'Do they have an ax to grind?' and make sure that they're objective."" Pressed on whether he is convinced climate change is caused by man, he said, ""I would like it to be shown that it's man-made, and if it is, then at that point I think that we have to address how we deal with it.""¶Lindsey Graham: Graham has called out members of his party who dismiss climate change.¶""When it comes to climate change being real, people of my party are all over the board. There was several resolutions,"" Graham said after a recent Council on Foreign Relations event. ""I said that it's real, that man has contributed to it in a substantial way.""¶Mike Huckabee: On NBC's ""Meet the Press"" in June, Huckabee said, ""Whether it's man-made or not, I know that when I was in college I was being taught that if we didn't act very quickly, that we were going to entering a global freezing. And, you know, go back and look at the covers of Time and Newsweek from the early '70s. And we were told that if we didn't do something by 1980, we'd be popsicles. Now we're told that we're all burning up. Science is not as settled on that as it is on some things,"" he said.¶Bobby Jindal: ""I'm sure human activity is having an impact on the climate,"" Jindal told reporters at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast in September 2014. ""But I would leave it to the scientists to decide how much, what that means, what are the consequences."" He argues that the Obama administration policies have hurt the environment and the economy and has said Louisiana won't comply with the administration's Clean Power Plan, which aims to curb carbon emissions from power plants.¶John Kasich:The Ohio governor has in the past said he's concerned about climate change, telling a conference in 2012, ""I happen to believe there is a problem with climate change. I don't want to overreact to it, I can't measure it all, but I respect the creation that the Lord has given us and I want to make sure we protect it.""¶He's also taken steps to this end, telling NBC's Meet the Press in August that in Ohio, ""[W]e preciously take care of Lake Erie. We've reduced emissions by 30 percent over the last 10 years. We believe in alternative energy."" But, he continued, ""We don't want to destroy people's jobs based on some theory that's not proven."" His campaign later modified that statement, reiterating that he believes that climate change is real and that something needs to be done.¶Still, most of Ohio's electricity - about two thirds - is generated by coal-burning power plants. Kasich has been a proponent of clean coal, and he said at the 2012 conference, ""we are going to dig it, we are going to clean it, and we are going to burn it in Ohio, and we are not going to apologize for it.""¶George Pataki:For years, since the 1990s, George Pataki believed that climate change is scientifically proven. Unlike most of his GOP opponents, he has supported reductions in greenhouse gases since 1998. He even co-chaired an independent commission on climate change that released a report recommending a market-friendly cap-and-trade system that aimed to cut emissions by 60-80 percent from 1990 levels by 2050. He has not, however, expressed a position on climate change since he announced his presidential candidacy, and there appears not to be any mention of climate change on his campaign website.¶Rand Paul:Paul has a mixed voting record on climate change. He voted for an amendment in January that said that climate change is real and humans contribute to it, but then in March cast a vote against a bill that would cut carbon emissions.¶This is a sensitive issue for Paul's home state of Kentucky, which keeps the lights on with electricity almost exclusively powered by coal and which is also the third-largest coal producing state in the U.S.¶Paul doesn't talk much about the global warming. When he spoke with former top Obama adviser David Axelrod at the University of Chicago Institute of Politics a year and a half ago, he said, that the ""earth goes through periods of time when the climate changes, but he's 'not sure anybody exactly knows why,'"" according to The Hill.¶Rick Perry: In his 2010 book, ""Fed Up!"" Perry called global warming a ""contrived, phony mess"" and he has accused scientists of manipulating data to win research funding. At a June 2014 Christian Science Monitor breakfast, he suggested that there's no action that should be taken to curb global warming because ""I don't believe that we have the settled science, by any sense of the imagination.""¶The Environmental Protection Agency is also the department he famously forgot he would cut during a 2011 presidential debate. ¶Marco Rubio: ""I believe climate is changing because there's never been a moment where the climate is not changing,"" Rubio said in CBS' ""Face the Nation"" in April. In an interview with ABC's ""This Week"" in May 2014, he said, ""Our climate is always changing. And what they have chosen to do is take a handful of decades of research and say that this is now evidence of a longer-term trend that's directly and almost solely attributable to manmade activity. I do not agree with that.""¶Rick Santorum: What rankles Santorum about the debate over climate change is the idea that the science is settled. In June, on ""Fox News Sunday,"" he said,¶""Any time you hear a scientist say the science is settled, that's political science, not real science, because no scientists in their right mind would say ever the science is settled,"" he said.¶As far as he's concerned, the idea that man is responsible for the warming and cooling of the earth is ""just patently absurd,"" he told Rush Limbaugh in 2011, and ""just an excuse for more government control of your life.""¶Donald Trump: Although Trump has yet to take a formal position, it's probably fair to say he's not a believer in global warming. His commentary on the topic over Twitter goes back a few years, and that largely denies climate change, especially when the weather is cold.¶This very expensive GLOBAL WARMING bullshit has got to stop. Our planet is freezing, record low temps,and our GW scientists are stuck in ice¶He goes further than most climate change deniers, saying, in fact, that he thinks it's a hoax.¶Ice storm rolls from Texas to Tennessee - I'm in Los Angeles and it's freezing. Global warming is a total, and very expensive, hoax!¶ ¶ And Trump thinks he knows exactly who's behind that hoax.¶The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.¶Scott Walker: Walker has dodged questions about whether climate change is caused by man, but his campaign spokeswoman AshLee Strong said, he ""believes facts have shown that there has not been any measurable warming in the last 15 or 20 years."" He has also given a speech at the Heartland Institute, a group that challenges climate change.¶Walker has signaled that he plans to block Wisconsin from implementing to administration's Clean Power Plan, which aims to curb carbon emissions from power plants.",0
Obama finds perfect climate change victim in Alaska,"

    ","¶President Obama couldn't have picked a better place to make his case for acting on climate change.¶The state of Alaska, where the president started a three-day trip Monday, has had one of its worst wildfire seasons in memory, and its glaciers - like so many around the world - are melting. It also has experienced record warming over the past several years, which has caused the permafrost that lies beneath many roads and buildings across the state to begin thawing.¶Much of this has been blamed on global warming, which has caused land and sea temperatures to rise as the burning of fossil fuels increases the amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.¶More in Climate Change¶""While climate change is important to all, it is taking Alaska from a frozen to a thawed condition, causing structural changes and significant damage to our communities,"" Larry Hinzman, the interim vice chancellor for research at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, told CBS News. ""We must deal with these consequences, and we need the assistance of our countrymen to take on these challenges.""¶Wildfires¶The wildfires have drawn the most attention of late, with blazes in Alaska and Canada spreading smoke for hundreds of miles. Much like the fires in California and Washington state, the ones in Alaska have been blamed on poor winter precipitation and dry conditions throughout the spring. ¶Many of the fires have occurred in sparsely populated rural areas. By the end of July, 4.8 million of the 5.5 million acres burned this season were in Alaska.¶The fires are burning forests that have already been weakened over the past decade by bark beetle outbreaks that have killed many trees. The insects are taking advantage of warming conditions that have allowed them to survive year-round.¶""There have been a lot of changes since I started working there especially in terms of fire disturbance,"" said Scott Goetz, the deputy director at Woods Hole Research Center in Falmouth, Massachusetts, who has worked 20 years in the region and is leading NASA's multi-year campaign to investigate ecological impacts of changing climate in Alaska and northwestern Canada.¶""Most of the big fire years have happened in the past decade,"" he said. ""This year was another big fire year ... The big thing with fires are the severity. It is not only the trees that burn but the soil, the organic soil or peat lands.""¶As a result of the fires, Goetz said there have been wholesale changes in the ecosystem.¶""It increases permafrost degradation. It changes the vegetation that comes back and persists for decades,"" he said. ""A lot of the forests in western Canada are evergreen conifer. Those are killed off, the soil is burned off, and the forests that come back after a severe fire [are] more of a deciduous forest. That can persist for decades, so that changes everything - the carbon cycle, the nutrient cycling, and the energy feedback to the atmosphere. It sets the system on a whole new course.""¶Melting glaciers¶Glaciers, too, have suffered due to warming conditions and are proving to be a key contributor to sea level rise.¶A June study in the Geophysical Research Letters, a journal of the American Geophysical Union, found Alaska's glaciers have sent 75 gigatons (billions of tons) of water into the ocean every year for the past 19 years and helped increase sea levels by two-tenths of a millimeter per year.¶Taken over seven years, this volume of melting would cover the entire state of Alaska in a foot of water.¶Just last week, NASA concluded that overall sea level rise could be worse than previously thought since the climate models don't fully account for the melting of glaciers and ice sheets around the world. Two-thirds of sea level rise that is occurring is due to these melting glaciers.¶""The Alaskan glaciers have been degrading for the last couple of decades. We have seen a huge amount of loss,"" Hinzman said. ¶""The sea level rise we have observed in the last 20 years, most of that has come water sourced from Alaskan glaciers,"" he said. ""Our glaciers are getting hammered.  The glaciers are important for many of our communities. They are a water source and supply of water for our fisheries.""¶Rising seas are already a reality in Alaska, where Hinzman pointed out that a federal government survey concluded that 31 native communities will have to be moved and that 12 of those are already making plans to relocate.¶Thawing permafrost¶Moving villages may be one of the largest logistical challenges the state faces, but maybe not the most immediate. Across the state, the thawing of permafrost is threatening infrastructure and setting off slow-moving landsides, Hinzman said.¶""That is a big deal. That really is a big deal. These are huge amounts, mass flows of earthen debris that are coming down the hillsides,"" Hinzman said. ""They are encroaching on road and bridges. There is no way to stop them. If we get one of those landslides that hit a bridge, it would be a catastrophe.""¶And it's not only infrastructure. Thawing permafrost has implications for the climate.¶""The big concern with permafrost is that it can release a tremendous amount of carbon into the atmosphere,"" Goetz said, noting there is twice the amount of carbon in permafrost in Alaska and other Arctic regions than in the atmosphere.¶ ""There has been tens of thousands of years of carbon stored in permafrost and then we have, for example, a big fire or you have warmer temperatures or both,"" he said. ""The permafrost melts, degrades and then microbial action happens and that is what releases CO2 and methane into the atmosphere.""¶Max Holmes, a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Research Center who has been advising State Department officials on the problem, went further, saying this ""potentially unstoppable and self-reinforcing cycle could constitute a calamitous tipping point.""¶""The release of greenhouse gases resulting from thawing Arctic permafrost could have catastrophic global consequences,"" Holmes said. ¶""The United States must lead a large-scale effort to find the tipping point - at what level of warming will the cycle of warming and permafrost thawing become impossible to stop,"" Holmes said.  ""The real and imminent threat posed by permafrost thawing must be communicated clearly and broadly to the general public and the policy community.""¶Economic opportunities¶Despite all these challenges, University of Alaska Fairbanks' Mike Sfraga said there could be economic opportunity from the melting ice -  including the opening of shipping lanes in the Bering Strait and the building of ports. Already, he said the state has seen an influx of investors from as far away as Singapore interested in potential new opportunities in mining and oil and gas drilling in areas once inaccessible due to ice cover.¶""If done well, you can mitigate impacts on the environment while providing economic development for communities that currently do not have viable economic engines to sustain themselves in the future,"" he said. ¶But those economic opportunities have put Obama in a tough spot.¶While he will he is using his trip to Alaska to highlight the impacts of climate change, he is less likely to focus on his recent decision to allow Shell to drill for oil in the Arctic Ocean. ¶The drilling approval has angered environmentalists, some of whom claim the move contradicts Obama's calls for action to combat climate change. But on the other side are Exxon and supporters of the oil and gas industry who are using Obama's trip to call for him to open more areas for drilling onshore and offshore - a call that takes on greater urgency as the state feels the economic fallout from low oil prices.¶Scientists, for the most part, have steered clear of drilling controversy. Rather, they are just happy to see Obama finally giving attention to the region and climate issues that have long has been ignored by most Americans.¶Sfraga said they are hoping Obama's visit prompts Americans in the rest of the nation to consider the ways they ""think about the Arctic and conduct business in the Arctic."" And they also hope it will lead to the gathering of more data that could lead to better policies to help the state navigate its changing reality.¶""Although there is discussion out there, nothing puts a spotlight on it better and makes it more important than having the president of the United States speak to those various issues,"" Sfraga said.",0

    ","¶ANCHORAGE, Alaska --Submerged countries, abandoned cities and floods of refugees await the world barring urgent action on climate change, President Barack Obama warned Monday, painting a doomsday scenario as he opened a historic visit to Alaska.¶In a bid to further his environmental legacy, Obama brought the power of the presidential pulpit to Anchorage and called on other nations to take swift action as negotiations for a global climate treaty near a close. In a speech to an Arctic climate summit, Obama sought to set the tone for a three-day tour of Alaska that will put the state's liquefying glaciers and sinking villages on graphic display.¶""On this issue - of all issues -there is such a thing as being too late,"" Obama said. ""And that moment is almost upon us.""¶During his tour of Alaska, Obama planned to hike a glacier, converse with fishermen and tape a reality TV show with survivalist Bear Grylls - all part of a highly orchestrated White House campaign to illustrate how climate change has damaged Alaska's stunning landscape. The goal at each stop is to create powerful visuals that show real-world effects of climate change and drive home Obama's message that the crisis is already occurring.¶More in Climate Change¶Evoking ominous consequences, Obama said that climate change left unchecked would soon trigger global conflict and ""condemn our children to a planet beyond their capacity to repair."" In the Arctic, which is warming faster than any other corner of the globe, Obama said melting permafrost and disintegrating sea ice risk floods, fires and unimaginable economic damage.¶""It's already changing the way Alaskans live,"" Obama said. ""The impacts here are very real.""¶Obama has two audiences in mind as he traverses Alaska this week: Alaskans, who are hungry for more energy development to boost the state's sagging oil revenues, and the broader public, whose focus Obama hopes to concentrate on the need for drastic action to combat global warming, including a climate treaty that he hopes will help solidify his environmental legacy.¶Whether Obama can successfully navigate those competing interests - energy and the environment - remained the prevailing question of his trip.¶The president has struggled to explain how his dire warnings and call to action to cut greenhouse gases square with other steps he's taken or allowed to expand energy production, including oil and gas. Environmental groups took particular offense at the administration's move to allow expanded drilling off Alaska's northwest coast - just a few weeks before Obama arrived in Alaska to preach on climate change.¶Even Alaska Natives, who have echoed Obama's warnings, have urged him to allow more oil and gas to be sucked out of Alaska's soil and waters. Alaska faces a roughly $3.5 billion deficit this year as a result of falling oil prices, forcing state budget cuts that have wreaked havoc on rural services.¶""History has shown us that the responsible energy development which is the lifeblood of our economy can exist in tandem with, and significantly enhance, our traditional way of life,"" leaders of the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation, which represents Inupiat Eskimo shareholders, wrote Monday in a letter to Obama.¶Walking a fine line, Obama sought to portray the U.S. as doing its part even as it develops energy resources it will need during the longer-term transition to cleaner, renewable fuels. He ticked through a list of steps he's taken to cut greenhouse gas emissions and said America is doing its part.¶""We're proving that there doesn't have to be a conflict between a sound environment and strong economic goals,"" he said.¶Obama's first stop after arriving in Anchorage was a listening session with Alaska Natives, who relayed concerns about crippling energy costs and uncertainty about hunting and fishing rights. Highlighting what he described as progress for Alaska Natives on his watch, Obama said he hoped to be setting a new pattern of cooperation that would extend beyond his presidency.¶His tour continues Tuesday with a boat tour Kenai Fjords National Park and a hike to Exit Glacier, a sprawling expanse of ice that is retreating amid warming temperatures. In southwest Alaska on Wednesday, Obama will meet with fishermen locked in conflict with miners over plans to build a massive gold and copper mine in Bristol Bay, home to the world's largest salmon fishery.¶Obama will close his trip by becoming the first sitting president to travel north of the Arctic Circle. In Kotzebue - population 3,153 - Obama planned to address the plight of Alaska Natives, who face dire economic conditions amid some of the worst effects of global warming.¶""They don't get a lot of presidents in Kotzebue,"" quipped Alaska Gov. Bill Walker, who joined Obama for the flight to Anchorage.¶The White House unveiled a new National Park Service map bearing the name Denali on the former Mount McKinley. Before departing Washington, Obama announced that North America's tallest mountain was being renamed using its traditional Athabascan name. The move drew applause from Alaska's leaders and harsh condemnations from Ohio politicians angry that the name of its native son, former President William McKinley, will be erased from the famed peak.¶Rep. Bob Gibbs, R-Ohio, deemed the name change ""insulting,"" vowing in a statement to reverse it if he can.¶""President Obama has decided to ignore an Act of Congress in unilaterally renaming Mount McKinley in order to promote his job-killing war on energy,"" Gibbs fumed.¶House Speaker John Boehner, another Ohio Republican, said he was ""deeply disappointed"" in the decision.¶Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, described the change as ""another example of the president going around Congress"" in a tweet. And Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a Republican presidential contender, tweeted that the president ""again overstep[ped] his bounds"" in renaming the mountain.",0
Risk of food shortages to rise with climate change,"

    ","¶The chances of food shortages and extreme price hikes could triple by 2040 due to increasing extreme and erratic weather brought about by climate change, according to task force of British and American experts.¶According to the new report from the Global Food Security program, the risk of a ""production shock"" is set to go from an event that has happened once a century to one that happens every 30 years mostly due to the impacts to farmers from floods and droughts.¶""It is likely that the effects of climate change will be felt most strongly through the increasing frequency of extreme weather events such as droughts, heat waves and floods and their impact on the production and distribution of food - something we almost take for granted,"" said Tim Benton, who serves as the UK Champion for Global Food Security, acting as ambassador and spokesperson for matters to do with food and food security.¶""This study presents a plausible scenario for how the food system might be impacted by extreme weather, alongside a series of recommendations that should help policy and business plan for the future,"" he said. ""Action is urgently needed to understand risks better, improve the resilience of the global food system to weather-related shocks and to mitigate their impact on people.""¶More in Climate Change¶The report is the latest to link climate change with disruptions in the food system, which is expected to see demand increase 60 percent by 2050 mostly due to increases in population as well as the numbers of people escaping poverty for the middle class.¶The United Nations has warned that a warmer world will push food prices higher, trigger ""hotspots of hunger"" among the world's poorest people, and put a crunch on supplies of Western delicacies like fine wine.¶Other scientific studies have suggested that increased greenhouse gas emission mostly from the burning of fossil fuels will reduce the availability of some vegetables, fruits and seafood varieties, cause others to lose their taste and make some food crops less nutritious.¶In Friday's report, the task force warned that the global food system was especially vulnerable because food crops like wheat come from just a handful of major producing countries and due the fact that the world is so interconnected - reducing the impacts of a local shock while increasing the vulnerability to large shocks in distant ""breadbasket"" regions.¶The report calls for a range of recommendations to improve the system's resilience, including creating international contingency plans, developing better modeling methods to accurately predict the effects of production shocks and identifying international trading ""pinch points"" in order to minimize them. It also calls for helping the poorest countries prepare for market shocks and farmers adapt to climate change with such things as drought-tolerant crops.¶""Agriculture faces a triple challenge. Productivity must be increased by reversing declines in yield growth and closing the gap between actual and attainable yields in the developing world, whilst also reducing its environmental impact,"" the report said. ""However, given the increasing risk of extreme weather, this cannot come at the expense of production resilience. Increases in productivity, sustainability and resilience to climate change are required.""",0

    ","¶Calling climate change ""one of the key challenges of our lifetimes and of future generations,"" President Obama on Monday unveiled his unprecedented -- and already controversial -- plan to cut carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants.¶The Clean Power Plan is ""the single most important step America has ever taken in the fight against global climate change,"" Mr. Obama said from the White House, noting that there have never been federal limits on the levels of carbon pollution that power plants can emit. ¶""For the sake of our planet that has to change,"" he said. ¶The administration has already imposed carbon limits on future power plants, but this is the first time such limits would be applied to existing power plants -- the single largest source of carbon pollution in the U.S. Specifically, the Clean Power Plan would require the existing plants to reduce emissions by 32 percent from 2005 levels by 2030 -- going even further than the administration initially proposed. The Environmental Defense Fund has also called the plan ""the most significant step in U.S. history toward reducing the pollution that causes climate change.""¶More in Climate Change¶The reduction in emissions, Mr. Obama noted, equates to taking 166 million cars off the road and will result in 90,000 fewer asthma attacks among children each year. ¶Adding urgency to the matter, Mr. Obama said, ""There is such a thing as being too late when it comes to climate change.""¶When she unveiled the plan last year, EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy insisted, ""We have never -- nor will we ever -- have to choose between a healthy economy and a healthy environment."" Of course, there are many who argue the Clean Power Plan will hurt the economy. Opponents to the plan have already tried challenging it in court.¶Mr. Obama on Monday dismissed the criticisms of the plan as cynical and short-sighted. ¶""We've heard these same stale arguments before,"" the president said, pointing to resistance to environmental reforms enacted during the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations. ""Every time America's made progress, it's been despite these claims.""¶Pointing to the new fuel efficiency standards implemented in his own administration, Mr. Obama said that the auto industry is doing well while ""giving consumers more choice than ever before.""¶""We can figure this stuff out as long as we're not lazy about it,"" he said, ""as long as we don't take the path of least resistance.""",0
Are massive wildfires the new normal?,"

    ","¶Tom Harbour of the U.S. Forest Service readily admits he doesn't know all that much about climate change.¶But the folksy and plain-spoken Harbour knows plenty about fighting wildfires. And since he first joined the service in 1970 , Harbour, the agency's national director for fire and aviation management, has witnessed ""longer seasons"" and ""bigger fires.""¶""When I started 45 years ago, the sense that we would have half-million acre fires in timber just was completely out of the question,"" Harbour told CBS News. He says fire season is now 78 days longer than when he started. ""So, you know, I don't know all the climate change stuff. I know what I see. I know what I've lived ... I don't know exactly why it's happening but I know it's happening.""¶More in Climate Change¶Harbour's observations are backed up by a study this month in Nature Communications that found fire seasons across the globe are about 20 percent longer than they were 35 years ago, and that the burnable areas affected by fire have doubled during that time.¶The study comes as North America is enduring another active season, with thousands of wildfires in Canada and Alaska sending smoke as far as the Midwest. Many of the fires have been fueled by long-running droughts in California and other Western states, with thousands of acres in the Napa Valley catching fire over the weekend while winds also sent flames racing through part of Glacier National Park in Montana.¶The numbers of fires and acres burned this year is slightly above the 10-year average. A majority of that has been in Alaska, where 4.8 million of this season's 5.5 million acres have burned, according to the Forest Service. One factor there is that Alaska is so big and many areas are so remote.¶""The fire season this year is driven mainly by drought along the West Coast, Northwest and the biggest impact has been Alaska,"" Robyn Heffernan, a national fire weather science and dissemination meteorologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.¶""Alaska has had a really big fire season,"" she said. ""That was to due with poor winter precipitation they have had up there and dry conditions throughout the spring.""¶Those fires and the choking haze they produce have prompted a debate in the fire community over what is behind the blazes and whether climate change could be to blame. Most often fires are helped along by higher temperatures, lower humidity, stronger winds or a combination of all three.¶""We don't really know what role, per se, climate change is having but we can show that these changes are a result of things like increasing temperatures and more frequent rain-free days, so longer dry periods essentially,"" said the Forest Service's Matt Jolly, a co-author on the Nature Communications study. ""Those things have direct links back to documented climatic changes."" ¶Heffernan also was careful to downplay a direct link between increased fires and climate change, though she added that global warming is causing more extremes in the weather, ""swings of extreme heat, extreme cold, more extreme severe weather seasons ... that we can tie to climate change.""¶""But then making the link between that and fire gets a little bit fuzzy,"" she said, noting the Southwest had a mild fire season partly due to two tropical systems that dumped rain in places like Texas. ""It's not like you can say a blanket statement that this year is a bad fire season. It's all dependent on where you are.""¶Still, recent decades have seem some of the biggest and most deadly fires worldwide, including 1997-98 blazes in Indonesia peat lands that blanked Southeast Asia in haze and released up to 40 percent of fossil fuel emissions at the time; the worst-ever fire season in Western Russia in 2010; and a marked increased in fires in Northern Rocky Mountains over the past several decades.¶At the same time, factors contributing to big fires have all increased: the number of rain-free days has risen by 1.31 days per decade, and average temperature on vegetated land increased by 0.185 degrees per decade, while the annual relative humidity dropped by 0.127 percent per decade, according to the Nature study.¶""Ecosystems are designed to withstand the normal climate situation, but we suspect that things aren't normal anymore,"" South Dakota State University's Mark Cochrane, another co-author on the paper, said.¶And looking further out, bigger and badder fires are likely to become the normal as temperatures rise due to the continued burning of fossil fuels like oil and coal.¶A study out earlier this month in the International Journal of Wildland Fire predicts that climate change will be responsible by mid-century for more mega-fires.  ¶Using a model to accurately simulate locations and timing of the largest wildfires across the U.S. in the past 30 years, they saw an increase in fire potential in nearly all regions, but especially in the northwest, northern California, Florida and the northern Great Lakes.¶""Our study paints a fairly grim picture,"" said co-author John Abatzoglou, associate professor of geography at University of Idaho. ""Climate change will up the odds of conditions that have historically accompanied these large fires. While it may be challenging to slow the pace of climate change, our work highlights hot spots where land management might be able to focus adaptation efforts.""¶The trend for more fires is especially problematic in the United States, as more and more Americans are building homes in wildfire country, resulting in more structures potentially burning down and lives lost. ¶U.S. spending on fire suppression has increased from $239 million in 1985 to $1.5 billion last year, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Currently, there are nearly 45 million homes considered at risk, with hundreds, if not several thousand, burning each year.¶Tom Harbour knows he can't control the climate so he is focused on what he can do: improve training of firefighters and work with local and state government to ensure homes are being built in a way that ""provides those firefighters with a much better opportunity to not only protect the home but to protect themselves, ultimately keeping folks alive.""¶""I'm really concerned about this witches' brew of what scientists are telling us about what is going to happen with the fire season and certainly with what we are doing as a nation - more homes at risk and more private land being developed,"" Harbour said. ¶""I'm responsible for 10,000 firefighters. That is where rubber hits the road for me,"" he said. ""I worry about the complexity that we're asking our young wildland firefighters - our smoker jumpers, hot shots and folks on engines  - to face into the future with longer, more intense fire seasons, more ground at risk.""",0

    ","¶Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton announced Sunday that her plans to combat climate change as president include installing more than half a billion solar panels across the U.S. by the end of her first term and generating enough clean renewable energy to power every home in America within 10 years of taking office.¶Clinton, the frontrunner for the 2016 Democratic nomination, announced the goals in a video released by her campaign Sunday evening. Her campaign said the two initiatives were part of a comprehensive energy and climate agenda she'll lay out over the next several months.¶""Future generations will look back and think 'what were we thinking, how could we possibly be so irresponsible?' "" Clinton says as the narrator of a video that features images of children, wildlife, and images associated with energy production. ""I'm just a grandmother with two eyes and brain and I know what's happening in the world is going to have a big effect on my daughter and especially on my granddaughter.""¶The video also takes direct aim at the Republican presidential candidates for statements skeptical of climate change. Clinton speaks, the video shows quotes from candidates including former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (""I'm a skeptic. I'm not a scientist""), Florida Sen. Marco Rubio (""I'm not a scientist"") and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (""There's been no warming whatsoever"") and other candidates.¶More in Campaign 2016¶""It's hard to believe there are people running for president who still refuse to accept the settled science of climate change who would rather remind us they're not scientists than listen to those who are,"" Clinton says. ""You don't have to be a scientist to take on this urgent challenge that threatens us all, you just have to be wiling to act.""¶Clinton argues that increasing the use of wind, solar, hydro, geothermal and other renewable energy will help prevent as many as 3,000 premature deaths and 700,000 asthma attacks each year.¶Expanding the installation of solar panels across the U.S. would increase the current capacity to 140 gigawatts by the end of 2020, a 700 percent increase her campaign said. It would be like having rooftop solar systems on 25 million houses across the country.¶A fact sheet released by the campaign offered a number of federal government initiatives Clinton would implement to help reach the goals, including partnerships with states, cities and rural communities that are leading on clean energy, competitive grants to states that exceed federal carbon pollution standards, awards for communities that make it easier and cheaper to install rooftop solar systems, strengthening grid reliability and resilience, and making it easier to get low-cost renewable energy to market.¶She is also promising to talk about plans to reduce oil consumption in the U.S. and around the world, improve the safety and security of the existing energy infrastructure, make fossil fuel production safer, and protect the health and retirement security of former coal workers and their families.¶At an event in Iowa Sunday, Clinton said those who don't acknowledge the existence of climate change are ""just not paying attention."" Iowa is the second-largest producer of wind-generated electricity in the nation, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.¶Clinton's plan follows one laid out by another Democratic candidate, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, which promises to end the country's reliance on fossil fuels entirely by 2050 and to double American energy efficiency within 15 years. O'Malley promises an entire nation powered by renewable energy within the 35 years, as opposed to Clinton's pledge to power every home with renewable energy in 10 years.¶Though Clinton has not revealed the full extent of her policies to address climate change, O'Malley said he would deny permits for drilling off the coasts of Alaska and Antarctic and promises not to build the Keystone XL pipeline. Clinton has not yet said what she would do about the pipeline.¶Clinton's biggest challenger for the Democratic nomination, Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, regularly talks about climate change in his stump speech, describing dire weather conditions created by the warming of the planet. He has not yet laid out a formal plan to combat climate change, although last month he introduced legislation which would provide $200 million in loans and grants for solar panels on public housing and low-income family homes.",0

            In Greenland, climate change is already hard at work - CBS News
    ",CBS News,"July 19, 2015, 6:29 PM","¶The annual ""State of the Climate"" report released Thursday said 2014 was the warmest year on record going back 135 years.¶Temperatures continued to rise, and glaciers kept shrinking. ¶The impact has been dramatic in Greenland, the huge ice-covered island between the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans.¶Almost 8 years ago to the day in 2007, it was 35 degrees below zero on top of Greenland's vast ice sheet. Strong winds and blowing snow were more the norm for researchers there.¶This summer, the sun is shining and the ice is thinning; it's 27 degrees above zero -- 62 degrees warmer. Researchers are trying to determine if the warming is a trend.¶The world's second largest ice body, Greenland is more than one quarter the size of the continental United States and its ice is nearly two miles high at its thickest. ¶Since 1989, researchers have been ferried to the Greenland Environmental Observatory.¶University of Montana glaciologist Joel Harper has been camping each summer on Greenland's ice sheet, studying how glaciers and ice move. ¶""Greenland stores an enormous amount of water in the form of ice,"" Harper said. ""In recent decades it's certainly been melting more than is replenished from snow fall and that's causing sea level to come up."" ¶Evidence of the increased ice melt can be seen from the air in the form of blue pools.¶Satellite images show that on the warmest day this month, half the ice sheet's surface was melting, double the norm for this time of year.¶As glaciers melt, they darken, which combined with sediment and global air pollution (black carbon) further speeds up the process.¶University of Colorado researcher Michael O'Neill, who has been measuring pollutants here since 2008, said: ""In Greenland, the farther north you go dirtier the air becomes. Most of the industry is in the northern hemisphere and that's where we see the highest concentrations of the manmade chemicals.""¶The darker the ice, the faster it melts into the ocean.¶""Greenland contributes about 40 percent of current sea level rise,"" Harper said.¶Over the past century, the world's oceans have risen 4 to 8 inches. By the end of this century, scientists predict sea level rise will be the greatest environmental threat to coastal cities from Miami to Mumbai.",0

            Reporter's Notebook: 72 Hours in Greenland - CBS News
    ",CBS News,"July 19, 2015, 5:24 PM","¶ CBS News producer T. Sean Herbert recently traveled to Greenland for an assignment on climate change. He filed this Reporter's Notebook on his experience.¶Sunday, June 28¶ 	The alarm goes off at 4:30am at my hotel a few miles from my destination -- the Stratton Air National Guard Base in Scotia, New York, home to the 109th Airlift Wing (109thAW).¶ 	Each year the New York Air National Guard invite a small group of journalists to tag along with the 109thAW as they show off their unique capabilities.¶ 	In addition to flying missions in support of ongoing military efforts worldwide and assisting during natural disasters, they fly the world's only ski-equipped LC-130's -- nicknamed ""Skibirds."" Because their planes can land on snow, they fly to unique areas of the world.¶ 	At the base, 20 miles northwest of Albany, New York, I join others assembled to fly to Kangerlussuaq, a village of less than 600 people on the west coast of Greenland -- the largest island on the planet.  The recruitment poster on the wall says it all: ""It's the polar opposite of typical business travel. Air Guard.""¶ 	Depending on the amount of cargo, these aircraft can either be comfortable for the passengers on board, or quite cramped.  There are no traditional airline seats, but rather cargo netting and canvas benches provided with seat belts.¶ 	We're traveling on the more common C-130 Hercules referred to here as a ""Wheelbird."" With me on the flight -- besides journalists -- are teachers, scientists and five American high school students looking forward to meeting their counterparts from Denmark and Greenland participating in a scientific and cultural exchange.¶ 	Called the Joint Science Education Program (JSEP), this partnership is supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and provides the group with three weeks of intense emersion on the island of ice. The weather at takeoff is rainy and temperatures are in the low 60s.¶ 	Scores of scientists from around the globe journey to Greenland this time of year. As the ice that covers much of the least densely populated country in the world thaws, they are measuring the effects of climate change and the impact humans are having on the world. The amount of cargo and passengers on this flight requires that half way to Greenland, we land at a Canadian Forces Base (CFB) in Goose Bay, Labrador, to refuel.¶ 	On the second leg of the flight, we are allowed to walk about the belly of the C-130 and take turns peeking out the small windows throughout the fuselage.¶As we approach the Arctic Circle, the landscape below changes color from plush green to stark white. After crossing the Labrador Sea, ice can be seen floating in Baffin Bay. Once over Greenland, the ice and snow softly blankets the surface.¶ 	We all buckle up as we begin our descent along a fjord into Kangerlussuaq, a former Cold War outpost with runways long enough for B-52 bombers when it was Sondrestrom Air Base. I check in at a modest hotel on the opposite side of the tarmac from the headquarters (HQ) of the flight operations for the 109thAW.¶ 	The weather is actually much nicer here than it was when we left upstate New York -- about 67 degrees and only a few clouds in the skies. After about six hours flying, and losing two hours to the time difference, I grab a bite to eat and try to get some sleep despite the fact that at 10:30pm the night sky is still bright -- this part of the world is bathed in sunlight, 24-7.¶ Monday, June 29¶ 	At 7:45am, I join the other journalists at the HQ building to film preps for the 455 mile journey northeast aboard an LC-130 Skibird to deliver supplies to the NSF's Greenland Environmental Observatory (GEO) located in the center of the ice sheet at 10,530 feet above sea level.¶ 	The weather forecast calls for mid-20s Fahrenheit, unseasonably warm, with lots of sun and very little wind. It's about a two hour flight from Kangerlussuaq to the GEO location.  I shoot footage of the loading process and then take a selfie in front of the nose art on the plane.  ""City of Albany"" is the nickname of this aircraft, which as a resident of New York, brings a smile to my face. We take off around 11:00 am.¶ 	The other journalists on this Skibird are first-timers.  I was here once before, back in 2007, and the weather was much colder, well below zero and almost no visibility at GEO. Once airborne, we have plenty of room to spread out and claim a window to film through to get footage as we head toward the summit of the ice sheet.  The crew in the belly of the plane is going over paperwork, so I ask for access to the cockpit and film the crew mid-flight.¶I'm wearing my own cold-weather gear while the others are putting on handout military gear required on all flights in the polar regions in case of an emergency landing. Theirs is much heavier and bulkier then my personal apparel.¶As the cargo is unloaded and the Skibird refueled, it's a protocol that the engines remain running for fear that they won't re-start stranding precious cargo or passengers.¶I only have about 35 minutes to shoot footage and line up and shoot interviews, before being asked to be back on the plane. It's a sprint at altitude, more physically challenging than most segments I produce for CBS News.¶ 	I board a ski mobile with a sled and head right to the largest building in the complex, referred to as the ""Big House."" I interview a few researchers then step outside and ask the woman driving the ski mobile to take my photo in front of the only signage at GEO.¶ 	On the flight back, the Skibird has 19 extra passengers -- researchers the NSF is rotating out to make room for the next batch needing time on the ice at GEO. It's a bit cramped. Once back in Kangerlussuaq, I spend the rest of the day touring the surrounding area, filming some beauty shots and setting up interviews for the next day.¶ Tuesday, June 30¶ 	At 7am, I meet with scientist Lauren Culler, who flew here with me on Sunday. An ecologist at Dartmouth College in Hanover, NH, she has spent the past few summers in Greenland studying insects in the lakes and ponds surrounding Kangerlussuaq. She drives me to a pond that was flourishing in 2012. Now it's bone dry.¶ ""Out of the 10 or so ponds that I have been keeping track of, about three of them have completely disappeared since 2012,"" said Culler. ""And I know that in this area in particular we tend to see a lot of drying ponds in the landscape. So it's not every pond that's drying, but certainly we are seeing this trend of less and less water staying on the landscape.""¶ 	Afterwards, I grab lunch at the Kangerlussuaq International Science Support (KISS) facility.  It's the hub for most of the visiting NSF scientists. Glaciologist Joel Harper is spending a few days here before spending the next four weeks camped out on Russell Glacier about 48 miles east of town.¶ 	Harper takes me 19 miles down a dirt road to the site where he is staging his supplies at the base of Russell Glacier. Harper, a professor at the University of Montana, is spending his ninth summer in Greenland studying the mechanics of how glaciers and ice move.¶ 	Once back, I spend time with the JSEP high school students from the U.S.  The American kids are all very impressive. Henry Hao, from San Diego, and Natalie Ezeggwu, from Tucson, have never seen ice and snow before. Aislinn Slaugenhaupt, from Summerville, Pennsylvania, is looking forward to her time on the ice.¶""I don't think a lot of high school students anywhere, let alone the United States, know a lot about polar science,"" said Slaugenhaupt. ""I'm definitely excited to get more engaged in polar science especially as something that young people can do to take action for our future.""¶ Wednesday, July 1¶ 	The phone in my hotel room rings at 5:15 am.  It's time to get packed and head back over to the HQ building for the last filming opportunities.  Precious cargo needs to get from the top of the ice sheet back to the states for analysis, including perishable ice cores.¶ 	I'm wearing a net over my head as I film a Wheelbird being loaded because the mosquitoes are out in force.  It's peak season for the biting insects.¶ 	After filming the takeoff, it is our turn to load up and leave Greenland.  We're flying a Skibird back to the U.S. with no plans for refueling in Canada. Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) in Scotia is 1:30pm.¶ 	Instead, there is an unexpected detour to Goose Bay that lasts most of the day as we wait the arrival of a replacement aircraft. The New York Air National Guard brought in pizza and water to feed the troops, which has now doubled in size.  At about 8:30pm, we depart CFB for Stratton Air National Guard Base on a cramped Wheelbird with 43 passengers -- mostly members of the 109thAW. I post a selfie to Facebook asking, ""Guess which one I am on this crammed @109thAW aircraft to Scotia, tonight?""¶ 	On the way back I take a series of photos on the Skibird from my cell phone of the views out the small window. We touched back down in Scotia after midnight, a whirlwind 72-hour tour in Greenland complete. I post the photos on Facebook, asking: which ""arctic circle"" do you ""like"" best? Here's the winner:",0

    ","¶If the latest report from America's top weather experts is an indication, it's becoming really hard to deny global warming.¶Temperatures last year across the world reached record highs, according to the ""State of the Climate in 2014"" report from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Center for Weather and Climate. Sea levels continued to rise and glaciers kept shrinking while record concentrations of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide were recorded in the atmosphere.¶Some of the results have been released previously but together paint a sobering picture of what humans are doing to the climate. The findings should also bring a sense of urgency - it if wasn't there already - to global talks later this year aimed at tackling global warming by requiring all countries to set emissions targets.¶More in Climate Change¶""The variety of indicators shows us how our climate is changing, not just in temperature but from the depths of the oceans to the outer atmosphere,"" said Thomas R. Karl, director, NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.¶""It's been a pretty persistent and continuous message over the past 10 years at least that we are seeing a planet that is warming,"" Karl told reporters, adding ""you'll be hearing much of the same, a number of the indicators will be showing record or near record levels"" when the report for 2015 is released.¶The report comes on the same day that the Rockefeller Foundation-Lancet Commission on Planetary Health released a report warning that humans were essentially destroying the planet. ¶In that report, an international team of 15 academics and policymakers warned, ""human activity and development have pushed to near breaking point the boundaries of the natural systems that support and sustain human civilizations"" and that ""rising population, unsustainable consumption and the over-use of natural resources"" will exacerbate health challenges in the future.¶""We are on the verge of triggering irreversible, global effects, ranging from ocean acidification to biodiversity loss,"" Sir Andy Haines of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine said. ""These environmental changes - which include, but extend far beyond climate change - threaten the gains in health that have been achieved over recent decades and increase the risks to health arising from major challenges as diverse as under-nutrition and food insecurity, freshwater shortages, emerging infectious diseases, and extreme weather events.""¶The most jarring data from the NOAA climate report was on temperatures, with four separate, global data sets confirming the world saw record high temperatures in 2014, with 20 countries from Europe to Mexico setting records. These were the highest temperatures seen in the past 135 years.¶The hothouse conditions come as atmospheric CO2 concentrations increased by 1.9 parts per million in 2014, reaching a global average of 397.2 ppm for the year. To put this context, this compares with a global average of 354.0 in 1990 when this report was first published a quarter of century ago.¶Much of the temperature increases have been blamed on warming seas, with this report finding that the globally average sea surface temperature was the highest on record. The warmth was particularly striking in the North Pacific Ocean, where temperatures are in part likely driven by a transition of the Pacific decadal oscillation - a recurring pattern of ocean-atmosphere climate variability centered in the region.¶Another indicator of the ocean's importance to climate was the fact that it remains a key storage site for the all that additional thermal energy. Oceans absorb over 90 percent of Earth's excess heat from greenhouse gasses, according to the report.¶The report also provided reams of evidence that global warming is wreaking havoc on the planet. Global average sea levels rose to a record high in 2014, reflecting trends in sea level growth that have been observed over the past two decades.¶The Arctic, among the most vulnerable places to climate change, saw snowmelt occur 20 to 30 days earlier than the 1998-2010 average. The Arctic minimum sea ice extent reached 1.94 million square miles on September 17, the sixth lowest since satellite observations began in 1979.¶Glaciers, too, continued to shrink for the 31st year.  From the highest peaks in South America to South Asia, the numbers all showed a decline in the mass of glaciers. This loss of glacier area, the report concluded, imperils the lives of 370 million people who depend on glacier runoff to feed rivers and provide water for drinking and agriculture.",0

    ","¶New research suggests that U.S. climate change, and the unpredictable temperature swings it can bring, may boost death rates in seniors.¶""Temperature variability emerges as a key feature in the potential impacts of climate change. The take-home message: Unusual temperature is bad for people's health,"" said study author Liuhua Shi, a graduate student in the department of environmental health at Harvard's School of Public Health in Boston.¶Scientists have long been debating the health effects of climate change, and the general assumption is that it will make people sicker through more extreme heat, more flooding and more polluted air.¶More in Climate Change¶Shi and colleagues launched their study in the New England area to better understand how weather affects death rates. ""Many studies have reported associations between short-term temperature changes and increased daily deaths,"" Shi said. ""However, there is little evidence to date on the long-term effect of temperature.""¶The researchers looked at Medicare statistics regarding 2.7 million people over the age of 65 in New England from 2000 to 2008. Of those, Shi said, 30 percent died during the study.¶The researchers found death rates rose when the average summer temperature rose significantly, and death rates dropped when the average winter temperature rose significantly.¶The researchers believe the increased risk in the summer is due to an increase in the variability of temperatures. According to Shi, ""climate change may affect mortality rates by making seasonal weather more unpredictable, creating temperature conditions significantly different to those to which people have become acclimatized.""¶On the other hand, warmer winter temperatures caused by climate change could actually reduce deaths, the researchers added.¶The study notes that research has suggested it's more difficult for people to develop exercise endurance when they're in variable temperatures compared to consistently hot conditions. This, the researchers wrote, could explain why variable temperatures spell trouble.¶The study has weaknesses. The researchers don't know what people died of, and it's impossible to predict the exact effects of climate change and global warming on the variability of temperatures.¶Also, the study only found a possible association between weather and death rates, and not a direct cause-and-effect relationship.¶Richard Keller, a professor of medical history and bioethics at University of Wisconsin-Madison, studies climate change's potential effects on health.¶""This is clearly an important study. It is valid and useful within certain limits,"" said Keller, who was not involved with the study.¶What's next?¶""We would expect that people will respond differently to climate change in different climate zones,"" Shi said. ""Hence, we plan to do a national study to examine the long-term effects of temperature on mortality in each climate zone.""¶Meanwhile, Keller said, ""The big mysteries concern our adaptability to a changing climate. What kinds of solutions will humans imagine to adapt to a changing climate, and to whom will these solutions be available?""¶The study appears in the July 13 issue of Nature Climate Change.",0

    ","¶Rising sea levels have been mostly measured in inches in the past decades, but scientists said they could increase more than 20 feet in the future as global warming continues to melt ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica.¶The dire projections are based on a look back at the climate record, with scientists finding that increases of 20 feet have happened at least twice over the past 3 million years when temperatures were very similar to what they are today. ¶If similar increases were seen across the globe, that could put tens of millions of people living in coastal communities from New York to Miami to Bangkok at risk of storm surges and increased flooding. Even NASA is fearing its launch pads could be threatened by climate change.¶More in Climate Change¶Many of these coastal communities are already seeing increased flooding - and that is just from global sea levels rising around 8 inches since 1880. Records also indicate the rate of sea level rise has intensified since the 1990s.¶""Studies have shown that both the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets contributed significantly to this sea level rise above modern levels,"" Anders Carlson, an Oregon State University glacial geologist and paleoclimatologist, and co-author on the study that was published Thursday in Science, said.¶""Modern atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are today equivalent to those about 3 million years ago, when sea level was at least 6 meters higher because the ice sheets were greatly reduced,"" he said. ""It takes time for the warming to whittle down the ice sheets but it doesn't take forever. There is evidence that we are likely seeing that transformation begin to take place now.""¶Peter Clark, an Oregon State paleoclimatologist and another co-author of the study, said that because current carbon dioxide levels are as high as they were 3 million years ago, ""we are already committed to a certain amount of sea level rise.""¶""The ominous aspect to this is that CO2 levels are continuing to rise, so we are entering uncharted territory,"" Clark said. ""What is not as certain is the time frame, which is less well-constrained. We could be talking many centuries to a few millennia to see the full impact of melting ice sheets.""¶The researchers, analyzing everything from fossilized coral to records of ice sheets to geophysical models on sea level response, concluded that sea levels rose 20 to 30 feet higher than present about 125,000 years ago, when global average temperature was 1.8 degrees higher than preindustrial levels, similar to today's average. Sea level peaked somewhere between 20 and 40 feet above present during an earlier warm period about 400,000 years ago, when global average temperatures are estimated to have been about 1.8 to 3.6 degrees warmer than the preindustrial average (though that estimate is uncertain). ¶During those times, atmospheric carbon dioxide levels peaked around 280 parts per million, but today's levels are over 400 ppm and rising. The team of researchers looked at the last time period when carbon dioxide was this high - about 3 million years ago - but weren't able to say for sure what the levels were due to problems with shoreline records.¶""If anything, we may be looking at worst scenarios because carbon dioxide levels are much higher so our inference is that ice sheets are out of equilibrium with the present climate so that they are now catching up to all this warming that has occurred in the atmosphere and the ocean,"" Andrea Dutton, a University of Florida geochemist and lead author on the study, said.¶The challenge looking ahead is to better understand how these ice sheets respond to these temperature increases, including the ""threshold temperature beyond which it undergoes irreversible retreat, with current estimates ranging from 1.8 degrees to 7.2 degrees above pre-industrial temperatures,"" according to the study.¶""As the planet warms, the poles warm even faster, raising important questions about how ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica will respond,"" Dutton said. ""While this amount of sea-level rise will not happen overnight, it is sobering to realize how sensitive the polar ice sheets are to temperatures that we are on path to reach within decades.""¶Dutton said understanding the response of the ice sheets ""will be very important to guide policy makers or inform decisions on mitigating sea level rise.""¶""One of the most burning questions for policy makers is how fast sea levels will rise,"" she told CBS News. ""We want to know will sea levels rise gradually as ice sheets retreat or will they rise very suddenly due to rapid ice sheet collapse? That is a fundamental question that we are trying to get at by looking at the past records.""",0

    ","¶Bumblebees are seeing their ranges in North America and Europe rapidly disappear due to climate change and some species could be driven into extinction by the warmer temperatures.¶A study examined historical and current records of bumblebee movements over the past 110 years and found they have lost about 185 miles of territory from the southern edge of their ranges in Europe and North America. Much of that loss for the 31 species in North America and 36 species in Europe studied was due to increased warming brought about by rising greenhouse gas emissions from the burning of fossil fuels.¶This was on top of other threats the bees already face like habitat destruction and exposure to a range of agriculture pesticides.¶More in Climate Change¶""This was a surprise,"" said Leif Richardson, a scientist at the University of Vermont who helped lead the new research. ""The bees are losing range on their southern margin and failing to pick up territory at the northern margin - so their habitat range is shrinking.""¶""The scale and pace of these losses are unprecedented,"" Jeremy Kerr, a biologist from the University of Ottawa, who led the new study, added.¶""Pollinators are vital for food security and our economy, and widespread losses of pollinators due to climate change will diminish both,"" he said. ""We need to figure out how we can improve the outlook for pollinators at continental scales, but the most important thing we can do is begin to take serious action to reduce the rate of climate change.""¶Bumblebees are just the latest species to pay a price for a warming world. Animals from polar bears to butterflies to birds are seeing their ranges shrink or shift towards the polar region or higher elevations in response to changes in climatic conditions.¶""This paper is important because it reinforces the understanding that species will not all be able to shift their ranges in order to adapt to a changing climate,"" Sacha Vignieri, an associate editor for the journal Science, said.¶The bumblebees, the study found, are shifting to areas of habitat at higher elevation in response to climate change; the southern range populations where temperatures are higher are retreating up mountainsides and away from the equator. Northern populations, meanwhile, are failing to take advantage of temperatures that have increased 3.6 degrees to colonize new areas.¶""Global warming has trapped bumblebee species in a kind of climate vise - the result is dramatic losses of bumblebee species from the hottest areas across two continents,"" Kerr said. ""For species that evolved under cool conditions, like bumblebees, global warming might be the kind of threat that causes many of them to disappear for good.""¶Among the questions is why the bees in northern ranges aren't moving.¶""We don't know for sure what is causing a stagnation at the northern end of things. Bees should be able to start new colonies in places they did not historically occupy,"" University of Calgary's Paul Galpern, a co-author on the study, said.¶The new study is also expected to reignite the debate over the role pesticides are playing in the deaths of bumblebees and other bee species, especially honey bees.¶Starting in 2006, the rates of dead bees almost tripled due to a condition called colony collapse disorder or CCD. A nationwide survey in May found that beekeepers across the United States lost more than 40 percent of their honeybee colonies between April 2014 to April 2015. ¶Scientists have long struggled to identify the cause of the bee die-off, which threatens the nation's $2.75 million of managed colonies and could one day impact the nation's food supply since bees are crucial to pollination. The economic value of bee pollination services ranges from $10 billion to $15 billion.¶Some of the deaths have been blamed on the varroa mite, a lethal parasite that can easily spread between colonies. Others have singled out a class of pesticide called neonicotinoids, or ""neonics,"" which have been shown to disrupt a honeybees ability to seek out flowers. One study found that bumblebees in fields treated with the pesticide didn't grow, while those in pesticide-free fields did grow.¶The researchers didn't discount the impact of the pesticides on bumblebees but suggested they didn't play a role in their shrinking ranges.¶""The question is: Have neonicotinoids or other pesticides caused a huge range loss we observed in this study? And the answer clearly now is no,"" University of Ottowa's Alana Pinard, another co-author on the study, said. ""And we checked this carefully. In fact, bumblebee range losses began before neonicotinoids were in wide use. This cannot be interpreted to mean that neonicotinoids do not and cannot harm bees, just that they do not affect our results. In this study we show that they are impacted by climate change and that these effects are already very large and widespread, and it is probable that these losses will increase in the future.""¶The researchers are calling for a number of steps to halt the range losses of these plump, yellow and black bees. Among them is encouraging gardeners to plant more native wildflower, convincing governments to conserve more of their natural habitats and considering moving bee populations into new areas where they might persist -  a controversial strategy known as assisted migration.¶""We need new strategies to help these species cope with the effects of human-caused climate change, perhaps assisting them to shift into northern areas,"" Kerr said.",0

We have come to see ourselves as her lords and masters, entitled to plunder it at will."" He quoted from his recent document on the environment, the encyclical Laudato Sii.  In that document, released in June, the Pope urged immediate action to combat climate change.¶""It is wrong to turn aside from what is happening all around us, as if certain situations did not exist or have nothing to do with our lives,"" he said. He delivered equally strong words to a gathering of political, civic and cultural leaders immediately following.¶More in Climate Change¶""The tapping of natural resources, which are so abundant in Ecuador, must not be concerned with short-term benefits,"" he said. ""The goods of the earth are meant for everyone.""¶Containing both the Galapagos Islands and Amazon rainforest, Ecuador has more biodiversity than any other country on earth.  At the same time, it is heavily reliant on revenues from its oil reserves, which represent the country's chief source of income.  Critics say that a planned increase in oil drilling, as well as mining, will put Ecuador's natural riches at risk.¶ Earlier in the visit, the Pope urged Ecuadorians to balance the need to increase the nation's wealth with the need to protect the environment. ¶Francis began his day by holding a mass for over one million people in Quito's Bicentennial Park.  Many -- including families with small children -- had camped out all night in the cold and rain in order to stake a good spot to see him.  Local media reported that 20 people suffered hypothermia from spending the night outdoors. ¶In his homily, the Pope urged Ecuadorians to work towards unity. He said that Catholics should work as ""builders of peace in a world divided by war and individualism,""  and they should rely on their common Catholic values to work towards common hopes and ideals. ¶The Pope's visit has brought a temporary lull in demonstrations against the embattled left-wing government of President Rafael Correa.  Correa's fiscal policies have angered many in the upper and middle classes, and demonstrations have rocked the capital for the past month. ¶Ecuadorians have welcomed Pope Francis with great enthusiasm, with large crowds lining the streets to see him in the Popemobile or outside venues.

    ","¶Seafood lovers are set to see less shellfish, salmon and other fish on their dinner plates as climate change warms the oceans and makes them more acidic.¶The findings from a series of studies out this week suggest rising greenhouse emissions from the burning of fossil fuels are adding stress to oceans that are already suffering from overfishing, pollution and destruction of coastal ecosystems like mangroves.¶""The types of fish that we will have on our dinner table will be very different in the future,"" said William Cheung, University of British Columbia associate professor and the co-director of the Nereus program, an international research team that put has put out a report on the state of the oceans. ""Fisheries will be catching more warm-water species, with smaller size, and that will affect fish supply through our domestic and overseas fisheries as well as imports.""¶More in Climate Change¶The report didn't single out any species that would be taken off the menu, but several others studies gave some indications, with one suggesting freshwater salmon - who start their lives at sea - in particular could suffer due to ocean acidification.¶Ocean acidification is a process where increasing amounts of carbon dioxide make the water more acidic. As a result, mollusks, crabs and corals have a harder time growing their shells, and other fish may also be affected.¶In a study this week in Nature Climate Change, University of British Columbia scientists Michelle Ou and Colin Brauner along with several other scientists reared pink salmon embryos and juveniles for 10 weeks, in two separate tanks - one that matched current CO2 levels in the water, and the other at the elevated CO2 levels predicted in the future.¶The hatchlings and juveniles exposed to higher levels of CO2 were significantly smaller than those raised at today's levels. Smaller fish are at higher risk of predation in streams and as they enter the ocean.¶The salmon's sense of smell also seemed to be affected at higher CO2  levels, which could make it harder for them to escape predators.¶The young fish were then placed in seawater, again at control or elevated levels. And again, higher CO2 concentrations inhibited growth, regardless of the conditions the fish were born in.¶""Most of the work on acidification has been in the ocean, yet 40 percent of all fish are freshwater. We need to think about how carbon dioxide is affecting freshwater species,"" said Brauner, a professor in the Department of Zoology at UBC. ""We found that freshwater acidification affects pink salmon and may impact their ability to survive and ultimately return to their freshwater spawning grounds.""¶But Philip Munday, in an article that accompanied the study, said there was reason to hope the salmon might adapt to their changing world.¶""The results of Ou et al. sound a warning that we need to consider the possible effects of CO2-induced acidification on freshwater fishes, especially species that migrate to the ocean during early life,"" Munday, of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies and College of Marine and Environmental Sciences, James Cook University, wrote.¶""Some of these fishes may be more susceptible to rising CO2 levels than we have assumed. At the same time, we also need to consider the potential for fishes to adapt to rising CO2 levels over coming decades,"" he added. ""One positive for pink salmon is that they have very large populations, they are highly fecund, and they complete their lifecycle in just two years. Consequently, there is likely to be genetic variation within existing populations that could assist them in adapting to future high CO2 levels, and they will have at least 30 generations to do so before the end of this century.""¶In a separate study, scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, University of Alaska and an Alaskan shellfish hatchery concluded that worsening ocean acidification would make it difficult for Alaskan coastal waters to support shellfish hatcheries by 2040 - unless costly mitigation efforts are installed to modify seawater used in the hatcheries.¶""Our research shows there could be significant effects from ocean acidification on Alaska's emerging shellfish hatchery industry in a matter of two and half decades,"" said Jeremy Mathis, an oceanographer at NOAA's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory and a co-author of the study, ""On the Frontline: Tracking Ocean Acidification in an Alaskan Shellfish Hatchery,"" in PLOS ONE. ""We need to continue to partner with industry and other stakeholders to make sure we're providing the environmental intelligence needed by industry to answer key questions and make decisions to meet these challenges.""¶The findings add to a growing body of evidence showing the hazards of ocean acidification.¶An earlier study warned that Alaska's commercial fisheries - representing 60 percent of fish caught in the United States - were vulnerable to ocean acidification and a broader one in Nature Climate Change concluded that fisheries producing oysters and clams across the United States will be ""vulnerable"" in the coming decades.¶Along with better monitoring of the ocean waters and increased awareness of the threat, Cheung and his colleagues said the world needed to more aggressively combat rising emissions and improve ocean governance globally to ensure the fish we love to eat are not lost.¶""Global marine ecosystems have already been largely altered by overfishing,"" said Daniel Pauly, professor at UBC and an advisor to Nereus. ""This report clearly points out that any solution needs to deal with the CO2 problem as well.""",0

China announces ambitious climate change plan,"

    ","¶China on Tuesday announced its contribution to a global climate pact that's supposed to be adopted this year in Paris, pledging to reduce the intensity of its carbon emissions and to halt their growth by 2030. It comes on the heels of a major climate accord inked last year between the United States and China.¶During a visit to the French capital, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang said in a statement that the world's most populous nation and top carbon polluter will aim to reduce its emissions per unit of gross domestic product by 60-65 percent by 2030 from 2005 levels.¶Beijing's goals, which were formally submitted to the U.N. later Tuesday, also included previously announced pledges to achieve a peak in overall emissions around 2030 and to raise the percentage of energy consumption from low-carbon sources to 20 percent by that year.¶More in Climate Change¶The news comes as another big emitter, Brazil, announced Tuesday that it would step up plans to combat illegal deforestation and increase its use of renewables in the coming decades, following a meeting between President Obama and President Dilma Rousseff.¶Li, meanwhile, said the targets show ""that China is exerting its utmost in addressing climate change, and that China is fully committed to playing an even greater part in global governance and in advancing common development of mankind.""¶The U.S. and the European Union have already announced their climate targets, meaning the world's top three carbon emitters have now made pledges for the Paris deal, which would be the first agreement to require both developed and developing nations to take actions to curb global warming.¶China announced some of its targets last year in a joint statement with the United States, injecting momentum into the climate talks by signaling that two countries that had previously been at odds in the negotiations were moving forward together.¶After a meeting with Li, French President Francois Hollande said China's contribution ""confirms its commitment to build an 'ecological civilization.'""¶Environmental groups also applauded China's contribution, though many had hoped for more ambitious targets.¶""China has only ever been on defense when it comes to climate change, but today's announcement is the first step for a more active role,"" said Li Shuo of Greenpeace. ""For success in Paris, however, all players -- including Chinaand the EU -- need to up their game.""¶In a detailed submission to the U.N., China listed a range of policies it said would help it achieve its goals, including reducing its reliance on high-polluting coal for electricity generation, scaling up renewable sources like solar and wind power, increasing energy efficiency, improving urban planning and public transport and even ""promoting voluntary tree planting by all citizens.""¶China said it aims to increase the volume of its forests -- which absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere -- by 4.5 billion cubic meters (about 160 billion cubic feet) by 2030 compared to 2005 levels.¶The document spelled out China's expectations for the Paris deal, reiterating its long-held position that developed countries need to take the lead in cutting emissions and helping poorer nations limit theirs.¶But it also showed that China accepts that as a major emerging economy it has a special role among developing countries by pledging to establish a ""south-south"" fund to help the poorest and most vulnerable countries deal with climate change.¶That's a shift from the previous, failed attempt to craft a global climate deal six years ago in Copenhagen, when China insisted on a firewall between developed and developing countries.¶""This is a clear sign that we're moving past the old developed-developing country divide to a new understanding that all major economies have to contribute their fair share to the global effort,"" said Bob Perciasepe, president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, a think tank in Washington.¶During her meeting with Obama, Brazil's Rousseff laid out a plan in which her country would aim to eliminate illegal deforestation and restore and reforest 12 million hectares of forests by 2030. Deforestation is huge problem in the Amazon and contributes about 20 percent to global warming.¶The country, the world's seventh biggest emitter, also pledged to get as much as 33 percent of its energy from renewables sources other than hydropower by 2030. It is likely many of these commitments will be reflected in the country's climate plan that it will submit to the United  Nations ahead of the Paris meeting.¶""As we work toward a strong global climate agreement in Paris, I thank our Brazilian friends for previewing elements of their post-2020 targets for reducing emissions, including substantial new goals to eliminate illegal deforestation and restore forests,"" Obama said at a joint press conference with Rousseff. ""Following progress during my trips to China and India, this shows that the world's major economies can begin to transcend some of the old divides and work together to confront the common challenge that we face -- something that we have to work on for future generations.""¶Environmentalists also praised Brazil's announcement.¶""Brazil's commitment to increase and diversify its supply of renewable energy is an encouraging step forward,"" Jennifer Morgan, global climate director for the World Resources Institute, said. ""The actions announced today will help Brazil grow its economy with clean, sustainable energy. Brazil should build on this announcement with an ambitious national climate plan as part of the international agreement this year.""",0

Those aquifers were still being depleted but had some water flowing back into them.¶Scientists say the total remaining volume of the world's usable groundwater is poorly known, with estimates that often vary widely.

    ","¶For some time, scientists have watched as creatures big and small have attempted to adapt to climate change. Some have shifted their ranges while others are breeding earlier.¶Now, a study finds that time may be running out for some species as the world continues to pump heat-trapping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, causing temperatures to rise to record levels.¶The study published in Science Thursday found that one in six species on the planet could face extinction due to the effects of climate change - with the rates of biodiversity loss accelerating with every degree-Celsius rise in temperature.¶Those plants and animals living in South America, Australia and New Zealand - where shrinking habitats are a barrier to migration - are most at risk, according to study author Mark Urban, who came his conclusion after conducting a meta-analysis of 131 previously published biodiversity studies.¶More in Climate Change¶""Extinction risks from climate change are expected not only to increase but to accelerate for every degree rise in global temperatures,"" he wrote. ""The signal of climate change-induced extinctions will become increasingly apparent if we do not act now to limit future climate change.""¶Overall, extinction rates did not vary significantly by taxonomic groups. But Urban did find that endemic species with smaller ranges and certain taxonomic groups such as amphibians and reptiles are predicted to face greater extinction as temperatures rise.¶World leaders will meet in Paris later this year to negotiate an agreement to tackle warming. The aim of any deal is to keep global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees C (3.6 degrees F) over what they were in preindustrial times, which most scientists contend would avert the worst impacts of climate change, such as widespread droughts, heat waves and flooding.¶But even at 2 degrees, extinction rates are expected to increase. Urban suggests that the global extinction risk would almost double from its current value of 2.8 percent to 5.2 percent. And if global warming continues on its current path without any intervention, leading to a 4.3-degree Celsius post-industrial increase, 16 percent of species could face increased risks.¶The University of Washington's Janneke Hille Ris Lambers, in an article accompanying the study, praised the findings for attempting to quantify the scope of the problem. As she noted, previous studies put the impacts on biodiversity from climate change at anywhere from 0 percent to 54 percent, making it difficult to ""assess the seriousness of the problem.""¶""By quantitatively assessing how extinction risk depends on model assumptions, Urban's study provides insight into factors that increase biodiversity loss with climate change,"" she wrote. ""Surprisingly, the modeling approaches used in the studies that Urban surveyed did not have the largest effect on estimates of extinction risk, despite substantial methodological differences. Instead, the magnitude of future climate change was the most important predictor of extinction risk, with increased warming resulting in greater biodiversity loss.""¶In a related study also in Science, University of California, Berkeley's Seth Finnegan and his colleagues examined marine species from nearly 3,000 genera that have died out over the last 23 million years in an effort to project which of species in the oceans today might go extinct.¶Echoing Urban's results, they found that animals with small geographic ranges are most at risk of extinction. In addition, some groups tend to be more extinction-prone than others. For example, in the fossil record, whales, dolphins and seals show higher risk of extinction than sharks or invertebrates such as corals. Clams and mussels - so-called bivalves - had about one-tenth the extinction risk of mammals.¶""It's very difficult to detect extinctions in the modern oceans, but fossils can help fill in the gaps,"" said co-author and conservation biologist Sean Anderson, a postdoctoral researcher at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia. ""Our findings can help prioritize areas and species that might be at greater risk of extinction and that might require extra attention, conservation or management.""¶Researchers said the findings could help policy makers better decide on what species are in need of additional protection in the future.¶""The implications of these patterns for the future of coastal marine ecosystems will depend on how natural risk and current threats interact,"" said co-author Paul Harnik, an assistant professor of geosciences at Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. ""By understanding these patterns in the past, we hope to provide a framework for understanding global change.""",0

Only 37 percent of GOP conservatives believe the current generation will have to deal with the effects of a changing climate.¶That belief puts them at odds with every other ideological group Gallup surveyed. Eighty-nine percent of liberal Democrats, 78 percent of moderate Democrats, 66 percent of independents, and 64 percent of moderate Republicans believe they'll see the effects of global warming during their lifetime, according to Gallup.¶More in Climate Change¶The results expose the tricky political question facing proponents of a more aggressive response to climate change: Can progress be made on a response if a significant part of one party can't even agree on the existence of a problem, much less the wisdom of a proposed solution?¶President Obama will deliver a speech at Everglades National Park in Florida on Wednesday, which also happens to be Earth Day. The president is expected to highlight the bipartisan efforts to restore the park's fragile ecosystem, which has been threatened by decades of development in south Florida. But he's also expected to warn that those efforts will be for naught if global warming continues unchecked.¶Democrats have long pushed for a reduction of carbon emissions and a transition to cleaner forms of energy to help ward off the most pernicious impacts of climate change, from rising sea levels to droughts and other severe weather patterns. A cap-and-trade proposal to place a price on carbon emissions cleared the House when it was under Democratic control in 2009, though it later died in the Senate. And last year, President Obama unilaterally imposed a carbon cap on coal-fired power plants.¶Many Republicans, though, have questioned the science behind climate change, disputing the majority of scientists who believe human carbon emissions are to blame. Others in the GOP have said human activity has played a role, but they've accused Democrats of pushing solutions that would be too costly for American businesses.¶Gallup's data was based on annual interviews between 2010 and 2015 with 6,154 American adults.

    ","¶As the nation's capital gears up for a large Earth Day celebration this weekend, President Obama issued a warning on the dangers global warming pose to the planet.¶""Climate change can no longer be denied - or ignored,"" the president said in a video Saturday. ""The world is looking to the United States - to us - to lead.""¶""Today, there's no greater threat to our planet than climate change,"" Mr. Obama continued. ""This is the only planet we've got.  And years from now, I want to be able to look our children and grandchildren in the eye and tell them that we did everything we could to protect it.""¶Though Earth Day isn't officially until Wednesday of this coming week, the president is getting a head start on reminding the American people of the dangers of global warming. Earlier this month Obama, accompanied by Surgeon General Vivek Murthy and Environmental Protection Agency chief Gina McCarthy, met with health experts in a recent public awareness initiative to tie global health to the effects of climate change. ¶More in Climate Change¶""The world's top climate scientists are warning us that changing climate already affects the air our kids breathe,"" Mr. Obama said.¶The president, who plans to visit the Florida Everglades on Earth Day, also added in a dig against climate change-deniers in the opposing party. ¶""This winter was cold in parts of our country - as some folks in Congress like to point out - but around the world, it was the warmest ever recorded,"" Mr. Obama said in his address. ¶It may have been a jab at Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Oklahoma, who had brought a snowball to the Senate floor in late February, questioning the science behind global warming. The chair of the Environment and Public Works Committee, who has long called climate change a ""hoax,"" was trying to prove that it was still ""very, very cold"" outside during the Washington, D.C. winter.  ¶The president also touted his administration's efforts to increase the use of renewable fuel sources and cut carbon emissions abroad and at home.¶""We've committed to doubling the pace at which we cut carbon pollution, and China has committed, for the first time, to limiting their emissions,"" Mr. Obama said. ""And because the world's two largest economies came together, there's new hope that, with American leadership, this year, the world will finally reach an agreement to prevent the worst impacts of climate change before it's too late.""¶Obama's declaration comes at a time when a major linchpin of his carbon-cutting strategy -- new EPA regulations called the Clean Power Plan -- is facing an uphill legal battle. A federal appeals court heard arguments Thursday on the far-reaching policies to limit the pollution from coal-fired power plants. ¶In their own address, the Republican Party took issue with the administration's Iran nuclear negotiations, which would result in dialing back sanctions on the Middle East country. ¶""Lately, Iran has tried to backtrack on the promises they made to President Obama,"" Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Illinois, said in a video Saturday. ""Iran now wants sanctions immediately lifted which would fund Iran's terror subsidiaries with billions."" ¶""We must use strong economic pressure on Iran to prevent them from getting nuclear weapons,"" the Illinois senator continued. ""Stopping Iran from getting nuclear weapons is the greatest challenge to peace in our time.""¶Kirk, who recently penned a budget amendment that would impose Iran sanctions if they skirt the terms of the nuclear agreement, called the country ""the world's biggest sponsor of terror."" ¶""We must keep terrorists from hurting our allies and our nation,"" the Republican legislator said.",0
Obama's climate change plan faces high-profile legal challenge,"

    ","¶The cornerstone of President Obama's plan to address climate change is still months away from being finished, but it's already facing a high-stakes legal challenge from critics who want to halt the process in its tracks.¶A federal appeals court heard arguments Thursday in two cases challenging the Environmental Protection Agency's far-reaching proposal to cut Earth-warming pollution from the nation's coal-fired power plants. Two out of the three judges on the panel expressed doubts about the lawsuits. Judges Thomas Griffith and Brett Kavanaugh seemed to agree with lawyers defending the EPA that the suits are premature because the agency has not yet made the rule final.¶The lawsuits - one from a coalition of 15 states and another brought by Ohio-based Murray Energy Corp., the nation's largest privately held coal mining company - are part of a growing political attack from opponents who say the move is illegal and will kill jobs, cripple demand for coal and drive up electricity prices.¶At issue is whether the EPA has legal authority for its plan under the Clean Air Act. But the agency and environmental advocacy groups have urged the court to throw the cases out as premature, saying legal challenges must wait until the EPA issues a final rule until this summer.¶More in Climate Change¶Opponents concede it's not typical for a court to provide relief before a rule is final, but argue that states and the coal industry already face the prospect of shutting down coal plants and spending other resources in anticipation of the rule.¶All three judges on the panel hearing the case were appointed by Republican presidents.¶The EPA rule proposed last year requires states to cut carbon emissions by 30 percent by 2030, giving customized targets to each state and leaving it up to them to draw up plans to meet the targets.¶But a backlash has been building. Last month, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, sent a letter urging the governors of all 50 states to defy the EPA by refusing to submit the compliance plans.¶West Virginia and other states argue that the plan is illegal because coal-fired power plants already are regulated under a separate section of the Clean Air Act. They say the law prohibits ""double regulation.""¶The legal debate focuses on dueling provisions added by the House and Senate to the Clean Air Act in 1990. The EPA says it wins under the Senate language, but opponents argue the House version should prevail.",0

    ","¶It seems  that most American aren't listening to all the cynics who have called climate change a hoax or some kind of grand conspiracy.¶In the one of the most detailed surveys of its kind, researchers writing Monday in Nature Climate Change found that an overwhelming majority of Americans believe climate change is real and that something should be done about carbon emissions. ¶The study by Yale and Utah State University researchers tallied opinions in 2013 on whether global warming was real and what should be done about it from survey participants in all 50 states, including 435 Congressional districts, 3,000 counties, and 381 cities across the nation. The researchers compiled their data into a set of interactive maps, which can be found at the bottom of this article.¶More in Climate Change¶Collectively, 63 percent of Americans were found to believe global warming but those numbers ranged from a low of 54 percent in coal-friendly West Virginia to 81 percent in Washington, D.C.  From there, citizens in Hawaii, New York and California and are the next biggest believers at 75 percent, 72 percent and 70 percent respectively. Lowest numbers generally were found in Middle America and in parts of the Southeast.¶The findings would appear to show public attitudes are becoming closer in line with the science, which has found ""there is no ambiguity"" on climate change. It also suggests the thinking of some skeptical politicians, like Sen. Jim Inofe from Oklahoma, who has called global warming a hoax and has denied its existence, could be out of line with the national mood on the issue.¶""The results show that most Americans everywhere think that global warming is happening. That becomes pretty clear,"" Yale University's Anthony Leiserowitz, a co-author on the study, told CBS News. ¶""That is the context in which every national leader whether in the House or Senate is operating,"" he said. ""You will often hear comments from people more dismissive of climate change that the American people don't believe in climate change. In fact, we find overwhelmingly they do think it's happening.""¶Fifty-two percent said they were worried about global warming, though that differed quite a bit by state, with just over 40 percent of respondents in Wyoming, North Dakota and West Virginia showing concern. Nationwide, only 42 percent said it was already harming people in the United States and only 34 percent felt they had been harmed personally by rising levels of greenhouse gas emissions that have caused temperatures to rise - and led to record highs in 2014, especially in places like Florida, which has been hit by rising sea levels, and California, which is enduring a four-year drought.¶While only 48 percent of respondents believe humans cause climate change, a clear majority think something should be done about it. Eight-three percent nationally think more research should go into renewable energy sources while a surprising 81 percent support regulating CO2 as a pollutant and 76 percent want strict CO2 limits on existing coal-fired power plants. ¶The last finding is significant, since it would imply most Americans back President Obama's Clean Power Plan. The rule for coal-fired power plants calls for a 30 percent reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030. Power plants represent the largest source of emissions in the United States.¶""For the first time, every member of Congress should be able to see the level of support for that policy in their own district,"" Leiserowitz said of the Clean Power Plan. ""If you look at it by state or congressional district, there is strong consistent support for that policy just about everywhere.""¶Drilling down to state, county and city level, the study found strong belief in climate change in New York City, Chicago and Los Angeles while ""proportions in most rural counties are significantly lower."" The presence of colleges and universities also ""was a factor associated with high levels of belief,"" while counties with oil drilling or fracking operations tended to be home to fewer believers.¶Leiserowitz said many of the demographics where belief was strongest have much in common. They are typically pro-government with a liberal bias that includes support for legalizing marijuana and gay marriage. ¶""They are more trusting of environmental science and they are also more supportive of government action to deal with it,"" Leiserowitz said.¶""It is helpful to compare and contrast them with those who are dismissive and who don't think its real,"" he said. ""These people by contrast have very strong individualistic world views so it's all about individual freedom, individual autonomy ... These people are most hostile to the issue of climate change. What is fascinating is that a major motivation of their hostility isn't the science or the reality of climate change but they are afraid of the policy solutions to climate change.""¶One of the more interesting findings is that Latinos were big believers in climate change, with Latino-dominated Southwestern Texas showing rates 10 percent higher than in other parts of Texas. That builds on earlier research, which found they are the most concerned of any racial or ethnic group in the United States about global warming.¶Leiserowitz said scientists are still trying to understand why that is, but a few theories have been put forth. Among are their Catholic faith, Latino's connection to the land and the fact that many have come from South and Central America, where the impacts of global warming are more apparent.¶""When a weather disaster hits like drought or flood or storms, it does far more damage down there than it does here,"" he said. ""They understand vulnerability.""",0
Climate change forcing polar bears to go on diet,"

    ","¶Forced onto land by melting sea ice, polar bears are struggling to find enough to eat.¶A team of scientists led by the U.S. Geological Survey found the bears are getting by on berries, birds and their eggs. But these appetizers, if you will, cannot compensate for diminishing access to their traditional diet of ice seals.¶""The bears are being forced off the ice earlier and they are not just going to sit around and wait for the sea ice to refreeze if there is something available for them to eat,"" Steve Amstrup, the chief scientist of Polar Bears International and a co-author of the study in Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, told CBS News.¶More in Climate Change¶""The issue is whether or not eating these things will benefit the bears,"" he said. ""The one terrestrial food rich enough to support bears is bird eggs. But the problem is that there aren't enough of those in the polar bear's range to make much of a difference.""¶And despite media reports of their newfound diets, the researchers said bears eating many of these items is still not the norm. The study found that fewer than 30 individual polar bears have been observed consuming bird eggs from any one population, which typically range from 900 to 2000 individuals.¶""Although some polar bears may eat terrestrial foods, there is no evidence the behavior is widespread,"" USGS scientist Karyn Rode said. ""In the regions where terrestrial feeding by polar bears has been documented, polar bear body condition and survival rates have declined."" ¶The other challenge, the authors note, is that the polar bears on land have to compete with grizzly bears for what food sources are available.  And tellingly, these grizzly bears are among the smallest of their species because of their diet.¶""The smaller size and low population density of grizzly bears in the Arctic provides a clear indication of the nutritional limitations of onshore habitats for supporting large bodied polar bears in meaningful numbers,"" Rode said. ""Grizzly bears and polar bears are likely to increasingly interact and potentially compete for terrestrial resources."" ¶This is just the latest dose of bad news for the polar bears, which were added to the Endangered Species List due to the impact that global warming is having on their icy world. ¶Last year, the USGS found that polar bear numbers in Alaska and Canada have declined by almost half, mostly due to the impact thinning ice was having on their ability to hunt ringed seals and bearded seals.¶Scientists found polar bear numbers in the southern Beaufort Sea dropped about 40 percent, to 900, between 2000 and 2010. Survival rates were especially dire from 2004 to 2006; they began to recover in 2007 and stabilized two years later. ¶Amstrup said he did not expect conditions to improve much, noting polar bears simply don't have the time to adapt to a new environment with completely different food sources.¶""There doesn't seem to be anything out there that could replace rich foods that polar bears get off the sea ice,"" he said. ¶""We are talking temperatures being warmer in 50 years and certainly in 100 years than has ever occurred in the evolutionary history of polar bears,"" he said. ""You can't undo a million years of evolution in 50 years.""¶Amstrup acknowledged a short-term solution might be for humans to feed the bears - as is sometimes done with snow-bound deer in the United States or reindeer in Norway. But the only real fix, he said, was cutting greenhouse gas emissions, which are contributing to the rise of record temperatures in the Arctic.¶""If we don't stop the rise in greenhouse gases, polar bears will go extinct,"" he said. ""For a while, we could potentially feed the bears. But if we don't stop the rise in greenhouse gases, the world will get warmer and warmer and all those options will be off the table.""",0
One-fifth of New England's plant life threatened,"

    ","¶BOSTON -- From picturesque coastal estuaries of Cape Cod to the soaring White Mountains, much of New England's rich native flora is fighting for survival against increasing odds, according to what conservationists call the most comprehensive accounting ever made of the region's plant life.¶The report, to be released Thursday by the New England Wild Flower Society, studied more than 3,500 known plant species and determined that 22 percent are considered rare, in decline, endangered or possibly extinct. Many plants also range over a much smaller geographical area than they once did.¶Another statistic that researchers found alarming: More than 30 percent of current plant species are not native to the region. Non-native or invasive species often compete with and crowd out existing plants.¶The report's authors cite numerous risk factors, including familiar ones such as climate change, land development, forest clearing and pesticides. But among the lesser-known threats to plant life are dams that alter floodplains; commercial harvesting for pharmaceutical use; and salt marsh dieback, a complex process of erosion that already has affected more than 80 percent of Cape Cod marshes, the report said.¶More in Climate Change¶Imperiled plants carry a variety of exotic or obscure names: Goldenseal and American Ginseng, gathered for culinary or medicinal purposes in New England's northern hardwood forests; Jesup's milk-vetch, a federally endangered species found in three places along the Connecticut River and nowhere else; sandplain gerardia, birds-foot violet and wild goat's-rue, all native to drier grasslands; and saltpond pennywort, one of many rare plants that reside in marshy coastal habitats.¶The decline of these and other species have enormous ramifications to wildlife and humans, the report warns, because of the obvious if underappreciated role plants play in complex ecosystems.¶""You actually have to save the plants because that is the base of the food chain,"" said Debbi Edelstein, the society's executive director. ""And that's what all of those critters that you are thinking you want to save, whose habitat you want save, are depending on.""¶The nonprofit organization, based in Framingham, Massachusetts, said it compiled the information through observations made by hundreds of volunteers and professional botanists throughout New England and data culled from voluminous historical surveys, some as far back as the botanical journals of famous naturalists such as Henry David Thoreau.¶Douglas Tallamy, a professor of entomology and wildlife ecology at the University of Delaware who was not involved with the study, said the estimate that 31 percent of New England plants are non-native appears consistent with other parts of the country.¶He said humans are often guilty of displacing native plant communities through development while adorning their gardens with plants imported from overseas.¶""We have come to see plants simply as decorations and we just want to have pretty landscapes, but in doing that we have forgotten all the ecological roles that they play,"" Tallamy said.¶The report recommends additional research and documentation of New England flora, improved public awareness of invasive species, and stronger conservation laws and land management measures where needed.¶""It's not all gloom and doom,"" said Elizabeth Farnsworth, the organization's senior research ecologist. The overall diversity of New England plant life still compares favorably with many other regions in the U.S., she said, and many plants continue to flourish in part because of successful ongoing conservation initiatives.¶Robbins cinquefoil, a small plant related to the rose and once so rare that 95 percent could be found within a 1-acre site on New Hampshire's Mount Washington, fell victim over the years to poachers and hikers who trampled it underfoot. Placed on the federal endangered list in 1996, the plant had a resurgence after the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the White Mountain National Forest and the Appalachian Mountain Club worked to divert a popular hiking trail and create a barrier to shield the plant. Today, more than 14,000 inhabit the site, the report said.¶Individuals can help, Farnsworth said, simply by planting a native shrub on their property or teaching their children to appreciate native plant life.¶""We can begin to reverse these declines,"" she said.",0

    ","¶Climate change could have an impact so real you can literally taste it. A report from Australia suggests increased temperatures due to greenhouse gas emissions could change the way foods taste and make some vegetables, fruits and seafood varieties harder to find.¶It is the latest dose of bad news for Australia after several years of heat waves, wildfires and drought brought on by record temperatures, and it's a troubling warning for the rest of the world as well.¶""Australian farmers have always faced a highly variable climate, but now climate change adds significant additional complexity to their management,"" said Richard Eckard, the director of the Primary Industries Climate Challenges Centre based at the University of Melbourne, who contributed to the report.¶More in Climate Change¶In addition to reducing production of crops and livestock by 2030, he wrote, ""heat and drought are likely to reduce the quality of grain, grape, vegetable, fruit, and other crops.""¶The report found a long list of supermarket staples would be effected if temperatures rise up to 1.6° Celsius (2.9° Fahrenheit) by 2030 (compared with the 1980-1999 average temperature) and up to 5°C (9° F) by 2070.¶Carrots might lose some of their texture and taste, kale could become more bitter, eggplants could grow deformed and canola oil could lose about a quarter of its nutritional value. Many other crops could suffer lower yields, increased disease or reduced flowering, including raspberries, lemons, beets, potatoes, lentils and chickpeas.¶Meat and seafood would also be impacted. The rising temperatures could force ranchers to raise more heat-tolerant cattle which produce lower quality beef. Dairy cows would likely produce lower quality milk -- and up to 40 percent less of it. Heat stress could also be extremely dangerous to pigs and chickens, while higher temperatures in the oceans may lead to a decline in some species of octopus and result in ""Southern scallops disappearing from our plates.""¶Previous studies have found that in a warmer world, food prices are expected to rise and some of what we eat will have less nutritional value.¶Not everything on the farm, however, will suffer in a warmer world.¶The report found that sweet potatoes could become a greater part of the global diet, the range of olives should expand and such things as mangoes and eggplant will be able to grow in areas where it is now to cold to produce them. ¶The report quotes some farmers who say they're worried about the warming trend. ""Should we address global warming? We have no bloody future if we don't,"" winemakerDavid Bruer said. ""I worry very much about my children. I just wonder what their future is.""¶""Climate change is one of the top pressures facing farmers,"" said dairy farmer Lynne Strong.

Hawaii frets over vanishing beaches,"

    ","¶HONOLULU -- More than 13 miles of Hawaii beaches have been lost to erosion in the past century, and lawmakers are tackling the problem by attempting to secure more money for beach restoration.¶Chronic erosion is affecting 70 percent of beaches on Oahu, Kauai and Maui, according to a study by the U.S. Geological Survey.¶""That's just the tip of the iceberg,"" said Sam Lemmo, administrator for Hawaii's Office of Conservation and Coastal Lands. ""Most of the beaches in the state are on an erosion basis now, and that's only going to increase in the future with sea level rise. It's going to double, it's going to possibly triple, by the end of the century.""¶More in Climate Change¶A study by the University of Hawaii released Monday indicated that coastal erosion of Hawaii's beaches could double by mid-century. Following current trends, the shoreline could recede by an average of 20 feet in 2050 or 40 feet by 2100, according to the report.¶A bill in the Legislature would set aside part of the transient accommodation tax to help fund beach restoration.  The bill is supported by the Hawaii Tourism Authority, which has an obvious interest in ensuring that beaches aren't lost.¶""It is one of the most important things that we need to focus in on, because we are known for our beautiful beaches, our sand, our environment,"" said Senate President Donna Mercado Kim, ""and if that should go, that would be so detrimental to the economy and to the environment.""¶The dollar amount for beach restoration in the bill is currently blank, and Kim said she's hoping for $3 million to $5 million a year for what would be a new beach restoration and conservation special fund.¶Kim's proposal in the Senate, SB 617, died, but a companion measure introduced in the House is alive. A joint Senate panel approved that bill, HB 444, on Monday.¶""Our beaches are so vital to not only our visitors, but to our local families,"" said Rep. Ryan Yamane, who introduced HB 444. Yamane is hoping for $5 million for the beach restoration fund.¶The bill would give the Department of Land and Natural Resources a foundation for a program to sustain beach management, Lemmo said.¶""The erosion rate is going to be horrendous,"" Lemmo said. ""We have to adjust or adapt to those rapid changes that are going to be occurring because of rapid sea level rise. We need to have a total package, not just like throw sand on the beach.""¶The construction of sea walls and buildings that are too close to the shore may be contributing to the problem. If the bill passes, the department could devote more resources to addressing erosion through planning, building setbacks and ordinances that would guide future development, Lemmo said.¶The Tax Foundation of Hawaii opposed the bill, arguing that earmarks decrease government accountability and should be avoided.¶Having dedicated funds would allow the department to act quickly, instead of continually requesting legislative approval and waiting until later when it will cost more to fix problems, Kim said.¶""It's too much at stake,"" Lemmo said. ""It's half of our economy.""",0

A new study published Tuesday suggests that rising sea temperatures due to climate change could help them return to their old habitat once again.¶""Today, gray whales are found only in the Pacific. But our research indicates that they may move back into the Atlantic, where they could have transformative impacts on existing ecosystems,"" said Elizabeth Alter, lead author of the study and professor of biology at the Graduate Center and York College, City University of New York.¶More in Climate Change¶In their paper in Molecular Ecology, scientists from the City University of New York, Potsdam University and the Wildlife Conservation Society used ancient DNA sequences to show that gray whales migrated between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans during warmer periods of the late Pleistocene and Holocene, when the Bering Strait was open and sea-ice was thinner.¶As Arctic sea-ice melts, sea levels rise and once-obstructed waterways open up, the thinking is that whales may move back to the Atlantic.¶Two recent sightings of gray whales in the Atlantic suggest this movement may already be starting.¶""Unfortunately, the complete disappearance of the Atlantic gray whale is the only instance of a whale extinction from an ocean basin during the historical era,"" said Dr. Howard Rosenbaum, director of the Wildlife Conservation Society's Ocean Giants Program and co-author of the study.

    ","¶The numbers of people impacted by floods around the world could nearly triple to 54 million by 2030, driven in part by climate change and unchecked development, according to a new study.¶The findings come from the Aquaduct Global Flood Analyzer, an interactive online flood-tracking tool developed by the World Resources Institute and four Dutch research organizations. They also found a similar trend with regard to the economic impact. It concluded that, today, economic activity to the tune of $96 billion in GDP is disrupted annually and that number could increase more than five times to $521 billion by 2030. ¶Poor countries in Asia would be hit hardest of the 170 countries analyzed. India is by far the most vulnerable with 4.8 million citizens put at risk by flood waters followed by Bangladesh, Vietnam, Pakistan and Indonesia. ¶More in Climate Change¶""Our analysis shows a clear trend across the world. In lower- and middle-income countries, socioeconomic development is expected to concentrate more people, buildings, infrastructure and other assets in vulnerable regions,"" the researchers wrote in a blog post. ""So, the developing world is expected to see more GDP exposed to flood risks in 2030, driven largely by socioeconomic change.""¶India, for example, faces more potential change in exposed GDP than any other country. Using a middle-of-the road scenario, the analysis estimates that $14 billion of GDP is already exposed annually with that number rising tenfold to $154 billion in 2030. ¶Researchers said the findings demonstrate that climate change will worsen flood risk as a result of rising sea levels. But they acknowledged the impacts of global warming would be dwarfed by socioeconomic growth, in particular due to the concentrated growth of Southeast Asia's megacities in flood-prone areas.¶The only developed nation in the top 20 countries most vulnerable to flooding damage was the the United States. It came in 18th just behind Mexico and ahead of Sudan with 170,000 residents and $7 billion in GDP at risk. By 2030, that figure is expected to rise to 262,000 people and the GDP impact will more than double.¶Breaking it down further, the analysis found that Florida ($890 million in lost GDP) was currently most at risk of all U.S. states. It was followed by Louisiana, California, Texas, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois, Ohio, Indiana and New York. ¶By 2030, Florida continues to be the most at risk with as much as $5.5 billion in GDP at stake. But Oregon, Washington, Nevada and Tennessee replace Michigan, Indiana, New York and Ohio in the top 10.¶The flood analyzer is the first publicly available online tool to assess current and future river flood risk - measuring the flood risk in dollar amount, including urban damage, affected GDP and affected population. Users can also look at flood risk by country, river basin or state and see the extent that floods will inundate any given place.¶""Through this flood analyzer, the complex data really comes alive and becomes available to a nonspecialist audience far beyond the research arena,"" Hessel Winsemius, a researcher with Deltares, one of the four Dutch organizations, told reporters.¶ ""It really transforms these data layers into actionable information informing users like governments and businesses which developments in their region are at risk,"" he said. ""On the positive side, the user can actually see a first cut of how much benefit flood protection can provide in reducing this risk both at present day as well as in future in real economic dollars values. This really opens the door to actions, how to achieve this protection.""¶Erin Coughlan, a program officer at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent's Climate Center, said the tool would be a great benefit for the disaster response community, noting that almost half of the natural disasters in 2013 were floods.¶""As the Red Cross, we often find ourselves in the place of firefighting and responding to these disasters after people have been surprised by the flooding event itself,"" Coughlan said.

Could climate change take oysters off the menu?,"

    ","¶If there was a frontline in the fight over climate change, a good place to start might be oyster farms in places like the Pacific Northwest or the East Coast.¶A new study published Monday in Nature Climate Change warned fisheries producing oysters and clams across the United States will be ""vulnerable"" in the coming decades to ocean acidification, a process where increasing amounts of carbon dioxide make the water more acidic. In turn, that makes it more difficult for mollusks, crabs and corals to grow their shells. ¶In the first nationwide assessment, scientists from University of California at Davis, Ocean Conservancy, Duke University and National Resources Defense Council found the process was more widespread than previously thought and that 16 of 23 coastal regions across the U.S. will endure ""rapid acidification"" by mid-century.¶More in Climate Change¶The study comes at a time when the industry is on the upswing, with farms booming and demand rising for oysters, especially in places like New York City. In Maine alone, the numbers of farms went from four to 65 in 2013, producing some 2 million oysters.¶But that growth is in danger.¶""Ocean acidification has already cost the oyster industry in the Pacific Northwest nearly $110 million, and jeopardized about 3,200 jobs,"" said Julia Ekstrom, who was a lead author on the Nature study and leads the Climate Adaptation Program at UC Davis. ""Our research shows, for the first time, that many communities around the U.S. face similar risks.""¶Factoring in a region's economic dependence on the industry and local environmental conditions such as agriculture runoff that might exacerbate ocean acidification, the study identified 15 states most at risk from the impacts. They include Massachusetts, New Jersey, Virginia, Washington, Oregon, Connecticut, New York, Rhode Island, Maine, Florida, North Carolina, California, Louisiana, Maryland and Texas. ¶""Our analysis shows acidification will harm more than ocean creatures; it will have real impacts on people's lives,"" said Lisa Suatoni, NRDC Oceans Program Senior Scientist. ""It will pinch pocketbooks, it will put livelihoods at risk, and it will alter the fabric of communities all across the country.""¶In response the study, some in the industry are calling for increased research to understand the impacts of ocean acidification on fisheries. They also want authorities to stem the flow of the nitrogen-rich runoff mostly from agriculture but also from sewage that are polluting waters along the East Coast and causing oxygen-depleted dead zones in places like the Gulf Coast.¶""Some coastal waters are already experiencing conditions that shellfish larvae cannot tolerate, but the chemistry is complex and there are still many unknowns about how corrosive conditions will impact not only shellfish (such as oysters, clams and mussels) but also lobster, shrimp and other organisms that form the base of the marine food chain,"" Bob Rheault, executive director of the East Coast Shellfish Growers Association, said in an op-ed that accompanied the study. ¶""Given the importance of seafood to global nutrition and coastal economies, it is increasingly important that we conduct critical scientific research so we can better predict how various organisms will react to increasingly corrosive waters in the coming years,"" he said. ""We need to develop strategies that will help us mitigate and adapt to rapidly changing conditions. Biological research, selective breeding and technological innovation will be critical for our industry to adapt to the challenges that lie ahead.""¶Ekstrom also said work needs to be done to make these coastal communities aware of the threat and to ensure that places like southern Massachusetts - a region which depends more than any other in the country on shellfish- can start to adapt to by diversifying their economies or shifting into other fisheries.¶""It doesn't mean getting out of shell fishing but we need to understand better what it means to them,"" Ekstrom said. ""They are going to be the ones who can figure out how to become resilient to these global changes.""¶Despite the dire predictions, many in the industry point to the Pacific Northwest as a lesson on how the industry can combat the threat.  Hit by acidic waters that decimated shellfish hatcheries in 2007 and 2008, the industry made up of some 120 farms has recovered in part by installing monitoring systems in hatcheries that ensure the waters are safe for their oyster larvae.¶""Oyster hatcheries here are chemically buffering their waters to reduce the corrosiveness, exploring ways to reduce other stressors on the organisms in the hatcheries, and developing breeding programs to help find strains that are more resistant to ocean acidification,"" Oregon State's George Waldbusser, another co-author, said by email.¶""So for now, the industry here has adapted in the short-term,"" he said. ""However, there are always limits to adaptation, we can only engineer so much, and for shellfish species that don't have established hatcheries, meaning they are wild spawned, the possibilities are far less. Ultimately we need to remove the primary causes of ocean acidification if we value shellfish for their economic and ecological roles.""",0

    ","¶It's official: 2014 was the hottest year ever.¶Two separate analyses by NASA and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration found that temperatures across the globe last year were the warmest since 1880. The 10 warmest years, with the exception of 1998, have occurred since 2000.¶""This is the latest in a series of warm years, in a series of warm decades,"" said Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA's Goddard Institute of Space Studies. ""While the ranking of individual years can be affected by chaotic weather patterns, the long-term trends are attributable to drivers of climate change that right now are dominated by human emissions of greenhouse gases.""¶More in Climate Change¶During 2014, the average temperature across global land and ocean surfaces was 1.24 degrees Fahrenheit (0.69 degrees Celsius) above the 20th century average. This was the highest among all 135 years in the 1880-2014 record, surpassing the previous records of 2005 and 2010 by 0.07 degrees F (0.04 degrees C).¶Much of the increase was due to warming in global oceans, NOAA said, particulary in the northeastern Pacific Ocean in and around the Gulf of Alaska, much of the western equatorial Pacific, parts of the western North Atlantic and western South Atlantic, and much of the Norwegian and Barents Seas. The annually-averaged temperature for ocean surfaces around the world was 0.57 degrees C (1.03 degrees F) higher than the 20th century average, breaking the previous records of 1998 and 2003 by 0.05 degrees C (0.09 degrees F).¶Temperature records on land were also reached across the globe, from far eastern Russia to Australia, across the western United States and much of Europe.¶The rising temperatures are part of a long term trend that goes back decades and is driven to a large degree by the burning of coal, oil and gas which traps heats, changing the climate.¶Since 1880, Earth's average surface temperature has warmed by about 1.4 degrees F (0.8 degrees C). The majority of that warming has occurred in the past three decades.¶The dire temperature news is expected to put further pressure on world leaders to come with an international agreement to combat climate change when they meet in Paris later this year.¶The goal of any agreement would be to keep global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees C over what they were in preindustrial times, which most scientists contend would avert the worst impacts of climate change, such as widespread droughts, heat waves and flooding.¶But to achieve that, the world will have to dramatically shift away from its heavy reliance on fossil fuels. To have a 50 percent chance of achieving the temperature goals the world would have to keep 82 percent of coal reserves, half of the gas reserves and a third of oil in the ground.¶""The scientific community is telling us that, unless we get our act together, what we will see in years to come is more droughts, more floods, more extreme weather disturbances, increased raising of sea levels which will threaten our coastal communities and in fact countries all over the world,"" Sen. Bernie Sanders, who plans to introduce an amendment in the Senate affirming that climate change is real, caused by burning of fossil fuels and must be addressed, told CBS News.¶""If we don't reverse climate change -- if you can believe this -- by the end of this century, this planet is going to be between 5 degrees Fahrenheit and 10 degrees Fahrenheit warmer,"" he said. ""We know what that is already doing to the ocean and to this planet. What they are saying is this planet is in trouble and it will only get worse unless we move boldly to cut carbon emissions.""¶It isn't all that surprising that temperatures reached a milestone, since several months in 2014 hit global heat records including December, October, September, August, June and May. April 2014 was the second hottest on record. January, March and July were fourth. February was the 21st warmest.¶The United States didn't hit a record in 2014, though it was above the 20th century average for the 18th year in a row. The nation saw stark regional differences over the year: Parts of the Midwest and East Coast were unusually cool, while Alaska and three western states - California, Arizona and Nevada - experienced their warmest year on record, according to NOAA.",0
Global warming expected to drastically reduce giant panda habitat,"

    ","¶Giant pandas, already under threat from poaching, illegal logging and development, could see their remaining habitat shrink dramatically in the coming decades due to climate change.¶A study in Biological Conservation released this month found that upwards of 71 percent of the panda's habitat in China could be lost by 2070 and the remaining terrain will become ""more fragmented and isolated.""¶Already reduced to 1 percent of their historic range, giant pandas are limited to six mountain ranges in China and are almost wholly dependent on bamboo for food. Their numbers -- thanks to conservation efforts -- have risen from 1,114 in the 1980s to 1,596. But given their slow rate of reproduction and continued threats from development, the researchers from China and Rutgers University warned that a warmer climate could nullify recent gains.¶""The population is thought to be vulnerable to the increasingly warmer and drier climate that is expected to occur in this century,"" the researchers wrote. ""Climate change may reduce significantly both the area of the giant panda habitats and food supplies in panda reserves, jeopardizing their effectiveness to safeguard giant panda populations in the future.""¶More in Climate Change¶With little doubt that temperatures will rise due to growing carbon emissions, researchers suggest that emergency measures be considered to save the panda.¶""We found that climate change would make it increasingly necessary to translocate small populations of pandas from the southwestern to the northwestern part of the current distribution range to ensure population viability,"" they wrote. ""Our results suggest the need for immediate change in current conservation policies and the formulating adaptation plans for giant panda conservation in a changing climate.""¶The study builds on earlier research that raised concerns about the future of pandas in a warmer world.¶Two years, ago, a study in the International Journal of Ecology used two different global climate models to find that more than 16,000 square kilometers of giant panda habitat will likely be lost by 2080. In other words, the researchers suggested that less than half of their habitat would be suitable to live in 70 years.¶ The study also found that habitat fragmentation will likely increase, leading to smaller areas that can support fewer pandas farther away from each other, increasing the risks of inbreeding and population collapse.¶""The question remains as to whether giant pandas will have the capacity and opportunity to shift to new areas should they become viable,"" Melissa Songer, lead author of the paper and an Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute wildlife ecologist, said when the study came out. ""Our work is an important step in developing climate adaptation strategies and in identifying critical areas that will most likely be suitable and accessible for giant pandas in the face of climate change.""¶But other researchers aren't as pessimistic about the future of the panda. In a third study, Michigan State University's Vanessa Hull found that pandas may be more flexible in choosing their habitat than previously believed.¶It has been thought, for example, that pandas demanded a forest with fairly gentle slope (easier to mosey around in while seeking bamboo) at a certain elevation in original, old forest, an abundance of bamboo, and plenty of distance from people. These recommendations, Hull said, come from often scant research because pandas are difficult animals to study. ¶The research published in the journal Ursus in October shows, for instance, that pandas are willing to live in secondary forests -- forests that have been logged and have regrown. They also don't seem as selective about slope, and are willing to climb depending on which of the many varieties of bamboo is growing, or what type of forest it was in. Same for elevation, and the amount of sunshine that hits a piece of panda home.¶""It's exciting to see the flexibility pandas have, or at least see that pandas are choosing areas I didn't think could support them,"" Hull said. ""It gives you hope. They've survived throughout many challenges over so many millions of years, it would be sad to think humans came along and threw it all away. This also suggests we should stay on board and try to make things better for them.""",0

    ","¶Imagine a world where coal is all but banned and the use of gas to fuel economies from China to the United States has been severely curtailed.¶Sound like science fiction?¶It's actually the latest projections from a Nature study out this week on what the world needs to keep global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees C (3.6 degrees F) over what they were in preindustrial times.¶More in Climate Change¶That's the goal that global leaders are expected to agree to when they meet in Paris later this year to sign a deal limiting greenhouse gas emissions starting in 2020. ¶To have a 50 percent chance of achieving this -- and thereby ensure the world averts the worst impacts of climate change, such as widespread droughts, heat waves and flooding -- the study's authors Christophe McGlade and Paul Ekins, of the University College London,  said cumulative emissions would have to be limited to 1,100 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide.¶To make this happen, the authors said the world must take some drastic steps in the next four decades. It would have to keep 82 percent of coal reserves, half of the gas reserves and and a third of oil in the ground. Geographically, that would mean the United States couldn't exploit 92 percent of its coal reserves while China and India couldn't tap 63 percent of their gas reserves.¶While acknowledging this would have ""profound implications for the future utilization of oil, gas and coal,"" the authors didn't touch on how economies especially in the developing world can transition away from their heavy dependence especially on coal. India and China, especially, have shown no inclination to give up coal in the near future.¶They also don't get into what would replace fossil fuels. ¶Previous reports,  including one from the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change last year, called for a shift away from fossil fuels to renewable energy, nuclear power and technologies that capture carbon dioxide emissions.

"Hotter, weirder: How climate change has changed Earth","
","
December 2, 2014 / 8:37 AM
      / AP
    ","¶WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the more than two decades since world leaders first got together to try to solve global warming, life on Earth has changed, not just the climate. It's gotten hotter, more polluted with heat-trapping gases, more crowded and just downright wilder.¶The numbers are stark. Carbon dioxide emissions: up 60 percent. Global temperature: up six-tenths of a degree. Population: up 1.7 billion people. Sea level: up 3 inches. U.S. extreme weather: up 30 percent. Ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica: down 4.9 trillion tons of ice.¶""Simply put, we are rapidly remaking the planet and beginning to suffer the consequences,"" says Michael Oppenheimer, professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University.¶More in Climate Change¶Diplomats from more than 190 nations opened talks Monday at a United Nations global warming conference in Lima, Peru, to pave the way for an international treaty they hope to forge next year.¶To see how much the globe has changed since the first such international conference - the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 - The Associated Press scoured databases from around the world. The analysis, which looked at data since 1983, concentrated on 10-year intervals ending in 1992 and 2013. This is because scientists say single years can be misleading and longer trends are more telling.¶Our changing world by the numbers:¶WILD WEATHER¶Since 1992, there have been more than 6,600 major climate, weather and water disasters worldwide, causing more than $1.6 trillion in damage and killing more than 600,000 people, according to the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters in Belgium, which tracks the world's catastrophes.¶While climate-related, not all can be blamed on man-made warming or climate change. Still, extreme weather has noticeably increased over the years, says Debby Sapir, who runs the center and its database. From 1983 to 1992 the world averaged 147 climate, water and weather disasters each year. Over the past 10 years, that number has jumped to an average 306 a year.¶In the United States, an index of climate extremes - hot and cold, wet and dry - kept by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has jumped 30 percent from 1992 to 2013, not counting hurricanes, based on 10-year averages.¶NOAA also keeps track of U.S. weather disasters that cost more than $1 billion, when adjusted for inflation. Since 1992, there have been 136 such billion-dollar events.¶Worldwide, the 10-year average for weather-related losses adjusted for inflation was $30 billion a year from 1983-92, according to insurance giant Swiss Re. From 2004 to 2013, the cost was more than three times that on average, or $131 billion a year.¶Sapir and others say it would be wrong to pin all, or even most, of these increases on climate change alone. Population and poverty are major factors, too. But they note a trend of growing extremes and more disasters, and that fits with what scientists have long said about global warming.¶It's this increase that's ""far scarier"" than the simple rise in temperatures, University of Illinois climate scientist Donald Wuebbles says.¶TEMPERATURE¶It's almost a sure thing that 2014 will go down as the hottest year in 135 years of record keeping, meteorologists at NOAA's National Climatic Data Center say. If so, this will be the sixth time since 1992 that the world set or tied a new annual record for the warmest year.¶The globe has broken six monthly heat records in 2014 and 47 since 1992. The last monthly cold record set was in 1916.¶So the average annual temperature for 2014 is on track to be about 58.2 degrees (14.6 degrees Celsius), compared with 57.4 degrees (14.1 degrees Celsius) in 1992. The past 10 years have averaged a shade below 58.1 degrees (nearly 14.5 degrees Celsius) - six-tenths of a degree warmer than the average between 1983 and 1992.¶THE OCEANS¶The world's oceans have risen by about 3 inches since 1992 and gotten a tad more acidic - by about half a percent - thanks to chemical reactions caused by the absorption of carbon dioxide, scientists at NOAA and the University of Colorado say.¶Every year sea ice cover shrinks to a yearly minimum size in the Arctic in September - a measurement that is considered a key climate change indicator. From 1983 to 1992, the lowest it got on average was 2.62 million square miles. Now the 10-year average is down to 1.83 million square miles, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center.¶That loss - an average 790,000 square miles since 1992 - overshadows the slight gain in sea ice in Antarctica, which has seen an average gain of 110,000 square miles of sea ice over the past 22 years.¶ON LAND¶The world's population in 1992 was 5.46 billion. Today, it's nearly a third higher, at 7.18 billion. That means more carbon pollution and more people who could be vulnerable to global warming.¶The effects of climate change can be seen in harsher fire seasons. Wildfires in the western United States burned an average of 2.7 million acres each year between 1983 and 1992; now that's up to 7.3 million acres from 1994 to 2013, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.¶And some of the biggest climate change effects on land are near the poles, where people don't often see them. From 1992 to 2011, Greenland's ice sheet lost 3.35 trillion tons of ice, according to calculations made by scientists using measurements from NASA's GRACE satellite. Antarctica lost 1.56 trillion tons of ice over the same period.¶THE AIR¶Scientists simply point to greenhouse gas emissions, mostly carbon dioxide, that form a heat-trapping blanket in our air.¶There's no need to average the yearly amount of carbon dioxide pollution: It has increased steadily, by 60 percent, from 1992 to 2013. In 1992, the world spewed 24.9 billion tons of carbon dioxide; now it is 39.8 billion, according to the Global Carbon Project, an international consortium.¶China has tripled its emissions from 3 billion tons to 11 billion tons a year. The emissions from the U.S. have gone up more slowly, about 6 percent, from 5.4 billion tons to 5.8 billion tons. India also has tripled its emissions, from 860 million tons to 2.6 billion tons. Only European countries have seen their emissions go down, from 4.5 billion tons to 3.8 billion tons.¶WHAT SCIENTISTS SAY¶""Overall, what really strikes me is the missed opportunity,"" Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&M University, said in an email.¶""We knew by the early 1990s that global warming was coming, yet we have done essentially nothing to head off the risk. I think that future generations may be justifiably angry about this.""¶""The numbers don't lie,"" said Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Penn State. ""Greenhouse gases are rising steadily and the cause is fossil fuel burning and other human activities. The globe is warming, ice is melting and our climate is changing as a result.""",0

    ","¶As the annual United Nations climate talks get under way Monday in Peru, global leaders are likely to call out natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy in a bid to rally support for a pact combating global warming.¶But a new study finds that extreme weather - whether it be droughts, floods or heat waves - does little to change attitudes about climate change in the United States.¶Climatic conditions ""only have a negligible effect on perceptions about the seriousness of climate change,"" the researchers wrote in a study published in Global Environmental Change. ""These results suggest that further changes in climatic conditions are unlikely to produce noticeable shifts in Americans' climate change perceptions.""¶More in Climate Change¶Rather, it comes down to personal politics.¶""Our results show that political orientation has the most important effect in shaping public perceptions about the timing and seriousness of climate change,"" ¶Climate change remains one of the most polarizing issues in the United States and surveys have found that Americans are more divided and doubtful about the issue than in other leading countries.¶One survey found that only 46 percent of Americans felt there was serious impact now from climate change and 28 percent felt global warming would have serious impact in the future. Three in four Republicans didn't feel global warming will be a threat to them personally; 56 percent of Democrats felt it would.¶With such divided opinions on the issue, Congress has been unwilling to seriously consider any solutions to combating rising emissions.¶In the Global Environmental Change study, researchers used data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's climate extreme index and Gallup Poll data on climate change. They found no link between exposure to extreme weather and views on global warming.¶""All the authors on the study went in expecting some correlation,"" Michigan State's Aaron M. McCright, one of the authors of the study, told CBS News. ""I certainly thought we would find really warm summers would be related to climate change or really warm winters. I thought we would find a smattering of effect and we didn't find anything.""¶The study also examined earlier research on the issue and came to a similar conclusion. Some of those past studies, McCright said, found a small effect in terms of people ""believing in the reality of climate change."" But they also found the more partisan person was, the less they saw a connection with extreme weather.¶In a separate study in Nature Climate Change that McCright also took part in, researchers found that only 35 percent of Americans believe global warming was the main cause of the abnormally high temperatures during the winter of 2012.¶""Many people already had their minds made up about global warming and this extreme weather was not going to change that,"" McCright said of the winter, which was the fourth warmest winter in the United States dating back to at least 1895.¶ Christopher Warshaw, an assistant professor of political science at MIT who is also studying climate change attitudes, said it made sense that politics trumps almost everything else when it comes to global warming.¶""There is a huge body of scholarship in which people sort of internalize external events through a partisan lens,"" Warshaw said. ""People's views on whether wars are a good idea shift completely when the party in power changes. In some ways, it would be more surprising that climate change didn't work that way.""¶Part of the resistance to changing one's views, Warshaw said, is that action on climate change will require a big role for government which is seen very differently by Democrats and Republicans.¶""Certainly on the left, your ideological predisposition is to support more government action. The fact the government will have to do something about climate change doesn't challenge your prior believes about the role of government in the world,"" he said. ""Whereas if you are conservative, you believe the government shouldn't do much. The fact the government will have to take a lot of action to address climate challenges your core beliefs about the role of government in the world a little bit.""¶Studies have found that extreme weather is expected to become more common and intense in the future. A report out Thursday from the Royal Society, the national academy of science in the United Kingdom, concluded that extreme weather cost $1.4 trillion, total, between 1980 and 2004. Looking ahead, it projected large coastal cities could face a combined cost of $1 trillion each year from flooding by mid-century.¶So if extreme weather won't change views about climate, what will?¶McCright said change would only come on the right when leading Republicans and opinion makers come around to the fact that climate change is real, acknowledge it is caused primarily by humans and start speaking out about it. ¶""We need key members of the Republican party and key Republican media figures to ease up on climate denial a little, just stop denouncing science and scientists and, over time, be more accepting of the science,"" McCright said.¶Warshaw also said it would help if Republicans saw an economic cost to inaction or see the solutions to reducing carbon emissions as being relatively cheap.¶""As the costs of wind power and solar power becomes cheaper to address climate change, I think public opinion on taking action on climate change will change,"" he said. ""People are attentive to cost.""",0

To them, reducing coal and oil = Big Brother.¶The film points to the origins of this pundit class in the late 1950s, within the PR efforts of the tobacco companies, whose secret documents (revealed by whistleblowers or as evidence in lawsuits) detailed the playbook that a company peddling a hazardous product should follow to avoid financial ruin: cast doubt upon medical research (or even produce studies of your own); warn against the economic impacts in terms of job losses; rail against regulations as government overreach impinging upon people's liberties (it doesn't hurt to liberally throw the terms ""Socialist"" or ""Communist"" around); and make the culprit in any public health issue the consumer, as a matter of ""personal responsibility."" ¶With the tobacco industry's success in the 1960s at forestalling government regulations to ban smoking or to punish tobacco companies selling an addictive substance, other industries thought, hey, if it worked for them ...¶And so trade groups and industry flacks began PR offenses to beat back changes in law. For flame retardants in furniture, a doctor testified before government committees about several babies he'd treated who'd been tragically burned in crib fires. The doctor later admitted to a reporter that he'd made it all up, but that (as a paid spokesperson for the chemical industry), he wanted to tell ""emotional"" stories that would convey the seriousness of the risks involved.¶Fred Singer, of the Heartland institute (a libertarian think tank funded in part by Exxon), is a well-known climate change denier who for years has called scientific evidence of a warming planet a lie. He proudly displays the publications his group produces that mimic actual scientific publications but which are meant to confuse Congressmen.¶Also interviewed is Marc Morano, a former producer for Rush Limbaugh and staffer for James Inhofe (a major climate change denier in the Senate), who specializes in spin. He proudly tells Kenner about his role in ""creating chaos"" through on-air debates with actual scientists; and he shows no remorse for the public attacks he launched against NOAA scientist James Hansen, who was among the first to warn of the dangers of CO2 pollution to irreversibly affect the Earth's climate. Morano laughs off having sent or encouraged threats of violence to Hansen, saying he's entertained by reading the threats he receives.¶And when South Carolina Republican Bob Inglis, a staunch denier of climate change, had a change of heart after studying the data and effects in Antarctica, the Koch Brothers-backed Americans for Prosperity pulled out the stops, sending him to a Tea Party-enabled primary defeat. Inglis now appears on right-wing talk shows trying to convince deniers that the facts do not support them. ¶Kenner's filmmaking is fluid, frightening, and -- hopefully -- will wake up people to the hazards of punditry (or better yet, wake up the bookers of news shows).  ¶Following an Academy Award-qualifying run in Los Angeles, later this year, ""Merchants of Doubt"" will be released by Sony Pictures Classics in March 2015. Running time: 1:36. The film has not yet been rated. ¶To watch a clip from ""Merchants of Doubt,"" featuring science historian Naomi Oreskes, click on the video player below. ¶For more info:¶More reviews from the 2014 New York Film Festival:",0
