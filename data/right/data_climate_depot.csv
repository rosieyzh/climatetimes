Excerpt: “The damage caused by catastrophic “superstorms” combined with rising sea levels could increase by a hundred-fold or more, displacing hundreds of millions of people from coastlines around the world unless more is done to limit greenhouse gas emissions, according to a draft report by the United Nations.”

Climate Depot note: “When current reality fails to alarm, make scarier and scarier predictions of the future. The UN is timing these latest “predictions” to the NYC UN summit featuring teen activist Greta Thunberg.”

Reality Check: Sea level expert Geologist Dr. Nils-Axel Mörner ridiculed the claim in Al Gore’s An Inconvenient Truth that Florida would be half covered by rising seas. “These are models. They are doing it wrongly, and this is lobbying. Geologic facts are on one side, lobbying and models are on the other side.” Morner added, “The rapid rise in sea levels predicted by computer models simply cannot happen.” …

Geologist Dr. Don Easterbrook: “If you look at the total global sea level from about 1850 until the present time it’s been rising at a fairly constant rate, rather slow—about 7 inches a century…. It’s about 1 to 2 mm a year so if you’re 50 years old you experienced a sea level rise about 3 ½ inches and you probably didn’t even notice it,”

Former NASA Climatologist Dr. Roy Spencer: “Sea level rise, which was occurring long before humans could be blamed, has not accelerated and still amounts to only 1 inch every 10 years.” … Spencer on Miami flooding: “That flooding is mostly a combination of (1) natural sea level rise (I show there has been no acceleration of sea level rise beyond what was already happening since the 1800s), and (2) satellite-measured sinking of the reclaimed swamps that have been built upon for over 100 years in Miami Beach.”

U. Penn Geologist Dr. Robert Giegengack explains, “At the present rate of sea-level rise it’s going to take 3,500 years to get up there [to Gore’s predicted rise of 20 feet]. So if for some reason this warming process that melts ice is cutting loose and accelerating, sea level doesn’t know it. And sea level, we think, is the best indicator of global warming.”",1

1) NASA: Global Wildfires Drop By 25% Since 2003

NASA Earth Observatory, August 2019

Since NASA satellites programme MODIS began collecting measurements there has been a decrease in the total number of square kilometers burned each year. Between 2003 and 2019, that number has dropped by roughly 25 percent.

The control of fire is a goal that may well be as old as humanity, but the systematic monitoring of fire on a global scale is a much newer capability.

In the 1910s, the U.S. Forest Service began building fire lookout towers on mountain peaks in order to detect distant fires. A few decades later, fire-spotting airplanes flew onto the scene. Then in the early 1980s, satellites began to map fires over large areas from the vantage point of space.

Over time, researchers have built a rich and textured record of Earth’s fire activity and are now able to analyze decadal trends. “The pace of discovery has increased dramatically during the satellite era,” said James Randerson, a scientist at the University of California, Irvine. “Having high-quality, daily observations of fires available on a global scale has been critical.”

The animation above shows the locations of actively burning fires on a monthly basis for nearly two decades. The maps are based on observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Terra satellite. The colors are based on a count of the number (not size) of fires observed within a 1,000-square-kilometer area. White pixels show the high end of the count—as many as 30 fires in a 1,000-square-kilometer area per day. Orange pixels show as many as 10 fires, while red areas show as few as 1 fire per day.



December 1, 2014 – August 31, 2015

The sequence highlights the rhythms—both natural and human-caused—in global fire activity. Bands of fire sweep across Eurasia, North America, and Southeast Asia as farmers clear and maintain fields in April and May. Summer brings new activity in boreal and temperate forests in North America and Eurasia due to lighting-triggered fires burning in remote areas. In the tropical forests of South America and equatorial Asia, fires flare up in August, September, and October as people make use of the dry season to clear rainforest and savanna, as well as stop trees and shrubs from encroaching on already cleared land. Few months pass in Australia without large numbers of fires burning somewhere on the continent’s vast grasslands, savannas, and tropical forests.

But it is Africa that is truly the fire continent. On an average day in August, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers (MODIS) on NASA’s Aqua and Terra satellites detect 10,000 actively burning fires around the world—and 70 percent them happen in Africa. Huge numbers of blazes spring up in the northern part of continent in December and January. A half year later, the burning has shifted south. Indeed, global fire emissions typically peak in August and September, coinciding with the main fire seasons of the Southern Hemisphere, particularly Africa. (High activity in temperate and boreal forests in the Northern Hemisphere in the summer also contribute.)



August 29, 2018 JPEG

The second animation underscores how much fire activity shifts seasonally by highlighting burning activity during December 2014, April 2015, and August 2015. The satellite image above shows smoke rising from the savanna of northern Zambia on August 29, 2018, around the time global emissions reach their maximum.

Though Africa dominates in the sheer number of fires, fires seasons there are pretty consistent from year-to-year. The most variable fire seasons happen elsewhere, such as the tropical forests of South America and equatorial Asia. In these areas, the severity of fire season is often linked to cycles of El Niño and La Niña. The buildup of warm water in the eastern Pacific during an El Niño changes atmospheric patterns and reduces rainfallover many rainforests, allowing them to burn more easily and widely.

Despite the vast quantities of carbon released by fires in savannas, grasslands, and boreal forests, research shows that fires in these biomes do not generally add carbon to the atmosphere in the long term. The regrowth of vegetation or the creation of charcoal typically recaptures all of the carbon within months or years. However, when fires permanently remove trees or burn through peat (a carbon-rich fuel that can take centuries to form), little carbon is recaptured and the atmosphere sees a net increase in CO 2 .

That is why outbreaks of fire in countries with large amounts of peat, such as Indonesia, have an outsized effect on global climate. Fires in equatorial Asia account for just 0.6 percent of global burned area, yet the region accounts for 8 percent of carbon emissions and 23 percent of methane emissions. On October, 25, 2015, the Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera aboard the DSCOVR satellite acquired an image (below) of heavy smoke over Indonesia; El Niño was particularly active at the time.

One of the most interesting things researchers have discovered since MODIS began collecting measurements, noted Randerson, is a decrease in the total number of square kilometers burned each year. Between 2003 and 2019, that number has dropped by roughly 25 percent.

2) Science Goes Up In Rain Forest Smoke

Dr David Whitehouse, GWPF Science Editor, 28 August 2019

If journalists as well as politicians, celebrities, presidents and the Pope can so easily slip into scientific myth and get the facts so wrong what credibility do they have on other issues of climate science?

The idea that the Amazon rain forest are the lungs of the world is so embedded in our minds that few questioned its widespread use when news about fires in the Amazon was reported this summer. The idea is everywhere – so it’s obviously true. Trees absorb carbon dioxide (bad), don’t they, and give off oxygen (good), and there are billions of trees in the Amazon, so surely it makes sense.

Responding to the fires in the Amazon the Pope has said that the, “Lungs of the forest are vital for the planet.” Emmanuel Macron tweeted, “The Amazon rain forest – the lungs which produces 20% of the planet’s oxygen – is on fire.” Leonardo DiCaprio has almost 3 million likes for his Instagram posting saying, “The lungs of the Earth are in flames.” Christiano Ronaldo tweeted that The Amazon Rainforest produces more than 20% of the world’s oxygen,” adding #prayforamazonia

Green Party MP Caroline Lucas says “It’s the lungs of the Earth…which provides 20% of our oxygen.” Barry Gardiner Shadow Minister for International Climate Change tweeted he couldn’t agree with Macron more. Lib Dem MEP’s say the lungs of our planet are literally burning. Even Donald Tusk, the President of the European Commission tweeted of “…the destruction of the green lungs of Planet Earth.”

The Rainforest Alliance say, “The lungs of the world are in flames.” Friends of the Earth want a deal to stop the fires adding, “They need to say ‘we won’t do a deal with you if you are effectively condoning burning the lungs of the world’.” WWF says the Amazon is popularly known as the lungs of the world. DiCaprio’s Earth Alliance has formed an emergency Amazon Forest Fund with an initial commitment of $5 million to focus critical resources on the key protections needed to maintain the ‘lungs of the planet.’

However, as the saying goes, it’s not that simple – things never are in science. Check where the figure comes from (and it’s actually not that straightforward to do) and you will find that it’s not that simple. It’s actually wrong.

Geology’s Gift

The Amazon rain forest is not the lungs of the world and they do not produce 20% of the world’s oxygen as is so often said. The Amazon rainforest is a vast, vital wonder, full of biodiversity and photosynthesizing plants producing 9% of the world’s photosynthetic output but, here is the key figure, 0% of its net output.

You could destroy all of the world’s forests and it would hardly affect our oxygen supply. In fact you could destroy every living thing on Earth and still not dent it because our atmosphere of 20.9% oxygen is the gift of geologic time, slow to build up and we have enough to last millions of years.

Yet this idea of the world’s lungs and of atmospheric oxygen needing to be refreshed and replenished, ideas unsupported by science, is everywhere.

Surely journalists would act differently from advocacy groups, celebrities and politicians and check this fact before writing and broadcasting about it. After all journalists, especially science and environment journalists who are experts in their field, always check figures and statistics? Oh no, they don’t. Just Google the phrase to see how many time it is repeated, by the BBC, the New York Times, CNN, The Australian, to name a few.

ITN in particular has risen above much of the other coverage with its over-the-top reporting. They say the Amazon is burning on a scale never seen before (nonsense). That the Amazon can never be replaced (nonsense), and that Nature is being killed (Oh come off it)!

Who spoke up?

If journalists as well as politicians, celebrities, presidents and the Pope can so easily slip into such scientific myth and get the facts so wrong what credibility do they have on other issues of climate science? Where are their science advisors? Surely they should make this mistake only once before being given proper advice. Or is it that if any of them goes against the trend they fear the condemnation? This is not the way to tackle the important environmental issues we face.

Look how much we had to go through for science to wrench our minds free of what is “obviously true” and seek proof. Is climate science, or at least the public side of it, immune from normal scientific standards? And where are the high profile, “public” scientists setting the record straight, highlighting that the Amazon rain forests are not the lungs of the world?

3) Reality Check: Forests Make a Comeback

American Institute for Economic Research, 26 August 2019

Vincent Geloso

In the last week, there have been many reports about the fires in the Amazonian forests. Many of these reports led news shows or were on the front pages of leading newspapers. The Amazon forest, which produces about 20% of earth’s oxygen and is the world’s largest rainforest, is often referred to as “the planet’s lungs.” The nickname strikes the imagination and it is frequently used in campaigns regarding the perils of deforestation. As such, the news reports about the fire strike a fear that one of the last great forests is disappearing.

That’s completely untrue. Forests are making a comeback! More precisely, the tree cover of the planet is increasing. To be sure, it is nowhere near what it was at the beginning of the 19th century when the world’s population was below 1 billion individuals (most of whom were abjectly poor). Indeed, many forests on the planet were destroyed and cleared as population grew in number and wealth. However, globally speaking, the tree cover has begun to recover.

Since 1982, a recent peer-reviewed paper in Nature suggests, the planet’s tree cover increased by 2.24 million km2 (an increase of roughly 7%).

The transition also differs by region as some countries saw a recovery of forest much earlier. Many European countries saw the beginning of this recovery in the early decades of the twentieth century (and some began the transition much earlier). For the United States, there are some studies placing the beginning of the recovery in the 1930s but many states (especially in New England and the Middle Atlantic states) saw their forest recoveries begin as early as 1907. To be sure, some regions on Earth are experiencing falls in forest cover. This is the case for Brazil and many other Latin American countries (not all as Chile and Uruguay have already seen their forest recoveries begin). Nevertheless, the global picture is one of optimism.

And there is cause for being optimistic that the trend will continue.

Geographer Pierre Desrochers and economist Hiroko Shimizu noted that nine-tenths of all the deforestation caused by humans took place before 1950. The main reason for this was that forest-clearing was one of the easiest channels by which to increase the food supply while also providing energy.

However, as we are now vastly more productive in our agriculture, we require less land to feed the same population. The effects of productivity growth in agriculture are so strong that some agricultural scientists are speaking of “peak farmland” – the idea that we will need less and less land to feed a growing population.

Moreover, as transports and communication technologies have also improved, we have been able to concentrate production in the most productive areas of the planet in ways that explain a sizable share of total gains in productivity. As we grow more productive in farming, mankind can now leave some acres to return to nature to be reforested. With the prospect of new advances in bio-engineering, meat printing, sky-farms and other innovations, this is a force for reforestation that will only strengthen.

4) Matt Ridley: The Most Dangerous Thing About The Amazon Fires Is The Apocalyptic Rhetoric

The Spectator, 31 August 2019

Cristiano Ronaldo is a Portuguese expert on forests who also plays football, so when he shared a picture online of a recent forest fire in the Amazon, it went viral. Perhaps he was in a rush that day to get out of the laboratory to football training, because it later transpired that the photograph was actually taken in 2013, not this year, and in southern Brazil, nowhere near the Amazon.

But at least his picture was only six years old. Emmanuel Macron, another forest ecologist who moonlights as president of France, claimed that ‘the Amazon rainforest — the lungs which produce 20 per cent of our planet’s oxygen — is on fire!’ alongside a picture that was 20 years old. A third bioscientist, who goes under the name of Madonna and sings, capped both their achievements by sharing a 30-year-old picture. […]

Around the world, wild fires are generally declining, according to Nasa. Deforestation, too, is happening less and less. The United Nations’ ‘state of the world’s forests’report concluded last year that ‘the net loss of forest area continues to slow, from 0.18 per cent [a year] in the 1990s to 0.08 per cent over the last five-year period’. A study in Nature last year by scientists from the University of Maryland concluded that even this is too pessimistic: ‘We show that — contrary to the prevailing view that forest area has declined globally — tree cover has increased by 2.24 million km2 (+7.1 per cent relative to the 1982 level).’

This net increase is driven by rapid reforestation in cool, rich countries outweighing slower net deforestation in warm, poor countries. But more and more nations are now reaching the sort of income levels at which they stop deforesting and start reforesting. Bangladesh, for example, has been increasing its forest cover for several years. Costa Rica has doubled its tree cover in 40 years. Brazil is poised to join the reforesters soon.

Possibly the biggest driver of this encouraging trend is the rising productivity of agriculture. The more yields increase, the less land we need to steal from nature to feed ourselves. Jesse Ausubel of Rockefeller University has calculated that the world needs only 35 per cent as much land to produce a given quantity of food as 50 years ago. That has spared wild land on a massive scale.

Likewise, getting people on to fossil fuels and away from burning wood for fuel spares trees. It is in the poorest countries, mainly in Africa, that men and women still gather firewood for cooking and bushmeat for food, instead of using electricity or gas and farmed meat.

The trouble with the apocalyptic rhetoric is that it can seem to justify drastic but dangerous solutions. The obsession with climate change has slowed the decline of deforestation. An estimated 700,000 hectares of forest has been felled in South-East Asia to grow palm oil to add to supposedly green ‘bio-diesel’ fuel in Europe, while the world is feeding 5 per cent of its grain crop to motor cars rather than people, which means 5 per cent of cultivated land that could be released for forest. Britain imports timber from wild forests in the Americas to burn for electricity at Drax in North Yorkshire, depriving beetles and woodpeckers of their lunch.

5) U.S. Democrats Are Getting More Concerned About Global Warming, Republicans Remain Cool

Pew Research Center, 28 August 2019

Brian Kennedy and Med Hefferon

The share of Americans calling global climate change a major threat to the well-being of the United States has grown from 40% in 2013 to 57% this year, Pew Research Center surveys have shown. But the rise in concern has largely come from Democrats. Opinions among Republicans on this issue remain largely unchanged.

Among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents overall, 84% say climate change is a major threat to the country’s well-being as of July 2019, up from 58% in a March 2013 survey. Views among Republicans and Republican leaners have stayed about the same (27% in 2019 vs. 22% in 2013).

Nearly all liberal Democrats (94%, including independents who lean to the party) consider climate change a major threat to the nation now, up 30 percentage points from 2013. Three-quarters of moderate/conservative Democrats say the same, up from 54% in 2013.

By contrast, there has been no significant change among either moderate or conservative Republicans on this issue. (While the share of moderate/liberal Republicans who see climate change as a major threat is up 9 percentage points since 2013, this change is not statistically significant at the 95% confidence level.)

The partisan trend is similar on a related question. More Americans said in January 2019 that dealing with global climate change should be a top priority for Congress and the president (44%) than did so in early 2015 (34%). But the increased interest in prioritizing climate policy stems from Democrats, not Republicans.

Two-thirds of Democrats (67%), including 83% of liberal Democrats, said this year that dealing with global climate change should be a top priority for the president and Congress. This was up from 46% of Democrats in 2015.

In contrast, about two-in-ten Republicans (21%) said this year that climate change should be a top priority – a virtually identical share as in 2015 (19%).

6) Sanjeev Sabhlok: Climate Hysteria Is A Great Opportunity To Teach Children To Ask Questions

Times of India, 25 August 2019

Only when our children have developed the strongest possible level of scepticism, first introduced to the world by Charvaka and later emulated by Socrates, can they be said to have been educated.

Most adults have little or no time to investigate the claims about climate change. They either accept them, assuming that “authority figures” have done their homework, or sit on the fence.

Some consider that only scientists are supposed to understand science. But everyone has an equal place at the table of science and if our questions are not answered or the evidence doesn’t stack up, we are free to reject that “science”.

Climate alarm has long given up the pretence of any link to science. Millions have been successfully “converted” – and they get duly worked up if their belief is questioned: “have you been outside recently?”, “erratic climate events are everywhere!”, “rainfall is getting less every year!”, “flash floods, including in Rajasthan are clear proof!”.

Some of them have gone to the next stage and become missionaries. They go about distributing their religious pamphlets in schools, indoctrinating innocent lower-IQ children. Hopelessly confused children like Greta Thunberg are being churned out as a result. At an age when children like her should be learning to ask questions, they have become the brainwashed front for the climate religion. …

Sanjeev Sabhlok, Senior leader of India’s Liberal Party (SBP)

In my view, if anyone tells a child that climate change is man-made just because someone says so (such as a missionary “scientist” but now increasingly, “royals” and “celebrities”), that person has committed a sin against the enlightenment, against human progress.

I would personally have been supportive of Greta Thunberg if she had been a prodigally intelligent child who dazzled her teachers with amazing questions, then found the answers and was now promoting a view that she thoroughly understood. It would not matter to me that she had come to the wrong conclusion. After all, no one can be right on everything all the time. But she suffers, sadly, from mental issues and speaks as a missionary – she cannot answer a single question about the science.

We are very prone as a species to superstitions, panics, delusions, manias and hysterias. We have gone through thousands of them (many still underway), such as religion, alchemy, witchcraft, astrology, phrenology, eugenics, the Y2K bug, the SARS panic, much of Ayurveda and Chinese traditional medicine and all of homeopathy.

The climate hysteria will ultimately pass, but to avoid such hysterias in the future we need to get our children to start thinking and stop believing. Climate change is a superb topic for teachers and students to explore.

I stumbled upon the ideas of Socrates and Voltaire when I was a child and since the age of twelve, I have been a deep sceptic. “God” would have to pass through a thousand hurdles if “He” came by and tried to make me believe. For example, I recall being the only one staring into the eyes of Sathya Sai Baba in Bangalore in 1981 when all others had prostrated themselves before him. He obviously failed to pull a fast one over me. Today, Michael Strong, author of The Habit of Thought, is one of the few educationists who actively uses the Socratic method. Our educationists must learn from him.

I believe that children from age 10 onwards should attend one class each week only on questions. They should list various topics and then ask as many questions as they can on that topic. As they grow older their ability to ask questions will get deeper and more sophisticated.

The topic of climate change can lead to many questions. What is climate? What factors impact the climate? (Answer: at least a few hundred). How is the Earth’s temperature measured? (Long-term quality thermometer measurements have only been available in a few European and American sites, with most of them now contaminated by urbanisation. Let children also ask about satellite measurements and about the only reliable surface measurements – from the US Climate Reference Network.)

How is the sea level measured? (Let them ask whether the land itself can sink – indeed it does: it is very common.) What is the proof of the greenhouse gas effect? (Let them ask and find out that there is no robust way to prove it in a laboratory.) How is CO2 measured?

What information is needed to confirm (or reject) the CO2 hypothesis? What is the correlation between CO2 and temperature over the recent past? (Answer: very little.) What is the correlation as we stretch out to hundreds and then millions of years? (Answer: zero.) What climate “model” predictions could prove the hypothesis? What would nullify it?

What are the strengths and weaknesses of temperature and CO2 estimates of the past? (Eg tree rings, ice core, marine sediments, pollen. Tree ring data is a better measure of rainfall than of temperature, ice cores show that CO2 increased when the Earth’s wobbles first made it warmer – CO2 was thereafter ejected from the oceans.)

Are extreme events increasing? Let the children read IPCC’s reports that say: “there is only low confidence regarding changes in global tropical cyclone numbers over the last four decades”, there is “low confidence that anthropogenic climate change has affected the frequency and the magnitude of floods” and that there is a “decreasing trend in the global number of tropical cyclones and globally accumulated cyclonic energy”.

EXPERTS believe they have found the burial site of the largest child sacrifice ritual ever recorded.

The skeletons of 227 kids, who were slaughtered at the same time, have been uncovered in a mass grave on the north coast of Peru.

Archaeologists believe the kids, born into the Chimú empire, were sacrificed in a ritual to stop disasters linked to the El Niño phenomenon.

The youngsters, between the ages of four and 14, are understood to have been brutally killed up to 1,400 years ago.

Some still have skin, hair and were found to have been wearing silver earmuffs.

The religious leaders who carried out the killings were part of the Chimú empire, a powerful society that predated the Incas.

Archaeologists found the mass slaughter site in the Pampa La Cruz sector in Huanchaco, a coastal municipality of Trujillo, north of Lima.

“We are the largest place where remains of sacrificed children have been found. There is no other” in the world, archaeologist Feren Castillo told AFP.

It is thought the youngsters were sacrificed to appease gods and stop bad weather.

“They were sacrificed to appease the El Niño phenomenon, we have found more evidence of rainfall in the findings,” Mr Castillo added.

This weather phenomenon, which occurs when the Pacific Ocean becomes very warm, can have disastrous impacts in Peru and other countries.

In 2017, El Niño triggered flooding and landslides that killed 162 and destroyed thousands of homes.

The Huanchaco child grave is not the first mass discovery of kids slaughtered in Pampa La Cruz.

In June 2018, remains of 56 children were discovered.

Awesome! U.S. Navy Shut Down Climate Change Task Force established by Obama,,2019-08-28 00:00:00,"The U.S. Navy shut down its Task Force Climate Change (TFCC), which was established by President Barack Obama in 2009, reported E&E News’ Greenwire.

The closure was quiet and occurred in March, according to Greenwire, and “the group’s tab on the Navy’s energy, environment and climate change website was removed sometime between March and July.”

The purpose of the TFCC was to evaluate how climate change affects or could affect Naval and national security operations.

Retired Navy Rear Admiral Jon White, who ran the TFCC under the Obama administration from 2012 to 2015, said the shut down was “suspicious.”

“It was a very quiet canceling of the task force,” he told E&E News. “I didn’t know about it; no one told me. Usually, when you stand down a task force, you want to be able to go in there and declare victory.”

“It all goes back to the White House,” said the rear admiral. “That’s what changed, the White House.”

Alice Hill, a member of the National Security Council in the Obama administration, indicated the closure of the TFCC has a lot to do “with a pattern of climate change denial in President Trump’s administration,” reported Greenwire.

“It’s consistent with the patterns we’ve seen: Efforts with the title ‘climate change’ have either been suspended or renamed,” said Hill. “By not mentioning climate change, we are signaling the events that we’re experiencing now, the impacts, are not something that immediately needs to be attended to and planned for.”",1
"Climate Change Could Leave Obama’s Possible New Mansion Underwater, According To Researchers Funded By Obama Admin",,2019-08-26 00:00:00,"Former President Barack Obama’s possible new mansion on Martha’s Vineyard could be totally underwater by the year 2100, according to a climate change model relying on government data.

The Obamas are reportedly in the process of buying the island property, which was originally listed at listed at $14,850,000, from Boston Celtics owner Wyc Grousbeck. Though the deal has yet to be finalized, both TMZ and the Boston Herald have reported that the Obamas are in escrow.

Climate Central, a research group funded by the government during the Obama administration, projects the Obamas’ possible new mansion to be well underwater in its “Extreme Scenario 2100” model.

Climate Central allows users to map the group’s model over Google Earth to see what flooding in specific areas could look like by the year 2100.

The Daily Caller News Foundation plugged the street address of the Obamas’ possible new mansion into the model, which projects the waterline to have advanced well past the property’s house and private beach footpath by 2100.

Climate Central’s model is based off of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) “extreme rise” scenario, which Climate Central described as “unlikely but increasingly plausible” in an April 2017 report.

Climate Central’s less pessimistic models still paint bleak pictures for the future of Obama’s potential new property.

The research group’s “Unchecked pollution” model shows the waterline approaching where the house would be on the map. Even the “Sharp carbon cuts” model shows the waterline surpassing the private beach, encroaching into the tree line.

The National Science Foundation (NSF), a federal agency, provided grants to Climate Central in 2009 and 2014, prompting criticism from Republican lawmakers at the time.

The New York Times has repeatedly leaned on Climate Central’s data in reporting on the environment. (RELATED: Bernie Sanders, Climate Hawk, Spends Nearly $300K On Private Jet Travel In Month)

The NYT cited Climate Center data in a compilation of graphs meant to be used as teaching resources in schools, published in February.

“In many coastal states, flood-prone areas have seen the highest rates of home construction since 2010, a study found, suggesting that the risks of climate change have yet to fundamentally change people’s behavior,” read a July NYT article, citing Climate Central.

“Washington, D.C., for example, may well be a flood zone by 2100,” the NYT reported in September 2014, linking to Climate Central’s data.

Neither Obama’s personal office nor Climate Central returned emails seeking comment for this article.

The myth of ecocide,"Brendan O'Neill, Joshua Crosby, Peter Jenkins, Jerry Owen, Winston Stanley, Puddy Cat, Chris Ray, H Mclean, Zenobia Palmyra, Ed Turnbull",2019-08-27 00:00:00,"So now we know: the idea that the Amazon rainforest is burning on an unprecedented scale and that these fires will rob humanity of one of its key sources of oxygen is fake news. It is hard to think of any other global event this year that has been as awash with misinformation as the rainforest fires. We’ve been told these fires are a calamity, an act of ‘ecocide’; they’re proof of humanity’s contempt for the environment; they will blacken and possibly even destroy ‘the lungs of the world’, as the rainforests are referred to, given they produce 20 per cent of the world’s oxygen. It’s all untrue. We are being misled.

Everything – from the photos of fires being shared by heartbroken celebs to the wild claims about these fires harming the whole of humanity – is false. Some of the photos of the fires being tearfully shared on social media are 10 or 20 years old. Many are not pictures of the Amazon at all. Some are from south Brazil, others from India and Sweden. The idea that millions of glorious, oxygen-producing trees are been burnt to a cinder by evil humans is nonsense, too. To the extent that there has been an increase in fires in the Amazon – and this itself is a deceptive claim – many of this year’s new fires are of dry scrubland, where trees have already been felled. It is untrue that the fires are historically huge or unprecedented. NASA says the Amazon fires are ‘slightly below average this year’. Many are pointing out that we are witnessing the highest number of fires in the Amazon for seven years. But as meteorologist Jesse Ferrell reports, prior to 2012 there were many years in which the Amazon had worse fires than this year’s: 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2010. As Ferrell says, there are always fires on Earth: ‘Thousands of fires are continually burning across the Earth every day of every year, and they always have.’ The idea that what is currently happening in the Amazon is shockingly unusual or apocalyptic or proof of man’s fascistic disdain for his environment is an entirely politicised interpretation of a perfectly normal event.

The claim that the Amazon rainforest is the ‘lungs of the world’, producing 20 per cent of the Earth’s oxygen, is also bunkum. It has been cited everywhere, by people who want us to believe that these fires will have a dire impact on all of humanity and perhaps on the very survival of our species. But as even the Guardian felt moved to report, ‘it is not clear where this figure originated’. Climate expert Michael Mann says ‘the true figure is likely to be no more than six per cent’. The Guardian also points out that the crops being planted in place of felled trees in the Amazon – by farmers who are talked about as pure evil by Western greens – will also produce oxygen, and ‘quite likely at higher levels’ than the trees they replace. So the ‘oxygen crisis’ is complete fantasy. More broadly, it simply isn’t true that mankind is at war with forestland. As made clear by a substantial report in Nature, published last year, the world’s tree cover has increased over the past 35 years. In three decades, 2.24million square kilometres of trees – an area the size of Texas and Alaska combined – have been added to the world’s already existing tree-covered land. The study, involving satellite analysis of the Earth from 1982 to 2016, found that while there has been some tree loss in subtropical areas, this has been ‘outweighed by tree-cover gain in subtropical, temperate, boreal, and polar regions’. Part of this vast expansion is down to China’s historic tree-planting programme. The UN refers to it as mankind’s largest ‘tree-planting crusade’, in which China’s forest coverage has increased from 8.6 per cent in 1949 to 21 per cent in 2017. So much for the Chinese being evil polluters. All these new trees to have swarmed the Earth since 1982 will be producing oxygen, so the apocalyptic Western middle-classes can calm down about not being able to breathe.

In the words of Michael Shellenberger, one of the critical voices on the increasingly hysterical discussion of the rainforest fires, ‘Everything they say about the Amazon… is wrong’. Out-of-control fires, trees disappearing, oxygen in crisis, the climate being pushed to the edge – it is all wrong, all based in fear, not facts. Perhaps the most destructive myth is that Brazilians and others are engaged in ‘ecocide’. This emotive word, cynically designed to invoke thoughts of the evil of genocide, is designed to demonise human activity that impacts on the environment. It is motored by an arrogant, intolerant view among Western greens in particular that says people in the developing world who do what we have already done – fell forests, clear land for agriculture, elevate human needs over a sanctified view of nature – are guilty of a crime and deserve to be punished.

There is a neo-colonial instinct behind this accusation. It is a slur wielded by privileged Westerners who have already benefited from industrial revolutions and decades of modernisation against emergent economic powerhouses who want to do likewise: Brazil, China, India. Worse, it sets these nations up for outside intervention. The G7 has already agreed to send resources to resolve the rainforest fires, and some Western greens are fantasising about armed forces – ‘green helmets’ – going around the world to save nature from the destructive activity of the developing world’s inhabitants. What an ugly, borderline imperialist notion. The global condescension of the modern environmentalist movement is captured perfectly in this suggestion that we should treat foreigners as criminals simply because they want what we already have.

L A Times anti-science propaganda campaign hyping Amazon fires,Guest Blogger,2019-08-27 00:00:00,"Guest essay by Larry Hamlin

The L A Times is at it again pushing climate alarmist propaganda distortion, deception and dishonesty hyping the recent fires burning in the Amazon region.

The Times reporter drones on about the magnitude of deforestation underway in the Amazon with the following inaccurate and hyped discussion:

“Flames are spreading across the Amazon rainforest this summer, spewing millions of tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each day. But scientists say that’s not their biggest concern. They’re far more worried about what the fires represent: a dramatic increase in illegal deforestation that could deprive the world of a critical buffer against climate change.

More than a soccer field’s worth of Amazon forest is falling every minute, according to Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research, known as INPE. Preliminary estimates from satellite data revealed that deforestation in June rose almost 90% compared with the same month last year, and by 280% in July.

The Amazon is a key component of Earth’s climate system. It holds about a quarter as much carbon as the entire atmosphere and single-handedly absorbs about 5% of all the CO 2 we emit each year.

But if such rapid deforestation continues, it will foil efforts to keep global temperatures in check. Scientists fear parts of the Amazon could pass a critical threshold and transform from a lush rainforest into a dry, woody grassland. And that could bring catastrophic consequences not only for people in South America, but also for everyone around the world.”

The Times presents its “scientific evidence” of the grave “tipping point” increases in deforestation underway with the following graph:

But as always with the dishonesty of alarmism fabricated by the L A Times reality presents a quite different picture when a more complete analysis is undertaken with the result clearly demonstrating the propaganda focused objective of the Times.

A more complete and objective assessment of the deforestation issues in the Brazilian Amazon provided by another article shows a much more comprehensive picture of the history of declining deforestation that was astoundingly ignored by the alarmist Times as noted below.

The article notes:

“Interestingly, when NASA released the satellite image on August 21, it noted that “it is not unusual to see fires in Brazil at this time of year due to high temperatures and low humidity. Time will tell if this year is a record breaking or just within normal limits.”

So why are there so many fires? “Natural fires in the Amazon are rare, and the majority of these fires were set by farmers preparing Amazon-adjacent farmland for next year’s crops and pasture,” soberly explains The New York Times. “Much of the land that is burning was not old-growth rain forest, but land that had already been cleared of trees and set for agricultural use.”

It is routine for farmers and ranchers in tropical areas burn their fields to control pests and weeds and to encourage new growth in pastures.

What about deforestation trends? Since the right-wing nationalist Jair Bolsonaro became Brazil’s president, rainforest deforestation rates have increased a bit, but they are still way below their earlier highs.”

So once again we have the L A Times fabricating phony alarmist issues and making false claims based upon its complete lack of honest news integrity while displaying its total focus on manufacturing alarmism propaganda.

Forbes published an article addressing the fact that just about every hyped up account of these fires is wrong.

The article chastised at length the unjustified alarmist news coverage and provided a graph that puts the recent number of fires in perspective.

The article offered the following enlightening discussion about the absurd alarmist campaign present in much of the world’s media regarding these fires:

“One of Brazil’s leading environmental journalists agrees that media coverage of the fires has been misleading. “It was under [Workers Party President] Lula and [Environment Secretary] Marina Silva (2003-2008) that Brazil had the highest incidence of burning,” Leonardo Coutinho told me over email. “But neither Lula nor Marina was accused of putting the Amazon at risk.”

Coutinho’s perspective was shaped by reporting on the ground in the Amazon for Veja, Brazil’s leading news magazine, for nearly a decade. By contrast, many of the correspondents reporting on the fires have been doing so from the cosmopolitan cities of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, which are 2,500 miles and four hours by jet plane away.

“What is happening in the Amazon is not exceptional,” said Coutinho. “Take a look at Google web searches search for ‘Amazon’ and ‘Amazon Forest’ over time. Global public opinion was not as interested in the ‘Amazon tragedy’ when the situation was undeniably worse. The present moment does not justify global hysteria.”

And while fires in Brazil have increased, there is no evidence that Amazonforest fires have.”

“Amazon forest fires are hidden by the tree canopy and only increase during drought years. “We don’t know if there are any more forest fires this year than in past years, which tells me there probably isn’t,” Nepstad said. “I’ve been working on studying those fires for 25 years and our [on-the-ground] networks are tracking this.”

“What increased by 7% in 2019 are the fires of dry scrub and trees cut down for cattle ranching as a strategy to gain ownership of land.

Against the picture painted of an Amazon forest on the verge of disappearing, a full 80% remains standing. Half of the Amazon is protected against deforestation under federal law.”

“Few stories in the first wave of media coverage mentioned the dramatic drop in deforestation in Brazil in the 2000s,” noted former New York Timesreporter Andrew Revkin, who wrote a 1990 book, The Burning Season, about the Amazon, and is now Founding Director, Initiative on Communication & Sustainability at The Earth Institute at Columbia University.

Deforestation declined a whopping 70% from 2004 to 2012. It has risen modestly since then but remains at one-quarter its 2004 peak. And just 3% of the Amazon is suitable for soy farming.”

The L A Times article of course was silent on any rational assessment of the history of declining deforestation and related fires in favor of pushing its usual climate alarmist propaganda campaign garbage.

Climate crisis canceled: Where did all the drought go?,,2019-08-26 00:00:00,"A record low amount of drought occurred in the United States in 2017, but that didn’t stop climate alarmists from blaming 2018 California wildfires on global warming. Yes, even though California state officials determined Pacific Gas & Electric power lines were to blame. So if global warming was a major factor in the 2018 wildfires, is global warming due praise for the record lack of drought in 2017? And what is the state of drought in California and the United States today?

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reports good news for Americans and bad news for climate alarmists. As the late summer/early autumn drought season kicks in, the entire state of California is free of drought. A couple small areas of southern California are experiencing minor dry conditions that do not rise to the level of drought. The rest of the state is experiencing normal or wetter than normal conditions. Did global warming suddenly stop?

It’s not just California, by the way. NOAA also reports the United States just experienced its most abundant rainfall in any recorded 12-month period. And examining extreme drought versus merely regularly drought, this spring marked the smallest portion of the country experiencing drought in nearly two decades. So 2017 brought the smallest amount of drought ever recorded, and mid-2018 through mid-2019 brought the most abundant rainfall on record. But when faulty PG&E power lines sparked wildfires during the middle of this abundant rainfall, alarmists say global warming is causing drought which causes or exacerbates wildfires.

It is for reasons like this that alarmists lack credibility with the American people….",1
"Macron, Celebrities Get Hysterical: Burning Amazon Rainforest The ‘Lungs Of The World.’ Rainforest Expert: That's ‘Bulls***.’",,2019-08-26 09:48:00-07:00,"As the largest rainforest in the world, situated in Brazil, is burning, politicians and celebrities are exhibiting growing hysteria and making claims they believe will galvanize the world into joining their perspective on climate change.

There’s one problem: Some of those hysterical claims adducing supposed facts simply aren’t true, one Amazon rainforest expert says.

Writing in Forbes, Michael Shellenberger, a Time Magazine “Hero of the Environment” and Green Book Award Winner, quotes Dan Nepstad, the President and Founder of Earth Innovation Institute and the co-founder of The Amazon Environmental Research Institute, a scientific, non-governmental, non-partisan and non-profit organization that has worked for the sustainable development of the Amazon since 1995, according to its website. Nepstad proceeds to demolish some of the most strident claims made about the Amazon rainforest burning.

Prior to the comments by Nepstad, Shellenberger notes, “Celebrities, environmentalists, and political leaders blame Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro for destroying the world’s largest rainforest, the Amazon, which they say is the ‘lungs of the world.’” French President Emanuel Macron tweeted, “The Amazon rain forest — the lungs which produce 20% of our planet’s oxygen — is on fire.”

Shellenberger references a photo shared with the public by actor Leonardo DiCaprio and French President Emanuel Macron, which he points out is over 20 years old, soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo sharing a photo that was actually taken in southern Brazil, nowhere near the Amazon, in 2013 as well as tweeting, “The Amazon Rainforest produces more than 20% of the world’s oxygen,” and a photo Madonna and Jaden Smith shared that was over 20 years old.

Shellenberger noted that although CNN pointed out “Deforestation is neither new nor limited to one nation” and The New York Times wrote, “These fires were not caused by climate change,” both publications repeated the claim that the Amazon is the “lungs” of the world. CNN: “The Amazon remains a net source of oxygen today.” The Times: “The Amazon is often referred to as Earth’s ‘lungs,’ because its vast forests release oxygen and store carbon dioxide, a heat-trapping gas that is a major cause of global warming.”

Nepstad had a blunt response when he spoke to Shellenberger about the “Lungs” claim, saying, “It’s bullshit. There’s no science behind that. The Amazon produces a lot of oxygen but it uses the same amount of oxygen through respiration so it’s a wash.” Nepstad addressed the Times’ claim, in which they stated, “If enough rain forest is lost and can’t be restored, the area will become savanna, which doesn’t store as much carbon, meaning a reduction in the planet’s ‘lung capacity.’”

Nepstad snapped: “The Amazon produces a lot of oxygen, but so do soy farms and [cattle] pastures.”

Shellenberger also spoke to Leonardo Coutinho, a leading Brazilian environmental journalist, who asserted, “What is happening in the Amazon is not exceptional. Take a look at Google web searches search for ‘Amazon’ and ‘Amazon Forest’ over time. Global public opinion was not as interested in the ‘Amazon tragedy’ when the situation was undeniably worse. The present moment does not justify global hysteria.”

Knowing that many of the fires in the Amazon are hidden by the tree canopy, Nepstad stated, “We don’t know if there are any more forest fires this year than in past years, which tells me there probably isn’t. I’ve been working on studying those fires for 25 years and our [on-the-ground] networks are tracking this.”

Shellenberger points out, “What increased by 7% in 2019 are the fires of dry scrub and trees cut down for cattle ranching as a strategy to gain ownership of land.”

Nepstad explains that accidental forest fires in drought years pose the greatest threat to the rainforest, adding, “Macron’s tweet had the same impact on Bolsonaro’s base as Hillary calling Trump’s base deplorable. There’s outrage at Macron in Brazil. The Brazilians want to know why California gets all this sympathy for its forest fires and while Brazil gets all this finger-pointing.” He added, “Brazilian farmers want to extend [the free trade agreement] EU-Mercosur but Macron is inclined to shut it down because the French farm sector doesn’t want more Brazilian food products coming into the country.”",1
Science Under Attack,Ralph B. Alexander,2019-08-26 00:00:00,"This Northern Hemisphere summer has seen searing, supposedly record high temperatures in France and elsewhere in Europe. According to the mainstream media and climate alarmists, the heat waves are unprecedented and a harbinger of harsh, scorching hot times to come.

But this is absolute nonsense. In this sixth and final post in the present series, I’ll examine the delusional beliefs that the earth is burning up and may shortly be uninhabitable, and that this is all a result of human-caused climate change. Heat waves are no more linked to climate change than any of the other weather extremes we’ve looked at.

The brouhaha over two almost back-to-back heat waves in western Europe is a case in point. In the second, which occurred toward the end of July, the WMO (World Meteorological Organization) claimed that the mercury in Paris reached a new record high of 42.6 degrees Celsius (108.7 degrees Fahrenheit) on July 25, besting the previous record of 40.4 degrees Celsius (104.7 degrees Fahrenheit) set back in July, 1947. And a month earlier during the first heat wave, temperatures in southern France hit a purported record 46.0 degrees Celsius (114.8 degrees Fahrenheit) on June 28.

How convenient to ignore the past! Reported in Australian and New Zealand newspapers from August, 1930 is an account of an earlier French heatwave, in which the temperature soared to a staggering 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit) in the Loire valley, located in central France. That’s a full 4.0 degrees Celsius (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) above the so-called record just mentioned in southern France, where the temperature in 1930 may well have equaled or exceeded the Loire valley’s towering record.

And the same newpaper articles reported a temperature in Paris that same day of 38 degrees Celsius (100 degrees Fahrenheit), stating that back in 1870 the thermometer had reached an even higher, unspecified level there – quite possibly above the July 2019 “record” of 42.6 degrees Celsius (108.7 degrees Fahrenheit).

The same duplicity can be seen in proclamations about past U.S. temperatures. Although it’s frequently claimed that heat waves are increasing in both intensity and frequency, there’s simply no scientific evidence for such a bold assertion. The following figure charts official data from NOAA (the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) showing the yearly number of days, averaged over all U.S. temperature stations, from 1895 to 2017 with extreme temperatures above 38 degrees Celsius (100 degrees Fahrenheit) and 41 degrees Celsius (105 degrees Fahrenheit).",1

Amazon Fires – A Big, Fat Nothingburger of a #FakeNews Scare Story – The fires are mainly in agricultural areas as farmers prepare their land for planting. The land was cleared in the past.

Day After Stating No Link, NY Times Blames Amazon Fires on ‘Global Warming’

Lies, Damn Lies, And Amazon Rainforest Fear-Mongering

FALSE ALARM: AMAZON BURNING IS MOSTLY FARMS, NOT FORESTS – So why are there so many fires? “Natural fires in the Amazon are rare, and the majority of these fires were set by farmers preparing Amazon-adjacent farmland for next year’s crops and pasture,” soberly explains The New York Times. “Much of the land that is burning was not old-growth rain forest, but land that had already been cleared of trees and set for agricultural use.”

It is routine for farmers and ranchers in tropical areas burn their fields to control pests and weeds and to encourage new growth in pastures. What about deforestation trends? Since the right-wing nationalist Jair Bolsonaro became Brazil’s president, rainforest deforestation rates have increased a bit, but they are still way below their earlier highs:

Brazil’s Bolsonaro gets blamed for same Amazon fires also plaguing socialist Bolivia – But Media Ignores! – “The left is doing its level best to blame Brazil’s bush fires on Brazil’s conservative, Trump-like president, Jair Bolsonaro, and get him thrown out of office…Socialist President Evo Morales has openly encouraged what’s known, at least in Venezuela, as “conuco” agriculture, telling subsistance farmers it’s fine to set of fires to gather charcoal to sell for fuel or clear the land of brush for planting, and now he’s refusing international firefighting help.”

“Now Bolivia is robbing them of their rimshot argument. No more Sting and the rainforest man for their “narrative” now. What appears to be a far more desperate and mismanaged situation is going on Bolivia, and we don’t see any eurochicken clucking about the “lungs of the world” or sanctioning the socialist hellhole. The European Union and much of the G-7 are focused exclusively on Brazil and putting the screws to Bolsonaro blaming him for a broader temporary weather phenomenon. It’s starting to look political and it would be a welcome thing if President Trump sticks up for the man among the clucker. Bolivia makes their hypocrisy show.”

Bolivia’s Wildfires Ignored By The BBC – The Reason? ‘Evo Morales is a socialist, unlike Brazil’s Bolsonaro’ – Of course, Evo Morales is a socialist, unlike Brazil’s Bolsonaro. But I am sure that had nothing to do with the BBC’s lack of interest in this story!

Needs to be emphasized. Amazonia is many wonderful things. It is not ""lungs of the world""… https://t.co/y7MBkZlHnJ — Andrew Revkin (@Revkin) August 24, 2019

NYT tamps down hysteria: ‘Much of the land that is burning was not old-growth rain forest, but land that had already been cleared of trees and set for agricultural use’ – But for current Amazon fires, we want to know: not just the number of fires (for which the NY Times has quite a different number than Global Fire Data, which is shown above). . . .but instead: What is burning?

However, that is not true, according to a brave journalist — Alexandria Symonds — at the NY Times. She reports: “Natural fires in the Amazon are rare, and the majority of these fires were set by farmers preparing Amazon-adjacent farmland for next year’s crops and pasture. Much of the land that is burning was not old-growth rain forest, but land that had already been cleared of trees and set for agricultural use.” Our brave journalists skates close to the dangerous edge of violating Editorial Mandates by telling readers: “Did climate change cause these fires, and how will they affect climate change? These fires were not caused by climate change. They were, by and large, set by humans. However, climate change can make fires worse. Fires can burn hotter and spread more quickly under warmer and drier conditions.” [Note: there is no mention of actual conditions of temperature or rainfall concurrent with these fires in the article, as usual for when climate is being blamed — just the implication that “climate change will makes things worse” without any data. — kh] Dear hysterical media & celebrities: We regret to inform you that NASA declared Amazon fires to be ‘close to the average in comparison to the past 15 years’

Watch: Morano on Fox with Varney: You have been Amazon.CONNED about rainforest fires & the Democratic Party is ducking climate debates & Inslee fails

Amazon rainforest fires at record high levels? ‘This is a blatant lie’ – Fires ‘nowhere close to a record so far in 2019’ – “The NY Times claims 2019 fires are way up, over 2018. That is correct. What they don’t say, is that about 1/2 the years BEFORE 2019 are higher, and about 1/2 are lower. Cherry picking of the first order.”

NASA’s caption: “As of August 16, 2019, satellite observations indicated that total fire activity in the Amazon basin was slightly below average in comparison to the past 15 years. Though activity has been above average in Amazonas and to a lesser extent in Rondônia, it has been below average in Mato Grosso and Pará, according to the Global Fire Emissions Database”

Delingpole: The Amazon Fires Scare Is #FakeNews,James Delingpole,2019-08-26 00:00:00,"All this week, the mainstream media have been trying to scare you with heartrending tales of burning Amazonia — a conflagration the like of which we have never seen before. Supposedly…

A Washington Post story headlined ‘Bolsonaro, Trump, and the nationalists ignoring climate disaster’ quotes Vitor Gomes, an environmental scientist at the Federal University of Para:

“I cannot remember any other big fire episode like this one.”

According to the BBC:

Brazil’s Amazon rainforest has seen a record number of fires this year, new space agency data suggests. The National Institute for Space Research (Inpe) said its satellite data showed an 84% increase on the same period in 2018.

According to NPR:

Half the fires in Brazil so far this year, nearly 36,000 of them, have ignited in just the past month. That’s nearly as many as in all of 2018.https://t.co/bphNHVcqcX — NPR (@NPR) August 22, 2019

According to this recidivist enviro-loon activist:

From a scientist who specializes in prehistorical fire in the Amazon: The current fires are without precedent in the past 20,000 years. These fires are not natural, they are being driven by greed, colonialism, and are a crime against humanity.

The fires have spawned a hashtag — #PrayforAmazonia — and attracted the inevitable display of competitive virtue-signalling from the wankerati, with Jennifer Lopez, Madonna, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Kris Jenner among those eagerly expressing their concern on social media.

Politicians have jumped on the bandwagon too:

Our house is burning. Literally. The Amazon rain forest – the lungs which produces 20% of our planet’s oxygen – is on fire. It is an international crisis.

But almost everything you have read or heard about the Amazon fires in the mainstream media is #FakeNews.

To generate public hysteria in order to precipitate expensive and unnecessary government action which no sober cost benefit analysis could ever justify To raise ‘awareness’ — and, by extension, money — for the green cause To discredit conservatives, especially those who are properly sceptical of the green agenda, such as President Trump and his Brazilian counterpart Jair Bolsonaro To reinforce in the popular imagination the notion that economic growth and expressions of national sovereignty — in this case the interests of Brazilian farmers — are intrinsically bad for the environment To promulgate the common received idea that the Amazon is the ‘lungs of the planet’ and therefore sacrosanct and inviolable in much the same manner as polar bears, glaciers, Pacific islands, the Great Barrier Reef, etc. To lend false credibility to the global left’s claim that the planet is experiencing a #ClimateEmergency To invoke the spectre of the Green New Deal and, by extension, to rain on the parade of Trump 2020 To exploit the mainstream media’s insatiable demand for environmental scare stories, especially in the August “silly season” when there’s a shortage of real news

Here is the truth about the Amazon fires:

The fires are mainly on agricultural land – not virgin rain forest…

Turns out the Amazon Rain Forest fires aren’t exactly as advertised. Read for yourself: fires are mainly in agricultural areas as farmers prepare their land for planting. The land was cleared in the past. https://t.co/j8MXX8XWIH pic.twitter.com/hxhuxDZbeP — Ryan Maue (@RyanMaue) August 24, 2019

amazing: an informative article and very informative map by NYT on Amazon fires. Map shows that fires in previously cleared land. Nothing new. Furore is yet another fraud by enviro activists. https://t.co/xlMXiMZ9BM pic.twitter.com/e6p8GHW3BU — Stephen McIntyre (@ClimateAudit) August 24, 2019

There is nothing abnormal about this fire season

To everyone concerned about the future of the Amazon: sensationalizing the current fire season in the Amazon will not help keep it from burning.

So, it appears: * Fire close to average from 2003-2018. (Period of MODIS operation.)

* Fire highest since 2012. Graphs and discussion in that article I linked leave out fires from 2003-2011. Presumably, there were big fires sometimes between 2003-2011. — lucia liljegren (@lucialiljegren) August 24, 2019

The Amazon rainforest does NOT produce 20 per cent of the world’s oxygen (h/t Dennis Ambler)

From a 2014 New York Times article by Nadine Unger, Assistant Professor of Atmospheric Chemistry at Yale:

Moreover, it is a myth that photosynthesis controls the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere. Even if all photosynthesis on the planet were shut down, the atmosphere’s oxygen content would change by less than 1 percent. The Amazon rain forest is often perceived as the lungs of the planet.



In fact, almost all the oxygen the Amazon produces during the day remains there and is reabsorbed by the forest at night. In other words, the Amazon rain forest is a closed system that uses all its own oxygen and carbon dioxide.

It wasn’t always rainforest… (h/t Dennis Ambler)

From a 2008 article ‘Brazil: Ancient Amazon Actually Highly Urbanised’

Using satellite imagery, scientists have discovered the remains of once densely populated towns in west Brazil, an area that was thought to be virgin forest. The report in Friday’s edition of the journal Science describes clusters of towns and smaller villages that were connected by complex road networks and were arranged around large central plazas. Researches also discovered signs of farming, wetland management and fish farms in the ancient settlements that are now almost completely covered by rainforest. As Professor Philip Stott, Emeritus Professor BioGeography at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, wrote in 2003: At the end of the last ice age – some 12,000 to 18,000 years ago – the tropics were covered by seasonal savannah grassland, cooler and much drier than now. There were no rain forests in the Malay Peninsula and much of Amazonia, and, despite the increasing human development of forest space, there are still more rain forests persisting than existed then. Whatever the world’s greenies say, there is no adamantine rule that Brazil — or its neighbours — must stay rain forested in perpetuity.",1
"False Alarm: Amazon Burning Is Mostly Farms, Not Forests",,2019-08-25 07:21:03+00:00,"False Alarm: Amazon Burning Is Mostly Farms, Not Forests

Problematic deforestation continues, but the “lungs of the earth” are still breathing.

“A picture is worth a thousand words” is one of the dumbest aphorisms ever coined. Speaking as a former television producer, I’d say a picture takes a thousand words to explain. Take this much-circulated NASA satellite photo showing vast smoke plumes over the Amazon region:

Combined with a report from the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research that says the agency had detected 39,194 fires in the region, a 77 percent jump up from the same period in 2018, that picture has launched alarmed headlines around the world.

“Amazon rainforest is burning at an unprecedented rate,” declares CNN. The Daily Beast gives us “Record Number of Wildfires Burning in Amazon Rainforest.” Here’s NBC News: “Amazon wildfires could be ‘game over’ for climate change fight.”

Interestingly, when NASA released the satellite image on August 21, it noted that “it is not unusual to see fires in Brazil at this time of year due to high temperatures and low humidity. Time will tell if this year is a record breaking or just within normal limits.”

So why are there so many fires? “Natural fires in the Amazon are rare, and the majority of these fires were set by farmers preparing Amazon-adjacent farmland for next year’s crops and pasture,” soberly explains The New York Times. “Much of the land that is burning was not old-growth rain forest, but land that had already been cleared of trees and set for agricultural use.”

It is routine for farmers and ranchers in tropical areas burn their fields to control pests and weeds and to encourage new growth in pastures.

What about deforestation trends? Since the right-wing nationalist Jair Bolsonaro became Brazil’s president, rainforest deforestation rates have increased a bit, but they are still way below their earlier highs:

NYT

Various researchers have noted a U-shaped relation between environmental degradation and economic growth. As development takes off, levels of pollution and land degradation rise, but they begin to improve once certain thresholds of per capita incomes are attained. A 2012 study found, after parsing data from 52 developing countries between 1972 and 2003, that deforestation increases until average income levels reach about $3,100 per capita. As it happens, Brazilian per capita incomes reached $3,600 per capita in 2004,which is when deforestation rates began trending decisively downward.

While problematic deforestation is still taking place in the Amazon region, a 2018 study in Nature reported that the global tree canopy cover had increased by 865,000 square miles from 1982 to 2016. As Brazilians become wealthier, the deforestation trend in the Amazon will likely turn around toward afforestation, as it already has done many other countries.",1
Brazil's Bolsonaro gets blamed for same Amazon fires also plaguing socialist Bolivia,,,"Things are bad for him - the fires are affecting air quality in states that are his political base, and they're concentrated not in the actual rainforest, but in areas of developed farmland , something Bolsonaro's encouraged to bring some kind of prosperity to Brazil's flyover.

The left is doing its level best to blame Brazil's bush fires on Brazil's conservative, Trump-like president, Jair Bolsonaro, and get him thrown out of office.

It's drawn tremendous negative press on him, and set European Union's eurochickens clucking, vowing at the G-7 to cut off trade with Brazil to pin those fires on Bolsonaro instead of the weather. Brazil doesn't deserve that, but these people are shameless.

Democrats, back in the states, are doing it, too. Here's one who wants to suspend all funding to Brazil until the fires (which Brazil is fighting) are under control.

Kamala Harris is onboard, as well, tweeting this anti-Bolsonaro screed:

As the Amazon burns, Brazil’s Trump-like President who let loggers and miners destroy the land isn’t acting. Trump must not seek a trade deal with Brazil until Bolsonaro reverses his catastrophic policies and addresses the fires. We need American leadership to save our planet. — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) August 24, 2019

Never mind that the fires are within the range of fires that normally occur in dry areas during droughts. Brazil's fires, while they need attention, are in fact little different from the wildfires seen in Harris's own California, or for that matter, Spain or Australia. They're a function of the place's natural climate. Yet the euro-left has dancing visions about Brazil being the rainforest lungs of the world under great global catastrophe unless they can turn Brazil into a nature reserve to their liking, and of course to bring Bolsonaro to heel.

Look at this nonsense reported to a largely European readership from The Guardian:

In Rio de Janeiro, a couple of thousand people crowded the steps of the town hall. Many said the fires were a result of Bolsonaro’s plans to develop the Amazon forest and permit mining and commercial agriculture on protected indigenous reserves. The fires happen each dry Amazon winter but soared this year as farmers and loggers, emboldened by Bolsonaro’s anti-environment rhetoric, torched felled trees and cleared land for pasture. “We need to show how much we disagree with his policy,” said Mariane Rocha, a trainee teacher. Others were angry Bolsonaro blamed NGOs for the fires without providing evidence. “His whole political game is based on false accusations and mistakes,” said Beatriz Ferreira.

Well, guess what? The bid to blame Bolsonaro or his conservative policies on the fires in the Amazon falls apart now that news comes out that socialist Bolivia has exactly the same fire problem, and no, they aren't promoting development of land the way Bolsonaro is. According to ScienceAlert in a piece beginning with the following headline and lede:

It's Not Just Brazil's Amazon - Bolivia's Vital Forests Are Burning Out of Control, Too Up to 800,000 hectares of the unique Chiquitano forest were burned to the ground in Bolivia between August 18 and August 23. That's more forest than is usually destroyed across the country in two years.

Here's a Bolivian news account tweet:

#ANF Vea la dimensión de los incendios en #Roboré, Santa Cruz. Un sobrevuelo en la zona permitió verificar que el fuego arrasa extensiones de superficie de área boscosa. pic.twitter.com/d2BCI66CwN — Agencia Fides (ANF) (@noticiasfides) August 23, 2019

If anything, the dynamic there is far more man-made than anything going on in Brazil. Socialist President Evo Morales has openly encouraged what's known, at least in Venezuela, as ""conuco"" agriculture, telling subsistance farmers it's fine to set of fires to gather charcoal to sell for fuel or clear the land of brush for planting, and now he's refusing international firefighting help. When I visited Venezuela in 2005, I saw a lot of this going on over the jungle-edged savannahs and llanos and it was destructive. Apparently it goes on in Bolivia, too. The timing for that was not good now that the region is experiencing a drought.

Here's another claim that looks worthy of investigation as a result of that:

The left says that Bolsonaro's develop-the-rainforest policies are what's causing the fires, but this is highly questionable, given that in California, exactly the opposite is what triggers its huge and consuming wildfires - overforestation and greenie regulations. What's going on is bigger than any of this -- the issue is the weather and the correct management of conditions. Overforesting, as goes on in California, is as bad as conuco farming in Bolivia. In Brazil, there may be need for some policy adjustments, too, but it's no cause for panic or sanctions.

That's exactly what Europe and the U.S. Democrats are doing though, solely targeting Brazil which is in a difficult situation that requires support, not condemnation. Why is this happening> Well, because they hate Bolsonaro who to them is an extension of Trump. It's also because they still romantice the rainforest.

Now Bolivia is robbing them of their rimshot argument. No more Sting and the rainforest man for their ""narrative"" now. What appears to be a far more desperate and mismanaged situation is going on Bolivia, and we don't see any eurochicken clucking about the ""lungs of the world"" or sanctioning the socialist hellhole. The European Union and much of the G-7 are focused exclusively on Brazil and putting the screws to Bolsonaro blaming him for a broader temporary weather phenomenon. It's starting to look political and it would be a welcome thing if President Trump sticks up for the man among the clucker. Bolivia makes their hypocrisy show.

"NBC Joins CBS, Fails to Include Inconvenient Tidbit About Global Warming Teen’s Voyage",,2019-08-29 00:00:00,"Wednesday’s CBS This Morning gave another glowing segment to Swede and climate change teen Greta Thunberg, but as my colleague Scott Whitlock noted, they failed to include an embarrassing tidbit that, while the teen sailed on a zero emissions-boat across the Atlantic to New York for a United Nations conference, two individuals are being flown across the Atlantic to retrieve the boat.

This was despite the fact that Thunberg herself has decried flying as horrid for the planet. While an Associated Press story claimed that “the carbon emissions from their flights will be compensated for,” the irony remained. Yet, the CBS Evening News and NBC Nightly News ignored it while covering Thunberg’s arrival (while ABC’s World News Tonight didn’t cover it).

The 130-word AP item said a team “spokeswoman....said it'll be necessary to fly the crew to the U.S. because the high-profile trip with the 16-year-old Swedish campaigner that left Plymouth on Wednesday was arranged at very short notice” and that they recognize that this is “an imperfect solution.”

Yikes.

At any rate, the CBS Evening News kept up the hype and good feelings. Fill-in anchor John Dickerson referred to Thunberg in a tease for an 18-second brief as a “climate warrior....with a message to the President.”

New to this part of her story was NBC Nightly News, which gave her arrival a one-minute-and-13-second story. Filling in for Lester Holt, Sunday anchor Kate Snow introduced correspondent Kelly Cobiella’s piece: “A teenage climate activist whose passion for the planet has attracted global attention arrived in New York City today. The young environmentalist chose to travel on a zero emissions yacht and she invited fans to share the journey.”

Cobiella even made a point to mention Thunberg’s decision to sail here because of her disdain for flying (which took 15 days and one day later than planned due to rough seas):

The 16-year-old Swedish student, who started a global youth movement when she went on strike from school last year, set sail from England August 14th for New York and the United Nations Climate Conference taking a boat, she said, because flying is terrible for the planet....Sharing her maiden voyage with her two million social media followers tweeting “it's like camping on a roller coaster.” And on day 8, “you really lose sense of time.”

While such a small tidbit in the bias by omission department isn’t that big of a deal compared to MSNBC host Lawrence O’Donnell’s bit, it’s yet another reminder of how many in the national media fail to accomplish the most basic elements of news gathering.

Ocasio-Cortez: Climate Change Threatens to Unleash Glacier Diseases ‘Frozen for Thousands of Years’,Craig Bannister,2019-08-28 15:39:00-04:00,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (Screenshot)

Melting glaciers threaten to release diseases “that are thousands of years old,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) cautions in an Instagram video warning of the dangers of climate change.

“They going to get into our water” – and mankind is going to be unprepared for these ancient, unknown diseases – Ocasio-Cortez says:

“There are a lot of diseases that are frozen in some of these glaciers that scientists fear that there is a potential that a lot of diseases could escape these melted glaciers.” “Things that were frozen for thousands of years, and that they’re going to get into our water, and that humans could contract them, and they’re going to be diseases that are thousands of years old that have vectors that we are not prepared for, that we have never seen. Um…and so that’s a concern.”

Ocasio-Cortez adds that, even if she’s wrong about the glacier diseases, migrating mosquitoes fleeing climate change will bring diseases “and a whole slew of other things” to the U.S.:",1

‘Renegade Republican’ Mitt Romney Comes Out in Favor of Carbon Taxes,Marc Morano,2019-08-28 00:00:00,"https://bigleaguepolitics.com/renegade-republican-mitt-romney-comes-out-in-favor-of-carbon-taxes/

By Shane Trejo

Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT), who claims he is no longer is apart of the Republican Party establishment in the age of Donald Trump, is demonstrating his new “renegade” status by pushing for carbon taxes to cripple the U.S. economy.

The AP reported: Romney said that he believes climate change is happening and human activity is a significant contributor…Romney discussed the benefits of a carbon tax, a fee based on each ton of carbon dioxide emissions produced by fossil fuels that some major oil companies have adopted. He suggested a portion of the tax revenue could go to coal workers in rural communities that would suffer financially from the move to cleaner power alternatives.

“In some respects, (by speaking with newer conservatives), I’ll be able to make inroads with some of the young people coming along,” he told the Sutherland Institute in Salt Lake City, claiming that he was reaching young people by preaching about the evils of global warming.

Rom-Gore?

“I’m not willing to sit by if there are major sectors that are losers … and watch people and communities suffer because of that change,” he added.

Romney outlined his support for cap-and-trade policies during his speech. He wants to place a fee for each ton of carbon dioxide emissions that businesses release into the atmosphere. He believes some of the tax money could go to provide federal welfare to coal workers who are put out of jobs under his proposal.

Meanwhile, President Trump is bringing the industry back by shredding regulations that prevent coal mines from providing jobs to rural, poverty-stricken Appalachian states. Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reversed his predecessor’s rules last month that were holding back the coal industry, allowing states to set their own emissions standards regarding power plants.

“We are gathered here today because the American public elected a president with a better approach,” EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in July. “One of the President’s first acts in office was to issue an executive order to promote energy independence. In it, he instructed EPA to rescind, replace or revise the Clean Power Plan.”

Wheeler announced the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) to restore federalism and remove centralized control by ending the dubiously titled Clean Power Plan. These regulations were crippling the coal industry, which was a stated goal made by Obama before he was elected President.

…

The newly anti-establishment Romney wants to return America to the policies of the Obama administration. Romney appears to be a “renegade” in the same sense that deceased former Sen. John McCain was a “maverick.” He is willing support the globalist status quo, even when it is remarkably unpopular among his constituents to do so.

Selected Rough Excerpts:

Question: Could you say a word about the ideology that’s behind the climate change, hype.

Marc Morano: “I saw a bumper sticker today, ‘Science is not a liberal conspiracy.'”

Morano: “Oh yes it is. Yes, it can be and much of it is. And here is where that bumper sticker is wrong. When the regulatory state, ie the Environmental Protection Agency’s the United Nations US federal government, the UN, EU — when they want to regulate, they look for justifications and causes and that’s the natural state of any government. So essentially the regulatory state is using climate now to achieve its ends.

And if you go back to the beginning of the, of the environmental movement of the modern environmental at the 1960s, they’ve used every environmental scare from overpopulation to resource scarcity to threat a famine to deforestation to global cooling, as an excuse to increase the regulatory powers of the state. In other words, we’re facing overpopulation we’re facing global cooling we need to redistribute wealth, we need sovereignty limiting treaties, we need more central planning, we need less freedom less capitalism. I actually point that out in my book.

‘Global warming’ is merely the latest environmental scare with the exact same solutions going back 50 years. In other words, it doesn’t really matter what the science of global warming. They actually have quotes, main figures say the science is irrelevant. The EU climate commissioner said even if we’re wrong on the science we’re doing the right thing by policy. See: EU Commissioner: Global Warming Policy Is Right Even If Science Is Wrong

What is that policy, the UN Climate chief explicitly stated — I interviewed her on this — we seek a centralized transformation that will make life on planet earth very different for everyone. See: Flashback: UN climate chief Christiana Figueres seeks ‘centralized transformation’ that is ‘going to make the life of everyone on the planet very different’ in order to fight ‘global warming’

The UN Climate sees that as the explicit goal, her assistant, a guy named Edenhofer actually said, we will redistribute wealth by climate policy is not even about environmental policy anymore. See: Flashback: UN IPCC Official Edenhofer: ‘We Redistribute World’s Wealth By Climate Policy’

They’re openly talking about it they talk about global governance, they talk about CO2 budgets for every man woman and child on the planet. See: German Climate Advisor Schellnhuber ‘proposes creation of a CO2 budget for every person on planet!’

This is their goal in global warming. It is merely the latest scare — you can go back and I do go back in the book, global cooling had the exact same solutions. It’s always the intervention and increasing the power of the regulatory state. See: ‘Global Warming Solutions Same As Global Cooling Cures’

That is why we’re hearing about global warming. We’re not hearing about global warming because of temperature or storms, or polar bears. It’s because they’re seeking a justification for regulations. They don’t want to argue on the merits of their policies like the Green New Deal. They just admitted, AOC’s Chief of Staff said this was never about the climate, this was a. increase the government kind of thing a change the whole economy type of thing. Her former campaign aide actually said a similar thing that this was actually not about the climate. See: AOC’s Chief-Of-Staff Admits Green New Deal About Implementing Socialism – ‘It wasn’t originally a climate thing at all’ – It’s a ‘change-the-entire-economy thing’ & FORMER OCASIO-CORTEZ CAMPAIGN AIDE CALLS ‘GREEN NEW DEAL’ A PLAN TO ‘REDISTRIBUTE WEALTH AND POWER’ FROM RICH TO POOR

They’re openly admitting that they don’t want to argue their points on the merits. So instead they use subterfuge — we only have 12 years left or we’re facing a climate emergency — as cities and colleges are now comically declaring that across the world. That’s how global warming fears become a tool for the regulatory state.

Winning: The ABC news implied the G7 didn’t achieve much and was a bit of a flop with leaders “unable to overcome their differences…” and signing only a one page form. But for the rest of the world, the G7 was a big success — there were no long pledges to lead the world in weather changing voodoo. Climate was sidelined.

Plus the 2019 G7 leaders statement was 54 times smaller than the last G7 leaders statement.

Stuart Varney, Staff, Fox News

“No matter what you read and hear from the media, this G-7 was all about Trump re-aligning the world — reshaping the world economy with America’s interests first and foremost,” said Varney on Fox Nation’s “My Take.”

“Trade was the headline issue … A deal with Japan – they will import a lot more of our agricultural product. Britain gets a major trade deal after Brexit, and there’s dialogue with Germany on car tariffs as well, but the most important – China,” stressed Varney.

After President Trump’s news conference, at the conclusion of the summit on Monday, CNN’s Jim Acosta said, ”I think perhaps one of the biggest headlines coming out of this press conference that we just witnessed here in France is that the President would not be pinned down on this question of climate change.”

Good governance means less government:

TWEET: Peter Baker, Chief White House Correspondent for The New York Times and MSNBC analyst.

With all the differences with Trump, the G7 leaders ended up releasing a largely general one-page statement that added up to 264 words. The last joint statement under Obama in 2016 was 14,263 words

That’s a 98% reduction in word pain.

Speaking of that Trade War

The Z-Man points out that China is much more vulnerable

China is selling cheap labor which is available in so many other places:

China is not selling the world anything the world does not have or cannot make. What China is selling is a safe haven to avoid the labor, tax and environmental laws that exist in the West.

U.S. imports from China totaled $539.5 billion in 2018. U.S. exports were $179.3 billion. … the U.S. market is about 5% of the Chinese economy, assuming the fake Chinese economic numbers are even close to reality, which is surely not the case. The Chinese market is less than one percent of the U.S. economy in 2018.

Right away, the relationship between China is the U.S. is not an equal one, in terms of dollars, but also in terms of impact. Then there is the nature of trade between the two countries. Almost all of the U.S. exports to China in 2018 were aircraft parts, electronic components and car parts. In many cases, these are either high precision items the Chinese cannot produce or they have intellectual property that the Chinese will try to steal, so they are made in the U. S. and sent to China.

This is why Trump is playing hardball. He believes he has far less to lose than the Chinese in a trade war. Even if all trade with China comes to an end, the cost to the U.S. economy is not going to be devastating. In fact, it will be hardly noticed.

"The Reference Frame: Stanford's ""physics for minorities"" is toxic racism",,,"Two more ""pure ideological indoctrination"" physics courses may be even worse



Wrath-0f-Khan has pointed out a remarkable story in Breitbart



Many students from all backgrounds and identities come to Stanford excited about physics, and this interest does not strongly depend on race or gender. But we lose a larger number of Black, Latinx and Native students, as well as women of all races, in the first two years of undergraduate study. A lot of that is due to the lack of community and overall climate. People from underrepresented groups often do not feel welcome in physics classes.



“Physics 94SI: Diverse Perspectives in Physics” is a seminar course in which “physics faculty members from diverse backgrounds share the story of their lives and careers.” Physics majors can earn academic credit by learning “what it is like to be a female professor” or “a faculty member raised first-generation/low income.” The course takes place “over lunch” and consists of a discussion of the “lives and career trajectories” of various “diverse” professors.



A similar course, titled “Physics 93SI: Beyond the Laboratory: Physics, Identity and Society,” is led by students, rather than professors. In this course, physics majors can earn academic credit by generally exploring “issues of diversity and culture in physics,” by applying concepts such as “critical race theory.” An optional extension of the class allows students to receive additional credit for developing a workshop to teach high school students about “inclusion in science.”



about a new Stanford physics course, Physics 41E. The content is supposed to be identical to Physics 41, a mechanics course, except that the enrolled students are supposed to be students from minorities who had little or no high school physics or calculus . Such students obviously have to be given more care – so they receive ""learning assistants"" (LAs) who get an extra $1,700 stipend for their work. I suppose that the students from the minorities don't have to pay for this extra expense. A female professor whose first name resembles Lisa – a faculty member and a blogger with the defunct ""Cosmic Variance"" weblog around Sean Carroll (who switched to the ""Preposterous Universe"") – seems to be the main driving force of this extremely unfortunate idea. It's natural to think that certain people have already gotten into the system with the help of the illegitimate ideologically driven distortions – and their gratitude helps them to spread this distortion further.Incidentally, it's funny to realize that most of the people behind the split of courses to Physics 41 and 41E have been attacking South Africa and the U.S. for segregation, the ultimate crime. Now it's their wonderful new idea!You know, almost 15 years ago, your innocent humble correspondent was forced to notice the stunning racist and sexist approach to students – and the terror against instructors who don't join it – for the first time. Perhaps because of my naivite, perhaps because of my limited experience, I still believed that Harvard was a fair university and even the grading was accurate and meticulous. But in a course, my TA – who was a perfectionist and whose work I was sufficiently verifying to have a full confidence in him – has determined some final grades for the students, based on some homework and/or exams.Soon afterwards, I was contacted by various senior people and told that it was impossible for someone to get a C or a D in that course because she was female; and a similar comment about another student who had to get a better grade because he was brown. A famous professor associated with the birth of grand unification seemed to be one of the bullies, too. I was completely shocked and frankly speaking, I am completely shocked even now, 15 years later. This was like a policy from Nazi Germany and the people who pretend that the analogy is misleading are lying to themselves. They still haven't answered my question whether Harvard really wants race-based grading; or whether they believe that a junior professor whom they hired – I – plus his TA wasn't respecting the basic principles of fairness. Well, everyone actually knows it's the former.As far as I can say, the treatment and grading of female and non-white students in Harvard courses (and at almost all universities, I guess) is pretty much corrupt so you should pay no attention to these grades and perhaps even degrees. They are not trustworthy – especially the relative grades between minorities and non-minorities seem to be complete garbage. An A in a physics course may have been well-deserved for a ""minority"" student but as far as I can say, based on my experience, it's far more likely that it is not and it is a result of ideologically-driven fraud and blackmail.The situation has gotten much worse in the following years and the professors who apparently matter today seem to be completely fanatical. The aforementioned ex-blogger is offering us some ""theory"":What a pile of junk. The interest in physics in an ethnic group (or anywhere) is clearly heavily correlated with the actual number of members of the group who choose to study physics or its prerequisites and because far fewer blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians go to physics than the percentage of the Jews, Asians, and whites, you may be pretty sure that they're also far less interested in it. That's also why many of them decouple from those who are actually more interested in physics – and good at it – which is why the less motivated or talented physics students generally feel less welcome, too.In other words, if someone hasn't had any calculus and/or physics at the high school, it shouldn't be shocking that he's more likely to decouple during the first years of the Stanford physics courses. The reasons may really be explained without any concept of the race. One just needs prerequisites to be good at some course. So the actual reason why the people of color are more likely to fail during the first years is the racism in admission policies – people who are unprepared are being admitted to Stanford because of their race or ethnicity! It's outrageous for the ideologues to blame the effect on someone else because it's clearly their fault, a result of their other racist policies.More generally, independently of races, I find it highly unlikely that it's a good idea to teach a ""university course on mechanics"" to someone who hasn't been exposed to calculus and/or physics as a high school student. There is no general rule that such a person with this limited background cannot comprehend mechanics. But it's very likely that he or she won't. The education must be assumed to be a somewhat gradual process. If it assumes that a student jumps from a kindergarten level of physics knowledge to the graduate school physics right away, it's not a realistic assumption and the resources and time spent for such schools will probably be mostly wasted. The discontinuity in the learning isn't the only problem with their plan; another problem is that the absence of the prerequisites is quite a hint that the person wasn't keen on similar things – so he or she is likely not to be too keen on the higher but related topics, either.So I just said that if someone wasn't exposed to calculus and physics during the high school years, you should also ask ""Why"" and think about the answer a little bit carefully. Do you always want to push the ""discrimination of the people of color"" down the people's throats? Does everyone have to believe this explanation at every level – and even after 50 years in which the discrimination at universities, if any, has been in favor of the people of color, as every sane person knows? If a non-white newborn is measured to have a lower IQ, is it also due to the discrimination by the evil whites in its mother's vagina?Needless to say, I am pretty much convinced that for most of these students, the extra LAs (learning assistants) won't help much, anyway. The absence of the solid high school prerequisites is incomplete but non-trivial evidence in favor of the opinion that they have some barrier that prevents them from getting further in physics etc. The assumption that the LAs' help will be perfect and turn the Physics 41E students to the equivalents of the Physics 41 students is just an ideological meme or a wishful thinking with zero evidence to back it up – and many good reasons to seriously doubt it. Most of the Physics 41E students probably shouldn't have gotten to the college at all. They probably got there because of racism at another level, the admission process, anyway. I know quite something about that bias from the admission committees, too.Even if this racism existed at one level only, the system could be considered a corrupt racist machinery. However, the racism and sexism seems to operate at a high number of levels – I think that all of them – so such schools are a complete mess. This racist and sexist treatment is surely being noticed by all intelligent people at a following level – who adjust their interpretation of the results from the lower stage. I have told you why you shouldn't take good grades and/or degrees of such minority students too seriously.So the people at a higher level, e.g. employers, naturally try to extract the most accurate information they can get from the manipulated data. It may mean that they internally or subconsciously replace minority students' grades by grades that are worse by two levels or something like that. Of course a good minority student could sometimes deserve an A but the re-calibration is surely a good idea in average – to reduce the ""sum of the squared error margins"" if you understand this statistics jargon of mine. While Stanford will probably try to create the illusion that the students who have passed Physics 41 and Physics 41E are equally good in average, others will probably have very good reasons to think otherwise.Needless to say, these sexists and racists want to impose their terror on all levels. So they would ideally love to punish the employers who try to undo the manipulation of the data they were served; and, for example, all the employers who will think that the education obtained from Physics 41 and from Physics 41E isn't really equivalent. Where can it lead? It can only lead to exponentially increasing lies and exponentially increasing terror against the people who don't like the proliferation of lies and the detachment from the basic reality. Without a massive effort to truncate the self-confidence of similar dishonest Marxist or neo-Marxist egalitarian leftists, such leftists pretty much unavoidably become new totalitarian rulers responsible for tens of millions of destroyed human lives or worse. Left-wing ideologies are unavoidably totalitarian for a simple reason: they want to defend the ""natural equality of results"", a big lie, and one needs terror and/or Gulags to defend a big lie.Communism was dividing the people into ""good"" and ""bad"" classes – instead of ""good"" and ""bad"" races – but the general logic was almost isomorphic. To look nice in the eyes of Lenin's corpse in the Mausoleum, the communist party needed to preserve its roots in the ""good"" class, the working class, but for the country not to collapse completely, it still needed people who weren't uneducated idiots – and you can guess that it was damn hard to find the working-class people who have voluntarily joined the communist party and who were not complete idiots. So the communist party took some of those who had a chance to become working-class communists who weren't complete idiots and they were ordered to study schools and universities. Because it was in the interest of the whole regime for them to become chaps and ladies with diplomas, they got an unlimited number of attempts to pass any exam, aside from similar bonuses. Be sure that this experiment has proven that the patience of almost all examiners was finite! ;-)How misguided the Stanford people must be if they want to recreate the same mess – with the analogous political interventions into schools – that we had during communism? It would be vastly better for Stanford and others to eliminate the actual self-evident racism, especially against the Russians and the East Asians. The Campus Reform article says that the Stanford Republicans are ""skeptical"" (the word doesn't suggest that they have the balls to fight this horrible thing) but it also offers us news about two amazing ""purely diversity"" courses (announced in a press release ):Wow. As far as I know, Nazi Germany hasn't had similar purely ideological indoctrination courses and seminars pretending to be about physics. These neo-Marxists are already ""beyond"" the manipulation of the universities by the Nazis and I guess that they would love to punish everyone just for pointing this fact out.Incidentally, I could say quite something about what it is like to be a first-generation faculty member – my father hasn't completed any high school with a final exam and my mother was a high-school-trained librarian – especially when it comes to the fact that the Nth-academic-generation faculty members are almost certainly increasingly spineless and ready to collaborate on increasingly disgusting policies (because their parents and maybe grandparents were probably teaching them that they have to attach themselves to the universities as ticks, whatever it costs; I had a tick 6 weeks ago and it literally sucked) – whether it's in Nazism, communism, or neo-Marxism. But I am not sure whether I would get the credits for these essential stories although the description seems to clearly say that exactly these stories are wanted. The distributors of the credits would prefer the opposite stories i.e. lies, wouldn't they?",1
Why Would the Obamas Buy a Doomed Beach House?,Dean Karayanis,2019-08-23 00:00:00,"Why Would the Obamas Buy a Doomed Beach House?

RUSH: I hear from you frequently, who think that the Democrat primary process is all a show for nothing because at the last moment Michelle Obama is gonna rush in there and accept the nomination and save the Democrat Party.

Now, I know that’s always been a seductive thing to believe. I want to tell you I never have believed it. The closest I got to believing it was when thinking about it from the perspective of Barack Hussein Obama. I don’t think Michelle Obama has ever had any desire to be president, but I could see where he would want back in.

Now, he can’t do it again, but Michelle could go in and front for him, and he could be revolutionary first guy, whatever, like Clinton was gonna be. But all of that’s out the window now because the Obamas have purchased beachfront property in Martha’s Vineyard. They’re gonna be so close to the Kennedys there that you could probably throw water balloons at each other.

Multiple sources on Martha’s Vineyard say that the Obamas are now in escrow for the estate owned by the owner of the Boston Celtics. Barack Hussein O and Michelle (My Belle) O have been renting the house this summer, they loved it so much, they made an offer. Now, the property originally was put on the market for some obscene amount of money and it didn’t sell. I think it was over $20 million. The Obamas are buying it for $15 million, 14.8.

It has 29 beachfront acres. The main residence is just shy of 6900 square feet. It’s about the size of my library. It has seven bedrooms so that the Obama children will have a place to crash along with several of their friends. It’s got the obligatory pool, the outdoor fireplace, vaulted ceilings, two guest wings, but it’s right on the beach. It’s right on the beach.

The Obamas have just sunk $15 million into something that may not be there in 10 years because of climate change and rising sea levels. So why would the Obamas do that? Why would the brilliant Barack Hussein O plunk down $15 million on a property that’s gonna be ruined and destroyed inside of 10, maybe 12 years at the outside because of climate change?

Well, let’s see. What could the answer be? Maybe because they know that this whole climate change thing is nothing but a gigantic left-wing agenda-driven hoax! Seriously, folks! Seriously! You can make jokes, we can crack about it, laugh about it, but why the hell would — Look, left-wing voters, Democrat voters believe that their standard-bearers really, really passionately believe this stuff.

Democrat primary voters believe that all these Democrat leaders from Obama on down to Crazy Bernie, you name it, they really believe this climate change stuff. They really believe it. That’s why they’re so important. That’s why they’re so valuable. What Obama said after accepting the nomination in 2008 (doing Obama impression), “Today is the day that the saving of the planet has begun. Today the sea levels are gonna start receding.” “Yay, yay.”

Well, the truth is Algore doesn’t really believe it. He’s done a great job of convincing people. Obama doesn’t really believe this crap. If he did, they wouldn’t be buying a $15 million home that’s gonna be overrun by the ocean in years. Now, some of you are saying, “Well, wait a minute, Rush. Maybe not. Maybe they don’t want to live in it any longer than that. They love it and they want to get in it while they can, Rush.” I’m sure this will be one of the rationales that their devotees will come up with to explain it, but it’s a futile exercise.

They don’t any more believe that the sea levels are gonna rise to swallow up Martha’s Vineyard than I do. And this proves it. It also illustrates why I thought Michelle (My Belle) O would not run. I don’t think she wants to give up the good life. I don’t think she wants to give up any part of being loved and adored and, as stated in numerous polls, the most admired woman in America, the most admired woman in the world. She doesn’t want give that up.

And I’ll tell you something else they know. After eight years in the White House, I think they probably have a good idea of the futility that ultimately it represents. They showed up in the White House in 2009 with this grandiose agenda, and I mean it was right out of Alinsky. They were gonna transform this country, they were gonna get nationwide government-run health care. They were going to soak the rich. Whatever madcap extremist radical leftism is, they were gonna get it done.

And in eight years they did a lot of damage and they scared a lot of people, but their expectations, they didn’t do diddly-squat. Now they’re looking at the signature Alinskyite issue being ripped to shreds and falling apart, Obamacare. They now see that despite eight years of telling the American people that the economic days of greatness are behind us, they now see that all it took is two years without the Obamas and the economy’s roaring back to life. So their lies have been exposed. Their agenda has been exposed as it doesn’t work. Why rejoin that fray?

“Well, Rush, they want the power of it. Maybe they want to finish the job.” Nah. They’re getting too much money. They have too many accolades. They’re big stars now. They get invited on David Geffen’s yacht, which is a big deal. They get invited to the Clinton birthday party. They get cover stories where they’re admired, the adulation never ends at People and USA Today. You might think that would continue. And it probably would. But who needs the hassle?

It’s like Fredo said, Fredo Cuomo pointed out, you know what? He thinks the reason Trump looks younger now than when he took office is because Trump doesn’t care. Trump doesn’t care about the country. Most presidents age in office, Fredo said. He was talking about this with Don Lemon.

Yeah, most presidents get gray hair, they get lines on their faces, the stress, not being able to sleep, worrying about who might be launching missiles or terror attacks, it just rips people apart and ages ’em like crazy, but Trump, Trump doesn’t look a day older. In fact, he may even look younger.

So Fredo concludes that Trump really doesn’t care. The job isn’t a burden to Trump because Trump doesn’t care about the country. Trump doesn’t have a care in the world. He just wants to have dinner with Tim Cook and go play golf with Rush Limbaugh and other people. He doesn’t care. That’s Fredo’s excuse.

I think there might be another reason why Trump is not aging, why Trump doesn’t look a day older in office. I can think of a whole bunch of reasons. I’m out of time for this segment here, but the fact is Obama did look like the job wore him out. And I don’t think Michelle Obama wants to go gray. And I don’t think Michelle Obama wants to have to start using Grecian Formula to hide the fact she’s going gray. I think they’ve got it right where they want it.

They’re gonna have their little six-months-a-year home in Martha’s Vineyard, knowing climate change is not gonna wipe it out. They don’t have to have the pressures of running around with their hand out begging people for money to run for office again. They have just as much power outside the White House as in, essentially. So I’ve never really thought she was gonna do it unless Barack really wanted it, but I think purchasing this house kind of wraps up that possibility now.

BREAK TRANSCRIPT

RUSH: There’s a guy named Andrew Stiles out there. Andrew Stiles occasionally writes for the Washington Free Beacon, and he has just a funny-as-hell piece on the Obamas picking up this beachfront estate in Martha’s Vineyard. He writes this story from the standpoint of how the left would write it, with all of the worshipfulness and the adulation and the idolatry. So the this would that Andrew Stiles imagines would accompany this story in any leftist publication goes like this: “Obamas Strike Blow for Economic Justice, Donate Millions in Exchange for Massive Beachfront Estate.”

The subheadline is: “Former president conquers ‘wealth anxiety.'”

No matter what they do, it’s gonna be portrayed as a beautiful thing using leftist, politically correct talking points. The article begins, “Celebrity authors Barack and Michelle Obama are striking a blow for social, economic, and climate justice, vowing to donate an undisclosed eight-figure sum to [the] Boston Celtics owner … in exchange for his massive beachfront estate on Martha’s Vineyard, the luxury island vacation spot popular with Northeastern elites, boat-shoed bon vivants, and other rich freaks who use ‘summer’ as a verb and donate to Pete Buttigieg,” and it goes on.

So the Obamas are tackling climate change! The Obamas are donating to a charity, the owner of the Boston Celtics. The Obamas are overcoming “wealth anxiety.” They see so many of their friends with so much, and they have so little, and they’re conquering that. It’s a great thing, the Obamas are doing. There is no greed. There is no desire to separate themselves from the poor and middle class. No, everything the Obamas are doing is rooted in charity and good workers — and even challenging climate change!

It’s the epitome of bravery to buy a house that you know is gonna be underwater in 10 years. That’s courage, that’s bravery. The Obamas may even be willing to sacrifice the $15 million they paid to prove the point. (impression) “Barack Obama, desperate to wake Americans ups, risks $15 million to drastic loss due to climate change by buying beachfront estate which may not exist in 10 years.” That’s how it works when you’re an approved leftist and you do stupid, crazy, hypocritical things.

RUSH: Okay. So Open Line Friday, El Rushbo, executing assigned host duties flawlessly, zero mistakes. Here we go back to the phones. This is Duane in Beaumont, Texas. How you doing, Duane? Great to have you here.

CALLER: Well, fantastic. I’m glad to have gotten on the line. Got a answer for you, though. I figured out why Obama bought the land so close to the water on Martha’s Vineyard.

RUSH: I thought I’d already answered this, but go — what is your take?

CALLER: Well, is — I believe that his real estate adviser is representative Hank Johnson, and so according to his logic, Martha’s Vineyard will float. So they really have nothing to worry about.

RUSH: Why — now, Hank Johnson thinks that Guam is going to tip over because of the population. You think Hank Johnson thinks Obama will prevent Martha’s Vineyard from tipping over and sinking?

CALLER: Well, it won’t sink in the water ’cause of the buoyancy, as far as he’s concerned, with his logic.

RUSH: Okay. Okay. Well, we don’t — I don’t know anything about that wives’ tale that there’s buoyancy involving — ladies and gentlemen, I —

RUSH: I know it’s Open Line Friday, but I have cautioned everybody. I make this look really easy. I know that all of you think you could do this, especially when you think I’m making a dumb, stupid point — which I never do. But don’t try this at home. The great always make it look easy, until you try it, and then you find out it isn’t. I always look at pros. When I look at football or baseball players or golfers hitting a ball…

The greatest golfers make it look like it’s easy as hell, until you get up there and actually start trying. Obama buying his home on the beach in Martha’s Vineyard is the greatest evidence yet that he and whole bunch of Democrats know that climate change is an entirely made-up hoax. If he really believed all this in the pit of his stomach, the bottom his heart, he wouldn’t be buying something that’s gonna be underwater in 10 years.

Annual Amazon farmland burn sets records for international outrage,"The Washington Times Http, Valerie Richardson",2019-08-26 00:00:00,"Every year, farmers in the Amazon set fires to clear agricultural land during the dry season starting in August, but this year may be a record-setter, not for the number of fires, but for the global outrage.

The G-7 nations pledged Monday about $40 million to help fight fires in the Amazon rainforest in response to the outcry from celebrities, media outlets and leaders like French President Emmanuel Macron, who said the blazes represented an “international crisis.”

Climate scientist Roy Spencer had another term for the fires: “normal agriculture.”

“I think the media focus on this is misplaced and exaggerated, as is virtually every weather-related story that appears these days,” said Mr. Spencer, a former NASA scientist who does consulting on global crop-market forecasting.

“The driest years in Brazil will have the most fires set by farmers,” the professor at the University of Alabama at Huntsville said in an email. “That isn’t a climate story, it’s normal agriculture in a country where 50 million people living in poverty are trying to survive.”

This year’s fires have been decried by media outlets and environmentalists as “record-setting,” and while that may be true of the number of fires in one of the 10 Amazon districts — Amazonas — the big picture is far less incendiary.

After finding last week that the Amazon fire activity “has been close to average in comparison to the last 15 years,” the NASA Observatory said Saturday that there has been an “uptick,” making 2019 “the most active fire year in that region since 2010.”

Data from the Global Fire Emissions Database of Amazon Region fire activity dating back to 2003 showed 2019 falling somewhere in the middle of the pack, with the number of fires as of Saturday at nearly 110,000.

That’s well above last year’s 58,500, the basis of widespread reports of an 84% increase in fire activity, but it’s also below the 116,000 fires recorded to date in 2016.

Dan Nepstad, president of the Earth Innovation Institute, told Forbes that the number of 2019 fires is 7% above the average of the last 10 years, even as deforestation fell by 70% from 2004-12 in the Brazilian Amazon. About 80% of the Amazon rainforest is intact, and half is protected under Brazilian federal law.

The photos you saw weren’t of today’s fires in Brazil



Amazon isn’t the “lungs of the world”



Deforestation is 75% below 2004 peak



*Forest* fires not increasing



Fires 7% more than decadal ave.



Here’s why everything they say about the Amazon is wronghttps://t.co/dQIIwv5DRq — Mike Shellenberger (@ShellenbergerMD) August 26, 2019



Such facts run counter to the widespread narrative depicting the Amazon going up in flames and on the brink of deforestation, thanks to the pro-development policies of President Jair Bolsonaro, the so-called “Brazilian Donald Trump” who took office in January.

Christian Poirier, Amazon Watch program director, said the “unprecedented fires ravaging the Amazon are an international tragedy and a dangerous contribution to climate chaos.”

“This devastation is directly related to President Bolsonaro’s anti-environmental rhetoric, which erroneously frames forest protections and human rights as impediments to Brazil’s economic growth,” he said in a Thursday statement.

In addition to Mr. Macron, celebrities such as Madonna, Leonardo DiCaprio, Cristiano Ronaldo, Jaden Smith and Shakira have stoked alarm about the fires on social media. Also going viral are photos declared fake by fact-checkers at such media outlets as Agence France-Presse and Mother Jones, which noted that Mr. Macron tweeted an image taken in 2003.

Also going viral was the claim that the Amazon produces 20% of the earth’s oxygen, as tweeted by Mr. Macron and Rep. Ro Khanna, California Democrat.

But even Penn State climate scientist Michael E. Mann, a leader of the global-warming movement, said that was too high. In fact, Mr. Mann tweeted, even 6% would probably be too high, because “plants both photosynthesize and respire.”

Mr. Bolsonaro may have invited some of the alarm with his florid rhetoric though.

“I used to be called Captain Chainsaw. Now I am Nero, setting the Amazon aflame. But it is the season of the queimada,” Mr. Bolsonaro told reporters last week, using the Portuguese word for “burned,” which has entered Brazilian usage to refer to the annual burning project.

Kris Jenner accused Mr. Bolsonaro of issuing “an open invitation to loggers and farmers to clear the land,” despite the Brazilian Embassy in the U.S. noting that nearly all of the fires in the annual burn are ranked 1 on a scale of 1 to 3, with 1 being the lowest intensity.

Mr. DiCaprio pledged $5 million to protect the Amazon rain forest through his newly formed Earth Alliance. Canada agreed to add $11 million and Britain $12 million to the $20 million also pledged by the G-7 nations, prompting Mr. Bolsonaro to speculate that they may want something in return.

“Look, does anyone help anyone … without something in return? What have they wanted there for so long?” asked Mr. Bolsonaro, who accused Mr. Macron last week of treating Brazil like a “colony.”

Mr. Macron had a response: “We cannot allow you to destroy everything,” he said.

Most but not all of the Amazon basin is in Brazil, which has six of the 10 Amazon districts. Three others are in Bolivia and one is in Peru, but Bolivian President Evo Morales, a socialist, has received none of the international condemnation heaped on the right-wing Mr. Bolsonaro.

Certainly Mr. Bolsonaro has invited criticism by, for example, suggesting that the fires were set by his critics to hurt his image, but it’s also true that his pro-business political positions have rubbed environmentalists the wrong way.

“The Brazilian president has been labeled a ‘climate denier’ by the media, thus he must be stopped,” said Climate Depot’s Marc Morano. “The Amazon fires are being used to crush Bolsonaro politically and vilify him.”

In 2015, Mr. Morales told a crowd at the World People’s Conference on Climate Change that, “Capitalism is Mother Earth’s cancer.”

“The fires in Bolivia are being ignored by the media because Bolivia’s government is socialist and does not fit the narrative of evil ‘right-wing,’” Mr. Morano said. “Bolivia is protected from media criticism because they are the politically correct political leaders.”

The incidence of fire was higher from 2003 to 2007 and in 2010, during the administration of former Brazil President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, a member of the Workers’ Party, although he received little in the way of international backlash.

The Embassy of Brazil in the United States reported that 2,409 firefighters have been deployed, more than in recent years, and insisted that the Amazon fires “are not out of control.”

1⃣ Forest fires happen every year in Brazil. We are now in the dry season, which is the critical period for the occurrence of these fires. pic.twitter.com/fl3kqrm3Yg — Embassy of Brazil in the USA 🇧🇷 (@BrazilinUSA) August 23, 2019



While climate change has been blamed for the fires, NASA attributed the blazes more to farm activity than drought.

“While drought has played a large role in exacerbating fires in the past, the timing and location of fire detections early in the 2019 dry season are more consistent with land clearing than with regional drought,” said the NASA post.

Mr. Spencer, who holds a Ph.D. in meteorology, pointed out that that “many of the fires are being reported along roadways and near urban areas, so it is possible that carelessness is also playing a role.”

Conditions in Brazil have been dry for the past two decades, a phenomenon he attributed to “persistent El Nino activity in the tropical Pacific.”

Farmers burning already deforested land to prepare for crops is nothing new, but what is exceptional this year is the fire intensity and visible imagery of smoke, which Mr. Spencer attributed to the dryness of the vegetation.

“This year is exceptional, but not in a way that is concerning,” he said. “When rainfall conditions return to normal, so will the human-caused fire activity.”

Climate Alarmists Foiled: No U.S. Warming Since 2005,Noaa Uscrn,2019-08-23 00:00:00,"When American climate alarmists claim to have witnessed the effects of global warming, they must be referring to a time beyond 14 years ago. That is because there has been no warming in the United States since at least 2005, according to updated data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

In January 2005, NOAA began recording temperatures at its newly built U.S. Climate Reference Network (USCRN). USCRN includes 114 pristinely maintained temperature stations spaced relatively uniformly across the lower 48 states. NOAA selected locations that were far away from urban and land-development impacts that might artificially taint temperature readings.

Prior to the USCRN going online, alarmists and skeptics sparred over the accuracy of reported temperature data. With most preexisting temperature stations located in or near urban settings that are subject to false temperature signals and create their own microclimates that change over time, government officials performed many often-controversial adjustments to the raw temperature data. Skeptics of an asserted climate crisis pointed out that most of the reported warming in the United States was non-existent in the raw temperature data, but was added to the record by government officials.

The USCRN has eliminated the need to rely on, and adjust the data from, outdated temperature stations. Strikingly, as shown in the graph below, USCRN temperature stations show no warming since 2005 when the network went online. If anything, U.S. temperatures are now slightly cooler than they were 14 years ago.

Temperature readings from 2005 (far left) to the present (far right) show absolutely no warming.

Climate activists frequently visit or mention particular regions, states, or places in the United States and claim warming impacts are evident, accelerating, and unmistakable. Yet how can that be when there has been no warming in the United States since at least 2005?

Unfortunately, when politicians and climate activists claim they can see the impacts of climate change in a particular place, the media rarely question them on it and tend to accept the claims at face value. But the objective temperature data show no recent warming has occurred.

There is also good reason to believe U.S. temperatures have not warmed at all since the 1930s. Raw temperature readings at the preexisting stations indicate temperatures are the same now as 80 years ago. All of the asserted U.S. warming since 1930 is the product of the controversial adjustments made to the raw data. Skeptics point out that as the American population has grown, so has the artificial warming signal generated by growing cities, more asphalt, more automobiles, and more machinery.

If anything, the raw temperature readings should be adjusted downward today relative to past temperatures (or past temperatures adjusted upward in comparison to present temperatures) rather than the other way around. If raw temperature readings are the same today as they were 80 years ago, when there were fewer artificial factors spuriously raising temperature readings, then U.S. temperatures today may actually be cooler than they were in the early 20th century.

The lack of warming in the United States during the past 14 years is not too different from satellite-measured global trends. Globally, satellite instruments report temperatures have risen merely 0.15 degrees Celsius since 2005, which is less than half the pace predicted by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change climate models.

Climate crisis advocates attempt to dismiss the minor satellite-measured warming by utilizing ground temperature stations around the globe, which tend to have even more corrupting biases and problems than the old U.S. stations. Of course, they adjust those readings, as well. Perhaps the time has come for American officials to direct some of the billions of dollars spent each year on climate-research and climate-change programs to building and maintaining a global Climate Reference Network.

Either way, it is becoming increasingly difficult for American politicians and climate activists to say they can see the effects of warming temperatures in the United States. For at least the past 14 years, there have been no such warming temperatures.

YouTube ‘Corrects’ Conservative Comic on Global Warming,Christian Toto,2019-08-26 16:57:20+00:00,"Make fun of Al Gore? YouTube will slap a 'Fact Check' on you without your permission.

Michael Loftus admits he’ll grab any excuse to share his Al Gore impression.

Why not? It’s rock solid. Only this time the Big Tech Overlords were listening, too. And, apparently, they weren’t pleased that Loftus poked fun at the “Inconvenient Sequel” star.

The most recent Loftus Party video mocks both the former Vice President as well as President Barack Obama. The latter brought it on himself, to be fair.

The Obamas just bought a $15 million property on Martha’s Vineyard, AKA land kissing the Atlantic Ocean. The move drew plenty of criticism from conservatives, but not for any one-percent complaints.

Why would someone who believes global warming is causing the oceans to rise gobble up coastal property?

It’s a legitimate question, one most journalists refuse to ask. Not Loftus. The conservative comic joined the fray, using comedy to pile on the former President.

Enter YouTube.

The increasingly liberal channel stepped in, adding its own editorial slant to the video. The comedy clip now features a horizontal addendum below the frame. The text, credited to Wikipedia, describes Global Warming in a clinical fashion.

Is this a new feature at YouTube? Does the platform fact check liberal comedians, too? What about hard news clips exploring the now-debunked Russia collusion hoax? Do they get a horizontal explainer ribbon as well?

Loftus shared the YouTube situation on his latest podcast episode.

“At first, I was’t outraged by it … because they haven’t demonetized the video,” Loftus said. His anger grew the more he drilled into the matter.

“They are playing hardball … I can’t get rid of it,” he says of the info strip.

“They’re trying to do a little Kung Fu on me. ‘You wanna joke about Global Warming? We’re gonna embed a link onto your video with a banner talking about. It’s real, its non disputable, and here’s the link to Wikipedia.’ ”

“Wikipedia?”

While Wikipedia feeds answers to voice-activated services like Siri and Alexa, journalists rarely rely on it a reputable news source.

This Loftus kerfuffle isn’t an isolated incident. Conservative pundit and Fox News contributor Dan Bongino says his YouTube videos are routinely demonetized shortly after being posted, but YouTube reverses that call the following day.

That matters since the first day a video tied to a news-related show launches is often its most trafficked window.

PragerU is squaring off against YouTube to court, again, for its consistent attacks on its wildly popular channel. The service lost the first round of the legal fight earlier this year.

Conservative comic Steven Crowder also tangled with the video service, getting demonetized in the process for his squabble with a gay journalist.

It’s part of a larger issue where Big Tech clamps down on conservatives while giving many liberals a pass. Far-left actor Ron Perlman recently found himself briefly suspended by Twitter for wishing death on the surviving Koch brother, Charles, hours after David Koch passed.

Yesterday Twitter slapped me with a 12-hour ban for a tweet referencing the Koch brothers. The day that we are silenced for calling out fascism, for pointing a finger at those who would rape and pillage the very air we breathe, may God help us! @twitter https://t.co/bkc9jwkRgD — Ron Perlman (@perlmutations) August 25, 2019

That’s the exception that proves the rule. The vast majority of Leftists remain free to Tweet what they wish, including Antifa accounts. Just ask Ellen Barkin.

The article goes on to reveal why the Washington Post and other mainstream media outlets are so willing to distort science and bash Brazil.

"Day After Stating No Link, NY Times Blames Amazon Fires on Global Warming",,2019-08-25 00:00:00,"One day after reporting, “These fires were not caused by climate change,” The New York Times blamed the ongoing Amazon rain forest fires on....climate change.

In Sunday’s Times, Johannesburg bureau chief Norimitsu Onishi falsely conflated the Amazon rain forest fires in Brazil with global warming in “Europe Tries to Fill Void On Climate Left by U.S.,” a two-for-one story that blamed both President Trump and Brazil's ""far right"" president Jair Bolsonaro for failing to act on ""climate change."" A photo showing burning forest had a caption that underlined the purported connection: “Europe ‘has to be a green superpower,’ a member of Parliament said, as the Amazon burned.”

Onishi either fell victim to a lazy leftist assumption that the wildfires in the Amazonian rain forest were somehow connected to global warming, or else did his best to force the connection himself (click ""expand""):

As the Amazon burned and the world faced an ecological disaster, President Emmanuel Macron of France bluntly criticized Brazil’s leader this week and threatened to kill a major trade deal between Europe and Brazil. President Trump, on the other hand, posted a tweet only Friday evening, saying that the United States was ready to help contain the fires, but adding that “future trade prospects” between the United States and Brazil “are very exciting.” The contrast highlighted the gap in leadership on issues affecting the global climate. As the Trump administration denies established climate science and has abandoned an international accord intended to fight global warming, European leaders have energetically stepped in to take up the mantle of leadership.

Onishi made sure to get some hostile labeling in:

By week’s end, the global condemnation led by Mr. Macron appeared to have chastened President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, a far-right populist and climate change skeptic. (....) But given Mr. Trump’s position on climate, and the absence of China as well as Russia, the talks are not likely to lead to significant change, said Jean Jouzel, a leading French climate expert.

Theirs is only one problem with talking about the rain forest blazes and climate policy: These fires were not caused by climate change. We know that from an unimpeachable source, the New York Times, in an explainer story on Saturday by Alexandria Symonds, which helpfully states:

These fires were not caused by climate change. They were, by and large, set by humans. However, climate change can make fires worse. Fires can burn hotter and spread more quickly under warmer and drier conditions.

Still, Onishi barged forward, using the manmade (!) fires in Brazil to blame Trump and Brazil’s leader Bolsonaro for ignoring global warming:

“The international scene now lacks dynamism in the fight against global warming,” said Mr. Jouzel, who was vice chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2007 when it won the Nobel Prize. “To effectively combat global warming, all countries must look in the same direction.”

This isn’t the first time Onishi has wrongly placed blame. In 2006, he wrote that ""Reaganesque policies of deregulation, privatization, spending cuts and tax breaks for the rich” were blame for inequality....in Japan.",1
Greta’s Dire Straits,"Posted On, Weylan Mcanally",,"Greta Thunberg doesn’t go to school, because adults around her have convinced her the climate situation is simply too bad. Instead she is traveling on an expensive yacht to the US, preaching imminent doom as a “magnet for hope.” She has been told that children had a much brighter future when CO2 levels were lower, like a century ago. Greta believes greenhouse gases cause catastrophic heatwaves, natural disasters and disease, which will ruin her future..

It is easy enough to test that idea out, by looking at how children lived a century ago – at lower CO2 levels. On this date in 1916, children were out of school for different reasons. New York Public Schools were shut down due to a polio epidemic.

The polio epidemic spread all over the country. This 1916 photo was taken in Billings, Montana. (At least the children didn’t have to face an extra 0.0001 mole fraction CO2 in the atmosphere.)

And what about the weather? On this date in 1916, there were 100 degree temperatures from Oregon to upstate New York. Adrian, Michigan was the hottest place in the country at 106 degrees.

Ithaca NY was 101 degrees on this date in 1916. They have had a total of ten days over 100 degrees since 1895, all of which occurred more than 80 years ago.

Chuck DeVore: 'Green New Deal' preview? Texas town's lofty environmentalism leaves residents with a nightmare,"Chuck Devore, Chuck Devore Is A Vice President With The Texas Public Policy Foundation, Served In The California State Assembly To",,"It wasn’t supposed to be this way. Georgetown, Texas – population 75,000 – was to be the new poster child of the green movement.

Environmental interest in Georgetown’s big push to generate all of its electricity from wind and solar power was amplified by three factors: the town and its mayor were nominally Republican; Georgetown is in an oil- and natural gas-rich state; and that state is deep-red Texas.

Former Vice President Al Gore and other climate change luminaries feted Georgetown Mayor Dale Ross, and Ross was featured prominently at renewable energy conventions.

TEXAS TOWN’S ENVIRONMENTAL NARCISSISM MAKES AL GORE HAPPY WHILE STICKING ITS CITIZENS WITH THE BILL

Last October, while the green dream was still in full flower, the city applied for a $1 million grant from former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s nonprofit, Bloomberg Philanthropies, and won it.

Ostensibly to be used for energy storage innovation in batteries, the grant’s only real requirement was that the city serve as a public relations platform in Bloomberg’s push to convince Americas to abandon affordable fossil fuels and switch to more costly renewable energy.

Trouble started when politicians’ promise of cheaper renewable energy was mugged by reality.

Georgetown’s electric bills went up as more wind and solar power displaced cheaper natural gas in the power portfolio of the Georgetown’s municipal utility. Politicians scrambled for cover. And the bloom came off Georgetown’s renewable rose.

Now, largely embarrassed members of the City Council are trying to figure out how to unwind the renewable mess they and their predecessors voted themselves into.

With their municipal utility facing a $7 million shortfall – money that has to be made up by the city residents through higher electricity costs – the City Council voted 5-1 in July to instruct the staff to figure out how to wriggle out of the Bloomberg PR deal.

On Aug. 13 the Council voted 5-0 to officially kill the deal. The city is also raising property taxes.

The Council member who asked for the vote said he wasn’t opposed to renewable energy, but that in light of the city utility’s deficit, the city should focus on the basics, rather than “doing experiments.”

Indeed, there’s not a single city in the contiguous 48 states that runs solely on wind and solar power. The reason is simple: electricity gets to cities via a grid, and that grid draws its energy from a variety of sources – mostly natural gas.

Excluding large-scale dams, which fell out of favor with the environmental movement 50 years ago, renewables powered about 10 percent of the U.S. grid last year.

This means that cities like Georgetown, which have contracted to take power from wind and solar farms hundreds of miles away, don’t risk blackouts on windless nights, because reliable power is delivered from a grid getting power from fossil fuels.

As part of the Bloomberg agreement, Georgetown was going to hire a new bureaucrat to oversee the installation of solar panels on homes, while creating a battery storage farm to keep the grid energized when the sun wasn’t shining and the wind wasn’t blowing.

But such arrangements are hardly cutting edge. In fact, the physics and economics of battery storage are well known. And here’s where Georgetown’s 100 percent renewable push merely looks like expensive virtue signaling.

Moore’s Law governs the world of computing – the speed and capability of computers doubles every two years. But computers only manipulate 1s and 0s.

In contrast, we use energy to manipulate the physical world – to cool and heat homes, to move ourselves and commerce faster and farther than we could using our feet (or horses or bicycles), and to bring light to the darkness. Efficiency improvements in the natural world move more slowly and yield to diminishing returns as they reach physical limits.

In Georgetown’s case, for it to truly go 100 percent renewable energy using today’s state-of-the-art mass-produced batteries from Tesla’s Gigafactory, the city would need a $400 million battery farm weighing some 20,000 tons to avoid a blackout on a quiet winter night. And, after spending $15,600 for each household to build such a battery farm, its backup power would be drained in 12 hours, with a second windless winter night leaving residents shivering in the dark.

Funding, building and relying on such a lithium-ion battery farm would likely lead to a change in city leadership in the first election following an inevitable blackout. Which, perhaps, is why so many of today’s environmentalists aren’t big fans of democracy – the freely expressed opinions of people stand in the way of their agenda.

This is where Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s D-N.Y., Green New Deal crashes into reality.

If the Green New Deal ever moves from fantasy to implementation, the voters will swiftly end the green dream at the ballot box.",1

Opinion: Climate change lawsuit is meritless chicanery,"Craig Richardson, Published P.M. Et Aug.",2019-08-27 00:00:00,"""Judge Smith has ruled that immensely complicated, multinational issues surrounding Earth’s climate change may now be decided in state courthouses..."" (Photo: File photo)

With little legal precedent to support his decision, Chief Judge William Smith of the U.S. District Court in Rhode Island remanded a politically driven climate change lawsuit case back to state court, effectively allowing the baseless claim that a few companies are solely responsible for all of the Earth’s climate change to be adjudicated at the state level.

In handing down this decision — which will most assuredly be overturned — Smith has ruled that immensely complicated, multinational issues surrounding Earth’s climate change may now be decided in state courthouses, using local “nuisance ordinances” to potentially impose massive fines on just a handful of American energy companies. This is an obvious shakedown effort by the Greens and their political and financial benefactors who brought these frivolous suits in the first place.

Unfortunately, two other federal judges have joined Smith in allowing these cases to remain at the state court level. Judge Ellen Hollander ruled that a case filed by the city of Baltimore should stay in state court. Similarly, Judge Vince Chhabria ruled that a suit by a few cities and counties in California belong in state court.

These rulings ignore precedent set by other federal courts as well as the U.S. Supreme Court, which have ruled against attempts to have climate-related issues adjudicated at the state level, saying an issue as complex and far-reaching as global climate change cannot be arbitrated by individual state courts.

Judge Smith ignored his own state’s Supreme Court decision 11 years ago in which the court unanimously rejected a similar public nuisance suit filed against three former lead paint manufacturers. Additionally, a virtually identical climate case was tossed out just last year by Judge John F. Keenan of the U.S. District Court in New York City, who correctly ruled that local nuisance ordinances cannot ever be used to impose fines or extract punishments from companies regarding an issue as vast as climate change.

Last year, a judge in San Francisco’s 9th Circuit Court appropriately tossed out a lawsuit brought by the cities of Oakland and San Francisco politicians, who launched a lawsuit seeking unspecified billions of dollars in fines from oil and gas companies, including BP, Chevron, Conoco Phillips and ExxonMobil. As the judge observed, the alleged damage “hasn’t happened yet and may never happen to the extent you’re predicting it will happen.”

While a few judges have ruled to keep these cases in state courts, other courts — even those in California and New York — have correctly ruled that matters of climate change fall under the jurisdiction of the executive and legislative branches of our government, not a collection of state courts and hodgepodge of judges.

Sadly now, emboldened by Smith’s flawed decision, Oakland, San Francisco and other cash-strapped local municipalities are demanding a do-over of their failed attempts to bilk energy producers — and ultimately consumers who will foot the bill — for their own municipal mismanagement, all under the pretense of protecting the Earth’s environment. But no matter how hard politicians in these cities attempt to shake down a few energy companies in the name of saving the planet, they will see their unsupported arguments tossed out of court.

Mayors who support such litigation also ignore how their own municipalities rely on fossil fuels for city-run airports, port facilities, bus terminals and city-sponsored industry. If a handful of energy producers are supposedly responsible for an entire planet’s worth of climate change, aren’t the cities that pump thousands of tons of carbon into the atmosphere also responsible?

Such epic hypocrisy exposes the blatant legal chicanery of these politicians and their deceitful attempts to backfill their cash-strapped municipal budgets with big checks from oil and natural gas producers. In reality, small-business owners and consumers would eventually bear the costs of tens of billions of dollars in fines imposed on the energy industry.

Ultimately, this litigation would do nothing to change the Earth’s climate or climate policy and can only unleash an economic Frankenstein monster upon our communities. It’s imperative that serious-minded judges adhere to the rule of law and dismiss these meritless lawsuits to protect the American people from such deeply dishonest climate change racketeering.

UN “sustainability” conference in Salt Lake pushing dangerous agenda,"Bonner Cohen, Ph. D.",2019-08-24 00:00:00,"NGOs from around the world are gathering in Salt Lake City, where, from August 26-28, they will participate in the 68th United Nations Civil Society Conference.

The theme of the confab at the swanky Salt Palace Conference Center is “Building Inclusive and Sustainable Cities and Communities.”

“Activists battling climate change, a former child soldier, and health workers pioneering new treatments around the world are among the thousands of participants who will gather in Salt Lake City,” the UN proclaims. Conferees will be treated to several “Thematic Sessions,” including “Inclusive Cities and Communities – Leaving No One Behind,” “Climate Change – Cities and Communities in Action,” “Impact Investing: Closing the SDG (Sustainable Development Goals) Gap,” and “Local and Regional Governments Leading the Way to Sustainable Communities “– just to name a few.

Smorgasbord of “Sustainable” Delicacies

The session on climate change, for example, will focus on reducing emissions and developing resiliency with what the UN says are “innovative strategies for carbon neutrality and resilient infrastructure, transportation and energy systems decarbonization, zero emissions buildings, innovative financing mechanisms, and behavior changes among consumers, producers, and policymakers.”

Participants lucky enough to attend the session on inclusive cities and communities will have the opportunity to partake of such delicacies as “equality and social cohesion,” “place-making,” and “gender responsive urban and territorial development.”

Hosting the extravaganza will be Salt Lake City Mayor Jackie Biskupski (D). In keeping with the spirit of the conference, the mayor has pledged to have her city powered by “100% clean energy by 2032.” This can only mean, of course, that residents of picturesque Salt Lake City will soon have to get used to both the sight and sound of giant wind turbines propelling the city toward the sustainable green future the Mayor has in store for them.

While it’s easy to make light of the UN conference’s offerings and Mayor Biskupski’s follies, the forces behind the push toward sustainable cities and communities need to be taken seriously. A new generation of urban planners has come to the fore, and what these people have in mind for the rest of us is truly frightening.

For years, urban planners have been extolling the virtues of “compact cities,” “smart growth,” bike lanes, roundabouts, and the like, and they have imposed policies at the local level to fulfill their vision.

But now they’re taking it to the next level.

The New Left Urbanists

At the vanguard of efforts to transform our cities into green Utopias are activists whom Christopher F. Rufo has labeled “the new left urbanists.” Their goal is to achieve social justice on a scale that is both local and grand by completely rebuilding the urban environment, including housing, transportation, roads, and tolls.

Writing in the Wall Street Journal (Aug. 23), Rufo points out that these activists, many of whom are urban planners on the taxpayer payroll in municipalities across the country, rally around such slogans as “ban all cars,” “raise the suburbs,” and “single-family housing is white supremacy,” even though the activists themselves are predominantly white and affluent.

Rufo quotes new left urbanists David Madden and Peter Marcuse who in 2016 wrote: “The shape of the housing system is always the outcome of struggles between different groups and classes.” In that spirit, a widely circulated April 2018 plan put forth by the People’s Policy Project calls for the construction of 10 million “municipal homes.” And what are municipal homes? They are what are otherwise known as public housing projects, now rebranded to distance municipal homes from the abject failure of crime- and drug-infested housing projects.

One of their goals to replace private construction of housing with publicly financed development. Rufo points out that new left urbanists have become adept at hijacking the zoning and permitting process to serve their agenda.

In San Francisco, the city commission hired a “shadow consultant,” to assess whether shadows cast by a proposed building could cause harm to the community. This is the same San Francisco that claims it lacks the financial resources to deal with the thousands of homeless who have transformed the city’s streets and sidewalks into a serious public health hazard.

Banning the Construction of Single-Family Homes

This urban activist agenda has even made its way into state houses. Oregon’s House and Senate recently passed a bill that essentially bans the construction of single-family homes in cities of 10,000 or more. In December 2018, Minneapolis became the first U.S. city to end single-family zoning.

Heads up! All this could be headed your way.",1
"UN flies in 5,000 people to Salt Lake to complain about fossil fuels",,2019-08-27 00:00:00,"How does the United Nations convince people that they are super serious in their outrage about fossil fuels? How about flying 4,000 people from all over the world in fossil-fueled jet airplanes to isolated Salt Lake City to whine about it? Sounds like a good plan to the United Nations bureaucracy, which is sponsoring a sustainability and climate change conference this week in Salt Lake City.

The UN brags that up to 4,000 people are likely to attend, representing more 300 nongovernmental organizations (read, environmental activist groups) and more than 80 countries. There is no compelling agenda, no compelling actions items, and no expected meaningful outcome from the conference. It is simply an opportunity for leftist global activists to get together and express outrage about economic freedom and the existential global climate disruption that is the greatest crisis humanity has ever faced – surpassing Genghis Khan, Adolf Hitler, Josef Stalin, the Black Plague, smallpox, AIDS, and the threat of nuclear war combined.

Salt Lake City is an isolated, medium-sized city with little national or international media impact. Most people flying to Salt Lake City for the UN conference will have to make at least one or two connecting flights to get there, exacerbating their carbon footprint for the conference. Why didn’t the UN choose New York or Brussels for such a conference? Because, silly, UN bureaucrats get tired of New York and Brussels and want to go someplace really cool and fun for their events. Carbon footprint, shmarbon footprint.

Seriously, now, if global warming is the greatest existential threat facing humanity, as the UN and Democratic presidential hopefuls claim, why would the UN induce 4,000 people to carbon-bomb the atmosphere with 4,000 multi-leg, roundtrip flights to whine about it? Almost nobody (other than us wonks here at CFACT) really cares or will be paying attention to the conference. Couldn’t they hold the conference at UN facilities in New York or Brussels? Or better yet, couldn’t the conference can be held online for a much lower carbon footprint?

The truth is, Salt Lake City is a beautiful place. There are breathtaking mountains all around. Posh Park City is just a 20-minute drive away. Environmental leftists may even catch a glimpse of part-time nearby resident Robert Redford. Holding the conference in Salt Lake City is an opportunity for the self-righteous environmental left to travel to a gorgeous city, take a nice vacation at taxpayer or employer expense, and all the while compliment each other on how they really CARE about climate change. All while carbon-bombing the atmosphere in order to travel there.

Makes you wonder just how existential they believe their contrived climate crisis truly is….",1
CFACT Undercover: Exposing radical UN sustainability conference,Cfact Undercover,2019-08-27 00:00:00,"“Nobody wants to talk about population control…Well we can’t kill everybody…” David Terungwa, Executive Director, Global Initiative for Food Security and Ecosystem Preservation.

“We need to change behavior at an individual’s level. We must start acting now,” Satay Tripathi, UN Assistant Secretary General.

Those were just a few of the radical comments from speakers at the United Nations’ 68th Annual Conference for Civil Societies, taking place in Salt Lake City, Utah this week.

CFACT’s on-the-ground operative is attending the conference under-cover, reporting back on the radical plans the UN has for communities across the United States.

By holding these swanky conferences, the UN is attempting to “normalize” a dangerous urban planning agenda – and it may be coming to your hometown sooner than you think.

Here’s what our investigative reporter has found:

A Dangerous Urban Planning Agenda

An estimated 5,000 attendees from all over the world, plus hundreds of volunteers (and hundreds of young people), are discussing how to establish “sustainable communities” across the United States. This includes a transition to 100% so-called renewable energy, urban and suburban planning, encouraging or mandating rooftop gardens, and finding ways to incentivize “behavior change” to mitigate climate change.

Most importantly, however, they are strategizing on how to achieve the United Nation’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 SDG targets by the year 2030. The conference’s main focus is SDG number 11, which seeks to make cities and communities “inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.”

In her opening Plenary remarks, Salt Lake City Mayor Jackie Biskupski stated, “The United Nations estimates that by the year 2050, two-thirds of the world’s population will live in urban areas” like Salt Lake City, making urban planning critical to the globe’s future. She expressed excitement for Salt Lake City’s policy move to 100% renewable energy by the year 2030. Biskupski drew loud applause when she said, “The world can’t wait, and neither will we,” a slogan she and other progressive U.S. mayors use to promote the UN’s sustainable development agenda.

Radical Comments from Panelists

One panel in particular seemed to reveal the extreme lengths to which the UN is willing to go to transform American life and culture. This panel, titled, “Infrastructure and Natural Resource Use” discussed urban sprawl, biodiversity, resource inequality and key drivers of human prosperity within “planetary boundaries,” aka limits. Said another way, human prosperity is only acceptable if and when prosperity is in harmony with nature.

Solutions to our suggested earthly problems included behavior change, vertical forests, rooftop gardens, nuclear gardens, a future world vision of “Megacities” in 10 years, “Rural Cities” in 20 years, “Floating Cities” in 30 years, “Frozen Cities” in 40 years, and “Off Planet Cities” in 50 years.

Panelist David Terungwa, Executive Director, Global Initiative for Food Security and Ecosystem Preservation, said: “We need population control. I know what population explosion has done to the environment…nobody wants to talk about population control.”After the panel discussion, our under-cover reporter asked Mr. Terungwa about his comments. Laughing uncomfortably, he replied: “Well we can’t kill everybody…”

Panelist Satay Tripathi, UN Assistant Secretary General and Head of New York Office United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), scolded Americans and the world for not heeding the UN’s warnings: “We have gone from bad to worse as a human species. I have been at this for 38 years…and every year a powerful group of scientists keep warning us about the future and we don’t listen.”

Tripathi snapped, “Our arrogance is that nature is for us…one million peer-reviewed articles on climate change AND WE DON’T READ! In 2014-2019 we experienced the hottest years…not in recorded history but in ALL of history,” Tripathi claimed. “We need to change behavior at an individual’s level. We must start acting now.”

Hypocrisy on Display

Panelist Amanda Nesheiwat is a certified recycling professional, a credentialed Al Gore Climate Reality Leader, a UN Youth Ambassador, and Environmental Director at Town of Seacaucus, New Jersey. Nesheiwat was excited because her town is passing an ordinance to ban plastic bags. Nesheiwat flies frequently to climate change-related conferences, but suggests walking is a “low hanging fruit” for addressing climate change. People should “get off their couch and walk more,” according to her.

While the panelists and speakers called on the world to consume less, travel less, and live with less, conference attendees enjoyed free, unlimited food and an assortment of free beer, wine, and sodas from a multitude of satellite bars and over 20 food trucks (we wonder what those trucks run on? Probably not wind.)

Trump: ‘I Think I Know More About The Environment Than Most People’,,2019-08-26 00:00:00,"President Donald Trump said he knows “more about the environment than most people” when asked about his skepticism regarding climate change Monday during the G7 summit in Biarritz, France.

“I’ve got more environmental impact statements probably than anybody … more than anybody that has ever been president or vice president or anything even close to president. I think I know more about the environment than most people,” Trump said.

He went on to list the U.S.’s success in the energy industry, saying it is the “No. 1 energy producer in the world.”

WATCH:

He added the industry is creating “tremendous wealth, and [liquefied natural gas] LNG is being sought over all over Europe and all over the world. … I’m not going to lose that wealth. I’m not going to lose it on dreams — on windmills, which, frankly, aren’t working too well.”

“In a nutshell, I want the cleanest water on Earth. I want the cleanest air on Earth. That’s what we’re doing. And I’m an environmentalist,” he continued. “A lot of people don’t understand that.” (RELATED: Trump Administration Touts Record On The Environment)

The president said he wants clean air, clean water and a wealthy, “spectacular” country with “jobs, with pensions, with so many things, and that’s what we’re getting, so we should be careful.”

“At the same, it’s very important to me — we have to maintain this incredible place that we’ve all built. We’ve become a much richer country, and that’s a good thing, not a bad thing. … We can take care of people that we couldn’t have taken care of in the past cause of the great wealth. We can’t let that wealth be taken away,” the president concluded.

Trump was the only G7 leader not in attendance at a climate meeting Monday due to prescheduled meetings with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and India Prime Minister Narendra Modi, according to the White House.

A senior administration official reportedly took Trump’s place to make up for his absence, though photographers still captured pictures of his empty chair.

The Real Agenda surfaces again – UN Sustainable Development Goals need ‘Deep Transformation’ of Society,Marc Morano,2019-08-27 00:00:00,"“The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) focus on time-bound targets for prosperity, people, planet, peace, and partnership—collectively known as the five Ps.

By adopting the 2030 Agenda with its 17 SDGs and the Paris Climate Agreement, UN member states effectively created a framework for national action and global cooperation on sustainable development, while the Paris Agreement committed signatory countries to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by the middle of the century.



SDG 13 on climate change specifically links to the Paris Agreement noting that the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change “is the primary international, intergovernmental forum for negotiating the global response to climate change.”



Despite the interconnectivity and clear aims of these global goals, stakeholders seem to lack a shared understanding of how the 17 SDGs can be operationalized.

The Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change call for deep transformations that require complementary actions by governments, civil society, science, and business.



IIASA contributed to a new study outlining six major transformations that will be required to achieve these ambitious goals. “The 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement have given the world an aspirational narrative and an actionable agenda to achieve a just, safe, and sustainable future for all within planetary boundaries.



The six transformations provide an integrated and holistic framework for action that reduces the complexity, yet encompasses the 17 SDGs, their 169 targets, and the Paris Agreement.



They provide a new approach to shift from incremental to transformational change; to identify synergies using sustainable development pathways; formulate actionable roadmaps; and a focus on inter-relationships to uncover multiple benefits and synergies,” explains study co-author Nebojsa Nakicenovic, executive director of The World in 2050 (TWI2050) research initiative at IIASA.” [and long time IPCC author and activist].

The origin of the 2 degrees meme goes back to economist William Nordhaus in 1975, in a working paper for IIASA):

CAN WE CONTROL CARBON DIOXIDE? William D. Nordhaus June 1975



“ IIASA is a non-governmental institution funded by scientific organizations in its member countries, which currently include: Austria, Brazil, China, Egypt, Finland, Germany, India (Observer), Indonesia, Iran, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Norway, Republic of Korea, Russia, South Africa, Sweden, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, the USA, and Vietnam. Funding for the Institute also comes from contracts, grants, and donations from governments, international organizations, academia, business, and individuals. “

“Pursuing the six transformations will require deep, deliberate, long-term structural changes in resource use, infrastructure, institutions, technologies, and social relations, which have to happen in a relatively short time window.



Previous societal transformations, like industrialization in 19th century Europe, were initiated by technological changes like the steam engine and were largely undirected, while 20th century technologies like semiconductors, the Internet and Global Positioning Systems, were promoted through directed innovation to meet military aims.



The authors emphasize that it is crucial that SDG transformations are formally directed in order to meet time-bound, quantitative targets, such as net-zero carbon emissions by mid-century.



“By achieving change in these six key areas, we can save both people and planet. To deliver on both ambitious climate targets and meet all the Sustainable Development Goals, we identify very concrete levers that governments can pull.”

Pretty clear where they are going with this, it is UN policy and politicians have always been



on-board. Co-author, ecologist Johan Rockstrom, is now Co-Director at Potsdam with economist Otto Edenhofer.

"How green is St Greta’s Ark? Er, not very","Michael St George Is A Freelance Writer Arguing For Minimal-State, Low-Tax, Free-Markets Minarchist-Libertarianism., He Tweets As, Laura Perrins, Chris Mcgovern, Andrew Cadman, Karen Harradine, John Redwood, Our Readers",2019-08-20 07:49:03+00:00,"LAST Wednesday, in a blaze of unremittingly fawning publicity and uncritical adulation of which even Moses descending from Mount Sinai with the tablets bearing the Ten Commandments would have been envious, the good ship Mazilia – or, as I prefer to call it in view of its almost quasi-religious mission, ‘Greta’s Ark’ – set sail from Plymouth bound for New York, carrying no less a personage, if you believe the Green hype, than putative Saviour of the World, diminutive, pigtailed ‘climate activist’ Greta Thunberg, aged 16.

There’s much about this stunt and its main protagonist to mock. But just for the purposes of this article, ignore for a moment both the grotesque cynicism of egregiously exploiting a clearly troubled and vulnerable child to advance an eco-totalitarian political agenda, and the incongruity that few of us can whistle up a $4million, 18-metre (60ft) yacht from Prince Albert of Monaco to cross the Atlantic to assuage our enviro-guilt, and consider just one question.

Precisely how green is the Blessed Greta’s planet-saving maritime odyssey?

Initially, let’s hopefully forestall any potential criticism for mixing up the terminology. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is an invisible, colourless, odourless 0.04 per cent trace gas essential to all plant life on Earth – though that, apparently, has not stopped Greta’s mother, a well-known Left-‘Liberal’ activist called Marlena Ernman, from saying her daughter can see it. Truly do the righteous have bestowed upon them gifts denied to the rest of us.

Carbon (C) on the other hand, is the predominant element in coal. Which is why the Green movement always uses the language of ‘carbon’-footprint or ‘carbon’-free, when they actually mean CO2. Because in the public mind, carbon is nasty black stuff, isn’t it, while wanting, on spurious scientific grounds, to reduce the Earth’s capacity for plant and crop growth perhaps isn’t a good look.

First, how did Greta get to Plymouth? On foot? By bike? On a magic carpet borne aloft by unicorns? Or perhaps, more prosaically, not by ‘carbon’-free means at all, but by using the same fossil-fuel powered transport that we’re enjoined to eschew on pain of eternal eco-damnation?

Next, Greta’s Ark required the assistance of other vessels to undock her and tow her out of Plymouth. Oddly, this was not accomplished by several longboats manned by brawny matelots lustily belting out a traditional sea-shanty, but by a couple of RIBs. They may have electric engines, but ‘carbon’-free their production ain’t.

Let’s look at the supposedly ‘zero-emissions’, ‘carbon’-free yacht itself. It’s built of carbon fibre. (Remember, we sceptics aren’t the ones who started the misuse of scientific terminology for political effect.) Now, the production process for building a carbon-fibre yacht is estimated to be around 14 times as energy-intensive, and thus in ‘carbon’, i.e. CO2, emissions, as that for building one of equivalent length in steel. Not only that. The epoxy resins used in the construction of Greta’s Ark are different and are all organic materials made from petroleum and significant amounts of natural gas.

Some intriguing revelations about the crewing arrangements emerged soon after departure. It turns out that the three westbound crossing crew will be flying back from New York to Europe, while the replacement crew of five will be flying from Europe to New York for the return passage.

Hilarious

Greta's boat trip to the US might emit 6x a flight, because the 5 people taking the boat back will fly over to NYC https://t.co/6tiHcEz7It — Bjorn Lomborg (@BjornLomborg) August 16, 2019

So that’s three transatlantic flights for Greta’s Ark westbound crew to return from New York, plus five more for its replacement eastbound crew to get to New York. I’m guessing those flights won’t be in Economy, either. What’s their ‘carbon’-footprint? Why can’t she just fly to New York with her father? Or even address the United Nations via Skype?

Even though this eco-boondoggle has its own website on which the yacht’s progress can be tracked, some of us prefer to access more independent sources of information. So it was some surprise to see that, last Friday, on the Marine Traffic website, it appeared that the yacht’s position had stopped being reported at 0132 BST on Thursday morning, a mere 9½ hours after leaving Plymouth, and still identifiably in the English Channel Western Approaches.

Which at the time struck me as slightly odd; as did the fact that, as far as I know – and I’ll happily stand corrected if wrong – there were no news broadcasts from the air filming the yacht at sea. Given the obsequious near-24/7 coverage pre-departure, I mused, wouldn’t one have expected at least Sky News and the BBC to have arranged that, when the yacht was still only about 1½ to 2 hours flying time at most from either Cornwall or Brittany?

Fast forward to Saturday, and a possible answer, with a picture transmitted from Greta’s Ark itself. Look closely at the right-hand image.

So yesterday Greta Thunberg shared her boat's position (first pic) and tweeted a photo (second pic). Given the position, what is that in the background? There have been unproven rumours of a powered chase boat. Any thoughts? Seems rather close. pic.twitter.com/sd2cGMy48W — Tony Roberts (@T_Roberts2019) August 17, 2019

What’s that in the top right-hand corner? Why, yes, it looks for all the world like a chase boat. Is this the way she’s being ‘accompanied by her father Svante Thunberg and filmmaker Nathan Grossman’? If so, that looks distinctly fossil-fuel powered.

Add all these up – the construction, the crew flights, the possibility, though denied, of a chase boat – and suddenly this venture doesn’t look anything like as green as it’s made out to be. But in this inversion of the fable of The Emperor’s New Clothes, we aren’t allowed to say so.

This entire eco-stunt, the sacerdotal reverence with which it’s being treated, and the invective heaped on those who dare challenge it, is in many ways an ideal metaphor for how deep-Green ideology has now acquired all the characteristics of a religious cult.

Like other pre-Enlightenment belief systems, it posits a prelapsarian state of grace, a pristine, innocent, nature-harmonious Rousseau-ean past which has been corrupted by modernity, industrialisation and capitalism, notwithstanding their having wrought in just 250 years an improvement in the human condition unprecedented in previous millennia.

It holds that the restoration of environmental equilibrium, the reversal of Man’s Fall from the Garden of Eden, requires above all sacrifice and submission to an elite, who will dispense indulgences – aka ‘carbon’-credits – while intolerantly silencing and excommunicating the heretics.

If the contradictions behind the Odyssey of the Greta’s Ark help more people to see that more clearly, then it may yet prove beneficial. Though mercifully not in the way it intends.

Rush Transcript:

Right now we are down 93. A few minutes ago we were down 140.

>> The g7 meeting starts tomorrow and France’s president macron wants world leaders to put the fires in the amazon rain forest at the top of the agenda. We have seen a lot of coverage of this recently. Those fires are ongoing. Joining us, climate depot founder. The fires are getting political. I see a clash coming at the g7 between especially the europeans who are dead set against climate change and President Trump. There’s Politics coming up here.

>> There is. The first thing you got to understand, they are punishing Brazil’s leadership for threatening to pull out of the u.n. Paris agreement, for not accepting the scientific consensus, and they have actually distorted the fires here. NASA just came out and said historically, the fires in the amazon are not unprecedented, they are only up a huge amount from last year but they are historically low and only the biggest since 2013. Brazil is being punished because of these fires because of their stance on climate change. President Trump, the same way they punished President Trump. He’s going to this meeting and he’s been vilified for years for the same exact issue. Of course, trump doesn’t help himself by, you know, his demeanor with some of the world leaders. But in the case, you know, in the case of Brazil and trump, they will sort of be on the outs at this g7 summit by all the other leaders, particularly macron. Stuart: guaranteed. Now, I’m sure you saw it. Bernie Sanders submits his green plan, his climate change plan. $16 trillion worth of cost right there. Then we heard that the democrat national committee is not going to have a single issue debate. They were going to have a single debate on climate change. Now they’re not going to do it. Seems to me that the party, the democrats, don’t want an intense discussion of climate change because the country’s not behind it. What say you?

>> Absolutely, yeah. The climate candidate, governor inslee, just dropped out. He was at .2% at the latest Iowa poll. The day after he drops out, the dnc not only do they not have a debate, but biden’s campaign is quoted as saying a climate debate specifically focused on that is quote, dangerous territory for the democrats. This goes on the heels of even MSNBC saying that climate is a ratings killer, whenever they cover the issue. So the democrats are terrified of being seen as the climate-only party and bernie is just stepping up to the plate and trying to out aoc, aoc on the green New Deal, coming up with an even more expensive and ambitious plan. Stuart: is it $16 trillion? That was for bernie’s plan.

>> $16.3 trillion or something. Yes. Stuart: over a ten-year period, I think.

>> Yes. He also has magical thinking. 3% of our energy comes from solar and wind. By 2030 he wants it to be 100% of our electricity. This is fantasy thinking. He also wants to punish fossil fuel companies, start prosecuting them for the damage they have caused allegedly. He also is going to give $200 billion to the u.n. Green climate fund. This is a wish list of all the climate activists and political left and it’s really designed just to pressure the Democratic Party and particularly Joe Biden to kow-tow to the Democratic Party climate interests. Stuart: I think it’s a bad political strategy. Even the activists in the party who run the primaries, I don’t see them going for a $16 trillion climate plan and $31 trillion Medicare for all plan. I just don’t see that. I think they have gone so far out of line with the rest of the party that I don’t think they are going to win on this one.

>> No. And I think it’s pretty transparent. There’s a whole bunch of non-climate stuff in bernie’s plan, as there was aoc. This has nothing to do with the climate. This is using the climate scare to get this radical agenda across. I think it’s even scaring the quote from the biden campaign, not only was it dangerous territory but it’s dangerous territory for middle America, for expanding the Democratic Party base, and the mainstream democrats, the establishment, they are terrified of bernie. They are terrified of this issue and the way the hardcore activists want to exploit this into a wholesale change of the american economy which by the way, would have no impact on the climate even if they are right on the science which they’re not, using the epa’s own model. There would be no impact on temperatures 100 years from now

A panel of the Democratic National Committee on Thursday rejected a proposal to host a single-issue debate on the climate crisis. – Excerpt: Inslee had no impact on front runner Biden: Symone Sanders, a senior adviser of presidential candidate Joe Biden, was among those who urged the DNC on Thursday to vote down a climate debate, saying it would be “dangerous territory in the middle of a Democratic primary process.” That contrasts with what Biden had earlier said during a campaign stop in Iowa this summer. The former vice president had endorsed having a climate debate, telling Greenpeace, “I’m all in.”

Even EPA Climate Models Show The ‘Green New Deal’ Would Have No Detectable Impact On Global Temps

GREEN REVOLUTION? SOLAR & WIND PRODUCED JUST 3% OF GLOBAL ENERGY – Wind and solar energy generation is growing, but it’s still an incredibly small part of the global energy mix, according to statistics compiled by the oil giant BP. Meanwhile, fossil fuels — coal, natural gas and oil — accounted for 85% of global energy consumption in 2018, BP reported Tuesday as part of its annual energy report. In fact, BP reported the U.S. led the world in oil and natural gas production growth. U.S. petroleum output saw the biggest annual growth ever recorded in any country, BP said. In other words, shale is booming. The U.S. surpassed Saudi Arabia and Russia in 2018 to become the world’s largest oil-producing nation. “Oil remains the most used fuel in the energy mix,” BP reported in its annual energy review. “Coal is the second largest fuel but lost share in 2018 to account for 27%, its lowest level in 15 years. The share of natural gas increased to 24%, such that the gap between coal and gas has narrowed to three percentage points.”

EIA data 2018: Wind & solar met 3% of U.S. energy after $50 billion in subsidies – Fossil Fuels 81%– The EIA (U.S. Energy Info Admin) AEO 2019 report shows that in year 2018 wind and solar energy resources provide about 3% of U.S. total energy consumption while fossil fuel energy resources provide about 81% of total energy use.PTC (Production Tax Credit) subsidies for renewable solar and wind projects in the U.S. have now reached about $50 billion dollars in cumulative payments through year 2018 with these resources providing about 3% of our countries total energy consumption in that year…Additionally these annual wind and solar subsidiies now total more than $8 billion dollars per year.",1

Sen. Sanders: Climate change is not a hoax because very serious reality for the planet…Climate change is real and it is causes deficit stating problems in our country and all over the world…We need bold and aggressive action to combat climate change.

Steve Doocy: There you’ve got Bernie Sanders yesterday unveiling his plan for a Green New Deal. The newest green New Deal. Promising to combat climate change to the tune of over $16 trillion. Here to break down the details Marc Morano, Publisher of Climate Depot and author of the Politically Incorrect Guide to Climate Change. Good morning to you.

Marc Morano: >> Good morning, Steve. Happy to be here.

Steve Doocy: if all this stuff that Bernie wants, went into effect, how would it affect the climate?

Marc Morano: “If you go out fifth to 100 years, using the EPA’s climate models and assuming they are correct on the science. If you assume Al Gore is correct you would not be able to measure a temperature difference in 100 years based on the UN climate deal, the Paris agreement. It’s pure climate symbolism. Their own science supports that this is not about the science or climate change.

Steve Doocy: okay. So, let’s talk a little bit about what’s in it. He wants 100 percent renewable energy. Cut domestic emissions by 71%. Create 526 billion-dollar electric grid. On the big screen right now, if we could go back one, let’s look at how they would pay for it. 6.4 trillion from the sale of clean energy. 1.2 trillion from military cuts. 3.1 trillion in fossil fuel litigation. So they are going to sue the oil companies and 2.3 trillion raised from taxes on new Jobs. What do you think of that?

Marc Morano: It’s a massive restructuring. Interesting thing is suing the fossil fuel companies. First of all, fossil fuels provide more than 80% of the U.S. Energy, global energy. Solar and wind that he wants to by 2030 have 100 percent essentially renewables powering our economy — are 3% according to the U.S. Information Agency. He is going to turn 3% (solar and wind), somehow to into 100 percent magically at the same time go after fossil fuels which means prices are going to go up for everyone, hey, guess what? Energy price goes up. Bernie has the solution. He will have the government subsidize people who can’t pay so he is going to control it on one hand an subsidize it. It’s the perfect central planner’s dream. Perfect control over the energy economy with this plan.

Steve Doocy: He already endorsed AOC’s green New Deal. What’s the difference?

Marc Morano: The difference is this is even more ambitious. Bernie doesn’t want to be outdone by an upstart like AOC. He is coming out with his more aggressive, more expensive, more sweeping plan. So now the burden is back on AOC is she going to come back and compete with Bernie here” I don’t know, Bernie is now the king of the Green New Deals.

The U.S. surpassed Saudi Arabia and Russia in 2018 to become the world’s largest oil-producing nation. “Oil remains the most used fuel in the energy mix,” BP reported in its annual energy review. “Coal is the second largest fuel but lost share in 2018 to account for 27%, its lowest level in 15 years. The share of natural gas increased to 24%, such that the gap between coal and gas has narrowed to three percentage points.”

EIA data 2018: Wind & solar met 3% of U.S. energy after $50 billion in subsidies – Fossil Fuels 81% – The EIA (U.S. Energy Info Admin) AEO 2019 report shows that in year 2018 wind and solar energy resources provide about 3% of U.S. total energy consumption while fossil fuel energy resources provide about 81% of total energy use.PTC (Production Tax Credit) subsidies for renewable solar and wind projects in the U.S. have now reached about $50 billion dollars in cumulative payments through year 2018 with these resources providing about 3% of our countries total energy consumption in that year…Additionally these annual wind and solar subsidiies now total more than $8 billion dollars per year.",1

Marc Morano Appears on FNC’s ‘Tucker Carlson Tonight’ To Discuss Climate Change

RUSH TRANSCRIPT:

Tucker Carlson: [Laughs] I mean, they be climate change is an existential threat. I’m certainly open-minded. But if it is, then why do none of the democratic responses seem very serious? None of them include, for example, ceasing to fly on private aircraft, which every single one of those people does all the time. Instead, their proposals entail making that more powerful shutting down any proposals that make people’s lives worse? First was a ban on plastic straws plastic bags.

This week, the Federal Energy Star program recommended that American Center thermostats to 82 degrees at night in the summer for the sake of stopping global warming. Okay, you first Marc Morano is the publisher of climate depot and the author of the politically incorrect guide to climate change. He joins us today, Mark, thanks a lot for coming on. Tonight. So there is this weird disconnect between the nature of the threat which is terrifying, it’s it’s Godzilla basically going to destroy all of us. And their proposals which are petty and small bore and disconnected from science.”

Marc Morano: “Yes, they are. In fact, the best quote, was a University of Pennsylvania scientist, a geologist who said even if we faced the climate catastrophe that they claim, none of the proposals offered by the EPA, the United Nations or the green new deal would have any impact on the climate, if in fact Carbon Dioxide was the control knob of the climate. It’s pure symbolism when it comes to the climate. And that’s what’s so shocking. The green new deal is nothing more than the same solutions. They were peddling in the 1960s and 70s. For the overpopulation scare for the resource scare with limited resources.

Tucker Carlson: Peak Oil.

Marc Morano: Yeah, all of that is the same exact solution. They’re using is global warming as the latest environmental scare to have the same solutions of wealth redistribution, sovereignty, limiting treaties, and massive intervention is central planning.

Tucker Carlson: That’s so actual scientists have noted, obviously, that if you’re worried about carbon, you probably should plant more trees that that might be practical. There’s zero interest that I can see it for any of these people in doing that.

Marc Morano: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Governor California climate champion, big champion of the Green New Deal-style proposals. He proposed to California when he was governor in a video address to the state that they should air dry their clothes on hang on a hanger for six months on the clothesline — for six months in order to reduce their carbon footprint. At the same time, he was flying a daily jet to the governor’s mansion to his house. But for Arnold Schwarzenegger, the governor’s mansion was a step-down with the quality of his life. So he daily commuted from his home, but told Californians that they should have air dry their clothes on lines outside.

Marc Morano: By the way, in California mentioning energy store and these regulations. The state proposed emergency control over people’s thermostats in 2008, in order to get to control the energy flow of California and this was even the New York Times balked at this and said this is the outer limits remember the outer limits something’s gonna be taking over your CV to government wanted to take over. But mandatory There was such outrage, they stopped that. And that’s the problem. Now we’re facing with these ENERGY STAR regulations. It’s a creeping thing. It’s what’s voluntary now maybe going to be mandatory under the Green New Deal.

Tucker Carlson: So, why wouldn’t Republicans, and I doubt they’re clever enough to think of this on their own. But why when it some sponsor legislation that bans the use of private air travel for people who are concerned about, or how about all private air travel? To see who votes for it?

Marc Morano: That would be a fantastic idea that the Republican Party most of their time, they don’t want to deal with this climate issue at all. Even Trump administration cabinet members are silent. Trump himself is the only one who really wants to speak and push back on this agenda.

Tucker Carlson: So that’s part of the problem is just want to lower capital gains tax,

Marc Morano: They want to talk about the regulatory impact, but they don’t want to go at the heart of it. Banning private jets is a fantastic idea because it would expose them all. Bernie Sanders himself — Even Hillary staffers talks about how much he demanded that in order to campaign for had to be on private jets. He spent millions on private jets back and forth During his 2016 campaign

Tucker Carlson: They are lecturing the rest of us who dare criticize Al Gore for having the largest house in the state of Tennessee and flying back and forth on a private plane. We were the bad ones were noting that.

Marc Morano: It’s nauseating, but it’s not going anywhere anytime soon. 16-year old climate activist Greta Thunberg is taking a yacht across the Atlantic because she doesn’t want to fly. First of all, the yacht is made out of carbon fiber. But they are going to have to fly the crew back to you Europe. There are going to be all sorts of flights associated with her voyage, but the symbolism of her on a yacht is all that matters. It’s all they care about.

Tucker Carlson: Marc, Thank you. Thank you.

‘Practice What You Preach’: Student Asks Bernie Sanders About His Own Fossil Fuel Use. Here’s How He Responded,,2019-08-22 00:00:00,"Democratic 2020 presidential candidate Bernie Sanders responded to a student who asked him a question about practicing what he preaches on fossil fuel use during a Thursday town hall in Chico, California, saying he would not stop using fossil fuels.

WATCH:

“So, I’m a senior at CSU Chico, [inaudible] major,” said the student. “So, my question is, you seem adamant about climate change.”

“Of course,” the student continued after Sanders assented. “So what ways would you take to practice what you preach if you were to become president? I know it’s stressful, and you have to travel a lot, and you have to use fossil fuels …”

“No, I’m not going to walk to California,” Sanders said to laughter from the audience. “Look, you know, I understand that. We do the best we can as an example, but I’m not going to sit here and tell you that we’re not going to use fossil fuels …”

During a Thursday speech, Sanders also said that the U.S. “must transition away from fossil fuels, period. End of discussion. There ain’t no middle ground.” (RELATED: ‘He Is The Enemy Of Every Entrepreneur’ — Home Depot Founders Blast Socialism, Issue Dire Warning For Bernie Supporters)

Bernie Sanders Unveils Massive $16 Trillion Green New Deal Plan,Hannah Bleau,2019-08-22 00:00:00,"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) released his plans for a Green New Deal, accompanied by a monstrous $16 trillion price tag.

Sanders calls climate change the “single greatest challenge facing our country,” citing “extreme” weather phenomena like floods, droughts, wildfires, and hurricanes, despite the fact that those occurrences have existed since the beginning of time. Sanders even suggests that climate change has a racial element to it, arguing the effects of climate change affect “communities of color,” particularly.

He warns “immediate” action is necessary, likening the “crisis” to the challenges former President Franklin D. Roosevelt faced in the 1940s, leading to the creation of the New Deal.

Sanders’ plan promises to effectively reverse the “crisis” while simultaneously creating 20 million jobs and reaching “100 percent renewable energy for electricity and transportation by no later than 2030 and complete decarbonization by at least 2050,” per the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s guidelines.

A $16.3 trillion public investment is necessary to make those goals a reality, which falls in line with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), who said any viable climate change plan needed to come with a $10 trillion price tag – at least– in order to “have a shot.”

Sanders says we must “directly invest a historic $16.3 trillion public investment toward these efforts, in line with the mobilization of resources made during the New Deal and WWII, but with an explicit choice to include black, indigenous and other minority communities who were systematically excluded in the past.”

However, he claims the investment will effectively “pay for itself” over 15 years and that the price of inaction will cost far more, citing experts who say that doing nothing will cost the U.S. “$34.5 trillion in economic activity” by 2100. He plans to pay for the $16.3 trillion plan with additional taxes on the fossil fuel industry, and he plans to “prosecute and sue” them for the damage ravaged on the planet.

Sanders’ exhaustive plan covers virtually every angle of the climate change “crisis,” from promising to “fully electrify and decarbonize” the transportation sector, to investing $1.12 billion in “tribal land access and extension programs,” to providing “oral translation assistance to USDA, FDA, and DOJ offices for non-English speaking farmers,” to pouring $200 billion in the Green Climate Fund:

Despite the major shortcomings of the Paris Climate Agreement, one primary reason why the globe was able to come together to sign the Paris Climate Agreement was that major developed nations like the United States finally recognized that they had an outsized role in the creation of the climate crisis, and an outsized obligation to less industrialized nations to help them achieve the same kind of carbon pollution emissions reductions while improving the quality of life in those countries. In order to help countries of the global south with climate adaptation efforts, the U .S . will invest $ 200 billion in the Green Climate Fund for the equitable transfer of renewable technologies, climate adaptation, and assistance in adopting sustainable energies. U.S. leadership can ensure that the developing world secures reliable electricity, reduces poverty and pollution-related fatalities, creates greater net employment, and improves living standards all while reducing greenhouse- gas emissions.

Sanders also uses his plan as a pitch to drastically expand existing entitlement programs, like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Low -Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP).

The plan states in part:

Energy assistance. While we do not expect energy prices to spike because the federal government is going to weatherize homes, electrify heating, and keep electricity prices stable, we still want to ensure that families are protected during the transition. We will expand the Low -Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) by $ 25 billion to help low-income families pay their heating and cooling bills. Additionally, the program will be expanded to provide 10 percent of program costs for maintenance of new efficient heating and cooling systems and technical assistance for the installation and use of new furnaces, heat pumps, boilers, and other upgrades for the duration of the 10-year transition. Ensure a hunger- free transition. Because the cost of energy and food are so intertwined, we will provide $ 215 . 8 billion for free, universal school meals, including breakfast, lunch and snacks. We will expand the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) by $311billion to increase the benefits from the ” thrifty plan which provides inadequate benefits to the more generous low-cost food plan, include those with incomes up to 200 percent of the federal poverty line, remove punitive work requirements, remove barriers for college students to access SNAP , and ensure are not denied benefits due to past interaction with the criminal justice system . We will also expand the SNAP program and benefits to the people of Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa so they are on par with the benefits in the continental United States.

“We need a president who has the courage, the vision, and the record to face down the greed of fossil fuel executives and the billionaire class who stand in the way of climate action,” his plan states.

“We need a president who welcomes their hatred. Bernie will lead our country to enact the Green New Deal and bring the world together to defeat the existential threat of climate change,” it continues.

The release of Sanders’ plan comes on the heels of Gov. Jay Inslee’s (D) departure from the presidential race. Inslee was the only candidate to build his entire campaign on the sole issue of climate change.

“I have seven grandchildren, and I’m going to be damned if I’m going to leave them a planet that is unhealthy and uninhabitable,” Sanders told the New York Times.",1
‘Only you know if we did it’: Scientists write dire letter to the future about climate change,Joe Romm,2019-08-21 00:00:00,"Scientists are gathering in Iceland Sunday to memorialize Okjökull — the country’s first glacier to be destroyed by global warming.

Okjökull, nicknamed Ok, lost its status as a glacier 2014. The monument being unveiled at the “funeral” is inscribed with an ominous warning, titled “A letter to the future.”

“Ok is the first Icelandic glacier to lose its status as a glacier,” it states in English and Icelandic. “In the next 200 years, all our glaciers are expected to follow the same path. This monument is to acknowledge that we know what is happening and know what needs to be done. Only you know if we did it.”

Only future generations will “know if we did it” — if we melted all of the glaciers, raised sea level tens of feet, destroyed all of our coastal cities, and ruined our livable climate.

But the truth is that human-caused global warming is disintegrating Arctic glaciers and the great ice sheets at such a rapid and accelerating pace that we will all know within a decade whether humanity has acted fast enough to avert catastrophe.",1
