"Candidates scramble to qualify for presidential debates; radio show host Chris Plante weighs in.Democrats may have just clobbered their chances of victory in 2020. While all eyes were trained on President Donald Trump’s furious confrontation with China last week, Democrat officials at their party’s convention in San Francisco again voted down a resolution calling for a candidate debate on climate change. That could prove a dire error.The decision to prevent a climate debate will almost certainly encourage a third-party candidate. And that candidate could sabotage Democrats’ chances of retaking the White House.Who might it be? It could be former Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, who ran to highlight climate change but recently withdrew from the Democratic nomination race. Or maybe a billionaire like Tom Steyer or Michael Bloomberg, who both similarly want to press Democrats to focus on global warming. They might not expect to win, but their campaigns could elevate the climate discussion.MANDY GUNASEKARA: US AIR IS CLEANEST ON RECORD – TRUMP IMPROVING OUR ENVIRONMENT AND ECONOMY Remember that the Green Party put Jill Stein forward in 2016. Though few took Stein’s candidacy seriously, in the end she attracted 1.4 million votes. In the aftermath of the election, some blamed her for Hillary Clinton’s loss, pointing out that in the critical swing states of Michigan and Wisconsin, Trump’s margin of victory was less than the number of votes won by Stein.Since 2016, the climate issue has taken center stage in Democrats’ platforms, becoming especially important to young voters who are playing a growing role in our elections. A Pew Center survey reports that voters under the age of 53 cast 62.2 million votes in the 2018 midterm elections, more than the 60.1 million recorded by people 53 and older. In the midterm contest, Gen Z and millennials made up 25 percent of the total votes cast; their share will increase in 2020.Young voters are energized, and especially about global warming. A Harvard Kennedy School survey found climate change to be the third most important issue to voters under 30, behind immigration and the economy.The decision to prevent a climate debate will almost certainly encourage a third-party candidate. And that candidate could sabotage Democrats’ chances of retaking the White House.For proof of the importance of young climate enthusiasts, look no further than the Sunrise Movement, an activist group begun only two years ago that has attracted tens of thousands of followers and staged protests in 250 cities around the country. It also takes credit for launching the Green New Deal, which, though widely mocked on the right, has been embraced by nearly every Democratic senator running for 2020.Sunrise representatives in attendance at the San Francisco convention erupted after the DNC vote to block a climate debate, chanting “Failure of leadership” and “we can’t wait” to protest the complicity of DNC Chair Tom Perez in the decision; many stormed out of the meeting.Their anger was echoed on social media.Elizabeth Warren tweeted: “Climate change is an existential threat that threatens (sic) all of us….That’s why we need to have a #ClimateDebate.”Al Gore chimed in, tweeting: “The Democrats’ decision to sabotage a #ClimateDebate is extremely disappointing. Voters all over the U.S. are demanding we focus on the biggest threat to our nation and humanity’s future and prioritize solving the climate crisis instead of continuing business as usual.”The hashtag #ClimateDebate trended on twitter in the wake of the vote, with nearly every Democrat hopeful weighing in. Climate warriors Greenpeace participated, tweeting “We just got word that the DNC voted to block a #climatedebate. We can’t begin to tell you how outraged we are… Our political system is failing us, and it’s failing a whole generation of people fighting for a better world.”Blocking a climate debate was risky for Perez and other Democratic Party officials. They must have known the decision would infuriate young voters, but they also recognized that such a forum could trip up their candidates. They knew that their over-the-top remedies to stem global warming might turn off much-needed independents, guaranteeing Trump’s reelection.Consider Bernie Sanders’ most recent plan to combat rising emissions, which is projected to cost $16 trillion. In a recent interview, even MSNBC’s liberal Chris Hayes sounded anxious about the scope of Sanders’ proposal, which he described as “really large.” He asked how Sanders would pay for such a mammoth overhaul, which includes “replacing every old diesel school bus, replacing old mobile homes in the country,” in addition to “a federal takeover of the whole thing, that's essentially a Tennessee Valley Authority extension for the whole country…”In a rambling response, Sanders explained that his program will be paid for with the money the federal government will make producing sustainable energy (though wind and power production still require subsidies), the elimination of “massive” tax breaks now given to fossil fuel companies, the taxes received from the 20 million new “good-paying union jobs” sure to be created, cuts to military spending, and higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy.Time does not allow a thorough debunking of this proposal, except to note that green activist group Oil Change International estimates the “subsidies” given to oil and coal producers at $20 billion annually, that the taxes that might be collected on 20 million union workers earning $100,000 apiece would be about $340 million, and that a 50 percent hike in the individual income taxes paid by every American would yield only about $1 trillion. In other words, the numbers don’t add up.Bernie is not alone, of course. Beto O’Rourke has laid out a $5 trillion plan, and Elizabeth Warren has not one but five climate proposals in the hopper. Joe Biden has put forward a plan that only costs $1.7 trillion, earning him a “C+” grade from the liberal scolds at Mother Jones. And let’s not forget the Green New Deal, estimated to cost north of $50 trillion.Perez and the Democrat machine are in a tight spot. Either allow Sanders and his rivals to alienate moderate voters by pushing programs that cost the moon, or risk providing a platform for a third party “green” candidate who can mobilize young voters.On the other hand, the debate could prove illuminating. In the MSNBC interview, Bernie starts off admitting, “Well, the first thing is we cannot not afford it.” Bernie is confused and confusing.",1

"Fox News Flash top headlines for August 24 are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.comThe Democratic National Committee voted down a resolution at its summer meeting in San Francisco Saturday that would have freed the party's presidential candidates to participate in unofficial “multi-candidate” forums focused solely on climate change.The national party committee voted 222-137 against a resolution that would have encouraged candidates to essentially disregard a rule set by DNC Chairman Tom Perez that barred them from appearing on the same stage at the same time during so-called ""non-party events.""The vote drew a rebuke from left-wing environmental activists, such as the Sunrise Movement, who say the party leadership is ignoring young voters' priorities.PROTESTS ERUPT AFTER DNC PUTS KIBOSH ON CLIMATE CHANGE-FOCUSED DEBATE""The Democratic Party needs the energy and motivation of young people to win in 2020,"" said Evan Weber, Sunrise Movement political director. ""The energy around this issue has been incredibly clear, yet Tom Perez keeps shooting the party in the foot by rejecting that energy and turning it away.""Similar protests broke out Thursday when the DNC's resolutions committee voted 17-8 against holding single-issue debates.Perez has said throughout the primary campaign that he opposes making any of the party's official debates revolve around a single issue. Perez said this week that he wants the widest possible audiences for primetime debates, with voters getting to see candidates address a full range of issues. The next official Democratic debate is scheduled for Sept. 12 in Houston, with a second night of debates scheduled for Sept. 13 if enough candidates can qualify.WATCH: TOP DEM SENATOR SCOLDS KIDS PUSHING FOR CLIMATE CHANGE LEGISLATION, TELLS WHIPPERSNAPPERS, 'I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING'Perez has encouraged candidates to participate in issue-specific forums that don't involve multiple candidates being on the same stage together. CNN, for example, has planned a climate forum in September, with at least 10 candidates expected to appear individually and discuss climate policy in-depth. Powerful organizations such as the National Education Association and the AFL-CIO already have hosted such events focused on their policy priorities.Perez aides also noted this week that he's gotten requests from different interest groups requesting full-fledged debates on civil rights, guns, poverty and issues affecting older Americans.GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe wrangling this week came in the wake of Washington Gov. Jay Inslee ending his presidential bid that he'd hinged on a pledge to make climate action the nation's top priority. Inslee was able to attract more than 130,000 individual donors — the mark the DNC set as one qualifying metric for the September debate stage. But Inslee was well shy of an additional requirement to hit 2% support in at least four national or early nominating state polls from reputable pollsters.Inslee had repeatedly called on Perez to dedicate a DNC-sponsored debate to climate action.",1
"Brazil's president has rejected calls from European leaders for swift international action to address fires scorching the Amazon rainforest; Kitty Logan reports.President Trump extended an offer of aid to Brazil's president on Friday should the government of the South American nation need help containing massive forest fires sweeping across the Amazon rainforest. Trump tweeted that he spoke with President Jair Bolsonaro and touted “very exciting” trade prospects between the U.S. and Brazil, adding that the relationship between the two nations was “perhaps stronger than ever.” ""I told him if the United States can help with the Amazon Rainforest fires, we stand by ready to assist!"" Trump said on Twitter Friday evening. Bolsonaro retweeted Trump’s message. AMAZON FIRES TURN POLITICAL AS BRAZIL'S PRESIDENT CALLS OUT FRANCE'S MACRONNearly 40,000 fires are incinerating Brazil’s Amazon rainforest, the latest outbreak in an overactive fire season that has charred 1,330 square miles of the rainforest this year. Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research noted an 84 percent increase compared to this same period last year. Sao Paulo was in the dark for about one hour Monday afternoon as a result of the fires about 1,600 miles away.On Friday, Bolsonaro announced that the Brazilian armed forces will step in to help public security agencies and public environmental agencies battle the fires. He also warned foreign powers against meddling in what he viewed as a domestic issue. ""The Brazilian Amazon is a heritage of our people, who will protect it from the threats of those who harm the forest with illegal actions and will react to those who intend to violate our sovereignty,"" Bolsonaro’s announcement said. Trump is traveling to Biarritz, France, next week to participate in the G7 summit, where leaders from seven of the world’s economies will discuss global economic issues. Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States are members. Climate change is on a topic on the agenda. On Thursday, French President Emmanuel Macron, the host and leader of this year’s summit, called on G7 members to discuss Amazon fires this week. Brazil is not a member of G7 and will not be present. “Our house is burning. Literally. The Amazon rain forest — the lungs which produce 20 percent of our planet’s oxygen — is on fire,” Macron said. ""It is an international crisis. Members of the G7 Summit, let's discuss this emergency first order in two days!""FRANCE THREATENS BRAZIL ON TRADE DEAL, ESCALATING TENSIONS OVER AMAZON FIRESBolsonaro slammed Macron for his “misplaced colonialist mindset” for suggesting that fires in the Amazon be discussed at G7 without representation from Brazil. Their feud carried over into Friday when Macron issued a statement, saying Bolsonaro had blatantly lied to Macron at the Osaka Summit in June over his commitment to tackling climate change, pollution and environmental destruction. Macron threatened to withdraw French support from a trade deal with South American nations and the European Union over the dispute. Bolsonaro, who has advocated against environmental conservation policies, admitted his country may not have the resources to police an area of land greater than the size of Europe. He suggested advocacy groups were starting criminal fires in the Amazon to tarnish his name, Politico reported. Reuters reported that farmers in Brazil — if not outright — had “tacit” encouragement from Bolsonaro who has maintained that the Amazon should be utilized for Brazil’s economy. The news agency reported that a so-called “Fire Day” was designated to show the president that farmers were eager to work.Fox News’ Edmund DeMarche, Lucia I.

"Daniel Turner calls Bernie Sanders' climate change plan is a 'socialist manifesto.'The ""Green New Deal"" proposed by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., seeks a complete transition to ""energy efficiency"" and ""sustainable energy"" — much of which would be owned and administered by the federal government.During an appearance on MSNBC Thursday night, Sanders told host Chris Hayes that the U.S. needed an ""aggressive"" federal approach to producing electricity and nodded after Hayes claimed he proposed a ""federal takeover of the whole thing.""Sanders agreed with Hayes' assessment that he wanted to create a ""Tennessee Valley Authority [TVA] extension for the whole country."" ""You can't nibble around the edges anymore,"" Sanders added.SANDERS RELEASES $16 TRILLION 'GREEN NEW DEAL' PLAN, PROMISES IT WILL 'PAY FOR ITSELF'The TVA is a federally owned corporation that was started in 1933 to provide flood control, electricity generation and a host of other services to the Tennessee Valley. The TVA's service area covers parts of seven southern states: Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina and Virginia.""Look, the TVA has done a lot of good work ... What we need to do is have an aggressive federal government saying that we are going to produce a massive amount of energy from solar and from wind and from other sustainable energies,"" Sanders said.In his climate plan, Sanders praised the TVA but indicated that it and other federal, administrative bodies didn't cover enough of the United States.""Currently, four federal Power Marketing Administrations [PMAs] and the Tennessee Valley Authority generate and transmit power to distribution utilities in 33 states,"" the plan read. ""We will create one more PMA to cover the remaining states and territories and expand the existing PMAs to build more than enough wind, solar, energy storage and geothermal power plants.""DANIEL TURNER: BERNIE SANDERS' GREEN NEW DEAL IS AN IMPOSSIBLE DREAM THAT WOULD BE A NIGHTMARESanders' plan would entail the federal government massively regulating the U.S. energy supply, which he said would be ""sustainable"" by 2030 ""at the latest.""""The renewable energy generated by the Green New Deal will be publicly owned, managed by the federal Power Marketing Administrations, the Bureau of Reclamation and the Tennessee Valley Authority and sold to distribution utilities with a preference for public power districts, municipally- and cooperatively-owned utilities with democratic, public ownership, and other existing utilities that demonstrate a commitment to the public interest,"" the plan read.When Hayes asked Sanders how he responded to critics who balked at the program's cost, Sanders said the country couldn't ""afford not to afford it"" because the future of the planet was at stake.Sanders has claimed that his $16 trillion plan would ""pay for itself,"" something Heritage Foundation scholar Nick Loris suggested was ridiculous.BERNIE SANDERS SIGNALS HIS ADMINISTRATION WOULD PURSUE 'CRIMINAL' CHARGES AGAINST OIL EXECUTIVES""Sanders' plan would cause energy prices to skyrocket, bankrupting families and businesses and empowering the federal government to control America’s energy economy,"" he said in a statement provided to Fox News. ""And what would we get for it? A change in the earth's temperature that’s barely measurable. The Green New Deal isn’t a 'climate thing' at all. Turns out it’s a green-glossed Trojan horse designed to increase government control over the economy.""In addition to taking over the nation's energy supply, Sanders' plan claims to end unemployment by creating 20 million jobs, provide ""massive investments in research and development"" and impose fines and litigation on the fossil fuel industry.The plan predicts that income tax revenues, penalties for fossil fuel companies, a reduced need for safety net spending, ""making the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share"" and other policy impacts would make the program pay for itself.BERNIE SANDERS: CLIMATE CHANGE POSES A BIGGER THREAT TO AMERICA THAN ISIS""The cost of inaction is unacceptable,"" the plan read. ""Economists estimate that if we do not take action, we will lose $34.5 trillion in economic activity by the end of the century. And the benefits are enormous:  by taking bold and decisive action, we will save $2.9 trillion over 10 years, $21 trillion over 30 years, and $70.4 trillion over 80 years.""The American Petroleum Institute, a trade association for the oil and gas industry, responded to Sanders in a statement to Fox News.""Pitting important environmental goals against working families who rely on affordable American energy is a false choice,"" the organization said. ""While some may use attacks on natural gas and oil to energize their political base, our industry will remain focused on providing the energy that powers America’s economy and modern lifestyle, while also continuing to lower carbon emissions beyond their current generational low.""",1
"A recent poll ranks climate change and the environment second only to healthcare among the most important issues to Democratic voters in the first-in-the-nation primary state. The hot-button topic is already a main pitch among progressive Democratic candidates flocking to the state ahead of its February primary and residents say the state’s tourism industry is directly impacted by ongoing environmental changes.GREENFIELD, N.H. – The 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls flocking to the first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire could encounter voters who say they are feeling the effects of climate change in their pocketbooks -- as they seek to woo Democrats who count the environment as a top issue.Tourism is the Granite State’s second-largest industry and accounts for a large portion of the state’s economy. The ski industry alone contributes on average about half a billion dollars a year to the state, but it’s been forced to make some changes over the years to combat a rise in winter temperatures -- an average increase of nearly six degrees since 1970.“We’re a climate-sensitive industry…we rely on cold winters and cold weather,"" Ski New Hampshire president Jessyca Keeler told Fox News. ""We did a four-year study looking at the economic impact of the ski industry in the state of New Hampshire…we can see the impacts of climate change on our operations.""
      ""The New Hampshire environmental community is very strong and Democrats seem to respond to environmental issues much more than they would probably in other parts of the country,"" said The New Hampshire Institute of Politics Executive Director Neil Levesque. Scenic landscapes like this lake near Ossipee, N.H. are easily accessible across the state to residents. (Allie Raffa/Fox News)
      OCASIO-CORTEZ, SANDERS CALL FOR CLIMATE CHANGE EMERGENCY MOBILIZATION, SEEKS A RE-DO OF FAILED GREEN NEW DEALSki resorts have experienced environmental changes like higher temperatures and shorter ski seasons, forcing them to use snow guns to keep skiers mobile on the slopes with artificial product and potentially harming industries that profit off of winter activities. They have also started offering summer activities like obstacle courses and ziplining to mitigate economic losses across the ski industry during slow winter seasons.“The rural beauty of our area is what brings people here,” said New Hampshire Democratic voter Dani Shaw. “So it’s very important that in areas that rely on tourism that we put our best foot forward."" Shaw added: ""We are a beautiful state.”

      Keeler says the losses cause a ripple effect.“If we're not doing as well that's not just impacting us, that's impacting whole areas because you're going to probably see less employment or people getting laid off…you're going to see restaurants, retail shops not doing as well. It's not just the ski industry, it impacts entire communities,” she said.A recent CNN poll ranks climate change and the environment second only to healthcare among the most important issues to Democratic voters in the Granite State, an indication of how the topic is playing a prominent role early in the 2020 contest.Democratic candidates -- and voters -- have called on the Democratic National Committee to hold a debate dedicated exclusively to climate change. Officials voted down a resolution calling for the debate Thursday, but did move forward an effort to create a “climate change council” within the Democratic party.

      “There really should be a debate just on climate change because there’s a physical, a social and an economic impact,” said George Hablen, the chairman of the Plaistow, N.H. Democrats.Meanwhile, the hot-button topic doesn't rank in the top six most important issues to the state's Republican voters.Republicans have accused Democrats of over-hyping the threat -- and have vehemently pushed back against the ""Green New Deal"" proposal embraced by progressives, pointing in part to the price tag – estimated to be about $7 trillion -- and saying it would hurt business.""I think Republicans are concerned about the environment...but the words ‘climate change’ or ‘global warming’ have become politicized...it shows this dichotomy of the country where such an issue like climate change, which could possibly be front and center, is another issue where the country splits and divides,"" said New Hampshire Institute of Politics Executive Director Neil Levesque.The views on climate change may vary depending on state and party affiliation, but one thing is clear: if candidates want to win over savvy Democratic voters in New Hampshire, they need to talk about climate change and the environment. As the state’s February primary nears, Levesque says candidates will continue to push the issue even harder to garner support in a state that’s influence can prove powerful in close election years.“New Hampshire has a long tradition of sort of taking a hard look at front runners and switching things up a little bit, and I think that the candidates here in New Hampshire know that, and that's why they're campaigning so hard here,” said Levesque.Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders often discusses the subject at his campaign rallies -- diving into his views on climate change, environmental protections and the fossil fuel industry -- while entrepreneur Andrew Yang chose the coastal town of Portsmouth, N.H. to roll out his climate policy proposal next week.

"2020 Democratic presidential contender Sen. Bernie Sanders says climate change is a bigger threat than ISIS or Al Qaeda.Back to school is big business, with Americans spending an estimated $60 billion on the latest technology, clothes, books and other items as school resumes. Just about everyone peddling a product is capitalizing on this lucrative period, including those selling political ideologies.Teen Vogue, an overtly liberal fashion magazine for girls, recently advocated for back to school “direct action” on climate change. On the to-do list: recycling programs, classroom walk-outs, confronting professors, and of course, plastic straw bans.Scholarly pursuits aren’t paramount on this “back to school” list. For example, there was no mention of studying physics to calculate the newtons in a thrust or the amps in a current. This knowledge makes quotidian realities like airplanes and electricity seem less like magic and more like science. Not “consensus” science. Actual science.PAUL BATURA: BACK-TO-SCHOOL: HOW A STRANGE, WONDERFUL TEACHER CHANGED THE COURSE OF MY LIFESpeaking of science, Teen Vogue didn’t demand greater earth science education. Students need to study real “climate change,” not the political movement, but the continual cycle that has put fossil fuels under our feet. What are rare-earth elements? Are they essential to green technology? Can we mine enough to meet the mandates of the Green New Deal? A solid history curriculum fosters intelligent discussion of the justice aspect of Teen Vogue’s desired activism. Here’s an example: extreme poverty has decreased worldwide from 40 percent in 1980 to 8 percent currently. Why?Here’s another: The Industrial Revolution was a catalyst to increased human rights, workers’ rights, and women’s rights: discuss.How can Teen Vogue encourage green activism without the requisite knowledge? Green activism isn’t about physics, earth science or history. It’s about politics, sure, but most of all it is a big business. Billions of dollars in grants are awarded to climate change studies and activists. Nonprofits raise fortunes pledging to battle climate change. It helped former Vice President Al Gore, a leading climate change prophet, make a very handsome $300 million profit.Big business needs customers, so ensuring the next generation is obsessed with climate change is smart marketing. But if Teen Vogue really believed in climate change, it would be honest with its audience and lay out real “direct action” plans. Problem is, these actions are not going to be popular with young people.For example, recycling may feel good, but facts prove it wastes energy and money, and does nothing for the planet. Here’s more: straws are only 4 percent of our plastic waste, and less than 1 percent of ocean pollution comes from America. Plastic straw bans, like recycling, are ineffective, even though these actions may feel morally satisfying. If Teen Vogue wants readers to lower their emissions, the magazine should call on them to stop streaming videos. Sites like Netflix and Amazon Prime use more energy per household than two refrigerators. Also, readers should cancel all gaming sites (which 72 percent of teens frequent) and music platforms. Sorry kids, it’s for the planet.Here’s more: electric scooters aren’t green, and in fact, they are worse for the environment than cars. Know what else is terrible for the planet? Pets.Good luck selling that message: love the Earth, get rid of your pet.Unlike cutting class or harassing teachers, the actions I’ve outlined logically result from the junk science that is the foundation of the current climate change movement.So, if you don’t do any of them, does that mean you don’t believe? No worries, neither do climate change activists. Last December 30,000 green activists flew to a conference in Poland. Next year 30,000 more will fly to Scotland. All to demand action on climate change.Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., wants action on climate change. He owns multiple homes.Recently leading green warriors like Prince Harry and Leonardo DiCaprio gathered in a Sicilian resort, arriving on 114 private planes and several diesel-guzzling mega yachts. The message? We need action on climate change.I’ll cut my footprint when you cut yours.These hypocrites don’t champion actions that stem from their beliefs. That’s too hard, so Teen Vogue calls for school boycotts. Ask teens which they would rather do to save the Earth: stop streaming Netflix or walk out of class? We know the answer, and it’s not very brave. But as the current de facto leader on green activism, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,  D-N.Y., once said: it’s better to be morally right than factually correct. We must hope that despite the prevalent liberal activism encouraging nonsensical “back to school” activism there are still young people who will study physics, earth science, and history. Educated in the richness of real facts and truths, these teens will find all they need to make the world a truly better place.",1
"Energy Secretary Rick Perry responds to Democrats' rhetoric on the campaign trail on greenhouse gas emissions and fossil fuel companies.Energy Secretary Rick Perry said Tuesday that Democrats are living in a ""fantasy world"" when it comes to their climate change rhetoric and accused them of twisting the truth to help bolster their political talking points.Perry was responding on ""America's Newsroom"" to 2020 presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who said climate change was a bigger threat to national security than ISIS or Al Qaeda while campaigning in Iowa on Sunday.""I think they live in a fantasy world. The reality is that the United States is lowering emissions -- one of the only countries in the world,"" the former Texas governor said. ""I think about all the 194 [countries] that signed onto the Paris accord, the U.S. is the one that's leading the world in reducing emissions... America [is] transitioning away from old inefficient power plants to natural gas plants.""Perry added, ""Maybe they think, they being the Democrats that are running for president, that China would be a better place for all of this manufacturing to occur. It is fantastical when you think about the true misrepresentation of the truth that the Democrats are spewing out there.""AL GORE CLAIMS HIS CLIMATE CHANGE PREDICTIONS ABOUT 2016 HAVE NOW COME TRUEHe also claimed the federal government is exploring new ways to reduce harmful emissions and said Democrats are trying to bury the truth because it conflicts with their political rhetoric.""We are addressing it. I think that's one of the things that the... media needs to take a second look at, what's going on. I'm leaving here from Pittsburgh headed to... our national energy technology lab, where we're seeing that type of technology being developed to reduce emissions -- to come up with the technologies and innovation,"" he said.""Fifteen years ago people told us that we'd found all the oil and gas that there was. There was no more. Innovation changed that -- whether it's hydraulic fracturing, directional drilling. And now natural gas is replacing a lot of those old inefficient plants and we're driving down emissions. That's the story that the Democrats don't want to talk about because it doesn't meet their narrative of going out and trying to scare the American public into potentially voting for them. I don't think the American people are going to be fooled by that rhetoric.""Perry spoke ahead of his visit with President Trump to Shell’s soon-to-be-completed Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex, which critics have said will be a major air polluter. The plant will turn natural gas deposits into plastics, though critics have called out the harmful environmental effects of plastics.Perry said the world must address the issue of plastics polluting oceans, but products made up of polyethylene are used widely, including for wind turbines, solar panels, heart valves and auto parts.""You can't have it both ways,"" Perry said, ""and the Democrats are trying to.""",1

"Fox News Flash top headlines for August 11 are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.comBrazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on Friday suggested eating less food, and therefore, defecating less, as an answer to some of the world's problems.Bolsonaro — who has come under fire in recent weeks after data showed increased deforestation of the Amazon rainforest — offered the response to a reporter who questioned if it was possible to boost the economy, feed those who are hungry and save the environment at the same time. It wasn't clear if Bolsonaro was being sarcastic.GERMAN LAWMAKERS CONSIDER 'MEAT TAX' TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE, IMPROVE ANIMAL WELFARE""It's enough to eat a little less. You talk about environmental pollution. It's enough to poop every other day,"" Bolsonaro said, according to AFP. ""That will be better for the whole world.""
      Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, pictured here during a ceremony at the Planalto Palace in Brazil last month, suggested people should go to the bathroom less as a way to help the environment.
      (REUTERS/Adriano Machado)Critics say that Bolsonaro's policies will help accelerate further deforestation of the Amazon — 60 percent of which is part of Brazil. A key regulator of the Earth's living systems, the rainforest's trees take in as much as 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide every year and release 20 percent of the planet's oxygen.TODAY'S CLIMATE CHANGE IS WORSE THAN ANYTHING EARTH HAS EXPERIENCED IN THE PAST 2,000 YEARSNew data published last week by the National Institute for Space Research, a federal Brazilian agency, showed that more rainforest was lost between May and July this year than during the same period in 2018, 2017 and 2016.In July alone, 870 square miles of vegetation was cut down — the biggest surge in deforestation rates since the institute adopted its current methodology in 2014.Bolsonaro alleged the agency might have manipulated the deforestation data to make his far-right administration look bad. He fired physicist Ricardo Galvão, who served as director of the National Institute for Space Research, after deeming the information ""doubtful.""Brazil was once heralded as a global environmental success story. But as data indicates an influx in Amazon deforestation under Bolsonaro — a climate change skeptic with a strongly pro-agrobusiness agenda — some fear what could happen to the rainforest.The Associated Press contributed to this report.",1

"Former EPA Air office deputy assistant administrator Mandy Gunasekara weighs in.Three congressional Democrats proposed a gradually-increasing carbon tax Thursday that they claimed would meet their ambitious goal of cutting carbon emissions 100 percent by 2050.The lawmakers -- Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, Dianne Feinstein of California and Rep. Jimmy Panetta of California -- argued the ""Climate Action Rebate Act"" would combat climate change while encouraging ""market-driven innovation in clean energy technologies.""“Americans want more options to purchase clean, affordable energy,"" Feinstein said in a press release. ""By placing a price on carbon, our bill encourages energy companies to take climate change seriously and reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions. It also provides families with a monthly dividend to offset price increases as we transition to cleaner alternatives.""She added, ""This is a commonsense approach to cut carbon emissions by 100 percent by 2050, and I’m proud to join with Sen. Coons and Rep. Panetta to introduce it.”The bill would rebate a majority -- 70 percent -- of revenues from the tax to low- and middle-income Americans as a monthly dividend while spending the rest on infrastructure, energy innovation, and helping communities transition to a ""cleaner energy economy.""GILLIBRAND UNVEILS $10 TRILLION PLAN TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE

      By 2030, the senators claim the bill would reduce carbon emissions by 55 percent from 2017 levels. ""We have high-confidence projections of extreme temperatures, rising sea levels, and increased frequency and intensity of storms and droughts,"" an information sheet for the bill claims. ""Failure to act now will result in more severe costs to our environment, economy, and security in the future.""According to Coons' office, the proposal is supported by DuPont, the Environmental Defense Fund, and other liberal organizations.“In order to decarbonize our global energy system, the U.S. must lead in setting reduction targets that will get us to zero carbon emissions and in developing and deploying the technologies that will form the new system,"" Armond Cohen, the executive director of the Clean Air Task Force, said in the press release.'THE FIVE' HOSTS DISCUSS SANDERS, OCASIO-CORTEZ TEAMING UP ON CLIMATE CHANGE, PARTNERSHIP'S POTENTIAL OUTCOMES""If enacted, the Climate Action Rebate Act will help prompt innovation by funding technology development and provide the certainty investors need to drive more private capital into zero carbon technologies,” Cohen said.Conservatives pushed back hard. According to Nicolas Loris, an economist at the Heritage Foundation, the carbon tax would inflict economic damage beyond what any rebate could cover.“One of the brightest spots in the economy over the last decade has been the country’s energy renaissance, so naturally the left wants to tax it, which means taxing the American people,"" Loris said in a statement to Fox News.""No rebate check will cover economic pain this legislation would inflict,"" Loris added. ""Are consumers going to receive a check every time they pay more at the grocery store, going out to eat, buying clothes, and everything else that will be more expensive because of higher energy costs? Unlikely.""MEDICAL GROUPS CALL CLIMATE CHANGE A 'HEALTH EMERGENCY' AHEAD OF DEMOCRATIC DEBATEThe legislation comes amid an internal debate over how ambitious the Democratic Party should be in combatting climate change. The ""Green New Deal,"" widely panned by conservatives, has received support from leading progressive Democratic presidential candidates.Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., proposed the ""Green New Deal"" as part of a stated goal of reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. It's unclear whether Ocasio-Cortez will support the senators' carbon tax, although her office previously indicated taxation alone is insufficient.""We cannot simply tax gas and expect workers to figure out another way to get to work unless we’ve first created a better, more affordable option,"" her office said in a document later removed from its website.That document said: ""So we’re not ruling a carbon tax out, but a carbon tax would be a tiny part of a Green New Deal in the face of the gigantic expansion of our productive economy and would have to be preceded by first creating the solutions necessary so that workers and working class communities are not affected.""KENNEDY: WARREN TRIED TO USE APOLLO 11 TO 'BRING US TOGETHER' ON CLIMATE CHANGE, BUT DEMS LIVE FOR 'CONSTANT DIVISION'According to an analysis by the Heritage Foundation, it is practically impossible to use a carbon tax in order to reach Ocasio-Cortez's goal of net-zero emissions by 2050. The analysis indicated that the substantial increases in the carbon tax would be economically costly and prove marginally less effective over time in reducing emissions.Loris and Kevin Dayaratna, a senior statistician at Heritage, attempted to use the Energy Information Administration's National Energy Model to forecast the impact of steep carbon taxes aimed at reaching the net-zero greenhouse gas emissions goal. Not only did the model crash, the conservative organization said, it failed to approach anywhere near the goal outlined in the ""Green New Deal."" The closest Heritage was able to get was a 58 percent reduction in emissions, achieved through a $300 carbon tax. Taxes above $300 crashed the EIA's model.Just a 58 percent reduction would, by 2040, cost the economy $15 trillion in lost gross domestic product and an average of 1.1 million jobs per year, the analysis found. It also found that the average family of four would also see a total income loss of $165,000, or nearly $8,000 each year. Household energy expenses would also see an average increase of 30 percent, the think tank said.",1
"New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand weighs in on the abortion debate, second night of the first Democratic presidential debate.Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand is pledging that if elected to the White House, she’ll spend $10 trillion over the next 10 years in both taxpayer dollars and private funding to tackle climate change and implement the goals of the ‘Green New Deal.’“We have seen catastrophic flooding across the Midwest, damaging wildfires in California, and hurricanes ravage communities in the South and Puerto Rico. Many people have lost their homes and loved ones because we’ve failed to act on climate change,” the senator from New York said in a Medium post Thursday morning.THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON CLIMATE CHANGE BATTLE“My plan lays out immediate and bold action to protect our communities and save our planet,” Gillibrand touted. “Not only would I enact the Green New Deal and protect clean air and clean water, but I will reinvest in the communities that have been most impacted by climate change and hold polluters accountable for the damage they’ve caused the American people.”As part of her proposal, Gillibrand vows to bring the nation to net-zero carbon and greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2050.To reach that goal, the senator calls for “100% clean, renewable, and zero-carbon electricity in a decade.”And she would push for new standards for newly manufactured vehicles so as many as possible are zero-emission. Gillibrand also said she’d issue an executive order to end all new fossil fuel leases on public lands or off-short on the nation’s outer continental shelf.Her plan also includes putting a price on carbon – starting at $52 per metric ton – to steer companies away from fossil fuels and towards clean and renewable energy alternatives, ending federal subsidies and tax subsidies for the fossil fuel industry, and spending $100 billion to help rural communities transition to clean energyGillibrand argued that her price on carbon will help pay for her plan.“The revenue generated from this carbon tax, estimated at more than $200 billion annually, will then go directly back into our country’s transition to renewable energy,” she explained.The candidate also pledged that on day one of a Gillibrand administration, she’d reverse Republican President Trump’s move to take the U.S out of the Paris climate agreement, and she vowed to strengthen Clean Air Act regulations and reverse the Trump administration’s moves on the Clean Water Act.GILLIBRAND SAYS SHE HAS NO REGRETS IN OUSTER OF AL FRANKEN FROM SENATEThe senator – who’s struggled to resonate in the 2020 Democratic nomination polls – is the latest of a handful of 2020 White House hopefuls to release a comprehensive climate change action plan.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., voting “present.”OCASIO-CORTEZ ASSAILS BIDEN'S 'MIDDLE GROUND' CLIMATE CHANGE PLAN, SAYS IT'S 'DEALBREAKER'Both the New York Democrat and her colleagues decried Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s move to bring the Green New Deal up for a vote, saying the Republicans purposely rushed the vote while McConnell only wanted Democrats to go on record to support the sweeping proposal that he himself called “a radical, top-down, socialist makeover of the entire U.S. economy.”The Green New Deal calls for the U.S. to shift away from fossil fuels such as oil and coal and replace them with renewable sources such as wind and solar power. It calls for virtual elimination by 2030 of greenhouse gas emissions responsible for global warming. Republicans have railed against the proposal, saying it would devastate the economy and trigger massive tax increases.It remains unclear how the new resolution differs from the Green New Deal, though a spokesperson for Sanders told the magazine that unlike President Trump’s emergencies, the climate change declaration warrants the use of emergency powers.“President Trump has routinely declared phony national emergencies to advance his deeply unpopular agenda,” the spokesperson said. “On the existential threat of climate change, Trump insists on calling it a hoax.”",1
"If the left can't come up with a way to solve terror, crime and homelessness, why should we listen to them about a problem the size of the Earth?There is no doubt that climate change is an issue that needs to be discussed and addressed. But alarmist headlines and personal agendas only give climate change deniers more ammunition in the fight against real science that tells us we need to pay attention to climate change.In response to a report from a European Satellite Agency, everyone from CNN to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is howling from the rooftops about June being ""the hottest month ever recorded on Earth.""The report has been interpreted to show that the global average temperature this June was about 0.18 degrees Fahrenheit higher than the previous record set in June 2016.DANIEL TURNER: DECADES AGO, THE UN PROMISED CLIMATE DISASTER; SO WHY HASN'T IT ARRIVED?According to the same headlines and tweets, experts say that climate change is to blame.Let’s take a look.First, many have mistakenly called it the hottest month ever recorded. What the report actually said is that it was the hottest June ever recorded, not the hottest month.Second, technically speaking, yes, it is the hottest June ""ever recorded."" But recordings are only officially recognized back to the 1880s. During the Hadean period billions of years ago, Earth had a surface temperature of 450 degrees Fahrenheit. We do not have enough reliable data from historical times, and we simply don’t know what the temperatures were to the level of precision we have today.That still leaves us with the thought that this June was the hottest in the past 139 years. Is that true?Maybe.Whether 2017 was warmer or cooler than 2015, or 2014 or 2013 really doesn’t prove anything. The only way to see a pattern is to look at long-term temperature changes spanning hundreds of years, along with many other measurements.When average global temperatures are taken, there is always a margin of error on the measurement. It is impossible to find the one true value. There is always a plus or minus associated with the finding (and sometimes the plus or minus is greater than the alleged increase or decrease).For instance, an old NASA press release projected that 2015 would be the hottest year ever. The agency predicted it would break the record by .02 degrees Celsius. However, the margin of error was plus or minus 0.1 degrees Celsius, larger than the projected increase.In other words, they had no idea what was going to happen.Now, after a significant amount of searching, I couldn’t find the statistical details of this on the Copernicus Climate Change Service’s (European Commission) website (where the official statement of June’s heat wave came from), but I can promise you, there is a plus or minus attached to the 0.18 increase.Let’s give these measurements the benefit of the doubt and say that this June was .18 degrees Fahrenheit hotter than the previous hottest June. Even if true, it is basically irrelevant to decision-making.Variation is the spice of life, and it exists abundantly in nature. Whether 2017 was warmer or cooler than 2015, or 2014 or 2013 really doesn’t prove anything. The only way to see a pattern is to look at long-term temperature changes spanning hundreds of years, along with many other measurements.Yes, the trend is warming. Yes, carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, and we know its concentration has increased drastically since the industrial revolution. Yes, we know it is harmful.But if we are so desperate to get our points across that we embrace alarmism, we demean the real science that tells us that we do need to pay attention to the environment, and we inevitably give climate change deniers enormous ammunition.Climate change zealots vilify climate change deniers for denying science. Unfortunately, much of the time, they do exactly the same.",1
"Maslansky and Partners president Lee Carter shares voter dials from the debate.If the first Democratic debate of the 2020 election revealed anything, it’s just how large the gap has grown between the Democrats’ “progressive” base and the American public.Here are just a few of the issues in which the candidates are wildly out of step with average Americans:Mass Immigration. According to the May 2019 poll from Gallup, immigration is now viewed as the second most important concern (19 percent) among all voters, after the loss of faith in government leaders (23 percent). In comparison, gay and lesbian rights, “the situation with Russia” and school shootings are mentioned by less than 1 percent.DEMOCRAT '1 PERCENTERS' CAUSE MISCHIEF, GRAB SPOTLIGHT AT FIRST PRIMARY DEBATEWhile the official number of illegal immigrants in the U.S. has declined slightly over the past 12 years – from 12.2 million in 2007 to 10.7 million in 2016 – the total number of all immigrants arriving annually, legal and illegal, has actually increased 70 percent just since 2011. The current estimate is 45 million, or 14 percent of the population – close to the record of 14.8 percent set in 1890.The YouGov poll commissioned by the Huffington Post found that nearly twice as many registered voters (45 percent) now want stricter immigration policies rather than less strict (25 percent).This is an inconvenient truth for the 2020 Democrats – all of whom are opposed to President Trump’s plan for increased border security and in favor of increased immigration, not less.   Late-term Abortion There is no issue that divides Americans more than legalized abortion.Yet at least when it comes to third-trimester abortions, the Democratic candidates’ positions are way out of step with those of the general public.Gallup polls show that 77 percent of the U.S. adult population remains opposed to abortion on demand in the third trimester, and 53 percent are opposed to abortion even in the first trimester if the woman simply “does not want the child for any reason.”Fully 64 percent support laws banning “partial-birth abortion” in the second and third trimesters except to save the mother’s life.Yet almost all of the leading Democratic candidates for president actively seem to almost celebrate abortion on demand up to the moment of birth, even opposing laws that would require doctors to care for (that is, not deliberately kill) the children who miraculously survive such abortions.Among the Democratic senators running for president, three – Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Elizabeth Warren – cosponsored a Senate bill that would override all state restrictions on third-trimester abortions.And even though 55 percent of Americans support so-called “heartbeat bills” that would restrict abortion after a fetal heartbeat can be detected at six to eight weeks, New York Mayor Bill De Blasio has called these laws “vile.”Health care. Nowhere is the socialist wing of the Democrat Party more in evidence than on health care.  “Private insurance is not working for tens of millions of Americans when you talk about the co-pays, the premiums, the out of pocket expenses,” de Blasio blustered during last night’s debate. “It’s not working.”Perhaps not, but a 2018 Gallup poll revealed that only 4 out of 10 Americans favor a government-run health care system with 54 percent still preferring private insurance.Climate change. Washington State Gov. Jay Inslee is basing his entire presidential candidacy on the issue of climate change. He has promised to spend $3 trillion creating “millions” of clean energy jobs.Most of the Democratic candidates support similar proposals – although not all are willing to embrace the so-called Green New Deal proposed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and supported by Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, O’Rourke and Sanders.The problem for the Democrats is that, while Americans support green energy in principle, fewer than half (45 percent) think global warming will pose a serious threat in their lifetimes.Americans are willing to do their part, but view the radical proposals of the Democrats as unrealistic.Free speech. The last issue that divides the 2020 Democrats from the American public is free speech.Americans are for it, the Democrats hate it.Kamala Harris has repeatedly threatened social media companies with legal penalties if they allow “hate speech” on their platforms.Socialist Bernie Sanders agrees. “Bernie believes we should not depend on a handful of large corporations to stop the spread of hate in America,” a Sanders spokesman told Buzz Feed News. “We must regulate these platforms to ensure the safety and security of the American people.”The problem lies in the definition of “hate speech.”The tech conglomerates have been repeatedly caught censoring conservative and religious viewpoints with which they disagree – such as advertisements for pro-life films like ""Unplanned.""The Democrat candidates want more of this kind of censorship, but the public strongly disagrees.A Rasmussen Reports survey found an overwhelming 85 percent of American adults believe the right to free speech is more important than making sure no one is offended by what others say. Seventy-three percent agree with Voltaire when he said, “I disapprove of what you say but will defend to the death your right to say it.”",1
"Fox News Flash top headlines for June 25 are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.comAn Oregon climate change bill that prompted 12 Republican lawmakers to flee the Statehouse in Salem last week has hit yet another snag: Senate President Peter Courtney, a Democrat, announced Tuesday that the chamber did not have enough votes to pass the legislation.The cap-and-trade program intended to rein in industrial carbon emissions lost traction even with the state's Democratic senators, according to Courtney, sparking protesters who were initially demanding that Republicans return to the floor for a vote to begin chanting ""Peter Courtney's got to go.""""I've done as much as I can, and I'll continue to try,"" Courtney said.RUNAWAY OREGON REPUBLICAN SAYS LAWMAKERS WON'T RETURN TO STATE UNTIL 'EXPENSIVE' CARBON TAX BILL SCRAPPED

      Gov. Kate Brown, also a Democrat, authorized the state police to round up the 12 Republicans who walked out of the Statehouse in protest of the bill Thursday and bring them back to the Senate floor for a vote but to no avail. If passed, the measure would make Oregon the second state in the nation, after California, to implement such a program.Republicans fled the Senate, some even claiming to the leave the state, refusing to sign off on a bill that would limit emissions and establish pollution permits or ""allowances"" for each ton of carbon an industry plans to emit.Speaking to ""Fox & Friends"" from an undisclosed location Tuesday, Republican state Sen. Tim Knopp criticized the bill and insisted that he and his GOP colleagues would continue to stymie the state legislative process, which requires 20 members in the Senate in order to constitute as a quorum in order to proceed, unless the carbon tax is scrapped and a bipartisan solution is reached.
The bill would limit greenhouse gas emissions and auction pollution allowances for carbon that businesses want to emit, with a lowering cap. The bill would reduce emissions to 45 percent below 1990 levels by 2035 and 80 percent by 2050. Critics say it would hurt the business community and exacerbate a divide between liberal urban areas and conservative rural parts of the state.

"Raw video: British government minister Mark Field physically restrains a Greenpeace activist protesting climate change at U.K. Chancellor Philip Hammond's speech to the annual Mansion House dinner in London's financial district.A British lawmaker was suspended Friday by Prime Minister Theresa May’s office after a video appeared to show him violently removing a protester from an event the previous night.Foreign Office Minister Mark Field received the suspension after officials raised questions about his treatment of the female protester during the annual gala Mansion House dinner Thursday night.The finance minister, Philip Hammond, was addressing a crowd of foreign industry chiefs when activists, wearing red dresses and sashes reading ""Climate Change Emergency,"" began disrupting the speech.BORIS JOHNSON LAUNCHES BID TO SUCCEED THERESA MAY, PROMISES NOT TO ‘KICK THE CAN’ ON BREXITVideo from the black-tie event showed the female protester walking toward Hammond. At that point Field stopped her by shoving her into a pillar and forcibly turning her around. He then placed his hand firmly on the back of her neck and led her out of the room.

      The demonstration comes after climate change activists disrupted life and travel in the British capital in April, bringing parts of London to a standstill as they demanded net carbon emissions be reduced to zero by 2025.In a statement to ITV, Field said he reacted “instinctively”  to what he called “a major security breach” after thinking that the protester could have been armed.“In the confusion, many guests understandably felt threatened and when one protester rushed past me towards the top table, I instinctively reacted. There was no security present and I was for a split-second genuinely worried she might have been armed.”“I deeply regret this episode and unreservedly apologise to the lady concerned for grabbing her but in the current climate I felt the need to act decisively to close down the threat to the safety of those present.”Field’s suspension came after he publicly referred to himself to the Cabinet Office, which is officially investigating the incident along with the City of London Police and the Conservative party.The Associated Press contributed to this report.",1
"Twenty Democratic presidential candidates are set to take the stage with the debate split between two nights; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.'It’s rare that I agree with the eco-left. In fact, it’s a small miracle that I can find common ground with those want to destroy energy jobs, decimate rural communities, and reduce our supply of inexpensive domestic energy that powers our economy and makes America great. But now I support the eco-left on one issue: Let’s have a climate debate among Democratic presidential candidates. The Democratic National Committee has come under fire from both eco-left activists and some 2020 presidential candidates who are calling for a candidate debate that is focused solely on climate issues. The push was first started by Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, who has staked his longshot presidential bid on being the “climate candidate.” INSLEE RAMPS UP PRESSURE CAMPAIGN FOR DNC TO HOLD CLIMATE CHANGE DEBATE, SAYS EARTH’S ‘ON FIRE’No doubt the candidates themselves want to pivot to the politically safe, ethereal and unquantifiable green issues. Why draw attention to the failure of their other policies?The list of areas where Democratic policies have turned out to be utter failures is a long one. On the national level, they include health care, job creation and controlling illegal immigration. On the local level, big cities run by Democrats are plagued by crime, poverty, homelessness and failing infrastructure.So for a Democratic presidential candidate, an entire debate devoid of facts, success metrics, or costs might seem like a welcome reprieve from the pressure of discussing serious policy deliverables. But the Democratic National Committee recently turned down the idea of a climate debate by presidential candidates. Committee Chairman Tom Perez said that the climate debate was not “practical,” after being pressured by eco-activists to weigh in. Perez’s refusal set off an uproar on the left. Joined by the Sunrise Movement – an eco-extremist group working with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., to win approval for her Green New Deal – 15 Democratic presidential candidates endorsed holding a climate debate.Even former Vice President Joe Biden, who had come under fire for his middle-ground approach to climate policy, said regarding the idea of a climate debate: “That’s what we should be doing. I’m all in, man.” Nothing like flying to a debate with an army of journalists in tow – and broadcasting it on TV and online using cameras, lights and microphones – to blast fossil fuels, man. I wonder what bottled water would be next to each podium, and whether candidates would taste the hypocrisy with each sip. All these crazy ideas must stay hidden if Perez wants Democratic candidates to score victories in swing states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan.  From a political perspective, Perez’s opposition to the debate is smart. He has to do all he can to hide the crazy extremist ideas Democrats have embraced for as long as possible. And let’s face it: their green policies are crazy. Nearly every Democratic presidential candidate has spoken in favor of the Green New Deal and its multitrillion-dollar price tag. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., wants to ban fracking. Biden wants to stop energy exploration on public lands. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., not only wants a Green New Deal, she wants a litany of new government bureaucracies to manage it. Somehow climate change requires hiring thousands more Washington bureaucrats as “program officers” and “project managers” making six-figure salaries. All these crazy ideas must stay hidden if Perez wants Democratic candidates to score victories in swing states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. That’s because Americans don’t want their taxes used for trillions of dollars in fruitless spending. We don’t want higher taxes and rising utility bills. We don’t want imagined “green jobs,” especially when we have good-paying energy jobs waiting to be filled.We don’t want to pay people “unwilling to work” and surrender hundreds of thousands of acres of land for subsidized solar panels and windmills to generate unreliable and expensive electricity under the Green New Deal. Last year U.S. oil production grew by the largest annual increase ever recorded by a country in world history. According to a new report from the Oil Price Information Service, this boom means gasoline prices could fall to below $2 per-gallon for many Americans in 2019. All this as we continue to reduce emissions. Our energy course needs no correction. The fact is, America’s energy revolution has created jobs, liberated us from Middle East turmoil, and sparked life into an economy left stagnant for eight years under President Obama and Vice President Biden. Putting the extremism of the Democratic presidential candidates on display in a nationally televised climate debate would wake Americans up to the radical, power-grabbing agenda so many Democrats have embraced. Perez is smart to keep all that in the dark. But I’m hoping for a debate. As the late Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis said, “sunlight is the best disinfectant.” Especially when that sunlight is really a spotlight powered by our reliable, abundant, inexpensive domestic fossil fuels.

"Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee is stepping up his push to force the Democratic National Committee to hold a primary debate solely on the issue of climate change.“This planet is on fire and we have to have a debate on how to put it out,” the Democratic presidential candidate and longtime champion of combating climate change told reporters.INSLEE UNVEILS $9 TRILLION PLAN TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGEAnd Inslee warned that if the DNC doesn’t drop its opposition to a climate change-only debate, he will “be talking to the other candidates” who agree with him and “we will pursue what other options we can make.”Inslee made his comments Wednesday while campaigning in New Hampshire, which holds the first primary in the race for the White House.Inslee, a long-shot for the nomination in an historically large field of two-dozen candidates, has been aggressively and relentlessly urging the DNC and the national party committee’s chairman Tom Perez to hold a climate change debate.DEBATE OVER DEBATE: SOME 2020 DEMS FUME OVER DNC CRITERIA TO MAKE THE STAGEPerez reportedly told activists who confronted him at a party gathering in Florida this past weekend that holding such a debate was “just not practical.”Inslee, firing back, added “I’ll tell you what’s impractical. It’s to be underwater, under eight feet of water as a farmer in Iowa. To have your town burned down in Paradise, California.”And the governor emphasized that “there’s 12 debates. One of them ought to be dedicated to this effort. I’m not just saying that. Hundreds of thousands of Democrats are. It’s the right thing to do and I hope the party will reconsider.”“There are nine state party chairs who are going to bring a resolution at the next executive committee to make sure this gets done,” he noted.And Inslee pointed to numerous rivals, including former Vice President Joe Biden, the clear front-runner right now in the Democratic nomination race, who’ve joined his calls for a climate change debate.“There are about 14 of the candidates, including the former vice president. The former vice president said we need a debate on this yesterday. So I would encourage the chair of the party to listen to the former vice president and hundreds of thousands of grassroots folks and party chairs and me and make sure this gets a full and fair debate,” he said.THE LATEST FOX NEWS STORIES ON CLIMATE CHANGEPerez, in a Medium post on Tuesday, defended his climate change record while steering the DNC the past two years.“Climate change is an urgent threat to our nation and our planet,” he wrote. “It imperils our children and grandchildren’s future, and it disproportionately affects our most vulnerable communities. That’s why, beginning in 2017, I made clear to our media partners that the issue of climate change must be featured prominently in our debates. That didn’t happen in 2016 — and it was wrong.”But in explaining his opposition to Inslee’s push, Perez said “if we change our guidelines at the request of one candidate who has made climate change their campaign’s signature issue, how do we say no to the numerous other requests we’ve had? How do we say no to other candidates in the race who may request debates focused on an issue they’ve made central to their own campaigns?”And he pointed to other options to spotlight the issue of climate change.“Already, a number of organizations and networks have hosted their own issue-based forums and town halls — and I hope and expect more of these will take place in the coming months,” Perez emphasized. “Nobody is prohibited from participating in a DNC-sanctioned debate because they participated in a climate change forum or town hall.”While Inslee twice gave Biden a shout-out for joining the calls for a climate change debate, he targeted the former vice president’s efforts on the issue.Inslee, who last week said that Biden’s new proposal to produce net-zero emissions and reach a 100 percent clean energy economy by 2050 lacks “teeth,” criticized the former vice president again.“I am the only candidate who has said this has to be the first priority of the United States. I am the only candidate who has said that. He (Biden) has not,” Inslee told Fox News.“I’m the only candidate who has said we have to get off coal with ... teeth in a law in the next ten years. He has not. I’m the only candidate who has said we need to make our transportation system electric in the next decade and a half. He has not,” Inslee spotlighted. “So there are some differences.”",1
"West Virginia Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin says former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's pledge to close all U.S. coal plants would punish the hardworking people of his state.Sen.

""Help us get the pension plan I can get Mitch McConnell to move off of, give them the pension plan they've earned.""After that's taken care of, Manchin said, the United States should begin to follow in the footsteps of other countries, creating bipartisan solutions to climate change and developing new technology to utilize the fossil fuels we already have.DOUGLAS MACKINNON: BLOOMBERG TO COAL WORKERS: YOU'RE FIRED!""Asia, India and China are using more coal-fired plants than ever. By 2040 they will be 50 percent dependent on coal and we have to find that technology,"" Manchin said.""The markets will change. People migrate to the cheapest form of energy, but now you need dependable energy. Fossil gives you that -- we use it cleaner and we can even do much more,"" he continued.Manchin went on to discuss the Green New Deal, which he said is ""not a practical approach,"" but expressed support for former United States Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz's proposal for a ""Green Real Deal.""

No other country. They are moving the technology innovation -- not elimination,"" he said.""I'm going to try to work with both sides to bring it together and use a practical approach,"" Manchin added.",1

JOE MANCHIN SLAMS GREEN NEW DEAL: IT'S NOT A DEAL, 'IT'S A DREAM'Bloomberg, who had briefly mulled a run for the White House as an independent, announced his Beyond Carbon initiative last week.

That includes 51 that we’ve retired since the 2016 presidential election -- despite all the bluster from the White House,” he said in an op-ed.But Manchin cited an International Energy Agency (IEA) prediction that China and India will use coal for more than half their power until at least 2040, and argued that this means that their reliance on fossil fuels is “not ending anytime soon.”“To truly combat global climate change, the U.S. must lead in seeking innovative technological solutions that focus on carbon capture and other technologies reflective of reality,” Manchin said.Manchin has been an outspoken critic against environmental projects that would hurt the interests of his coal-rich state, including those proposed by members of his own party.

Nye said he was optimistic about the efforts against climate change and pointed to D-Day as a source of hope.""I am always optimistic about this because tomorrow is the anniversary of D-Day -- and of course there was tremendous loss and tremendous sacrifice -- but it was part of this greater idea that we have a global problem and we're going to solve it,"" he told Matthews.""I always respect that ... both of my parents were veterans ... and we can do this! It's the United States and so things are changing.""BILL NYE'S FIERY MESSAGE ON CLIMATE CHANGE CAPTURES ATTENTIONMatthews responded approvingly, saying, ""you're our leader, Bill."" Nye, an outspoken activist on climate change, warned earlier in the interview that climate change would pose problems for agriculture and infrastructure.“It's not that we’re all going to die in 12 years,” he said. “It's just we’re not going to be able to move our infrastructure -- our seaports, our railroads and so on -- and move our agriculture away from the equators fast enough to feed everybody as we get to be nine and 10 billion unless we get to work.""Nye made those remarks as 2020 presidential candidates drew greater attention to the issue. Both former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. released plans in June that align with the controversial ""Green New Deal"" -- an aggressive, some would say unrealistic, attempt by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. to combat climate change.Both Nye and Ocasio-Cortez have received attention for their bold claims about climate change. Nye, for example, said the ""planet is on f---ing fire"" in May.",1
"RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel says Joe Biden's campaign has no enthusiasm.Joe Biden just rolled out a plan to tackle climate change, the second big policy offering of his campaign. In its ambitions and approach, the program looks a lot like others that have been presented by his rivals and by leading environmental concerns.In fact, it looks so much like competing plans that the former vice president has been accused of plagiarism, again. Remember that Biden faced similar charges in 1988. Engaged in his first presidential run that year, he lifted parts of a speech made by U.K. politician Neil Kinnock, in which the Labor leader declared he was the first in his family to attend college. That factoid turned out to be true for Kinnock but not for Uncle Joe. His family had several college grads.In the past, Biden apparently borrowed text from other politicians and also plagiarized parts of a research paper he wrote while at Syracuse University College of Law.BIDEN UNVEILS CLIMATE CHANGE PLAN USING GREEN NEW DEAL AS FRAMEWORK, AFTER AOC CRITICISMIn other words, stealing other people’s work appears to be something of a habit for the man President Trump likes to call ""Sleepy Joe.""Most likely, the goof in preparing the climate position paper reflects the price Biden is paying for his late entry into the Democratic race. While Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., have had months to work up policy initiatives – which in Warren’s case are as plentiful as dandelions in August – Biden is scrambling to get up to speed.It appears that in their haste to respond to charges that Biden was not taking climate change seriously, his team cut and pasted together a patchwork quilt of ideas taken from numerous sources. Instead of confirming Biden’s history of plagiarism, the slip may instead reveal that his opponents are correct. He does not take climate change seriously.That said, Biden’s climate policy is carefully crafted, not necessarily to reduce emissions, but to appeal politically to nearly everybody and offend nobody. His plan promises to reach net zero emissions and 100 percent clean energy by 2050, taking 20 years more to achieve that milestone than the Green New Deal. Sleepy Joe indeed.Biden enthusiastically joins the nuclear arms race of spending that the Democratic climate competition has become. He slaps a $5 trillion price tag on his program, way behind the $9 trillion of other people’s money that Washington Gov. Jay Inslee is prepared to spend, but matching Beto O’Rourke’s program.Of course, all proposals pale in comparison to the Green New Deal, which has been estimated to cost as much as $93 trillion but that encompasses far more than just climate management.In his proposal, Biden pays homage to the progressive wing of his party by lauding Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's costly GND, as have many of the other Democrats running for the Oval Office, calling it a “crucial framework.”He kowtows to Obama nostalgia by noting his plan goes beyond “the Obama-Biden administration platform,"" reminding us anew (as if we could forget) of his history with “Barack.” He massages environmental warriors by pledging to not take campaign contributions from those dastardly fossil-fuel providers (you know, the ones that heat our homes and make our cars run) and promising to “stand up to the abuse of power by polluters who disproportionately harm communities of color and low-income communities.”He mollifies those few Democrats worried about our nation’s $22 trillion debt by saying only $1.7 trillion of his $5 trillion 10-year plan will come from the federal government, with local authorities and corporations kicking in the rest. He also claims the $1.7 trillion would be financed by reversing the GOP tax cuts on businesses. That’s a puzzler, since hiking the 21 percent rate back to 27 percent or 28 percent is estimated to yield only around $700 billion over the next decade.The actual policies that Biden promises to enact are mostly conventional and small-bore, such as making sure the federal government purchases only zero-emissions vehicles (does Tesla make tanks?) or making government buildings energy efficient. He wants to bring together our nation’s top talent to speed new renewable energy technologies, though some might say the quickest way to stifle innovation would be to ensnare our brightest scientists in the federal bureaucracy.On one idea Biden should be congratulated. He proposes using “small modular nuclear reactors at half the construction cost of today’s reactors.” Though it is not size that makes nuclear investment prohibitively expensive today but rather cumbersome environmental opposition, expansion of zero-emission nuclear power would be a positive step.Several weeks ago, Biden was hammered when a campaign worker said he was searching for a “middle of the road” position on climate. That apostasy did not sit well with the left wing of his party, for whom mitigating the effects of carbon emission has become not just a policy but a creed. No price tag is too high, no loss of competitive advantage too great, no harm to our workers is too costly to justify taking a middle path.The issue describes perfectly the jam Democrats are in. Joe Biden is supposed to be the candidate who can appeal to progressives like Sanders and Warren who want to redistribute the nation’s wealth as well as those traditionally Democratic blue-collar workers who defected to President Trump in 2016.Creating a climate plan that satisfies both those groups is a tall order. Biden’s proposal and indeed all plans promising to end our use of fossil fuels will drive up power costs, make our industries less competitive, and will cost jobs. That’s why union leaders like the AFL-CIO criticized the GND, calling it “unrealistic” and likely to harm workers.Recent elections, like the one in Australia, show that even voters professing alarm at climate change will put jobs ahead of mitigating emissions. Democrats and Joe Biden would be smart to take note.",1

"Democratic presidential frontrunner Joe Biden is now a target for those chasing him; Peter Doocy reports from Dubuque, Iowa.Warning that “we must take drastic action now to address the climate disaster facing the nation and our world,” former Vice President Joe Biden on Tuesday unveiled a wide-ranging plan to combat climate change and transform America’s economy.Using the Green New Deal as a framework, the clear front-runner right now in the race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination announced he’s “calling for a Clean Energy Revolution to confront this crisis and do what America does best – solve big problems with big ideas.” The price tag for the proposal -- named ‘The Biden Plan for a Clean Energy Revolution & Environmental Justice’ --  is $1.7 trillion over the next 10 years. Biden’s campaign said this would be supplemented by leveraging more than $5 trillion in additional private sector and state and local investments. This is considerably less expensive than the Green New Deal itself, for which cost estimates range as high as $93 trillion.But it follows criticism from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and others on the party's left flank about his stance on environmental issues. The former vice president vowed he’d pay for the new plan by rolling back the tax incentives in President Trump’s tax cuts that he argued “enrich corporations at the expense of American jobs and the environment.”BIDEN DEFENDS HIS CLIMATE CHANGE RECORD AFTER OCASIO-CORTEZ CRITICISMBiden, in a statement announcing the plan, emphasized that “more severe storms and droughts, rising sea levels, warming temperatures, shrinking snow cover and ice sheets -- it's already happening. We must take drastic action now to address the climate disaster facing the nation and our world.”And he warned that “science tells us that how we act or fail to act in the next 12 years will determine the very livability of our planet.”The unveiling of the 22-page plan comes three weeks after Biden teased he would soon be producing a proposal, as he pushed back against criticism by rising progressive political star and freshman Rep. Ocasio-Cortez of New York that his record on tackling climate change was “middle of the road.”BIDEN COMES UNDER ATTACK BY 2020 DEMOCRATIC RIVALSBiden’s campaign, in spelling out the plan, said that the Green New Deal “captures two basic truths” – that the nation “urgently needs to embrace greater ambition on an epic scale to meet the scope of this challenge,” and that the environment and the country’s economy “are completely and totally connected.”The Green New Deal, co-authored by Ocasio-Cortez, is a sweeping proposal introduced in Congress earlier this year that aims to transform the country’s economy to combat climate change while enacting a host of new welfare programs.The Biden campaign said the former vice president’s plan would ensure that the U.S. achieves a 100 percent clean energy economy and reaches net-zero emission no later than 2050. And they said that if elected president, on his first day in office Biden would sign a series of executive orders “with unprecedented reach that go well beyond the Obama-Biden Administration platform and put us on the right track.”Other parts of the plan include demanding Congress pass a bill in Biden’s first year in the White House that includes milestone targets no later than 2025, make an historic investment in clear energy, climate research and innovation, and “incentivize the rapid deployment of clean energy innovations across the economy.”The campaign spotlighted that Biden would not only immediately recommit the U.S. to the Paris Agreements on climate change – reversing actions taken by Trump – but would also “rally the rest of the world to meet the threat of climate change.”The campaign also said that a Biden administration would take action against fossil fuel companies and others “who put profit over people and knowingly harm our environment and poison our communities’ air, land, and water, or conceal information regarding potential environmental and health risks.”And Biden, long a friend to organized labor, would vow “not to leave any workers or communities left behind” as the nation transforms to a clean energy economy.Climate change is a top issue in the race for the Democratic nomination, with a number of Biden’s rivals in the historically enormous field of 24 candidates releasing their own plans to tackle climate change.Last month, Biden past efforts in combating climate change were criticized by Ocasio-Cortez. She tweeted that Biden’s upcoming climate plan “is a dealbreaker. There is no 'middle ground' w/ climate denial & delay.”A day later, at an event in support of the Green New Deal, she took aim again. Without mentioning the former vice president by name, Ocasio-Cortez highlighted that “if the same politicians who refused to act then are going to try to come back today and say we need to have a ‘middle of the road approach’ to save our lives, that is too much for me.”Campaigning soon after in New Hampshire, Biden responded.“You never heard me say ‘middle of the road.’ I’ve never been middle-of-the-road on the environment. Tell her ... to look at my record. She’ll find that nobody has been more consistent about taking on the environment and a green revolution than I have,” he said during a gaggle with reporters.And pushing back against his critics, he noted that “this is a long campaign and everybody should just calm down a little bit and take a look at the record from before.”Biden is back in New Hampshire on Tuesday, and his campaign tells Fox News that the candidate is expected to talk more about his plan during the trip, which includes a stop at a renewable energy supplier in Plymouth.",1
"Is Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders turning to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to stem Joe Biden's surge in the polls? Reaction and analysis from Jason Meister, Trump 2020 campaign advisory board member, and Jay Jacobs, New York state Democratic chairman.California knows about fault lines. And political observers in the Golden State say the Democrats’ proposed Green New Deal may be a fault line that splits the party’s support – in California and elsewhere.The environmental high-mindedness of the plan for combatting climate change – put forth by Democratic U.S. Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Ed Markey of Massachusetts – appeals to the “elite” professionals the party has been courting for years.But the potential disruption for the American labor, in which untold numbers of employees might have to transition from “old economy” jobs to “green economy” jobs, may be offputting for many blue-collar workers – potentially turning many of them away from Democratic candidates at the polls, some political observers say.“Unlike the Mueller report --- and impeachment and indictment — people vote on whether or not they’re going to lose their job,” Jessica Levinson, a professor of politics and ethics at Loyola Law School, told Politico.“Unlike the Mueller report --- and impeachment and indictment — people vote on whether or not they’re going to lose their job.”In addition, Levinson said, many people who’ve spent years working in blue-collar union jobs “don’t necessarily want to be retrained” for so-called “green jobs.”Signaling a potential blue-collar backlash, chants of “Garcetti’s gotta go” greeted Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti in April when he launched his “Green New Deal LA” plan, Politico reported.“[Garcetti's] got the big corporations with him, and he’s not thinking of the effects on the common people,’’ Paul Valdez, 58, a building trades worker from Thousand Oaks, told Politico. “If they start taking away our jobs, who’s going to pay our bills?”“[Garcetti's] got the big corporations with him, and he’s not thinking of the effects on the common people.’’Similarly, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio – a Democrat who’s now running for president – was openly mocked in May when he launched his local version of the Green New Deal.The mayor was forced to shout for much of his speech amid jeers from a crowd of about a dozen protesters inside the lobby of Trump Tower, which also had music blasting over the speakers. A number of protesters rode up and down the escalator behind de Blasio carrying cardboard signs with slogans like “Worst Mayor Ever,” “Failed Mayor,” and “Trump 2020.”“They’re scared of the truth,” the mayor said. “Anyone that has a problem with saving the planet, I have a problem with them.”“They’re scared of the truth. Anyone that has a problem with saving the planet, I have a problem with them.”The Garcetti and de Blasio plans were part of an effort by Green New Deal backers to push the effort through left-leaning local and state governments rather than face the Republican-led U.S. Senate and the veto pen of President Trump.In New Mexico, Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed her state’s version of the plan, the Energy Transition Act, into law in March.“This is a really big deal,” Grisham said in a statement at the time. “In every corner of this state, advocates, utilities, young adults, unions, elected officials and families came together to push for and, today, enact this transformational law. The Energy Transition Act fundamentally changes the dynamic in New Mexico. This legislation is a promise to future generations of New Mexicans, who will benefit from both a cleaner environment and a more robust energy economy with exciting career and job opportunities.""""The Energy Transition Act fundamentally changes the dynamic in New Mexico. This legislation is a promise to future generations of New Mexicans, who will benefit from both a cleaner environment and a more robust energy economy with exciting career and job opportunities.""But not all workers find a potential transition to be exciting.On Saturday, dozens of members of California’s Building and Construction Trades Council, which represents more than 400,000 workers, planned a “Blue Collar Revolution” demonstration at the California Democratic Party Convention site in San Francisco.Robbie Hunter, president of the labor group, told Politico what the Green New Deal represented to the group’s members.“All it does is do what the Democratic Party seems to be very good at lately — which is export our jobs, while doing nothing for the end game, which is the environmental,’’ Hunter said.Jack Pitney, a political science professor at Claremont McKenna College in California, says Democrats should heed a lesson from West Virginia.“West Virginia, until 2000, was considered solidly blue,” Pitney told Politico, until the George W. Bush campaign reminded the state’s coal miners of opponent Al Gore’s ties to the environmental movement, which the miners viewed as a threat to their jobs. The state’s voters ended up backing Bush, 52 percent to 46 percent.“So yes,” Pitney told the magazine, “this is a real hazard for Democrats, something that somebody from a state with extractive industries may want to recognize.”Fox News’ Andrew O’Reilly contributed to this report.",1
"Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley speaks out on the damage assessment and the community's path to recovery on 'America's Newsroom.'Progressive politicians like Al Gore, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D.N.Y., don’t hesitate to blame any kind of severe weather – even if it is decreasing over time – on global warming.With the devastating Dayton, Ohio tornadoes fresh on our minds, it is useful to examine exactly why (modest) global warming has produced fewer – not more – of such events.The simple answer is that tornado formation requires unusually cool air.OHIO, INDIANA TORNADOES LEAVE AT LEAST 1 DEAD, SEVERAL HURT AMID DESTRUCTION THAT LOOKS 'LIKE A WAR ZONE'Very few thunderstorms produce tornadoes. In the hot and humid tropics, they are virtually unheard of. The reason why is that (unlike hurricanes) tornadoes require strong wind shear, which means wind speed increasing and changing direction with height in the lower atmosphere.These conditions exist only when a cool air mass collides with a warm air mass. And the perfect conditions for this have existed this year as winter has refused to lose its grip on the western United States. So far for the month of May 2019, the average temperature across the U.S. is close to 2 degrees Fahrenheit below normal.Every year, springtime thunderstorms in Central and Southeast U.S. have plenty of warm, moist air to draw on from the Gulf of Mexico. What they generally don’t have is a persistent cold air mass producing strong wind shear at the boundary between a warm and cold air mass.In recent decades, slow warming in the U.S. has been accompanied by fewer of these cold springtime air masses over the West.  As a result, based upon official National Weather Service statistics the long-term trend of strong (EF3) to violent (EF5) tornadoes has been decidedly downward, with 2018 experiencing a record low in activity.But this year, snows have extended into late May from Northern Michigan through Colorado to the Sierra of California.  As a result of this persistent cold air mass, as of May 27, we are well above normal for total U.S. tornadoes.This is what weather does – it varies from year to year. The alarmist claims of AOC, Gore, and Sanders are not just speculative; they opposed by our observations and by meteorological theory.",1

          FILE - In this April 4, 2013, file photo, a truck carrying 250 tons of coal hauls the fuel to the surface of the Spring Creek mine near Decker, Mont. Federal officials say the Trump administration's decision to lift a moratorium on coal sales from public lands could hasten the release of more than 5 billion tons of greenhouse gasses. The report comes after a court ruled last month that the administration failed to consider the environmental effects of its resumption in 2017 of coal sales. A moratorium had been imposed under President Barack Obama over worries about climate change. (AP Photo/Matthew Brown, File)
          BILLINGS, Mont. – The Trump administration's decision to lift a moratorium on coal sales from public lands could hasten the release of more than 5 billion tons of greenhouse gases, but officials concluded Wednesday it would make little difference in overall U.S. climate emissions.That conclusion from the Bureau of Land Management comes after a judge ruled last month the administration had failed to consider the environmental effects of resuming coal sales from public lands.Sales were largely halted in 2016 under President Barack Obama over worries about climate change. But the moratorium was rescinded by then-Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke soon after President Donald Trump took office, fulfilling a campaign pledge from the Republican.Critics said the Trump administration's contention that resuming sales would have negligible effects on the environment was absurd given the scope of the federal coal program.About 40% of coal burned in the U.S. comes from federal leases, primarily in Western states including Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Montana and New Mexico. Companies have mined about 4 billion tons of coal from federal reserves in the past decade, contributing $10 billion to federal and state coffers through royalties and other payments.In Wednesday's report , the Bureau of Land Management analyzed applications from companies for coal leases totaling more than 2.5 billion tons of the fuel. Just over 5 billion tons of greenhouse gases would be produced by burning the fuel for electricity over the next 20 years, the agency said.That's equivalent to just over 1 percent of greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector for 2017, according to the agency.The agency's conclusion was based on the assumption that coal sales would have resumed as normal once the moratorium ended in 2019.""The lifting of the coal leasing pause would not change the cumulative levels of (greenhouse gas) emissions resulting from coal leasing,"" officials wrote.Environmentalists who sued to reinstate the moratorium said that assumption was flawed. They also blasted officials for providing only a 15-day comment period.""This seems to be both absurd and tremendously insulting to the public,"" said attorney Michael Saul with the Center for Biological Diversity, one of several groups that sued to block the moratorium. ""Economics plus physics tell us that mining more cheap coal means burning more coal, which means more CO2 in the atmosphere and a hotter planet.""The attorneys general of California, New Mexico, New York and Washington — all Democrats — also had challenged Trump's move to end the moratorium.A spokeswoman for the National Mining Association, which intervened in the court cases on behalf of the Trump administration, declined to comment on Wednesday's report.The industry group has said previously that it was the Obama administration that violated federal law, by imposing the moratorium without first analyzing its effects on the coal industry.In February, Interior Department officials had announced a sale of coal leases on public lands in Utah by issuing a statement headlined ""The War on Coal is Over."" They said the sale would not have been possible if the administration had not overturned the Obama-era moratorium.__Follow Matthew Brown at https://twitter.com/matthewbrownap",1
"Fox News Flash top headlines for May 22 are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.comSome Democrats in Washington who are embracing the Green New Deal might be as oblivious as several of California’s own Democratic leaders about the real impact their ambitious environmental policies have on working families, the poor, and minorities. This is an ironic turnaround for the party that has long touted itself as the champion of the little guy.Progressive politicians both in Sacramento and Washington are correct in arguing that addressing climate change is imperative. However, in their quest to make California a world leader on climate change, the state’s political leaders seem to overlook the fact that addressing long-term goals to save the planet can hurt the people who live on it today. That’s the crux of a lawsuit filed by the civil rights and housing advocacy group, the Two Hundred, currently underway in California Superior Court.Since the enactment of Assembly Bill 32 in 2006, California has been working toward the goal of a 25 percent reduction in the state’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from 1990 levels by 2030. Ambitious as that was, it was not enough for many environmentalists. As a result, former Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill last fall (Senate Bill 100) that mandates the state’s utilities to obtain all their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2045.OCASIO-CORTEZ SAYS GROWING CAULIFLOWER IN COMMUNITY GARDENS IS 'COLONIAL'To meet the targets set by AB 32, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) is required to issue “scoping plans” every five years. The Two Hundred’s suit contends the 2017 Scoping Plan would exacerbate the state’s affordable housing crisis, hike electricity costs on those least able to afford it, and stifle job creation for working families.The 2017 Plan envisions gradually replacing older, less energy-efficient housing units with carbon-friendly, residential high rises closer to urban areas. That sounds like a good way to reduce urban sprawl and automobile traffic but as a practical matter, the suit against the CARB charges this would decrease the stock of affordable housing located close to where people work, driving up housing costs in a state where 2 million children live below the national poverty level.The Plan also seeks to implement a “vehicle mile traveled” quota that is patently unfair to people forced to commute to work from lower-cost areas, often communities of color. The quota is likely to prove even more discriminatory as rising housing costs force workers to relocate farther away.On top of that, the Plan aims to induce people to take buses and other forms of public transit or, better yet, bike or walk more. That might be fine for Californians who can afford to live close to work but for people who have no choice but to drive, the 2017 Scoping Plan smacks of arrogance and elitism.This disconnect from struggling workers is not surprising. The suit points to racial bias in environmental advocacy organizations that lobbied the CARB during the formulation of the 2017 Plan. Sierra Club Board of Directors President Aaron Mair, who happens to be African American, has conceded, “White privilege and racism within the broader environmental movement is existent and pervasive.”California’s experience – now being replicated on the national level with the Green New Deal – could signal the Democrats’ drift toward ambitious dreams and away from the day-to-day challenges of working families and people at the margins of the economy, especially people of color.While the details of Green New Deal are far from formalized, it could cost trillions of dollars, directly and indirectly. National Democrats should take note that California’s pursuit of cutting-edge environmental goals has taken a toll, with an exodus of well-paying jobs from the state, along with the hopes of young workers and their families. In California and at the national level, labor unions, long a stalwart part of the Democrats’ base, have warned they will not support green policies at the expense of jobs.It appears these Democratic leaders, in their disgust of President Trump, remain impenetrable to the chief lesson of his unexpected victory in 2016: Struggling workers are sick of their political leaders catering to big corporations, international bodies, progressive policy activists, and other elites.FDR’s New Deal created nation-building jobs, helped replace fear with hope, and built a Democratic coalition that lasted more than half a century. Democrats who support the Green New Deal argue that remaking the economy will likewise lead to shared prosperity and a healthier world. But they need to reckon with the fact on the way to that utopia, there could be disruption and hardships that fall disproportionately on working people – the very people Democrats have counted on to win elections in the past but who they could be losing touch with now.",1

It’s so important,” she said as she filmed a community garden in the Bronx.“So that’s really how you do it right. That is such a core component of the Green New Deal is having all of these projects make sense in a cultural context, and it’s an area that we get the most pushback on because people say, ‘Why do you need to do that? That’s too hard.’”She went on to add that growing cauliflower in such gardens is a “colonial approach” and the reason communities of color oppose environmentalist movements.“But when you really think about it -- when someone says that it’s ‘too hard’ to do a green space that grows Yucca instead of, I don’t know, cauliflower or something -- what you’re doing is you’re taking a colonial approach to environmentalism,” Ocasio-Cortez said.“That is why a lot of communities of color get resistant to certain environmentalist movements because they come with the colonial lens on them.”“But when you really think about it — when someone says that it’s ‘too hard’ to do a green space that grows Yucca instead of, I don’t know, cauliflower or something — what you’re doing is that you’re taking a colonial approach to environmentalism.”Ocasio-Cortez has emerged as the key Democratic voice on how to tackle climate change, going as far as to slam leading presidential candidate Joe Biden over reports that he’s exploring a “middle-ground” approach to tackling the issue.ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ APPLAUDS BILLIONAIRE'S OFFER TO PAY OFF ACADEMIC DEBT, BUT SAYS STUDENTS SHOULDN'T HAVE TO RELY ON GENEROSITY OF OTHERSBut the latest Instagram stories aren’t the first time Ocasio-Cortez linked climate change and the oppression of communities of color.Last month, the freshman Democrat said the migrant crisis is due to climate change, adding that if the U.S. doesn’t pass legislation addressing climate change, the U.S. would “have blood on our hands.”“The far-right loves to drum up fear & resistance to immigrants,” she tweeted. “But have you ever noticed they never talk about what‘s causing people to flee their homes in the first place? Perhaps that’s bc they’d be forced to confront 1 major factor fueling global migration: Climate change.”“I think what we have laid out here is a very clear moral problem,” she said at the House Oversight Committee. “If we fail to act or if we delay in acting, we will have blood on our hands.”Senate Democrats in March failed to reach the 60 votes necessary to begin debate on the Green New Deal proposal, with 42 Democrats and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., voting “present.” The lawmakers said they didn’t vote for the proposal because it was brought to a vote by Republican Senate Majority Leader for political purposes.Ocasio-Cortez also said in February that “there is no justice and there is no combating climate change without addressing what has happened to indigenous communities… That means that there is no fixing our economy without addressing the racial wealth gap.”",1

          In a newly posted video, Joe Biden can be seen telling a young activist he ""started this whole thing"" in response to a question about climate change activism
          Move over Al Gore, Joe Biden is stealing your shine.Or at least, based on a video posted online over the weekend, the former vice president may be trying to.In a video posted on Saturday, Biden is seen fielding a question from a member of the Youth Climate Strike, a group which organized over 100 marches worldwide by young people to protest climate change in March.The young woman told Biden about the group's push to get all 2020 presidential candidates to support a forum to discuss climate policy before the former vice president interrupts her.BIDEN CALLS FOR UNITY IN FIRST CAMPAIGN RALLY, BRANDS TRUMP 'DIVIDER-IN-CHIEF'""You know, I'm the guy that did all this stuff,"" Biden responded. ""Read RealClearPolitics, it'll tell you how I started this whole thing back in '87 on climate change.""He then tells the girl to ""send what they need,"" adding that he guarantees he'll ""be a leader.""The US Youth Climate Strike Twitter account posted the video along with the caption: ""Hey @JoeBiden, we’re happy to hear you care about climate policy, but we didn’t get to finish. We were gonna ask if you would commit to a #climatedebate. Will you?""FOX NEWS POLL: BIDEN UP BY DOUBLE DIGITS IN DEMOCRATIC RACEBiden also referenced his history as a pioneer in the climate change reform movement during a speech in Iowa earlier this month.In 1987, Biden did introduce a bill, the Global Climate Protection Act, that was signed into law by President Reagan. Its goal was to develop a task force to ascertain the best ways to stem the impacts of climate change.",1
"Bill Nye urges action on climate change in foul-mouthed rant; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.'When the much-ballyhooed Green New Deal came before the Senate — shortly before its anticlimactic demise — Democratic Hawaii Sen. Mazie Hirono waxed poetic about climate change as an agent of women’s oppression.“While the negative impacts of climate change often impact women the most, they too often don’t have a seat at the table when it comes to developing policy,” she said. “We need to empower women to tackle climate change. They need seats at the table.”We should certainly welcome and encourage more women to the public policy sphere, but the senator is wrong about the cause of the unequal suffering she describes.REINDEER ARE EATING SEAWEED TO SURVIVE CLIMATE CHANGE, SCIENTISTS SAYThe key to liberating women from oppression isn’t quixotic combat against a climate that has always changed and will always change. The real key is access to reliable, affordable, and abundant energy.Without electricity, daily tasks necessary for living such as cooking, gathering water, and caring for children require tedious, hard labor — labor that falls almost exclusively to wives, mothers, and daughters.If every community around the globe had the same affordable, reliable, and abundant energy as we enjoy in the United States, the untapped potential of millions of women in developing nations would be unleashed.Access to electricity is the most powerful catalyst for prosperity known to womankind. The overwhelmingly positive influence of energy to the human condition has been proven time and time again by radical advancements in life expectancy, child mortality, maternal mortality, public health, nutrition, economic growth, poverty, income, environmental quality, and nearly every other metric of human flourishing.According to UNICEF, women and girls around the world spend 200 million hours a day walking to collect water. This is time-consuming and physically taxing work, requiring women to walk more than three miles on average carrying immensely heavy loads while also putting themselves at risk for physical and sexual assault. If a woman was able to fetch the World Health Organization’s recommended supply of daily water for drinking, cooking, and washing, she’d carry 44 pounds of water every day — per family member.That burden could be lifted with access to electricity to pump the water where it is needed.And without electricity, that life-sustaining water is a source of danger itself. More than 500,000 people die every year from preventable diseases caused by contaminated water like diarrhea, cholera, dysentery, typhoid, and polio. These needless deaths, nearly unheard of in the developed world, could be prevented with clean water made possible by access to electricity.To make matters worse, three billion people worldwide lack access to safe cooking and heating fuels and are instead forced to burn wood, animal dung, kerosene, or coal. Girls in these households spend more than an hour every day collecting fuel, only to put themselves in more danger when they return home. Sadly, 3.8 million people die prematurely every year as a result of toxic pollutants released when these fuels are burned in closed quarters. Naturally, most are women and girls.We are privileged that electricity is an everyday commodity in the United States, and one we often don’t think twice about as long as the lights turn on when we flick the switch. But electricity could offer so much more than light to women in impoverished countries. It offers the unprecedented opportunity to escape not just physical and financial poverty, but also the poverty of time that too often prevents women from improving their lives.A study in Guatemala found that electrification reduced the amount of time women spent cooking by 34 percent, allowing them to invest more time in education, pursuing meaningful work, and civic engagement — activities that are critical to women’s political and social equality. With better education and meaningful, life-giving work, women in any community have the opportunity to truly shape their futures and their daughters’ futures.In 21st century America, vilifying the oil, natural gas, and coal industries is the politically easy and culturally sophisticated route — but not the correct route. These women can’t afford to wait for the advances in storage that will make wind and solar viable. Until battery technology achieves unprecedented improvement, renewable energy will remain too unreliable and expensive to make real change in the developing world.If every community around the globe had the same affordable, reliable, and abundant energy as we enjoy in the United States, the untapped potential of millions of women in developing nations would be unleashed. Women would be liberated from the time-consuming drudgery of maintaining a third-world household. No longer oppressed by energy poverty, women would have the time and ability to become active participants in leading their communities.Energy offers more than light and warmth to women in need. It offers freedom.",1
"Democratic presidential candidate Jay Inslee on Thursday unveiled a wide-ranging plan he says would combat climate change by shifting the U.S. from dependence on fossil fuels to renewable energy.The Washington State governor claimed his proposal -- called the ""Evergreen Economy Plan"" -- would create eight million jobs over 10 years as it builds a clean energy economy for the country.JAY INSLEE'S GREEN BID FOR THE 2020 DEMOCRATIC NOMINATIONBut it doesn’t come cheap.The price tag for the plan: $9 trillion in public and private money.“I believe America can defeat climate change and build a strong, clean energy economy for working families,” Inslee said in a statement.Spotlighting his efforts in his home state, the governor detailed that “this plan is built on our successes in Washington state, where we have passed strong clean energy laws and we have the fastest-growing economy in the nation. We need to rebuild the middle class with strong union jobs, while making the investments needed to power America’s clean energy transformation. The Evergreen Economy Plan provides a detailed roadmap to a clean energy economy that grows jobs in every community.”The Republican National Committee slammed Inslee in a statement to Fox News.“Not surprising to see yet another liberal Democrat propose a $9 trillion dollar plan that has the federal government calling the shots at the expense of American taxpayers and jobs. Meanwhile, under President Trump, the economy is flourishing because of his pro-growth, free-market approach. The choice for voters in clear,"" said RNC National Press Secretary Blair Ellis.First as a congressman, and now as a two-term governor, Inslee has spent decades as a leading advocate for reducing rising carbon levels in the atmosphere to reduce the effects of climate change.BIDEN DEFENDS HIS CLIMATE RECORD AFTER CRITICISM FROM GREEN NEW DEAL CHAMPIONS His latest efforts come as many progressive Democrats in Congress – as well as some of his rivals for the 2020 Democratic nomination – have embraced the Green New Deal, the sweeping proposal that aims to transform the country’s economy to fight climate change while enacting a host of new health care and welfare programs.But Inslee, who’s making combating climate change his top issue in his White House bid, is spotlighting his own plan rather than signing onto the Green New Deal.The plan would marshal 28 new or existing programs to shift U.S energy markets from fossil fuel dependence to renewable sources; transform U.S. automobile manufacturing and construction practices; and remake the nation's infrastructure from public transit to municipal water and rural electric cooperatives.Inslee projects about $300 billion in annual government spending over the first decade of the plan, with incentives he says will generate about $600 billion in matching private sector investment on everything from expanding solar energy to rebuilding dilapidating water systems like the Flint, Michigan, infrastructure that has garnered national headlines.Among Inslee's ideas are a ReBuild America program that would help retrofit existing public and private structures to meet new energy standards and a new version of the post-World War II ""G.I. Bill"" targeted to help coal industry workers who lose jobs in a transition to renewable energy. The coal worker aide would include guarantees for health insurance and pension benefits, in addition to funds for career training.Inslee unveiled his plan at an event at Washington D.C.’s wastewater treatment plant, which his campaign noted treats one billion gallons of water each day and uses cutting-edge technology to turn waste into 10 megawatts of electricity.The Associated Press contributed to this report.",1
"2020 hopeful Joe Biden applauds President Obama and the administration on the campaign trial. Former interim DNC chair and Fox News contributor Donna Brazile reacts.CONCORD, N.H. – Joe Biden is pushing back against criticism by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez that he’s “middle of the road” when it comes to tackling climate change.The former vice president and Democratic front-runner in the race for the White House – speaking with reporters during a campaign stop in New Hampshire on Tuesday – also called a new move by Attorney General William Barr to investigation the origins the Russia Investigation “Alice in Wonderland.”OCASIO-CORTEZ ASSAILS BIDEN ON CLIMATE CHANGEAnd he slammed President Donald Trump’s threats to send U.S. forces against Iran, saying the Republican president “has no foreign policy.”But the back-and-forth with Ocasio-Cortez, the freshman Democratic congresswoman from New York City and a rising star among progressives, began last week when she tweeted that Biden’s upcoming climate plan “is a dealbreaker. There is no 'middle ground' w/ climate denial & delay.”On Monday night she once again took aim at a “middle of the road approach.” Without mentioning the former vice president by name, Ocasio-Cortez highlighted that “if the same politicians who refused to act then are going to try to come back today and say we need to have a ‘middle of the road approach’ to save our lives, that is too much for me.”BIDEN SLAMS TRUMP OVER ESCALATING TRADE WAR WITH CHINAOcasio-Cortez spoke at an event hosted by the Sunrise Movement, a millennial that supports the Green New Deal, a plan co-sponsored by the congresswoman that aims to transform the country’s economy to combat climate change while enacting a host of new welfare programs. One of Biden’s main rivals for the nomination – Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont – also attended the event and also criticized the former vice president’s efforts on the issue.Biden, on Tuesday morning, responded.“You never heard me say ‘middle of the road.’ I’ve never been middle-of-the-road on the environment. Tell her.. to look at my record. She’ll find that nobody has been more consistent about taking on the environment and a green revolution than I have,” he spotlighted.The former vice president pointed to his record on the issue during President Barack Obama’s administration, emphasizing “$90 billion for dealing climate change.”Pointing to an address he’s expected to give before the end of the month on his plans to combat climate change, Biden said “you’ll hear very shortly the totality of what I plan on doing.”And pushing back against his critics, he noted that “this is a long campaign and everybody should just calm down a little bit and take a look at the record from before.”BIDEN CALLS GIULIANI'S NOW CANCELLED TRIP TO UKRAINE 'INAPPROPRIATE'Biden – who’s perceived to be more moderate than many of his rivals in an historically large Democratic presidential field that’s far surpassed 20 candidates -- touted his progressive chops.“I don’t yield anybody on my liberal credentials. Whether it’s on women’s issues, on LGBT issues, on speech, I have a record,” he spotlighted.“There’s very loud voices on the very new progressive side of the agenda, and I think it’s useful,” he noted.But Biden stressed that “the idea that somehow the Democratic Party is gone so far to the left that is not recognized by the most Democrats who consider themselves liberal is not factually what’s happening.”U.S. ATTORNEY HAS BEEN REVIEWING RUSSIA INVESTIGATION ORIGINS FOR WEEKSThe former vice president also criticized Barr’s appointment of John Durham, the U.S. attorney in Connecticut, to investigate the origins of the Russia investigation and allegations of improper government surveillance on Trump’s 2016 White House campaign. The FBI’s investigation into Russia tampering in the last presidential election began in July of 2016, at the tail end of Biden’s eight years as vice president.“Does anybody believe that the Russians didn’t engage in trying to engage our elected outcome? Does anybody believe anything is being done by this outfit now from keeping it from happening, which is happening now,” Biden asked on Tuesday.“Come one, this is like Alice in Wonderland. I don’t know where these guys are from,” he added, in a swipe against the current administration.The president, on Tuesday, denied that he asked for Barr to launch the investigation.“I didn't ask him to do that,"" Trump said at the White House ahead of his departure to Louisiana. ""I didn't know it.""""But I think it's a great thing that he did it. I saw it last night, and they want to look at how that whole hoax got started,"" the president added. ""You know what? I am so proud of our attorney general, that he is looking into it. I think it's great.""Biden also took aim at Trump over increased tensions with Iran, saying he’s “concerned” about a military escalation.The president on Tuesday dismissed a New York Times report that his administration is planning to send 120,000 troops to the Middle East to deal with Iran.But Trump then threatened to send more troops.""Would I do that? Absolutely,"" Trump told reporters. ""But we have not planned for that.""Trump then added that if he does send U.S. forces to the region, “we’d send a hell of lot more troops than that.""Biden argued that “the way to keep Iran from being a nuclear power is to stay in” the agreement hammered out during the Obama administration to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.“What has he done to slow up Iran at all,” Biden asked. “Now we’re going to decide we’re going to threaten a war with Iran. I mean the man has no foreign policy.”Biden spoke with reporters during his fourth campaign stop on a two-day swing through New Hampshire. It's the first trip to the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state by the former vice president since launching his White House bid in late April.",1
"GOP strategist Gus Portela and Democratic political analyst Wendy Osefo debate the Democratic Party’s relevance ahead of the 2020 election cycle.Conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh blasted Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., Monday for attempting to walk-back her previous comments about the planet only having12 years left because of climate change.“She claims that it was just dry humor and people don’t get it. She didn’t really mean it. Well, she did. She meant it to be taken seriously. She meant it to be received exactly as it was,” Limbaugh said on his radio show.RUSH LIMBAUGH: DEMOCRATS DESPERATE TO GET 'DONALD TRUMP OUT OF OFFICE' TURNING ATTACKS ON AG WILLIAM BARRThe freshman congresswoman Sunday, while responding to a tweet about taxing the rich, went after Republicans for mischaracterizing her “dry humor” and “sarcasm.” She also said her claim that the “world is ending in 12 years” was not meant to be taken literally.“This is a technique of the GOP, to take dry humor + sarcasm literally and 'fact check” it,' the freshman Congresswoman tweeted. Like the ‘world ending in 12 years’ thing, you’d have to have the social intelligence of a sea sponge to think it’s literal. But the GOP is basically Dwight from The Office so who knows,"" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted Sunday.Dwight Schrute was a character portrayed by actor Rainn Wilson on the NBC sitcom “The Office."" He was an eccentric foil who lacked understanding and made outlandish claims.In January, Ocasio-Cortez was much more matter of fact when talking about climate change and the world ending in 12 years, a number taken from a 2018 U.N. study.""Millennials and people, you know, Gen Z and all these folks that will come after us are looking up and we’re like: The world is going to end in 12 years if we don’t address climate change and your biggest issue is how are we gonna pay for it?"" Ocasio-Cortez said.AOC HITS THE ECONOMISTLimbaugh took offense to Ocasio-Cortez for asserting that Republicans were the ones who misunderstood her and didn’t understand humor.“So don’t tell me about people that don’t get humor. Don’t talk to me about people that don’t understand dry humor and sarcasm,"" Limbaugh said.""We get it, AOC. When things are funny, we get it. But you wouldn’t know funny if it bit you on your pretty little nose.”",1

"Can former Vice President Joe Biden thrive in a Democratic Party that treats predictions of climate change catastrophe as religious doctrine? Not if Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., have it their way.Reuters reported Friday that Biden – currently the early front-runner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination in terms of voter support and fundraising – is crafting a “middle ground” climate change policy that his team believes will appeal to enough voters to put him in the White House.According to the report by Reuters: “The backbone of the policy will likely include the United States re-joining the Paris Climate Agreement and preserving U.S. regulations on emissions and vehicle fuel efficiency that Trump has sought to undo, according to one of the sources, Heather Zichal, who is part of a team advising Biden on climate change. She previously advised President Barack Obama.”BIDEN, BUTTIGIEG WERE THE BUTT OF TRUMP'S JOKES 'PREVIEWING' ATTACKS FOR 2020: JOHN MCCORMACKReuters also reported that “the policy could also be supportive of nuclear energy and fossil fuel options like natural gas and carbon capture technology, which limit emissions from coal plants and other industrial facilities.”Biden’s “middle ground” policy comes just as Ocasio-Cortez – with help from Hollywood, the left-wing media and environmental groups – is ramping up her efforts to make the Green New Deal’s radical policies a litmus test for Democrats running for president in 2020.Ocasio-Cortez will headline a high-profile Green New Deal rally at Howard University in Washington on Monday. She is reportedly talking with filmmaker Rachel Lears about creating a documentary about the necessity of the Green New Deal. Lears is the director behind Netflix’s flattering “Knock Down the House” documentary about Ocasio-Cortez’s 2018 campaign.The pressure imposed on Biden by the socialist wing of the Democratic Party to conform to its far-left agenda presents a significant problem for him.So far, Ocasio-Cortez’s months-long effort to make the Green New Deal an essential part of the 2020 conversation has been wildly successful. Most Democratic presidential candidates have endorsed much or all of the Green New Deal.Six Democratic presidential contenders – Sens. Sanders, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kamala Harris of California, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Kristin Gillibrand of New York – co-sponsored Ocasio-Cortez’s nonbinding Green New Deal resolution in the Senate. It failed spectacularly when brought to floor in March.Biden has refused to endorse the Green New Deal, choosing instead to provide vague commitments about battling climate change.According to Biden’s website: “Climate change threatens communities across the country, from beachfront coastal towns to rural farms in the heartland. We must turbocharge our efforts to address climate change and ensure that every American has access to clean drinking water, clean air, and an environment free from pollutants.”Although “turbocharging” government’s control over American energy and imposing the Paris Agreement’s costly renewable energy mandates for sources like wind and solar power might sound appealing to some on the left, to radicals like Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders, nothing short of embracing the far-reaching socialist Green New Deal will do.After Reuters’ story about Biden’s “middle ground” plan broke, Green New Deal backers relentlessly attacked Biden.“There is no ‘middle ground’ when it comes to climate policy,” Sanders said. “If we don’t commit to fully transforming our energy system away from fossil fuels, we will doom future generations. Fighting climate change must be our priority, whether fossil fuel billionaires like it or not.”And Ocasio-Cortez tweeted: “There is no ‘middle ground’ w/climate denial & delay.”Biden campaign spokesman T.J. Ducklo pushed back, tweeting: “As president, Biden would enact a bold policy to tackle climate change in a meaningful and lasting way, and will be discussing the specifics of that plan in the near future.”“Any assertions otherwise are not accurate,” he added, noting in another tweet that “Reuters got it wrong.”The criticism Biden has drawn from the socialist wing of the Democratic Party has been going on since he made it clear he was seeking the party’s presidential nomination.Following Biden’s campaign launch in April, one of Ocasio-Cortez’s closest political allies – Justice Democrats Executive Director Alexandra Rojas – wrote in a statement: “While we’re going to support the Democratic nominee, we can’t let a so-called ‘centrist’ like Biden divide the Democratic Party and turn it into the party of ‘No, we can’t.’”Among the policies Rojas criticized Biden for was not embracing is the Green New Deal.The pressure imposed on Biden by the socialist wing of the Democratic Party to conform to its far-left agenda presents a significant problem for him.Biden is absolutely not a “centrist” and his climate change policies would likely cause massive and destructive energy price increases and economic harm. But he’s not a socialist, and that’s a big reason why so many Democrats are currently backing him.Although the Democratic Party has moved further to the left than ever, there remains a sizeable coalition of liberals who aren’t interested in completely destroying free enterprise, although that coalition appears to be getting smaller by the day.The Green New Deal’s policies are nothing short of extremist. It would eliminate all fossil fuels in just 10 years, destroying millions of jobs, and it would put government in charge of America’s energy industry. It would also require the government “upgrade” every building in the country – including every home – to reduce energy consumption. And it would offer a guarantee for “green” housing.The Green New Deal would provide “free” college tuition, a federal jobs guarantee, basic income programs, single-payer health care, and a slew of other socialist and “social justice” policies.All told, the Green New Deal could cost at least $93 trillion in its first ten years – about four times our current national debt.If Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders were to force Biden to adopt the Green New Deal, no reasonable person could argue Biden is a “centrist,” or even merely a far-left liberal – making it much harder for Biden to win in a general election against President Trump.This is especially true in America’s heartland, where Trump in 2016 performed better than most other recent Republican presidential candidates.Contrary to what Ocasio-Cortez might think, most voters in Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin don’t want the United States to become a government-controlled, socialist nation.They don’t want America to make the same mistakes made by the ruling class in some parts of Europe, North Korea, and Venezuela.Biden knows this. Ocasio-Cortez knows this. The only question that remains is, will Biden, in an effort to appeal to his party’s growing socialist base, choose to run off the Marxist cliff with the rest of the 2020 candidates?Thus far, it appears Biden isn’t buying what the socialists in his party are selling, but peer pressure can be a powerful force in politics. Biden’s peers have proven completely unwilling to allow anyone to deviate from their far-left beliefs on climate change.",1
"Former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell says the aspirational aspects of the 'Green New Deal' are OK.Billions of dollars are being spent each year in the U.S. to attempt to very slightly slow the pace of climate change – while raising the price of the energy we rely on and the goods and services we buy, and destroying jobs.Meanwhile, the fantasy-based Green New Deal embraced by many Democrats would increase spending by an unachievable level to combat climate change and to fund other far-left priorities – costing at least $93 trillion over the first 10 years, according to a study by the American Action Forum.That works out to about $600,000 for every U.S. household, according to the study. Would you like to pay that much more in taxes over the next decade? OCASIO-CORTEZ ASSAILS BIDEN'S 'MIDDLE GROUND' CLIMATE CHANGE PLAN, SAYS IT'S 'DEALBREAKER'Acknowledging that there’s not $93 trillion available, supporters of the Green New Deal advocate simply printing more money. Never mind that this is a recipe for hyperinflation that would destroy the value of U.S. currency and send our economy into a depression – the Green New Deal dreamers can’t be bothered with details.The Green New Dealers call climate change settled science, and if you disagree with them they say you’re a stooge of the oil companies, stupid, or evil – or all three.What they don’t tell you is that – as Ben Adler wrote in an opinion piece for The Washington Post May 2: “... the United States is currently responsible for only 15 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, and that share is declining as pollution from the developing world rises.”Adler, who is a senior editor at City & State NY, goes on to say that even massive cuts in greenhouse emissions from the U.S would be insufficient in the fight against climate change unless every other rich country makes similar cuts immediately.Adler is right, and many others have made the same point before. Carbon dioxide (which we all exhale every time we breathe) and other greenhouse gases that are believed to cause global warming are emitted all over the world and cross borders.So reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Iowa won’t slow climate change if emissions of the gasses go up in India, Iran and Indonesia.It’s an established fact that the draconian steps mandated by the federal Environmental Protection Agency to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. would only prevent the planet from warming by 0.01 degrees Celsius – an almost imperceptible amount.Former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said: “The value of this rule is not measured in that way. It is measured in strong domestic action which can actually trigger global action to address what is a necessary action.”In other words, McCarthy does not dispute the fact that the impact of enormously costly and disruptive new environmental regulations in the U.S. on climate change would be minimal. Her argument – and the argument of Green New Deal supporters – is that the U.S. should adopt such regulations to set an example for rest of the world.Of course, what you won’t find in McCarthy’s testimony or that of those who agree with her is the fact that saddling the American people with costly environmental regulations would be of great benefit to our competitors and adversaries around the world.In the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan cautioned European leaders against relying on the Soviet Union for energy. Thirty years later, we find the European Union has an enormous dependence on guess who? Russia.It’s an indisputable fact that oil, coal or natural gas produced in Russia, China or Iran sends as much greenhouse gasses into the global atmosphere as the same amount of fossil fuels produced in the U.S. But U.S.-produced energy strengthens our economy, creates jobs and reduces our foreign trade deficit.  The EU obtains more than half of its energy from imports. Of these imports, Russia is far and away from the largest partner, providing nearly one-third of crude oil importsIt’s no coincidence European nations were paralyzed and unable to react when Russia decided to annex Crimea from Ukraine. Being responsible for keeping the lights on gives Russia plenty of leverage.For the last two decades, climate change alarmists have done everything in their power to limit our own production of fossil fuels. While they may believe they are saving the world, they don’t realize (or perhaps they do) that they are benefiting countries like our adversaries Russia, Iran and China.Lower U.S. production of fossil fuels – coal, oil and natural gas – means higher prices and fewer places from which to purchase energy.The EU could be buying its energy from the United States. But during recent decades, while we had an ocean of fossil fuels beneath our feet, even the U.S. was sending money overseas to import energy for our own consumption.It’s an indisputable fact that oil, coal or natural gas produced in Russia, China or Iran sends as much greenhouse gasses into the global atmosphere as the same amount of fossil fuels produced in the U.S. But U.S.-produced energy strengthens our economy, creates jobs and reduces our foreign trade deficit. Luckily, in spite of the extreme environmental restrictions and hysteria, smart heads have prevailed. U.S. energy production is now booming under the Trump administration. Unlike President Barack Obama, President Trump has an energy policy based in reality.If you live in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Detroit or any city that has been struggling to stay afloat, take a look around and then go online and look at pictures of Dubai, which is part of the United Arab Emirates. Then ask yourself why your city doesn’t look like Dubai.Perhaps it is because the politicians who run your city have done everything in their power to prevent our great country from unleashing our energy economy. They are happy to scare you and tell you that the world will end if we don’t get rid of fossil fuels in just a few years.These Chicken Little environmental alarmists have been saying this every year for the last 20 years. Our foreign adversaries and competitors love them, because the alarmists ensure the foreign producers will make billions of dollars more every year – picking the pockets of the American people.We have to be smarter. If solar and wind energy were viable economic alternatives, they would have replaced fossil fuels already. And if they become viable in the future they will replace fossil fuels in the years ahead – that’s how the free market works.Should we adopt initiatives like the Green New Deal, we wouldn't be the only ones to suffer. We would increase not only our own dependence on foreign energy but the dependence of our closest friends.We all care about our planet and the environment. Nobody likes pollution and we all desire clean energy. But climate change does not exist in a vacuum. We need to look at the costs of draconian environmental regulations and the benefits the regulations provide.Bankrupting our nation, taxing the American people at impossible levels, and sending our economy into a depression are too high a price to pay for reducing the rise in global temperatures by 0.01 degrees Celsius.As you listen to presidential, congressional, and state and local candidates for elected office next year, keep all this in mind. While the Green New Deal may sound good at first glance, it looks very different when you examine the terrible harm it would cause to our nation and to the American people.",1
"Freshman New York Congresswoman Alexadnria Ocasio-Cortez says a potential Joe Biden nomination would be taking a step back; reaction from Fox News contributors Judith Miller and Dan Henninger.Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez slammed former Vice President Joe Biden’s “middle ground” climate change plan that is yet to be released, saying it’s a “dealbreaker” for the progressives.The New York Democrat joined environmental groups Friday in attacking Biden amid a report that his climate change plan will strike a less alarmist tone and won’t commit to a radical transformation of the economy.“This is a dealbreaker. There is no 'middle ground' w/ climate denial & delay,” tweeted Ocasio-Cortez, who earlier this year introduced the Green New Deal, a far-reaching proposal to combat climate change.OCASIO-CORTEZ SAYS SHE WAS ‘ASTONISHED’ WHEN MAN LEFT SIGN OUTSIDE HER OFFICE IN SUPPORT OF BOTH HER AND TRUMP“Blaming 'blue collar' Americans as the main opponents to bold climate policy is gas lobbyist 101,” she added. “We’re not going to solve the climate crisis w/ this lack of leadership. Our kids’ lives are at stake.”According to Reuters, Biden’s plan, which hasn’t yet been released, aims to appeal to both die-hard environmentalists and blue-collar voters who voted for President Trump in 2016.The core of the plan will likely include the U.S. re-joining the Paris Climate Agreement and focusing on technology and regulations to limit emissions from the burning of fossil fuels.The leading 2020 candidate also teased his plan on social media, tweeting: “I’m proud to have been one of the first to introduce climate change legislation. What I fought for in 1986 is more important than ever — climate change is an existential threat. Now. Today.”BIDEN BACKS HEALTH CARE FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, SAYS 'WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION' TO PROVIDE IT“We need policies that reflect this urgency. I'll have more specifics on how America can lead on climate in the coming weeks.”But progressive activist and environmental groups pounced amid the report about his plan. Sunrise Movement issued a scorching statement, calling Biden’s plan “a death sentence for our generation.”Prominent anti-capitalism activist Naomi Klein, meanwhile, tweeted: “No Joe, there is no ""middle ground"" on climate breakdown - there is bold, transformative action or there is sinking ground, burning ground and churning ground.”Yet some Biden staffers have objected to Reuters’ characterizations of the plan, issuing a number of tweets arguing that Biden’s plan will be as radical as those of his more progressive opponents.Biden “knows how high the stakes are,” campaign spokesman T.J. Ducklo said on Twitter. “As president, Biden would enact a bold policy to tackle climate change in a meaningful and lasting way, and will be discussing the specifics of that plan in the near future.”“Any assertions otherwise are not accurate,” he added, noting in another tweet that “Reuters got it wrong.”",1
"Fox News Flash top headlines for May 7 are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.comAn NBC News reporter raised eyebrows and prompted pushback from an MSNBC host after suggesting that climate change is like an alien invasion that is visible to everyone.The reporter, Jacob Ward, made the odd comparison following the release of the United Nations climate change report that claims a number of “transformative changes” will be needed to save nature and humanity from climate change and other threats.'TRANSFORMATIVE CHANGES' ARE NEEDED TO SAVE NATURE AND OURSELVES, MAJOR CLIMATE REPORT CLAIMS“Yeah, you know, it really is devastating, Stephanie. I mean, this is how dark the times are in the view of researchers… people are sort of getting ready for the horrors that this report is talking about. So it is dark times, I gotta say,” he told MSNBC’s Stephanie Ruhle during a Monday show.Ruhle then lamented that “there’s not even a consensus around climate change,” prompting Ward to make the comparison.“I know, I know. I mean, that’s the thing, right? You look at it and you think this should be our great unifying moment, right?” he asked. “This is the moment when space aliens land with ray guns and are threatening all of us and we all band together like you see in the movies. This is it. And yet, that’s not somehow happening.”“This is the moment when space aliens land with ray guns and are threatening all of us and we all band together like you see in the movies. This is it. And yet, that’s not somehow happening.”The over-the-top analogy was even too much to handle for Ruhle, who quickly pushed back against the reporter’s characterization, saying it’s “not fair.”MELTING PERMAFROST IN ARCTIC WILL HAVE $70 TRILLION IMPACT, NEW STUDY SAYS“But it’s not,” she interjected. “For your average American at home, there are not space aliens coming out and saying, ‘We’re going to take you over.’”She added: “This is an intangible. So how do we help them understand? Because it’s not fair to put it that way.”“For your average American at home, there are not space aliens coming out and saying, ‘We’re going to take you over.’”The reporter was receptive to the criticism and immediately admitted that his rhetoric was not grounded in reality, though doubled-down on the need to be alarmist.“I feel that it’s the kind of thing where we should be able to band together, we should be able to access something really basic in our programming that just says, ‘Existential threat, humanity, band together,’ and we’re not doing that for some reason.”",1
"Why the return to global scare tactics? Blame Trump.Remember Beto?Monday former congressman from Texas and current Democratic presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke said that Earth only has 10 years left if no action is taken on climate change.""I want to make sure that those who work in the oil and gas industry, those who work in the fossil fuel industry, are brought along as partners to make sure that we make this transition in the 10 years we have left to us, as the science and scientists tell us,"" O’Rourke said.BETO: WE ONLY HAVE '10 YEARS' LEFT TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGESo now it's 10 years. To save humanity, Beto proposes spending $5 trillion over three decades. I don’t get it. This begs the question: why?I'm thinking he saw Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, D-N.Y., claim we only had 12 years left on Earth, and he thought: Oh yeah? I can do it in 10!It's like a hysterical version of “Name that Tune.” Minus the tunes. Just the loons.So why the return to global scare tactics?I blame President Trump. America's economy is booming. Unemployment for everyone is at a historic low. Manufacturing jobs returned by the hundreds of thousands. There are people working now who never worked a day in their lives.Since ""Apocalypse Trump"" doesn't work, we’re back to “Chicken Little Theater.”Of course, this won’t stop Beto from using jets, trains or automobiles. Rationing is for the little people, but not for him.Poor Beto. Just a month ago he was the media's Best Friend Forever.

The Paris Agreement on climate change comes into force Friday Nov. 4, 2016, after a year with remarkable success in international efforts to slash man-made emissions of carbon dioxide and other global warming gases. (AP Photo/Thibault Camus, FILE)
          (The Associated Press)This week, Democrats in the House of Representatives will vote on a bill (H.R. 9) intended to prevent President Trump from withdrawing from the Paris climate accord. The legislation would also force the president to develop a plan for implementation — an endeavor even the Obama administration failed to accomplish — and would prevent any funds from being spent on withdrawal activities, which at this point amounts to a whopping 55 cents. That's the cost of sending one letter from the White House to the United Nation’s Secretary-General in New York.Trump understood that the Paris climate accord was a bad deal for the American people. It gave major polluters like China and India a free pass while locking in the last administration’s economically ruinous regulations that would have cost millions of jobs and undercut our recent economic success. Even more alarming is that all of those lost jobs would be sent overseas to countries that don’t use basic pollution control technology American industrial operators have been using for decades.Since the president's Rose Garden announcement that the United States would exit this disastrous deal, the lack of environmental progress from the nations that remain only further vindicates his decision. China’s carbon emissions in 2017 wiped out U.S. reductions more than threefold, and last year grew even faster. In 2017, India saw emissions rise nearly 5 percent with the growth split evenly between power and other sectors such as transport and industry.PARIS AGREEMENT ON CLIMATE CHANGE: US WITHDRAWS AS TRUMP CALLS IT 'UNFAIR'According to a 2018 report, as the president predicted, all EU countries are off target in reaching initial Paris commitments and have failed to adjust domestic policies to meaningfully advance them.  After spending $580 billion on renewable subsidies, Germany has had no meaningful carbon emissions reductions.The country has attempted to fix the numbers in their favor claiming emissions have fallen by 28 percent since 1990, but the bulk of those reductions occurred because of the collapse of East German industry after reunification, not their massive subsidization of renewables that has increased their citizens electricity rates by 50 percent.Where the Paris climate accord's words have failed, American innovation, our free-market system and President Trump continue to deliver.Meanwhile, the United States continues to lead the world in greenhouse gas emissions reductions while growing our economy to historic heights.  While emissions ticked up slightly in 2018 due to President Trump’s more than magical economy, the U.S. Energy Information Administration predicts emissions will continue to decrease in 2019 and 2020. According to the International Energy Agency, U.S. overall reductions represent the “largest absolute decline among all countries since 2000.”Any country that truly wishes to address climate in an economically beneficial way — such as creating five million jobs and over 3 percent GDP growth — should stop wasting their time with the empty and ineffective words of the Paris climate accord. Instead, they should seek to replicate U.S. actions. A key part of the president’s energy dominance agenda is sharing American energy expertise and innovative technologies with any country willing to constructively engage.During the floor discussion of H.R. 9 we will undoubtedly see that Democrats hate the president so much they are unwilling to recognize any of his achievements even when those achievements align with their party’s traditional goals. We have the cleanest air on record, are reinvesting in clean water infrastructure, have created millions of jobs, including 20,000 manufacturing jobs a month, and lead the world in greenhouse gas emissions reductions. Unfortunately, in the eyes of today’s Democrats, none of these counts because they have all occurred under the leadership of President Trump.Where the Paris climate accord's words have failed, American innovation, our free-market system and President Trump continue to deliver. Democrats who truly wish to address climate and create jobs should spend more time working with the Trump administration instead of trying to undermine its every move. Then, we could work together expanding U.S. environmental exceptionalism by finally getting the rest of the world to catch up.",1
"Newsom says the Los Angeles to San Francisco train will 'cost too much and take too long'; William La Jeunesse reports.In the next few weeks, California Gov. Gavin Newsom is slated to announce his administration’s energy policy strategy – and many environmental groups there are hoping it will include plans to end oil and gas drilling in the nation’s most populous state and phase out all fossil fuel extraction.At the very least, green groups are hoping that Newsom – who campaigned last year on a promise to end controversial extraction methods like fracking and who has been a key figure in the fight to curtail climate change – will create buffer zones for any new oil and gas wells near schools, hospitals and residential neighborhoods and also monitor for dangerous emissions from plugged or abandoned wells.“I consider to remain optimistic given how he expressed interest in issues that [former California Gov. Jerry] Brown did not address,” Kathryn Phillips, the director of the Sierra Club California, told Fox News. “The governor needs to make a plan to transition the state away from oil and gas toward renewables, but also transition workers into jobs in that sector.”CALIFORNIA GOV. NEWSOM OFFERS RARE PRAISE FOR TRUMPBut as Newsom’s term in Sacramento approaches its fifth month, many of these groups are losing patience as the governor tries to balance a clean energy agenda with the demands of an industry that supports hundreds of thousands of jobs in a state with around 26 million vehicles on the road.“I’m taking a very pragmatic look at it, in scoping this,” Newsom told The Los Angeles Times recently. “It’s also an inclusive scoping because it includes people in the industry, that have jobs; communities that are impacted from an environmental justice prism but also from an economic justice prism. It’s a challenging issue.”Newsom must now weigh the support he received from environmental groups while on the campaign trail – and his own assurances that he wants California to be powered 100 percent by renewable energy in the near future – with any moves that could negatively affect a billion-dollar industry in a state that has the world’s fifth largest economy.Even with California’s oil production being in decline for years, the state was the nation’s fifth-largest domestic crude oil producer in 2017, according to figures compiled by the federal government.“His intentions are very pragmatic,” Catherine Reheis-Boyd, the president of the Western States Petroleum Association, told Fox News. “Newsom understands the importance of an industry to the 40 million people who will be driving 26 million combustible engines tomorrow.”CALIFORNIA GOV. NEWSOM CALLS TRUMP INCOMPETENT IN INAUGURAL SPEECH; VOWS TO FIGHT WH POLICIESOne practice that environmental groups are hoping Newsom will clamp down on more than his predecessor is hydraulic fracturing. Known more popularly as fracking, it is a method of oil and gas extraction in which large volumes of high-pressure water are shot into the ground.Fracking has come under intense scrutiny in recent years amid widespread concerns over both the public health and environmental risks it poses. While Brown approved restrictions on the practice back in 2013, he was lambasted by green groups for not banning fracking outright amid his argument that it could provide economic opportunities to some Californians. On the campaign trail last year Newsom was adamantly opposed to fracking, but has so far remained quiet about the practice – along with the possibility of banning offshore drilling in the state - when discussing his energy agenda. Newsom, however, told the ""Los Angeles Times"" that despite his commitment to renewable energies, it would be impossible to completely stop California’s reliance on fossil fuels at the moment.“One cannot just turn off the switch. One cannot just immediately abut against a century of practice and policy,” Newsom said.Still California is one of the nation’s leaders in pushing forth a green energy agenda.CALIFORNIA VS. TRUMPDespite the criticism leveled against him for waffling on clamping down on the fossil fuel industry, Brown last year signed two pieces of legislation that effectively banned the construction of any new offshore oil and gas pipelines in the state’s waters and thwarted a Trump administration plan to open nearly 1.7 billion acres of coastal waters to drilling.While California cannot directly block oil and gas drilling off its coast, the legislation that Brown signed aims to drive up the operating costs of these operations enough to make the effort unprofitable. The law does this by blocking state land managers from permitting the construction of new pipelines, piers, wharves or other infrastructure projects necessary to bring oil and gas from offshore drilling sites to land.“California has positioned itself as the center of the Trump resistance,” Jessica Levinson, a clinical law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, told Fox News. “It’s bloody combat.”California banned offshore drilling in state waters out to three miles back in 1994 and there haven’t been any new platforms built in the last 30 years. But California is the nation’s third-largest oil-producing state, behind Texas and North Dakota, and there are still 32 offshore oil platforms and artificial islands in federal and state waters off the coasts of Santa Barbara, Ventura, Los Angeles and Orange Counties.California may be leading the nation in curbing its reliance on fossil fuels and many environmental activists believe Newsom will take even bolder steps than his predecessor, energy industry insiders like Reheis-Boyd question what the point is when other states – and nations – are not doing their part as well.“I get the idea of taking a lead on this issue and I think many companies agree with this,” she said. “But at what cost is this being done, especially when nobody else is doing anything.”",1
"What do you get when you combine climate change advocates, super glue, and large quantities of litter and waste? Well, it’s not a work of art… Tomi gives us the answer today in her 'First Thoughts.'Here’s a headline for you: California climate change activists superglue themselves to the globe at Universal Studios.You know I have some thoughts on this.The headline is true. On Earth Day, members of a radical climate change rebellion group managed to scale the iconic globe at Universal Studios in Hollywood and apparently superglued themselves to the structure.Why? For attention, duh.CLIMATE CHANGE PROTESTERS BRING LONDON TO A HALT; DEMONSTRATOR GLUES HIMSELF TO SUBWAY TRAINThe group, Extinction Rebellion LA, sent a list of demands to NBC, urging the network to take action on the climate crisis with the following proposals:1.That NBC/Universal declares that we are indeed in a Climate and Ecological Emergency -- that the extinction of the natural world is happening, that we are facing the collapse of civilization.2. That NBC/Universal will tell the whole truth about our climate and ecological emergency, including the failure of the U.S. government to respond with appropriate action/preparedness planning until now.3.That NBC reject all advertising from fossil fuel corporations, agrees to be zero-carbon by 2025, and publish a public, annual eco-audit of all NBC/Universal operations, including summary of key ecological and carbon data.4. That NBC ONLY permit think-tank spokespersons or lobbyists on the air to discuss the climate and ecological emergency whose funding is made fully transparent to viewers in each and every case.Did Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez set this stunt up? It sure sounds like it.Maybe instead of supergluing themselves to Hollywood infrastructure, these tree-huggers could use that time to clean up the trash and filth created by this state’s drug and homeless epidemic. That would be a productive use of time.If they care so much about conservation and the environment, why don’t they superglue themselves to Governor Gavin Newsom's door and demand that HE do something about the thousands of needles littering the streets of San Francisco? Or what about the human feces?It's not just in San Fran. The problem plagues the entirety of our state from San Francisco to San Diego and everywhere in between.These climate change groups also conveniently ignore the many third-world style encampments and tent cities scattered throughout our Golden State of Homelessness. Heck, at the end of last year the Sacramento City Council approved a resolution to dole out $400,000 to hire employees solely for the purpose of cleaning up homeless encampments in California’s capital.In fact, according to Caltrans -- the California Department of Transportation -- the growing amounts of trash along our freeways can be partly attributed to the homeless encampments.You think?!Those are the same encampments that Democrats and climate change warriors in this state -- and across the nation -- conveniently ignore.So maybe instead of supergluing themselves to Hollywood infrastructure, these tree-huggers could use that time to clean up the trash and filth created by this state’s drug and homeless epidemic. That would be a productive use of time.But wait, that kind of effort doesn’t get headlines and attention, which is really all these activists are after, right?They couldn’t care less about the actual environment. They just pull stunts to grandstand and validate their self-importance.So before they lecture NBC/Universal, or any of us for that matter, on the climate change apocalypse, perhaps they should adopt a highway, adopt some common sense, and adopt a true understanding of what the hell they’re talking about.I better not see a single one of these protesters arriving or departing from their “activism” in vehicles!If we are truly facing impending extinction due to global warming, do your part and walk your self-righteous behinds to your protests.God bless and get a clue.",1
"After Alec Baldwin's most recent appearance on 'Saturday Night Live' impersonating President Donald Trump, the President sent out a tweet criticizing the actor's parody of his White House Rose Garden announcement. Baldwin responded in kind shortly after wondering if Trump's tweet could be considered a threat against him and his family.Actor Alec Baldwin said Tuesday that his passion about preserving the planet for future generations was sparked by meeting indigenous people who are guardians of their lands at the 2015 Paris conference that adopted the landmark agreement to tackle global warming.Baldwin was at U.N. headquarters to moderate a panel on threats to ""Forest Defenders"" on the sidelines of the annual meeting of the U.N. Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues and spoke to several journalists about his commitment to the environment.ALEC BALDWIN IS AN 'ENTITLED CELEBRITY' WITH 'HISTORY OF VERBALLY AND PHYSICALLY MISTREATING OTHERS': LAWSUITHe said he finds it ""very, very unsettling"" that indigenous people who understand better than anyone else the places where they live face strong opposition from those in power who want ""to get rid of them by whatever means necessary"" and gain control of natural resources on the land. Baldwin cited as examples the killings of indigenous activists in Peru and Brazil, and deforestation of the rainforests in the Amazon and Asia that are ""the lungs of the planet.""Baldwin's message came just a day after Earth Day, a global celebration of environmentalism observed since 1970.President Trump didn't mention climate change or the environmental threats created by deforestation, species loss and plastic waste in oceans in his Earth Day address, the Guardian reported. Instead, the president affirmed that ""a strong market economy is essential to protecting our critical natural resources and fostering a legacy of conservation.""In 2017, Trump announced that the U.S. plans to leave the Paris climate accord as soon as it is eligible to do so.Baldwin, who plays Trump on the NBC comedy series ""Saturday Night Live, sat beside Rukka Sombolinggi, secretary-general of Indonesia's Indigenous People's Alliance of the Archipelago. She said 10 indigenous activists are currently behind bars in her country.

      World leaders will ""have to stop talking and negotiating"" at the U.N. climate summit coming up in September, Sombolinggi continued. ""They just really need to agree on actions"" to preserve ""mother Earth,"" Sombolinggi said.Baldwin interjected to laughter: ""Can't you move here and run for senator?""We need someone to say, 'No more talking,'"" he said. ""We need you in Washington!""Baldwin said Americans feel they are going to do the right thing because of their resources and economic power, ""but you find that we're becoming more and more like other parts of the world where anything goes, regulations being set aside.""He warned that ""this may be our last change in the next 20 years"" to take action against global warming.""There are things that we just can't imagine that can happen in terms of the food supply, in terms of climate change, in terms of flooding in coastal areas in the United States and beyond,"" he said. ""The time is now to make certain sacrifices ... so that this planet will remain habitable"" for today's children.Baldwin said that ""the imprimatur of the United Nations is important to me.""""My favorite thing about the U.N. is the word 'permanence',"" he said. ""They have permanent missions and permanent forums. They're the only ones who can say, 'We're here and we're not going anywhere.' And I love the inevitability of that.""The Associated Press contributed to this report. ",1
"Fox News Flash top headlines for April 23 are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.comCBS dug up for Earth Day a decades-old news clip about pollution and the environment urging people to “act or die,” while its current morning show hosts endorsed punitive fees on some urban motorists.CBS ""This Morning"" played the vintage video of Walter Cronkite in 1970 endorsing the Earth Day as “a day set aside for a nationwide outpouring of mankind seeking its own survival.” In another clip, Cronkite says: “The gravity of the message of Earth Day still came through. Act or die.”In the spirit of the doomsday warnings in 1970, which have since been ridiculed for over-the-top predictions, the show aired a segment praising London’s ultra-low emission zone that forces motorists to pay high fees just to drive through the center of London.BILL DE BLASIO SAYS GREEN NEW DEAL WILL BAN ‘INEFFICIENT’ STEEL AND GLASS SKYSCRAPERS“Approach central London and you'll see these signs announcing a charge just for bringing your car into town. Ka-ching, about 15 bucks. And if you've got an older car, especially if it's a diesel, the overhead cameras will spot you, and under the new, ultra low emissions zone, that will be another sixteen and a half bucks. That’s over $30 just to drive into town,” the segment said.The show’s co-anchor Gayle King said the fees are a way of doing “a little something” to fight climate change and suggested the policy will encourage people to update their vehicles or “take the bus.”The broadcast didn’t raise the criticism shared by Londoners and British conservatives that say the roll out of the policy hits the poorest motorists the hardest as, unlike wealthy residents, they cannot upgrade their vehicles to the required standard to avoid fees.

      (Reuters)PROTESTERS CLIMB UNIVERSAL STUDIOS GLOBE IN CALIFORNIA DEMANDING NBC TAKE CLIMATE-CHANGE ACTIONMany of the initial predictions about global warming voiced in the 1970s have been debunked. Ecologist Watt, according to the Daily Signal, issued a number of bombshell predictions in the wake of Earth Day in 1970, warning of the imminent shortages and the end of crude oil.“By the year 2000, if present trends continue, we will be using up crude oil at such a rate … that there won’t be any more crude oil,” Watt reportedly said. “You’ll drive up to the pump and say, ‘Fill ‘er up, buddy,’ and he’ll say, ‘I am very sorry, there isn’t any.'”According to various studies, the world oil consumption more than doubled since 1970 thanks to the emergence of industrial powers such as China and India.American Enterprise Institute, as pointed out by the Media Research Center, also notes the over-the-top tone of the media in 1970, encapsulated by Life magazine’s reporting that “in a decade, urban dwellers will have to wear gas masks to survive air pollution … by 1985 air pollution will have reduced the amount of sunlight reaching earth by one half.”",1

          A high-definition video camera outside the space station captured stark and sobering views of Hurricane Florence ESA/NASA–A. Gerst
          The hurricane pre-season hysteria is ramping up again, as predictable as the melting snow. Hurricanes are big newsmakers. They are also natural disasters that are easy to “weaponize” for various political ends – most notably as evidence of climate change.The 2005 hurricane season was a precursor for this. That year – a horrible and record-setting one that included the devastating hurricanes Katrina and Rita, among others – was used to launch endless and alarmist predictions that such a season would become the norm.And yet another 11 years would pass before the U.S. coast would experience another major hurricane hit – the longest period on record.AOC NARRATES VIDEO FROM FUTURE IN WHICH HER 'GREEN NEW DEAL' SAVES US FROM ENVIRONMENTAL CATASTROPHENow this year, 2018’s deadly Hurricane Michael is being used to set off yet another round of hysteria – and that storm’s incredible amount of damage is being cited yet again as proof of climate change.Is it, though? Is the devastation from such storms the result of CO2 in the atmosphere, as climate change proponents claim? Or could it be mankind’s affinity to densely populate our coastlines?If one simply looks at the past, one finds that history can solve the mystery for us.(charts courtesy of the National Hurricane Center)Imagine the hurricane hits of the 1940s occurring again, especially in Florida. The Great Atlantic Hurricane of 1944 in particular sticks out, with its 600-mile-wide diameter of hurricane force winds that destroyed every boardwalk from Virginia Beach to Long Island.Or take note of all the major hurricanes that impacted the U.S. East Coast during the 1950s – all Category 3’s, at least. I’ll remind the reader that 2012’s Sandy was barely a category 1 hurricane at landfall.If such events occurred then, with much lower CO2 present in the atmosphere, why should CO2 be the major contributing factor with respect to hurricane intensity now?The past is a great foundation to stand on to reach for the future. Because I know what happened in the past, not only is my forecasting improved, but it also helps me to cast a skeptical eye at some of the hype being raised over man-made climate change.When it comes to hurricanes, I think the hysteria relies in large part on the fact that most people do not know 20th century hurricane history. The bottom line is that hurricanes happen. And raising alarm and focusing all of our attention on “climate change” as the reason does not serve those in the next devastating storm’s path.My mission is to get people to become aware of why man-made climate change skeptics such as myself are skeptical, and to hope that the scientifically curious reader will look to make an informed decision for themselves.When it comes to hurricanes and the hysteria that the climate change purveyors are trying to encourage, I believe that presenting the other side of the issue will allow you to at least be able to question the ideas that are being pushed on you.Hurricane research and forecasting methods need to be a major initiative for the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Using hurricanes as a political tool to advance an agenda, however, does nothing to expand or enhance this, or the safety net for our nation.",1

Protesters said that they wanted to illustrate that they are ""not a rabble, (but) rebels with a cause"" and are ""disciplined and cannot only start disruptive actions but also end these when needed.""Next week, they say, will be ""focused on negotiations,"" organizer Farhana Yamin said, according to BBC.""Today marks a transition from week one, which focused on actions that were vision-holding but also caused mass disruption across many dimensions,"" she said.""Week two marks a new phase of rebellion focused on negotiations where the focus will shift to our actual political demands.""CLIMATE CHANGE PROTESTERS BRING LONDON TO HALT, DEMONSTRATOR GLUES HIMSELF TO SUBWAY TRAIN

At one point, campaigners glued themselves to each other, to a subway train, and to the roof of a truck atop Waterloo Bridge.Now, the group hopes to meet with major political figures, including the Mayor of London, to negotiate their demands about addressing climate change.It is not yet known if Mayor Sadiq Khan will be open to negotiations, given that he previously condemned the groups' behavior and called it an ""extremely challenging"" burden on police.""I'm extremely concerned about the impact the protests are having on our ability to tackle issues like violent crime if they continue any longer,"" he said.""It simply isn't right to put Londoners' safety at risk like this.""",1
"In a video released on Wednesday, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., told a ""story from the future"" in which her ""Green New Deal"" transformed the American economy and rescued the United States from the dire threat of climate change.The freshman congresswoman predicted that Democrats would take both chambers of Congress and the White House by 2020 — ushering in a ""decade of the Green New Deal"" that prompted the ""social and ecological transformation to save the planet.""""Lots of people gave up, they said we were doomed,"" she said after blaming fossil fuel companies like Exxon for saddling the public with the cost of climate issues. ""But some of us remembered that as a nation, we'd been in peril before — the Great Depression, WWII — we knew from our history how to pull together to overcome impossible odds,"" she said.Championed by Ocasio-Cortez, the ""Green New Deal,"" has been criticized as unrealistic and too expensive. According to a conservative think tank's estimate, the plan could cost upwards of $93 trillion, more than four times the national debt as of April 15, 2019.But in the video, published by the climate-oriented Sunrise Movement, Ocasio-Cortez described Green New Deal legislation as ""the kind of swing-for-the-fence ambition we needed.""""Finally, we were entertaining solutions on the scale of the crises we faced without leaving anyone behind,"" she said.Her plan included public works projects, a ""federal jobs guarantee,"" and Medicare-for-all, which she predicted would become ""the most popular social program in American history.""PELOSI APPEARS TO TAKE NEW JAB AT OCASIO-CORTEZ, SAYS 'A GLASS OF WATER' WITH A 'D' COULD WIN THEIR DISTRICTSThe ambitious video came at a time when Democrats appeared divided between more establishment Democrats and progressives like Sen.

"London was brought to a standstill Wednesday morning after militant climate change protesters cause havoc for a third day in a row, climbing and gluing themselves on subway trains, causing road closures and other disruption, leading to an arrest of nearly 300 people in the past 48 hours.The protesters calling themselves Extinction Rebellion, which were also responsible for a naked protest in the British Parliament earlier this month, are demanding the government to legally commit to reducing net carbon emissions to zero in the next six years and are willing to go to jail for the cause.TOPLESS CLIMATE CHANGE PROTESTERS ARRESTED AFTER INTERRUPTING BREXIT DEBATE IN BRITISH PARLIAMENTLondoners’ morning commute was particularly disrupted after the protesters climbed on top of a Docklands Light Railway (DLR) train in East London, prompting shutdown or severe delays on numerous underground lines.

          Former Secretary of State John Kerry clashed with Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., on Tuesday.
          (AP/Reuters)Former Secretary of State John Kerry and Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., had a heated exchange Tuesday over Kerry's education and climate change.Kerry, 75, appeared before the House Oversight and Reform Committee hearing to talk about climate change. The incredible exchange began when Massie read a quote Kerry said regarding President Trump’s advisers.“It sounds like you’re questioning the credentials of the president’s advisers, but I don’t think we should question your credentials today. Isn’t it true you have a science degree from Yale?” Massie asked Kerry.Kerry replied that he had a bachelor of arts degree from the university.JOHN KERRY: 'IT'S A MISTAKE TO TALK ABOUT IMPEACHMENT'“Is it a political science degree?” Massie, who has two engineering degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, asked.“Yes, it’s political science,” the former Massachusetts senator said.“So, how do you get a bachelor of arts in science?” the congressman asked.“Well it’s liberal arts education and - it’s a bachelor,” Kerry said.“So, it’s not really science. I think it’s somewhat appropriate that somebody with a pseudoscience degree is here pushing pseudoscience in front of our committee,” Massie said before Kerry fired back.“Are you serious? I mean this is really happening here?” the former secretary of state asked.JOHN KERRY SLAMMED FOR 'SHAMEFUL' SHADOW DIPLOMACY AFTER ADMITTING TO MEETINGS WITH IRANThe two men continued their back and forth before Massie asked Kerry if he was saying the president “doesn’t have educated adults there now.”“I don’t know who he has there because it's secret,” he replied. “Why would he have to have a secret analysis of climate change?”The two then began to discuss carbon dioxide levels on the planet today versus millions of years ago.“But there weren’t human beings; that was a different world, folks,” Kerry said.“So — how’d it get to 2,000 parts per million if we humans weren’t here? … Did geology stop when we got on the planet?” Massie asked.“This is just not a serious conversation,” Kerry fired back.Kerry tweeted about the exchange Wednesday.“It’s almost as if someone said, ‘Congress has hit rock bottom’ and Massie replies with ‘hold my beer,’” he wrote.Massie replied to Kerry’s tweet saying, “It’s almost as if someone said, ‘No one has less knowledge of science, a higher opinion of himself, and a bigger carbon footprint than Al Gore’ and Kerry replies ‘hold my champagne, I’m going to testify as a climate change expert.”",1
"While discussing the border crisis on “Your World” on Wednesday, Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, ripped fellow freshman lawmaker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., for saying climate change is responsible for troubling conditions at the nation's southern border.“It's news to me, I didn't know the Green New Deal would also solve the border crisis,” Crenshaw told guest host Charles Payne.“It's pretty clear that [Democrats are] not taking this seriously at all. I mean listen the numbers speak for themselves. This is not due to climate change.”“The far-right loves to drum up fear & resistance to immigrants,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted on Tuesday. “But have you ever noticed they never talk about what‘s causing people to flee their homes in the first place?PELOSI APPEARS TO MOCK OCASIO-CORTEZ OVER-RELIANCE ON TWITTER FOR SUPPORT“Perhaps that’s bc they’d be forced to confront 1 major factor fueling global migration: Climate change.”Ocasio-Cortez, the co-sponsor of the Green New Deal resolution, has been focused on addressing climate change since becoming a member of the House in January.Crenshaw said Dems are using climate change as the answer to everything.ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ SUGGESTS US WILL HAVE 'BLOOD ON OUR HANDS' IF CLIMATE CHANGE ISN'T TACKLED“Every immigrant who comes across has a different reason for wanting to come across but it certainly isn't climate change and that's just a ridiculous statement,” Crenshaw said.“You know they've come to this point where they want to blame climate change for quite literally everything now, and sorry, but the Green New Deal is not going to solve that.”",1
"Could toxic masculinity be the cause of climate change?Conservative commentator Mark Steyn appeared on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" and discussed that very question raised by a new research paper.“I think in fact it's actually one of the least reasonable climate science theses of recent years. So I'm kind of on board with where they're going on this,” Steyn told Carlson.CLIMATE CHANGE DROVE SOME NEANDERTHALS TO CANNIBALISMSteyn continued to break down the “scientific survey” to Carlson, explaining that Walmart gift cards were part of the study.“This is the kind of hardcore science behind it, which they gave someone a Walmart gift card, it was pink and had lots of flowery patterns on it,” Steyn said.“So the guy given this gift card went out and bought a lot of very macho masculine things to melt the polar ice caps. Whereas if you give him something.. he's so impressionable, this toxic masculine male, that if you give him a masculine-type card, he just thinks, ‘oh that's really nice,’ and he goes out and he buys the Sierra Club tote bag and saves the planet.”Carlson asked if climate science wasn’t supposed to be about “ice cores” but Steyn disagreed.OCASIO-CORTEZ: WE REACTED TO 9/11, WHY NOT CLIMATE CHANGE?“If you want to go out... you can go and take tree ring samples in the middle of nowhere if you want, but that's for losers,” Steyn said. “The big bucks are doing a survey [that] you decide what’s heating up the planet is men.”",1
"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D.N.Y., unleashed on her Republican opponents during a marathon Instagram Live session on Wednesday night.The freshman Democrat compared her GOP critics to ""that girl in 'The Exorcist' that's, like, vomiting pea soup,"" and said she ""pities"" the role they are playing in not taking action on climate change -- all while putting together some IKEA furniture in her new D.C. apartment.“The reason Republicans hate me so much is because I confront them directly on their moral — their lack of moral grounding on so many issues and, not just that, but the reason they're so upset and they act like that girl in 'The Exorcist’ that's like vomiting pea soup, that’s like them and negativity,” Ocasio-Cortez said in one clip.ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ HIT WITH FEC COMPLAINT FOR ALLEGED 'SUBSIDY SCHEME'“The reason that they do that is because they need to fiercely protect a paradigm and way of thinking that says short-term gains are more important, no matter how marginal than any long-term loss and any long-term cost.”The New Yorker then replied in dire fashion to a viewer who asked how many years the planet has left.“We have 12 years left to cut emissions by at least 50 percent, if not more, and for everyone who wants to make a joke about that, you may laugh but your grandkids will not,” she said, before continuing to compare those who oppose her calls for drastic action on climate change to those who were on the wrong side of history during the civil rights movement.“Look back and you open history books… you see those folks who are protesting against the ability for African Americans and black Americans to have the right to vote,” she said.CHARLES PAYNE: DEMOCRATS ARE 'AFRAID' OF THEIR 'DE FACTO LEADER' ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ“So just know, that in the present day, there are a lot of people who hide the fact that their families and that their grandparents fought against principles of equal rights in the United States. Not 100 years ago, not 80 years ago, but in this generation’s lifetime.“So, while a lot of people can hide that their grandparents did that in the civil rights movement, the Internet documents everything and your grandchildren will not be able to hide the fact you fought against acknowledging and taking bold action on climate change.“People who are trying to mock and delay this moment, I mean, I just feel bad for you. I just pity you for your role in history right now.”At another point in the video, Ocasio-Cortez appeared to accuse border agents of “trying to cage children at the border and inject them with drugs.”“That’s not a mistake, that’s a deliberate policy to attack people based on their national origin,” she said.The comment appeared to be in reference to a lawsuit last year claiming immigrant children were being routinely and forcibly given a range of psychotropic drugs at U.S. government-funded youth shelters to manage their trauma after being detained and in some cases separated from parents.AOC’s Instagram session came after Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz unveiled the “Green Real Deal” on Wednesday as a free-market counterproposal to the Green New Deal being pushed by Democrats to combat climate change.“The question for America is pretty simple: either we want a bunch of bureaucrats in Washington telling us what we can’t do, or we empower American innovators to unlock things that we can do,” the Florida congressman said at a press conference in front of the Capitol building.His plan, which he is putting forward in a House resolution, involves a number of planks including revisiting global trade and intellectual property policies to create “an international marketplace fair to American innovators.”Gaetz's plan also aims to modernize the electric grid, which he says currently “functions as a wet blanket over American innovation.” Gaetz claims that upgrading the grid will create an “entire class of energy entrepreneurs across the country.” He also wants to ""unlock federal lands"" from current regulations, saying they can be “an open canvas” for renewable energy research, testing and evaluation.",1
"SEATTLE -- With every flood, devastating wildfire and even a deep freeze, climate change seems to get the blame. News headlines sound alarms with fears about survival, destruction of the planet and the end of humans.It’s all apparently too much for some to cope with, which is the reasoning behind a first of its kind class at the University of Washington Bothell. It’s titled, “Environmental Anxiety and Climate Grief: Building Resilience in the Age of Consequences.”According to the school, Camilo Acosta, a student who enrolled in the class, explained her decision this way, “For the longest time I didn’t let myself feel the pain and anguish that was building up due to the destruction of our earth,” Acosta said.High profile Democrats are fueling the panic as they push for a Green New Deal. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., made headlines when she recently said, “The world is going to end in 12 years if we don’t address climate change.” Several Democrats running for president in 2020 also support the Green New Deal, including Beto O’Rourke of Texas, who said on the campaign trail, “The future of the human race literally depends on it.”The Climate Grief class has students spending one hour each week outside in nature in a quiet place. They’re required to write about what they see and feel. Students also take part in a group project in which they assemble a climate change survival kit. But it’s not to be filled with flashlights and emergency food, but rather books and poems that can help others deal with their emotions tied to the environment.Cliff Mass, a meteorologist and professor of Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Washington, agrees humans are playing some role in the warming planet, but he also thinks this class on grief and anxiety should flunk out.“I think the best thing to do now is not play on people’s fears and anxieties, and not reflect on some of the exaggerated headlines that we have in the paper,” Mass said.UN REPORT: EXTREME WEATHER HIT 62 MILLION PEOPLE IN 2018That assessment is shared by Benji Backer, a UW student and member of the American Conservation Coalition. Backer also believes humans bear some responsibility.“The climate is a slow change, a slow but steady change, and saying that people will have to deal with massive problems that they’ll need survival kits for is just not accurate,” Backer said.The World Meteorological Organization just released its 2018 report to the United Nations. It concluded the planet has warmed 1 degree Celsius since the pre-Industrial Age in the 1850s and 2018 was the fourth warmest year on record. The report documents a loss of sea ice, rising sea levels and says nations are not on track to meet carbon emission standards set in the Paris Climate Accord.A recent study done at Yale found 29 percent of Americans are “alarmed” about climate change. That’s double the number from an identical survey done in 2013.'BIRTH STRIKE' FOUNDER ARGUES FUTURE 'TOO FRIGHTENING' FOR HER TO HAVE CHILDREN DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGEDennis Hartmann, who was elected to the National Academy of Sciences and is a former Chairman of the University of Washington’s Department of Atmospheric Sciences, said it’s not healthy to be anxious about climate change all the time, but it’s rational to worry about the future.“Young people have a lot of anxiety, for many reasons, and anything we can do to help them cope with that is good,” Hartmann said.The Climate Grief class instructor, Jennifer Atkinson, calls her course a kind of boot camp for students willing to fight for the planet, giving them tools to survive emotionally.  But she does have her detractors, who mocked the class as a 12-step program for a generation of snowflakes.",1
"Throughout my 40 year career as a meteorologist, I have tried to live up to the responsibility I inherited from my predecessors. I was taught to strive for objective truth, irrespective of where the data would lead. Science is not a belief system based on feelings or subjective motives. It is about facts, evidence, theories and experimentation in search of a conclusion.The impassioned speech by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., to Congress last week revealed volumes about the intent and commitment of those pushing the Green New Deal. I can’t help but question if their positions are based on facts.Ocasio-Cortez’s statements about adverse climate effects and policy proposals reflect a lack of knowledge about energy policy and the geopolitical and financial impacts of abandoning fossil fuels in a quick and reckless manner. “The world is going to end in 12 years if we don’t address climate change,” she said earlier this year – a statement clearly designed to elicit panic but hardly based on fact.NICOLAS LORIS: THE GREEN NEW DEAL WOULD COST TRILLIONS AND MAKE NOT A DIME'S WORTH OF DIFFERENCEIn this age of political hysteria, we must all educate ourselves on the facts – the actual science. Unfortunately, there seems to be a total lack of awareness about important issues that scientists like myself – who aren’t paid by research grants – are concerned about.Instead, climate science is being used as a political weapon, and the voices of scientists like me are being ignored or even vilified. I was under the impression that in the United States, all voices and arguments should be heard. Climate science is not settled science. If it was, why would there be a continuous flow of money to research it?For example, is AOC aware that in the fossil fuel era, in spite of a four-fold increase in population, deaths have plummeted?Or that personal GDP and life expectancy – true measurements of progress – have dramatically increased?Or that world prosperity is rising while poverty is falling?And does AOC know that in the geological history of the Earth, there is no apparent direct link between carbon dioxide and temperature?AOC is trying to capture the imagination of young people to exact a specific result – the adoption of policies that cripple our way of life and push us towards socialism. But the charts above are only a few examples of data that should cause us to pause and ask questions about the direction that the Green New Deal wants America to go in.We should also ask why there is such a hurry to get there. For every current event that is used to whip up hysteria, there has been a past event that was even worse, but that people either ignore or are ignorant about in the first place. Extreme weather has always occurred and will inevitably continue.If climate alarmists do not know about the many arguments that question the credibility of their ideas, how is it even possible for their ideas to be seriously considered? Much of what is being proposed in the Green New Deal should not only cause skepticism, but should be considered draconian and even geopolitically dangerous.The migration towards cleaner, alternative energy needs to be done in a methodical, sustainable and intelligent way, otherwise, the consequences could be far worse than anyone can imagine.Perhaps we should pause and consider why none of the global warming models from two decades ago have come to fruition. Perhaps we should slow down and think about the consequences of allowing our adversaries to supply the world with cheap energy, because one thing is for sure – wind farms and solar panels won't get the job done.The objective reader should examine all sides of the climate debate and should ask himself: Are the consequences of acting hastily worse than not acting at all? I think many are skeptical of rushing forward. We must rein in the political hysteria and fear-mongering that is driving the climate change agenda.",1
"After releasing 12 years of tax returns on his campaign website, Washington governor and 2020 presidential candidate Jay Inslee urged President Donald Trump to do the same.Inslee became the latest Democratic presidential candidate to release his tax returns, making the announcement on ""Fox & Friends"" Friday. Inslee said he had released 12 years of his personal tax records on his campaign website and called on the president to “come clean with the American People.”“He’s got to show what he’s been hiding,” Inslee said. “Americans deserve that truth.”Trump broke with decades of tradition by not releasing his tax filings during his 2016 campaign. He argued he couldn't release his taxes because he was under an audit by the Internal Revenue Service, but being under audit is no legal bar to a candidate from disclosing taxes.After his ""Fox & Friends"" appearance, Inslee tweeted: “Just now, on @realDonaldTrump's favorite show, @foxandfriends, I announced I’m releasing 12 years of tax returns, and called on him to finally be transparent with the American people.”WASHINGTON GOV. JAY INSLEE ANNOUNCES 2020 PRESIDENTIAL BID Inslee announced his Democratic presidential bid earlier this month, which made him the first governor to enter an already-crowded field of senators and other hopefuls battling to challenge President Trump in 2020.Tax returns paint a fuller picture of a presidential candidate's financial situation, from income and revenues to the effective tax rate they pay to charitable donations and overseas holdings.Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, became the first 2020 presidential candidate to unveil her 2018 returns when she disclosed the documents on Wednesday.The 2020 hopeful urged her rivals to follow in her footsteps and make their returns public, as Democrats continue to slam Trump for not releasing his returns during his 2016 presidential run.“Join me in calling on every presidential candidate to disclose their taxes. This is what transparency and accountability is all about,” Gillibrand said in a video.Sen. Bernie Sanders has promised to release 10 years of his tax returns but hasn’t done so yet. He said he will make the returns public “soon.”GILLIBRAND THE FIRST 2020 DEMOCRAT TO UNVEIL 2018 TAX RETURNS: SEE WHAT SHE MADE Another White House contender, Sen. Elizabeth Warren highlighted that she has released the past decade of her tax returns and like Gillibrand, has urged the other candidates to do the same.The Massachusetts Democrat has yet to release her 2018 returns. Her campaign told Fox News she will, once she files her 2018 returns.The tax filing season doesn’t end until April 15.On ""Fox & Friends"" Friday, Inslee also made the case for climate change. It is a topic his campaign is focused on with the goal of building “a national movement to defeat climate change,” according to Inslee's website.“This is a can-do nation. We put a man on the moon, we defeated fascism and we can use our smarts to build a clean energy economy like we are doing right today and we are doing it all across America,” said Inslee. “We need an inspirational leader, not a pessimistic one in the White House. I think I am ready for that job. This country needs that spark of optimism.”TRUMP MOCKS GREEN NEW DEAL, POKES FUN AT ELECTRIC CARS DURING MICHIGAN RALLY Inslee made the case for climate change on Fox & Friends Friday, after Trump’s visit to Grand Rapids, MI the day before for a campaign rally where he said, “I love campaigning against the Green New Deal.”“No more airplanes, no more cows, one car per family, one car, you are going to love that in Michigan,” Trump said at the rally.The Green New Deal, championed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., calls for the U.S. to shift away from fossil fuels such as oil and coal and replace them with renewable sources such as wind and solar power. It also calls for virtual elimination by 2030 of greenhouse gas emissions that have been tied to climate change.Trump's jabs came days after 42 Democrats and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., voted ""present"" on a non-binding resolution that would have begun debate on the Green New Deal. Not a single senator voted to break the filibuster, while 57 senators -- including three Democrats and Sen. Angus King, I-Maine -- voted ""no."" In addition to Sanders, five Democratic presidential candidates who have previously backed the Green New Deal voted ""present"": Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York.Democrats described the vote, orchestrated by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., as a ""sham vote"" meant to avoid a genuine debate on the effects of climate change.The Associated Press Contributed to this report.",1

          WASHINGTON – The United Nations' weather agency says extreme weather last year hit 62 million people worldwide and forced 2 million people to relocate, as man-made climate change worsened.The World Meteorological Organization's annual state of global climate report says Earth is nearly 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) warmer than when the industrial age started. World leaders are trying to limit warming to 3.6 degrees (2 degrees Celsius).Emissions from burning fuels such as coal, gasoline and diesel for electricity and transportation are contributing to global warming that in turn brings more intense storms, floods and droughts.""We have seen a growing amount of disasters because of climate change,"" said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas. He said since 1998, about 4.5 billion around the world have been hurt by extreme weather.Cyclone Idai that just hit Mozambique is a good example, but is too recent to be in the report, Taalas said.The past four years were the warmest on record, according the to the report. That includes 2018, the warmest La Nina year on record, Taalas said. La Nina, a natural cooling of parts of the Pacific Ocean that changes weather worldwide, usually cools global temperature a bit.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on global leaders to convene in September with plans to reduce emissions.""I'm telling leaders, don't come with a speech, come with a plan,"" Guterres said.Guterres said climate change is a security and health issue for the world.""The impact on public health is escalating,"" Guterres said. ""The combination of extreme heat and air pollution is proving increasingly dangerous.""The 44-page report says:—Floods affected 35 million people.—Drought hit another 9 million people, adding to the problem of growing enough food to feed the world.- Ocean heat reached a record high, and oceans are getting more acidic and losing oxygen.- With some exceptions, glaciers are melting and ice in the polar oceans is shrinking.- The level of carbon dioxide in the air hit record highs.""Carbon dioxide is the major problem here,"" Taalas said, adding that the gas stays in the air for hundreds of years.___Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter: @borenbears .___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

"Rep. Ocasio-Cortez says 'Green New Deal' does not have a price tag; Fox Business' Charles Payne weighs in.I believe climate change is real. I believe that human emissions of greenhouse gases are a major cause of climate change.I also believe the Democrats’ cure for climate change, their “Green New Deal,” is so far out in left field that not many people will take it seriously. Basically, it is an assault on cars, cows and combustion. With nuclear power available, the Green New Deal's strategy for fighting climate change with windmills makes as much sense as going to war in sailboats.So, as one Republican, I propose this response to climate change: the United States should launch a New Manhattan Project for Clean Energy, a five-year project to meet Ten Grand Challenges that will use American research and technology to put our country and the world firmly on a path toward cleaner, cheaper energy.GREEN NEW DEAL WOULD DESTROY AMERICAN DREAM, CREATE AMERICAN NIGHTMAREThe purpose of the original Manhattan project during World War II was to find a way to split the atom and build a bomb before Germany could. Instead of ending a war, the goal of this New Manhattan Project will be to minimize the disruption on our lives and economies caused by climate change, to clean the air and to raise family incomes.These are the Ten Grand Challenges:Advanced Nuclear – Ninety-eight nuclear reactors produce 60 percent of all carbon-free electricity in the United States. Within the next five years, we need to build one or more advanced reactors to demonstrate the capabilities they may bring – lower cost, increased safety, and less nuclear waste.Natural Gas – Developing new combustion technologies will make natural gas-fired electric generation more efficient and further reduce carbon emissions.Carbon Capture – This is the holy grail of clean energy. If we can capture carbon at a cheaper cost and find large scale uses for its byproduct – for example, CO2 to ethanol – coal could be used everywhere in the world.Better Batteries – Today’s Nissan Leaf can travel 226 miles on one charge. A Tesla Model S can travel 335 miles. The price of lithium-ion batteries should fall another 45 percent during the next five years. Better batteries also can one day allow utilities and their customers to store large amounts of electricity during non-peak hours.Greener Buildings – This still is the real low-hanging fruit. Residential and commercial buildings still consume 39 percent of U.S. energy.Electric Vehicles – Ten years ago there were no mass-produced electric cars on U.S. highways. Today, there are one million and automakers are investing big to make millions more.Cheaper Solar – Solar power has grown but accounts for only 2 percent of U.S. electricity. The new goal for the Department of Energy is to lower the cost of solar another 50 percent.Fusion – This is the ultimate green energy dream: make electricity on earth the way the sun makes it. Instead of splitting elements, combine them and make clean, almost limitless energy without waste.Advanced Computing – China, Japan, the U.S., and the European Union all want to be first in advanced computing. The U.S. regained the number one spot last year thanks to sustained funding by Congress during both the Obama and Trump administrations. This is the first tool the New Manhattan Project needs.Double Energy Research Funding – The second tool is money. It would take $6 billion annually to double funding for the Department of Energy’s Office of Science and its 17 national laboratories, which are where most of the nation’s basic energy research is done. The cost of the Green New Deal is trillions annually.This strategy recognizes that, when it comes to climate change, China, India and other developing countries are the problem; American innovation is the answer. According to the Global Carbon Project, over the last 13 years, the United States has reduced production of greenhouse gases more than any major country – largely thanks to conservation and switching from coal to natural gas for electricity.This bold agenda – which will hopefully be bipartisan – can over the next five years place us firmly on a path toward dealing with climate change, and at the same time produce large amounts of reliable, clean energy that lifts family incomes in our country and around the world.",1
"U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., blasted congressional Republicans on Saturday for seeking a “bluff” vote on her proposed Green New Deal -- a move that other Democrats have also derided as a political stunt.“The GOP’s whole game of wasting votes in Congress to target others ‘on the record’, for leg [legislation] they have no intent to pass, is a disgrace,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. “Stop wasting the American peoples’ time + learn to govern. Our jobs aren’t for campaigning, & that’s exactly what these bluff-votes are for.”The freshman Democrat has touted the Green New Deal as an effort to rid the U.S. of greenhouse gas emissions while generating millions of high-paying jobs. Ocasio-Cortez has called climate change a ""generational"" issue, describing it as ""our World War II"" for younger people.Republicans have mocked the ambitious plan as socialism and cite its price tag that could reach into the trillions of dollars.It has almost no shot of passing in the Senate, where it would need 60 votes to advance. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has scheduled a procedural vote on the plan for Monday, when senators will return after a one-week recess.“Leader McConnell thinks the Green New Deal is just a resolution, but the Green New Deal is a revolution,” said U.S. Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., one the plan’s lead authors. “The Green New Deal has struck a powerful chord in this country, and it is igniting the movement of young people who are ready to make this the organizing issue for their generation.”The legislation exists as a nonbinding resolution, which would not require the government to do anything. Democrats have yet to deliver details on how to implement the plan or pay for it.OCASIO-CORTEZ LOOKS FORWARD TO 'REAL VOTE' ON GREEN NEW DEAL AFTER MCCONNELL MANEUVERBy pushing for a vote, McConnell hopes to see how far Democrats are willing to go to align themselves with the party’s new progressive wing.“Just a good old-fashioned, state-planned economy. Garden-variety 20th-century socialism,” McConnell said in a recent speech. “Our Democratic colleagues have taken all the debunked philosophies of the last hundred years, rolled them into one giant package, and thrown a little ‘green’ paint on them to make them look new.”“Our Democratic colleagues have taken all the debunked philosophies of the last hundred years, rolled them into one giant package, and thrown a little ‘green’ paint on them to make them look new.”Some Democrats said they plan to vote “present” on the resolution to signal their opposition to what they call a “sham” vote that seeks to quash public debate by blocking public hearings or expert testimony about the consequences of climate change.In addition to Republicans, several major labor unions also oppose the deal.In response to her tweet, some on social media mocked Ocasio-Cortez for being upset that her proposed legislation will get a vote.“Seems odd to introduce legislation with lots of fanfare if you don’t want it to receive a vote?,” one user wrote.“This has to be the first time a sitting congressperson has ever advocated for NOT holding a vote on their own ideas,” another tweeted in response.“Someone seems weirdly upset that the Senate will be voting on their plan,"" another wrote.“If planet is in a crisis and this serious proposal (totally not a stunt!) is the only plan to save it, you would think @AOC wd be: 1) thanking McConnell for scheduling a vote & 2) working to get votes to pass it. In fact, shouldn’t she be mad at Pelosi for not doing the same?,” one user tweeted.The Associated Press contributed to this report.",1

          (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)Freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., compared President Trump to a worm during an interview on “Late Night with Seth Meyers” on Thursday -- but you'd need your dictionary to know that.The 29-year-old congresswoman used an obscure term to take a swipe at Trump toward the end of her appearance, when Meyers asked her about winning the second-place prize as a teen in her high school science competition.AOC DEFENDS GREEN NEW DEAL, SAYS NARRATIVE BEING 'MANIPULATED' BY TRUMP, OTHER CRITICS“Science was my first passion,” said Ocasio-Cortez. “I studied microbiology and the impacts of antioxidants on a model organism known as the C. elegan, which is of the nematode family.”Meyers compared Ocasio-Cortez’s interest in science to that of Trump, interjecting “I think he did that, too.”“Because he’s a nematode?” she retorted while the crowd roared in laughter, comparing the president to the roundworms found as parasites in animals and plants.Ocasio-Cortez also vehemently defended her Green New Deal during her time on the show, claiming Trump and other critics are manipulating the narrative around her proposal for climate change reform.“They’re trying to say that the Green New Deal is about what we have to give up, what we have to cut back on, when in fact the Green New Deal itself is a resolution to be more expansive,” Ocasio-Cortez said.The massive climate change investment has been criticized for being too overreaching and too expensive.The self-proclaimed democratic socialist became the youngest woman ever elected to Congress after defeating 10-term Democratic incumbent Joe Crowley in the primary and then winning in the November general election.The bartender turned politician is a leader of the Democratic Party’s progressive wing and has managed to gain endorsements for her Green New Deal bill from Democratic 2020 hopefuls.Fox News’ Joseph A Wulfsohn contributed to this report.",1
"The former Texas congressman launches his 2020 presidential campaign with a dire warning.I agree with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on one thing: The Green New Deal is a pipe dream. It is neither technologically nor politically feasible and doesn’t solve for the fact that global emissions are rising because of China, India and other rapidly-developing nations. It would be potentially disastrous for our economy, and makes such extreme promises about employment and free higher education as to be comical.But we should also address the elephant in the room. Climate change is real and industrial activity around the globe is contributing to it.Don’t believe me? Listen to the top Republicans on our leading House and Senate energy and science panels: Reps. Greg Walden and Frank Lucas, and Sens. Lisa Murkowski and John Barrasso. Or listen to the head of the American Petroleum Institute, who confirmed recently that “America’s natural gas and oil industry is meeting the climate challenge head-on.”OCASIO-CORTEZ’S GREEN NEW DEAL WOULDN’T SLOW CLIMATE CHANGE, BUT YOUR ELECTRICITY COSTS WOULD SKYROCKETSo are the CEOs of Shell, Southern Company and other big energy companies, who not only are shepherding enormous corporate investments, but are literally putting their money where their mouths are and tying long-term compensation for senior executives to meeting their goals of reducing their carbon footprints.They understand that meeting the climate challenge will be good for business and jobs because of a rapidly changing global energy market and demand for both cleaner and reliable electricity generation.Any real progress in addressing climate change, especially in divided government, will depend on a realistic agenda built on pushing better technologies around the world that can expand quickly and affordably, give us a balanced mix of low carbon sources, perform better, and are cheaper than the alternatives, so that the rapidly developing world chooses them instead of more emitting technologies.I don’t know about you, but I’d rather those technologies be developed, commercialized and exported from the U.S. than elsewhere.The progressive wave overtaking the Democratic party has centered its future on outlandish big government solutions like the Green New Deal. These policies will increase the cost of our electricity bills, harm our economy, and hurt consumers across the country, all the while giving the edge to our global competitors.But climate change is not just our problem – it is a global problem. And China, India and other fast-growing developing countries aren’t that interested in handcuffing themselves with policies that will limit their economic growth and access to power at a time of increasing demand. That’s why new, emissions-reducing innovations for natural gas, coal and nuclear must be a part of the global mix.Clearly, we don’t need to agree on the problem of climate change to agree that solutions to the problem ought to be partly based on global competitiveness and job creation benefits to U.S. clean energy innovation.Most people are surprised to know that the last Congress appropriated more money for energy research and development (R&D) than the Congress of the last term of the Obama presidency. These investments included technologies that can capture, store and use carbon emissions from fossil fuel generation.Spending on R&D is an essential element of progress. These are the investments that create the next breakthroughs. Energy R&D is a smart investment for the country and pays back exponentially. The shale gas revolution contributes an estimated $100 billion to consumers every year, and has been the main driver behind reducing power sector emissions in the past decade.In addition, lawmakers in both parties have supported big advancements toward the next generation of zero-emission nuclear power, which is good for our national security and our electric grid reliability. Nuclear is a trillion-dollar global export opportunity and we must not let it slip away.We need to be proactive. We need to be smart. The progressive wave overtaking the Democratic party has centered its future on outlandish big government solutions like the Green New Deal. These policies will increase the cost of our electricity bills, harm our economy, and hurt consumers across the country, all the while giving the edge to our global competitors. We cannot afford to let that happen.We can’t swing for an implausible grand slam like a Green New Deal, that keeps our abundant and cheap fossil fuels in the ground and harms our domestic economy and global energy position. If we do, we will continue to strikeout.We can have big conversations, but games are won with action, and singles and doubles that get us there are the incremental but important clean energy wins that we know work.",1
"In a video posted to social media on Monday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio again directly blamed climate change for 2012's deady Superstorm Sandy -- a contention that lacks scientific support - and touted his plan to spend $10 billion to fortify and ""protect Lower Manhattan"" against future storms.Even as local leaders warned that de Blasio's plan to construct new barriers would actually destroy the waterfront neighborhoods he says he wants to protect, de Blasio insisted his views were now mainstream among New Yorkers.""After Sandy, there weren't a lot of climate change deniers left in New York City,"" de Blasio said directly into the camera, after reminding viewers that the storm left dozens dead and cost the city billions in economic losses. ""We need to protect this city and this country, and this world, from global warming. There's no national policy to do it right now. ... We have to do it ourselves.""Mayor de Blasio added in the video, which appeared on Facebook and Twitter, that the federal government also must act quickly: ""We have to fight for the bigger changes, like the Green New Deal,"" de Blasio said.The mayor claimed that studies undertaken by his office and others has determined that if the city does not prepare for climate change, rising seas will expose 20 percent of lower Manhattan to daily flooding by 2100.However, past expert predictions on the effects of global warming have proven inaccurate at best. For example, United Nations scientists predicted that the world had only 10 years to immediately address climate change all the way back in 1989, in order to protect entire cities from destruction and a resulting flood of eco-refugees. A NASA scientist falsely predicted the same thing in 2006.

      Contrary to de Blasio's assertions, no study has defintively linked the existence or power of Superstorm Sandy to man-made climate change, or made the claim that such a link can be definitively established at all. Some contested studies have, however, suggested the storm may have become more intense to some degree as a result of warming sea temperatures.""We suggest that it is more useful to regard the extreme circulation regime or weather event as being largely unaffected by climate change, and question whether known changes in the climate system's thermodynamic state affected the impact of the particular event,"" stated one paper produced by researchers at the National Center for Atmospheric Research.GREENPEACE CO-FOUNDER TEARS INTO OCASIO-CORTEZ: 'POMPOUS LITTLE TWIT'The researchers added: ""Some examples briefly illustrated include 'snowmaggedon' in February 2010, Superstorm Sandy in October 2012 and supertyphoon Haiyan in November 2013, and, in more detail, the Boulder floods of September 2013, all of which were influenced by high sea surface temperatures that had a discernible human component.""The Green New Deal backed by de Blasio has not attracted universal support even among Democrats, after the resolution's botched rollout in Congress earlier this year included the release of an official document by New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's office that promised economic security even for those ""unwilling to work,"" as well as the elimination of ""farting cows"" and air travel.""We have to fight for the bigger changes, like the Green New Deal.""The Democratic mayor on Thursday first announced his plan to meet the ""existential threat"" of climate change, specifically by extending a section of the lower Manhattan coastline as much as 500 feet into the East River. He said the $10 billion effort to protect lower Manhattan from flooding by extending the shoreline between the Brooklyn Bridge and the Battery will be funded partly by private development if federal funds are not available.WHAT DOES TRUMP ADMIN'S OWN CLIMATE CHANGE REPORT SAY IS COMING?""If there's federal money in play, it probably looks one way,"" de Blasio said last week. ""If there's not federal money in play, we have to get some private money into it and there has to be some development.""Officials have been developing schemes to fortify New York City's waterfront since Superstorm Sandy destroyed thousands of homes and businesses in 2012.De Blasio said it will cost about $500 million to fortify most of lower Manhattan from future effects of climate change, including rising sea levels and intense precipitation, with grassy berms and removable barriers.But planners determined that protecting the lowest-lying area, including South Street Seaport and the financial district, will require adding more land over several years.

      De Blasio, who is contemplating joining the crowded field of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, said the $10 billion landfill project should be supported by federal funds, but that's unlikely to happen during the administration of Republican President Donald Trump.""Lower Manhattan is one of the core centers of the American economy,"" he said. ""It's where the financial capital of the United States is. The security of lower Manhattan should be a national priority. The fact is it is not. And it's incomprehensible to me that there's no sense of urgency from the federal government.""He added, ""We can't afford to bury our head in the sand and that's right now what our federal government is doing.""The plan to extend the coastline will go through the city's environmental review process, de Blasio said, but he hopes to avoid ""the endless dragging on that usually accompanies something of this scale.""CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPBut the prospect of private development on the newly built land is sure to meet resistance from downtown Manhattan community members.City Council member Margaret Chin, who represents the area, said a more resilient future ""cannot be paid for by private real estate development that would destroy the waterfront neighborhoods that we are trying to protect.""De Blasio announced the climate resilience plan at a news conference after previewing it in New York magazine .""This is the existential threat,"" de Blasio said. ""This is the core issue we all must face as aggressively as humanly possible.""The Associated Press contributed to this report.",1
"Former Vice President Al Gore turned up the rhetorical heat during a conference in Atlanta on Thursday, where he warned that climate change could bring about the end of civilization.“What is going on in the public square right now is more important than any time since the Civil War,” Gore said before an audience of nearly 2,000 people. “We are facing an ecological crisis that can bring about the end of civilization.”AL GORE CALLS DONALD TRUMP THE 'FACE OF CLIMATE DENIAL,' SAYS AMERICANS ARE TIRED OF PRESIDENT'S CONSTANT CRAZINESSThe dire warning marked the start of Gore’s three-day Climate Reality Project at Atlanta’s Georgia World Congress Center. Gore shared the stage with church leaders and Saturday Night Live’s Pete Davidson who reportedly likened the “environment” to “a girl you’re in love with who just got engaged to someone else. The situation is dire but there’s still time.”Gore later lavished praise on the controversial Green New Deal, proposed by freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., which he compared to denuclearization talks of the 1980s, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.“It is similar to the nuclear freeze proposals, because it serves as a vehicle,” Gore said.",1
"Xochitl Hinojosa says that the Green New Deal is a document that wants to resolve climate change and create good paying jobs.The four Democratic Senators running for president in 2020 have all declared their support for a “Green New Deal” authored by New Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Ed Markey. The Green New Deal, released Thursday, calls for the United States to eliminate fossil fuel power sources in the next ten years. Its authors say that its costs are irrelevant because the “cost of inaction” is so high.This approach is exactly wrong for climate change. The central fact of climate regulation is that both climate change and climate change regulation can impose catastrophic costs on citizens of the United States and the world. As the world warms, we will all have to spend more to protect ourselves from climate change. And climate regulation will force us all to pay more for nearly every aspect of our lives—for power, for fuel, for housing, for every item we buy. Any plan that ignores one of these costs threatens disaster.The world’s premier climate change economist is William Nordhaus. His 2018 Nobel Prize in Economics was widely celebrated for showing the dire risks of climate change. In his Nobel lecture, he warned that unrestrained climate change could cost the world more than $20 trillion—about $3,000 for every man, woman, and child on the planet.DESPITE GREEN NEW DEAL PUSH, CLIMATE CHANGE NOT A HIGH PRIORITY FOR PEOPLE IN 2019But Nordhaus also warned that climate regulation could impose even more catastrophic costs. World climate accords like the Paris Agreement aim to keep climate change under two degrees Celsius. Nordhaus acknowledged that this aggressive goal would limit the cost of climate change to $6 trillion, but showed that it would cost the world $36 trillion—about $5,000 for every man, woman, and child.As the world warms, we will all have to spend more to protect ourselves from climate change. And climate regulation will force us all to pay more for nearly every aspect of our lives—for power, for fuel, for housing, for every item we buy. Any plan that ignores one of these costs threatens disaster.The world’s foremost expert on the harm of climate change is telling us that the world’s over-aggressive goals are so catastrophic that they are worse than doing nothing at all. Partisans on both sides may disagree with Nordhaus’s numbers, but the key point is that both climate change and climate regulation can cost the world trillions. The key question for climate regulators is how to minimize both costs: the cost of climate change and the cost of combating climate change.As we consider climate regulation, we need to avoid two common misunderstandings. The first comes from those who oppose climate regulation: “We’ll never stop climate change—why should we pay so much to try to do the impossible?” Nordhaus shows the answer: unrestrained climate change will cost us trillions so even if we can’t stop it there is plenty of room to take affordable steps and push that cost down.The second misunderstanding is the one behind the Green New Deal: “Climate change is so dangerous—let’s pay what it takes to stop it.” If we ignore the costs of climate regulation on ordinary citizens, we risk a catastrophe even worse than climate change.",1
"Climate change could trigger a “civilization breakdown,” a founder of the so-called “Birth Strike” movement warned on Tuesday night -- saying she's so afraid that she won't have kids.Blythe Pepino told Fox News' “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” “I think where we are now is incredibly frightening. And, what I discovered when I made the decision and started talking about it to other young women around me was that we felt that we lost faith in the system and the authorities, because they weren’t really dealing with the situation. They weren’t managing the threat properly.”During a live Instagram stream last month, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., warned that the planet will face a “disaster” if people “don’t turn this ship around.”“There’s scientific consensus that the lives of children are going to be very difficult and it does lead, I think, young people to have a legitimate question, you know. Is it okay to still have children?” Ocasio-Cortez asked her followers.DEMS PUSH CLIMATE CHANGE AS 2020 ISSUEPepino told Tucker Carlson her movement isn’t about stopping everybody from having children, but she and others are “too afraid” to do so.“Yes, it is quite sad, but at the same time, Birth Strike itself is a hopeful act. What we’re trying to say is, ‘C’mon, we’ve got two options; either unite collectively behind action on this immediately because we’re already towards the collapse or we can resign ourselves to -- I mean, it sounds crazy but it’s true -- extinction,’” she added.Pepino said she had been concerned about the environment for a “long time” but was distracted by her career and it wasn’t until recently that various studies convinced her the planet is at a point of no return.She insisted she was “fighting” for children before a “species suicide” develops.",1
"The Senate on Thursday confirmed former coal industry lobbyist Andrew Wheeler as the next administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in a 52 to 47 vote, largely along party lines.The addition to President Trump’s cabinet of Wheeler, who has served as acting EPA administrator since former chief Scott Pruitt resigned last July amid a slew of ethics investigations, has been in the works since November, when the president formally nominated him to the post.“The Senate has taken decisive action to confirm Andrew Wheeler as administrator of the [EPA],” Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., tweeted. “As acting administrator of [the EPA], he has prioritized commonsense policies that protect our air & water, while allowing our economy to grow.”EPA TAKES AIM AT OBAMA-ERA REGULATION OF MERCURY AT COAL PLANTSWheeler’s nomination – and his time as acting EPA administrator – has not been without controversy as many Democrats and environmental activists have criticized him for his close ties to the coal industry and for his push to deregulate a number of environmental rules and safeguards implemented by the Obama administration.“Senate Republicans have officially put a coal lobbyist in charge of protecting our children from the dirty air and toxic water created by his corporate polluting clients,” Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune said in a statement on Thursday. “With each rollback, Wheeler is stacking the deck in favor of the polluting corporations who formerly employed him, leaving our families to pay the price of more toxic pollution with their health.”Sen. Susan Collins of Maine was the only Republican to oppose Wheeler’s confirmation.“While Mr. Wheeler is certainly qualified for this position, I have too many concerns with the actions he has taken during his tenure as Acting Administrator to be able to support his promotion,” Collins said in a statement. “The policies he has supported as Acting Administrator are not in the best interest of our environment and public health, particularly given the threat of climate change to our nation.”Wheeler began his career at the EPA’s Information Management Division before going on to serve as Chief Counsel to Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Ok., and then as a lobbyist at the law firm of Faegre Baker Daniels, where he represented controversial coal producer Murray Energy. Trump nominated him in October 2017 to be the EPA’s deputy administrator.ANDREW WHEELER IS A FORMER COAL LOBBYIST WITH DECADES-LONG EXPERIENCE IN WASHINGTONDuring his time as acting EPA administrator, Wheeler has proposed a slackening of the carbon limits on power plants and an easing of the fuel-efficiency standards for cars and light trucks. He has also sought to make new coal-fired power plants easier to approve, undo the legal justifications for curbing mercury emissions from power plants and to limit the federal government’s power over protecting small waterwaysWheeler’s push to deregulate, however, has been paired with an easing off of some of Pruitt’s more controversial regulatory plans, such as one to ease the emissions rules for long-haul trucks. Last week, Wheeler also put forth a plan to enact tougher limits on nitrogen-oxide emissions from heavy-duty trucks.His confirmation on Thursday was greeted with praise by the industry he used to represent, who see him as an ally in the fight to roll back the regulations enacted in Obama’s Clean Power Plan.“Andrew Wheeler has been seen as a thoughtful leader who understands the need for sensible environmental policies,” Michelle Bloodworth, the president of the coal industry group America’s Power, said in a statement. “His long experience in public service demonstrates his integrity in serving EPA’s mission. We congratulate Administrator Wheeler, and look forward to his continued leadership at the EPA.”",1

"WASHINGTON -- Die-hard skeptics of climate change believe the rollout of the Green New Deal, with its plans for wealth redistribution, high taxes, and a massive transition to a carbon neutral economy, was a tipoff to a hidden agenda.""We always knew climate was a stalking horse for socialism, communism, totalitarianism, whatever you want to call it,” said Steve Milloy of JunkScience.com.Milloy is what many climate scientists and environmentalists pejoratively refer to as a ""denier.""But even many Democrats who support a climate change agenda saw the rollout as overreach.""I have read it and I have re-read it and I asked [co-sponsor Sen.] Ed Markey, ‘What in the heck is this?’"" said Senator Dick Durbin (D-Ill) on MSNBC’s Morning Joe. Panelists responded with howls of laughter.Some hope that from the excesses of the Green New Deal, more moderate voices emerge.WHAT IS THE GREEN NEW DEAL? A LOOK AT THE ECONOMIC AND CLIMATE CONCEPT PUSHED BY PROGRESSIVES""The climate debate has been driven for years by the edges of each party,"" said Jason Grumet, president of the Bipartisan Policy Center. ""Having a more aggressively unrealistic left edge to contradict the irresponsible right edge is not likely to create the kind of consensus that’s necessary to have meaningful change.""Others question the desperate sense of urgency to transition to a carbon neutral economy.John Christy, head of the Atmospheric Sciences Department of the University of Alabama, Hunstville, has long questioned the so-called 97 percent consensus among climate scientists. He notes the greatest scientific discoveries in history have often broken with consensus.Astronomer Galileo Galilei was condemned to life under house arrest for embracing heliocentrism – the belief that the earth and planets revolve around the sun.In 1931, the book ""A Hundred Authors Against Einstein"" was published questioning his theory of relativity. More recently Australian scientist Barry Marshall upended accepted treatment for ulcers by suggesting they were not caused by stress, but by bacterial infection. Today, the standard ulcer treatment is an antibiotic.Christy agrees that CO2 levels are increasing and the planet has warmed slightly, but his research indicates computer models that predict catastrophic consequences of climate change are unrealistic.ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ CALLS GREEN NEW DEAL A 'LIFE AND DEATH' ISSUE, ATTACKS GOP ON CLIMATE CHANGE""I take a real hard look at climate model output and can demonstrate that these models are just too sensitive to carbon dioxide,"" he said. ""The real world is not spiraling off into some dangerous territory of climate.""For expressing that view and others (his research shows that rising CO2 levels have some beneficial effects – agricultural yields are higher than they've ever been, and the planet is greener than at any time in recorded history.) Yet, Christy has been alienated from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, of which he used to be a part.After the rollout of the Green New Deal non-binding resolution, many Democratic Senators took to the well of the Senate to lambast what they believed was a ploy by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to bring the resolution to a ""show"" vote.""We'll give everybody an opportunity to go on record and see how they feel about the Green New Deal,"" McConnell said.Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called it a ""cynical stunt.""""I challenge Leader McConnell to say that our climate change crisis is real, that it’s caused by humans, and that Congress needs to act,"" he said. ""This is what two-thirds of the American people agree with.""An impassioned Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., weighed in.""Americans see this in their daily lives. This is not academic theory any longer,"" he shouted. ""They see the wildfires, they see the droughts, they see the floods, they see the sea levels rise...""Christy measurements suggest they're wrong.""What distinguishes me from many of them,” he said, “is I actually build the data sets that can answer questions about climate change.""As to Whitehouse's claims of catastrophic weather extremes, Christy said his data did not back that up.""I actually did a very detailed analysis of that for the United States,” he said. “What I found is that in the last 124 years, weather extremes and temperature extremes have actually declined, both record high temperatures and record low temperatures.""Novelist Michael Crichton, in the Caltech Michelin lecture in 1993, offered what some might see as a calming reassurance about the future of the earths’ climate. He looked back to the turn of the last century when people, ""didn't know what radio was, or an airport, or a movie, or a television, or a computer, or a cell phone, or a jet, an antibiotic, a rocket, a satellite, an MRI, ICU, IUD,  or what IBM was...”Crichton went on, presenting a long list of the scientific inventions of the 20th century that changed human life for the better. Toward the end of the lecture he asked, ""Now, you tell me you can predict the world of 2100?""",1
"Democrats have criticized President Trump for his declaration of a national emergency at the southern border, but some say he is setting a precedent that would allow future Democratic administrations to declare national emergencies to advance left-leaning policies.Last week, presidential hopefuls Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg both tweeted that climate change is an emergency while border wall construction is not, although they stopped short of saying that they'd declare a national emergency if elected. Sen. Warren also charged that gun violence and the nation's opioid epidemic should also be considered emergencies.Trump's declaration is facing a slew of legal challenges and backlash in Congress. Most Democratic presidential contenders are distancing themselves from the idea and condemning the president.PRESIDENT TRUMP'S NATIONAL EMERGENCY DECLARATION SPARKS PROTESTS""Republicans wouldn’t have tolerated this if Obama did it,"" Sen. Cory Booker, D-NJ, told Fox News at a campaign event in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. ""And they shouldn’t tolerate it when Donald Trump is doing it.""

      In her trip to New Hampshire, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., joined Booker yesterday in bashing the president's declaration, calling the move ""completely unnecessary.""“This is a crisis of his own making because it was a campaign pledge that took heat and propelled him to victory,"" Sen. Harris told the audience. ""He feels the need to keep reciting what is a lie.”WHAT IS A 'NATIONAL EMERGENCY,' AND HOW CAN TRUMP USE IT TO FUND BORDER WALL?A recent Fox News poll found that 63 percent of voters consider climate change an emergency, the same number of those who think that about border security. Meanwhile, opioid addiction dwarfs that: 87 percent consider it an emergency or major problem.Neil Levesque, the executive director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics, said Democrats could seize on the precedent, especially if it holds up in court.“The next president, if it is a Democrat, could use this to their advantage and politicize certain national emergencies as well, specifically on things like gun control or climate changes,"" Levesque said. ""That could be a real worry to conservative voters.”Democratic voters, however, are mixed on the idea of making a national emergency declaration a campaign promise.""I am a bit wary of granting that much power to one individual,"" said Devon Kristen at a Booker campaign event. ""Because in the current hands, I think it's in the hands of the wrong individual.""""I would feel extremely positive,"" said Sydney Paluch, a Dartmouth College student attending a recent town hall event for Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, ""Considering surprising that those are real, statistical documented issues. Not a manufactured one.""That same Fox News poll also found that 56 percent of Americans oppose the president's declaration, while 38 percent support it.",1
"The communications Director for Senator Chuck Schumer was forced out of his role due to ‘inappropriate encounters.’Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer on Thursday ripped into Republicans for planning to force a vote on the Green New Deal, calling the plan a ""stunt,"" a ""cheap, cynical ploy"" and ""a game of political gotcha.""“The Republican leader announced he's going to bring up a resolution he intends to vote against,” Schumer said on the Senate floor. “Now that is what the American people hate about Congress -- the pointless partisan games.”MCCONNELL TO BRING GREEN NEW DEAL TO VOTE, FORCING 2020 DEMS TO GO ON RECORD ON RADICAL PLANSchumer is the latest Democrat to criticize Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for calling a vote on the plan that many in the party have already rallied behind. Still, Schumer, joined by colleagues on the Senate floor, said: ""Bring it on."" He said Democrats ""believe that we need to do something about climate change"" and added: ""Do Republicans?""Earlier this week, McConnell said that the Senate will vote on the Green New Deal – endorsed by nearly all top 2020 Democratic presidential candidates – in an effort to force Democrats to officially go on the record for the radical proposal.“I’ve noted with great interest the Green New Deal,” McConnell told reporters. “And we’re going to be voting on that in the Senate. We’ll give everybody an opportunity to go on record and see how they feel about the Green New Deal.”The proposal, put forward by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., aims to transform the country's economy in a bid to combat climate change. It recently came under scrutiny after revelations that a related FAQ document included passages promising a job to “all people of the United States” – including those “unwilling to work” – and suggesting air travel could be made obsolete.“We set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren’t sure that we’ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast,” the now-deleted document also read.But McConnell’s move to bring the plan to a vote on the Senate floor will be a key test for Democratic presidential candidates such as Sens. Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand, who are running on the progressive platform in 2020.GREEN NEW DEAL CO-AUTHOR SEN. MARKEY MOCKED FOR ACCUSING MCCONNELL OF 'RUSHING' SENATE VOTEWhile backing of the far-left proposal will ultimately improve their liberal bona fides and their support from the Democratic base, the support of the plan will undoubtedly be the target of attacks during the general election.President Trump has already begun attacking the Green New Deal, claiming it would “shut down American energy” and describing it as “a high school term paper that got a low mark” during a rally Monday in El Paso, Texas.Corbin Trent, a spokesman for Ocasio-Cortez, said that McConnell’s plan to bring the plan to the vote will only show “just how out of touch Republican politicians are with the American people.”Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass, a co-sponsor of the plan, also decried McConnell’s move.“Don’t let Mitch McConnell fool you: this is nothing but an attempt to sabotage the movement we are building. He wants to silence your voice so Republicans don’t have to explain why they are climate change deniers. McConnell wants this to be the end, this is just the beginning,” Markey said.Fox News’ Chad Pergram and Lukas Mikelionis and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",1
"Fellow in energy and environmental policy for the Heritage Foundation Nick Loris weighs in on the Green New Deal.There has been a major change in Washington and in the news over the last week, where the question is quickly turning from “do you believe climate change is real?” to “what is the solution?”This is all thanks to the unveiling of the Green New Deal, a bold progressive agenda to fight climate change by reducing our reliance on fossil fuels. Regardless of whether you love or hate the proposal, people are talking about it, helping environmental advocates achieve what has eluded them for decades: breaking through the noise and getting Washington to have a serious conversation about climate change.In fact, this week Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said the Senate would vote on the Green New Deal. Assuming this goes through the normal legislative process with committee mark-ups and debate, and it’s not just a political stunt, this could be the most robust conversation we have seen in Washington on climate change.ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ CALLS GREEN NEW DEAL A 'LIFE AND DEATH' ISSUE, ATTACKS GOP ON CLIMATE CHANGEThere’s broad bipartisan agreement that climate change is real and needs to be addressed. In fact, 72 percent of Americans see it as a pressing issue, according to a new report.Yet, despite shocking images of melting glaciers and dried-up lakes, along with the increasing frequency and intensity of natural disasters, including hurricanes and wildfires, climate change is usually put on the back burner to deal with “more pressing” issues. The result is yet another “should.” We really should do something about climate change, but we need to [fill in the blank] first. Meanwhile, like an annual check-up (until something goes wrong), climate change gets put off for another day – at least in Washington.Fortunately, states have gotten wise to Washington’s broken ways and have been leading the way to a clean energy future. In Nevada, for example, voters overwhelmingly passed a ballot initiative in November requiring the state to get half its energy from renewables like wind and solar by 2030. While the state’s constitution requires a ballot initiative to be passed twice, Nevada’s governor and legislature aren’t waiting and appear poised to make the change legislatively within the next few months. They know something Washington doesn’t yet understand: voters believe the science of climate change and view clean energy as the solution.Enter the Green New Deal, a bold vision to create jobs and clean our air at the same time. Yes, the rollout had some missteps and conservatives are quick to oppose it because of the leaders who support it, but to write it off completely is to continue ignoring the voice of the people.The Green New Deal is not going to become law as it is currently written, but its immediate impact is inarguable: Washington is talking about climate change. It’s forcing members of Congress to answer the question, “If not the Green New Deal, then what is YOUR solution?” And it’s forcing lawmakers in Washington to come to the realization that it’s time to catch up to their constituents.Climate skeptics, like President Trump, who make ignorant jokes about the issue, will no longer just be in the minority, they will be exposed as the extremists they are, in the tank of fossil fuel corporations that see their glory days in the rearview mirror.Meanwhile, the conversation taking place now is not only about climate change, but about the promise addressing this challenge holds for American innovation, manufacturing, and prosperity. Every moment that goes by leaving this issue unaddressed is more money wasted on outdated fuel sources, another job left on the table, and a growing dependence on foreign energy sources.That’s what the Green New Deal is all about: putting Americans to work addressing one of the most pressing challenges of our time. So, go ahead and mock it. The very fact we’re having this discussion has already made this proposal a success.",1
"Lawrence Jones asks people in Washington, D.C. about the Green New Deal; reaction from Fox News contributors Jessica Tarlov and Lawrence Jones.Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ramped up the rhetoric in her push for a Green New Deal, describing it as a “life and death” issue.The star freshman Democrat fired off a series of tweets Tuesday night about her controversial proposal.“Don’t mess with our future. When it comes to climate, it’s all our lives at stake. The younger you are, the more consequences you’ll see. It’s life and death for us. And we will fight like it,” she tweeted.The New York Democrat also attacked the GOP for allegedly ‘doing nothing to stop’ climate change, before turning up the heat on Republicans she accused of trying to sow doubt on the issue.COTTON SAYS MEDIA WAS 'STALIN-LIKE' IN OCASIO-CORTEZ GREEN DEAL COVER UP“They knew early… Do you really think these increasingly regular & horrific wildfires & droughts are a coincidence? That growing regularity of '100-year floods' is an accident?“We are losing our homes & loved ones *now.* And GOP doesn’t even care enough to try.”The rising democratic socialist star’s remarks came after Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton blasted the Green New Deal plan and said the media were “complicit” in burying the most radical parts of the deal.BILL AND MELINDA GATES REJECT OCASIO-CORTEZ'S 70 PERCENT TAX ON WEALTHY, SUGGEST ESTATE TAX HIKECotton, a staunch Republican, appeared on ""The Hugh Hewitt Show"" on Tuesday and discussed the Green New Deal that aims to implement sweeping changes across the nation.But he claimed the media became complicit in hiding a now-infamous FAQ document circulated by the Ocasio-Cortez office, which included lines such as promising a job to “all people of the United States” –  including those “unwilling to work” – and making air travel obsolete.“I understand the Democrats that proposed this immediately tried to retract that white paper that went along with their resolution,” Cotton added. “And too many people in the media have been complicit in the Stalin-like or 1984 technique of disappearing it, sending it down the memory hole.”Multiple Democratic 2020 candidates such as Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, and Kirsten Gillibrand have endorsed the deal.“I’m proud to co-sponsor @AOC and @EdMarkey's Green New Deal. We must aggressively tackle climate change which poses an existential threat to our nation,” Harris wrote when announcing her support of the plan, adding in that “The Green New Deal is a bold plan to shift our country to 100% clean and renewable energy.”",1

"Democrats call to end fossil fuel industry, push 'Green New Deal.'We don't do a lot of weather segments on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight,"" but we couldn't help but notice this phenomenon called a ""polar vortex"" that's descended on the Midwestern United States this week. Temperatures dropped to lows that didn't even seem real. 
Parts of the state of Illinois fell to 38 degrees below zero Thursday morning; that's a new state record. In Thief River Falls, Minn., the temperature approached 80 below. Cold like that will turn hot coffee to ice crystals before it hits the ground. Stay outside for any length of time, and you will die -- and a number of people did in that region. They were found frozen to death in the last few days.Meteorologists -- and this is the good news -- say it will warm up soon. Climate change will continue, as it always has. Spring will come. But this is a good reminder of something: Energy matters. It keeps us alive. What would happen if you didn't have energy?Well, that's something we maybe need to consider very soon because of something called the ""Green New Deal."" What is that? It's not clear. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., the chief proponent of the Green New Deal, described it this way in an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper.""You are talking about zero carbon emissions, no use of fossil fuels within 12 years?"" Cooper asked.""That is the goal. It's ambitious,"" Ocasio-Cortez said.""How is that possible? You're talking about everybody having to drive an electric car?"" he asked.""It's going to require a lot of rapid change that we don't even conceive [of] as possible right now,"" she said.So no fossil fuels within 12 years. There's a lot we don't know about this plan, but that would definitely be the headline. They've spelled it out very clearly.Now, before we can assess whether getting to that point -- no fossil fuels in 12 years -- is even possible, it is, as the congresswoman just said, an ambitious goal. Let's consider what it would mean for the United States.No fossil fuels would mean no coal, no oil, and no natural gas. And that would mean no cars and no airplanes. It would mean shutting down the single most vibrant part of the entire U.S. economy, which is the energy sector. It would mean putting at least six million Americans out of work immediately.Solar is not a replacement for fossil fuels, now or any time soon, and anyone who tells you otherwise hasn't bothered to learn anything about it. That would be describe most of the people pushing the Green New Deal.As of today, America is the largest oil producer in the world. The country exports more natural gas than any other place. More than 90 percent of all of our energy comes from fossil fuels and nuclear power. So we have to figure out a way to replace that in 12 years, using primarily solar and wind power. Ambitious? Well, that's one way to describe it. More destructive than a major war on U.S. soil would be another way to describe it.Senator Kirsten Gillibrand calls the prospect of all of this ""a really exciting thing."" Kamala Harris agrees. Bernie Sanders isn't simply a fan; he says eliminating fossil fuels immediately is a moral imperative -- a ""life and death issue.""What's so interesting about this is that the party of science somehow forgot to consult actual scientists about their plan. Talk to someone who studies energy and see for yourself. We are nowhere near being able to do any of this. Wind power is a scam. It's an elaborate ripoff perpetuated on impoverished rural America by a few heavily-subsidized corporations that are getting rich from making the landscape uglier. Solar is a promising technology, actually. But we're still far from being able to efficiently store the energy it produces -- and storage is key in a power grid.Solar is not a replacement for fossil fuels, now or any time soon, and anyone who tells you otherwise hasn't bothered to learn anything about it. That would describe most of the people pushing the Green New Deal.How well is wind power going to heat your house when it's 30 below? What is the range, exactly, on those new solar passenger jets? Well, they don't know and they don't care because none of it applies to them. It never does.Adapted from Tucker Carlson's monologue from ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" on January 31, 2019.",1

"The public's concern about global warming has remained below 45 percent while progressive Democrats push a green agenda on Capitol Hill.I am dismayed to hear that NBC’s “Meet The Press” is actually blaming science for its decision to shut down any intelligent, meaningful discussion about climate change. “We’re not going to give time to climate deniers,” the show’s host recently said, referring to people, including Nobel laureates, who disagree that humans are mostly to blame for altering Earth’s climate. “The science is settled even if political opinion is not.”For the record I’m neither a “denier” or an “alarmist.” I’m a physicist who does his very best to seek the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. I’m also a journalist who’s been covering the complexities of the climate change story since the 1980s, even reporting directly from the north and south poles, where much of the climate research is done.My point here is not to debate the merits of today’s resolute scientific consensus that humans are having a decisive, apocalyptic impact on the climate. It might very well be correct.WHY MARS MANIA WILL REACH AN ALL-TIME HIGH IN 2019My point is that if you are absolutely, 100 percent convinced it is – as evidently the producers of the aforementioned news show are – you have a right to say your mind is settled, or your politics are settled. But never say the science of this or any equally complex subject is “settled.” That crucial lesson was learned centuries ago, when something far simpler than Earth’s mercurial climate was being hotly debated. Back then the scientific community was convinced beyond any doubt that our planet was at the center of the universe. In the sixteenth century, Nicolaus Copernicus – a “geocentric denier,” to use today’s pejorative labeling – was derided for believing the sun was at the center of everything.Mainstream scientists and university professors of the day proclaimed the science was settled and justified their “evidence-based” derision of Copernicus by citing the mountain of observational data in favor of the geocentric consensus. Tragically, if NBC had been around, the good Mr. Copernicus would not have been allowed to argue his case on ""Meet The Press.""Ditto for that other notorious geocentric denier, Galileo Galilei. In the early seventeenth century even the Catholic Church – which had long since reconciled scripture with science’s earth-centered consensus – condemned Galileo for his wayward thinking. Declaring that both science and scripture were settled, Pope Urban VIII’s chief inquisitor sentenced the aged astronomer to house arrest – but only after shaming him into publicly recanting his denial of geocentricism.The list is long and sobering of examples in history where resolute scientific consensuses have been disproven. And, worse, disproven only after “deniers” had been crushed and even destroyed for touting nonconforming interpretations of available evidence. Altogether the lesson should be crystal clear: science – which I believe to be the most brilliant discipline we have for understanding the physical universe – is fallible and, therefore, always open to debate.The ""Meet The Press’"" policy is pointedly and dangerously unscientific. And so are the calls by like-minded individuals to not just silence but punish anyone who dares to challenge the consensus of human-caused climate change – all allegedly in the name of science. “I think that denying climate change is a crime against humanity,” says comedian Eric Idle, not joking. “And they should be held accountable in a World Court.”Bill Nye – another commentator, but with an undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering – agrees, saying, “this extreme doubt about climate change is affecting my quality of life as a public citizen. So I can see where people are very concerned about this, and they’re pursuing criminal investigations …”“The scientific consensus is in, and the argument is now over,” proclaims actor Leonardo Di Caprio. “If you do not believe in climate change, you do not believe in facts, or in science or empirical truths and therefore, in my humble opinion, should not be allowed to hold public office.”Albert Einstein once faced a similar kind of repulsive, benighted lynch mob. In his day, the scientific establishment resolutely believed that time and space were absolutes and cited as incontrovertible proof a vast literature of peer-reviewed, published studies. Collectively, mainstream scientists mocked Einstein’s belief that space and time were relative – some calling it “Jewish science,” a particularly hateful way of smearing the young space-time denier.Yet, as everyone now knows, Einstein – like Copernicus, Galileo, and scores of other vindicated “deniers” over the centuries – ultimately disproved the vaunted scientific consensus.By all means, vet your guests carefully – avoid the uncredentialed nut jobs and purely political partisans. But, above all, heed Einstein’s wise words about how science really works. “No amount of experimentation can ever prove me right,” he observed, “a single experiment can prove me wrong.”",1
"The public's concern about global warming has remained below 45 percent while progressive Democrats push a green agenda on Capitol Hill.Florida Democratic Rep. Kathy Castor, whom House Speaker Nancy Pelosi tapped to chair the newly restored House ""climate crisis"" committee, owned investments worth tens of thousands of dollars over several years in two top polluters, federal disclosure records reveal.Castor's connections to companies like Dow Chemical and machinery manufacturer Caterpillar, Inc. threatened to further undermine progressive Democrats' confidence in the new climate panel, which New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez criticized earlier this week as a half-hearted effort that should exclude members who have taken money from fossil-fuel producers.In 2007 -- her first year in Congress -- Castor owned between $1,001 and $15,000 in stock in Dow Chemical, disclosure filings show. In July of that year, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reached an agreement with Dow Chemical requiring that the company clean up three ""dioxin-contaminated hot spots on the Tittabawassee River downstream of its Midland, Mich., facility.""Dioxin refers to chemically similar compounds that can cause environmental damage and a range of negative health effects in humans, including cancer and skin lesions.""This cleanup will make Michigan a safer, healthier place to live,"" an EPA regional administrator said at the time.

      Long after that administrative sanction, though, the EPA named Dow Chemical the nation's second-largest toxic waste producer, saying in 2012 that the company had produced approximately 600 million pounds of toxic chemical waste. Dow Chemical, in response, defended its handling of potentially dangerous waste materials and noted it is the largest chemical manufacturer in the country.From 2008 to 2013, Castor reported between $201 and $1,000 in income from dividends from Dow Chemical Stock, with the total value of the asset between $15,001 and $50,000. She disclosed that she had sold between $1,000 and $15,000 worth of Dow Chemical stock in 2014, and seemingly had disposed of all of her holdings in the company by 2016.TUCKER: THE LEFT WANTS TO TAKE AWAY YOUR STRAWS, BUT IGNORES REAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMSAdditionally, Castor disclosed in 2015 that she held between $1,001 and $15,000 in stock in Caterpillar, Inc., and sold an amount within that range in 2016. Just four years earlier, in 2011, Caterpillar reached a $2.55 million settlement with the EPA, which alleged that the company had committed Clean Air Act violations for ""shipping more than 590,000 highway and non-road diesel engines without the correct emissions controls"" and for failing to comply with ""emission control reporting and engine-labeling requirements.""The agreement also required Caterpillar to recall the relevant engines and reduce excessive emissions.“The enforcement of vehicle emissions standards, labeling and reporting requirements is critical to protecting the air we breathe and ensuring that companies play by the rules,” Cynthia Giles, the assistant administrator for EPA’s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, said in a press release at the time, adding that the settlement would ""protect public health and create a level playing field for companies that meet their environmental obligations.”The Castor financial filing details were first reported by The Washington Free Beacon.Castor's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on her investments. On Twitter late Thursday, Castor called the climate change committee potentially ""transformative,"" and stated that ""we intend to press for urgent action on climate change.""On her website, Castor touts her ""active and outspoken"" reaction to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010, as well as her successful push to include water quality regulations in the farm bill that address ""red tide and toxic algae."" Castor also notes that she has been ""fighting against President Trump's anti-environment policies.""In announcing Castor's selection to head the climate change committee last week, Pelosi remarked that the panel would ""engage the American people on the urgency of the climate crisis on public health, on reducing air pollution, on the economy for America to be preeminent in green technologies, on national security to facing climate-driven conflict and instability, and on our sacred moral responsibility to protect God’s creation for our children.""But in a series of New Year's Eve tweets, Ocasio-Cortez lamented that the new committee -- like its previous incarnation from 2007 to 2011 -- will lack the ability to draft legislation or subpoena individuals and companies to testify.ANALYSIS: 'GREEN NEW DEAL' IS MOST RADICAL PROPOSAL IN DECADESOcasio-Cortez also panned the Democratic leadership's rejection of her demands that committee members not have taken ""fossil fuel money,"" and that a sample ""Green New Deal"" be drafted to address climate change through economic policy.Ocasio-Cortez, in November, joined several environmental protesters outside Pelosi's office to advocate for a Green New Deal, which would seek to all but eliminate fossil fuels from the U.S. energy grid within a decade and force renewable energy purchases instead. The proposal would also have included a federal jobs guarantee to guard against economic shockwaves.""This committee, if it turns out that the rumors about it are true, sounds about as useful as a screen door on a submarine,” Ocasio-Cortez spokesman Corbin Trent reportedly said. “As it’s portrayed it’s going to be completely incapable of solving the greatest threat to human kind.”Ocasio-Cortez has similarly failed to upend Pelosi's policy priorities elsewhere in recent days, as the idealism of her historic and insurgent political rise has collided headlong with the Democratic establishment.Overcoming a defiant last-minute challenge from the party's progressive wing, including Ocasio-Cortez, House Democrats on Thursday approved most of a sweeping new rules package that includes not only the new climate committee, but also so-called ""pay-go"" restrictions on some new spending. Progressives pushing for policies like Medicare-for-all and free college tuition said they worried the pay-go limitations will prevent those pricey priorities from becoming reality.Ocasio-Cortez called pay-go a “dark political maneuver designed to hamstring progress on healthcare+other leg.""But Ocasio-Cortez -- who on Thursday joined most of her fellow Democrats in voting for Pelosi to again become House speaker -- did not specifically mention the Green New Deal in her last-minute objections to the rules package that ignored many of her environmental demands.In fact, earlier this week, Ocasio-Cortez seem resigned to the possibility that the environmental plan -- which some environmental analysts say is urgently necessary to avert global calamity -- might have to wait.“Democrats can’t enact a #GreenNewDeal right away — but they should start preparing now, and be ready to move in two years,"" read a quote from economist Paul Krugman that Ocasio-Cortez reposted on New Year's Day.",1

          In this file photo, commuters ride a new zero emissions electric bus in California.
          (AP)California moved Friday to eliminate climate-changing fossil fuels from its fleet of 12,000 transit buses, enacting a first-in-the-nation mandate that will vastly increase the number of electric buses on the road.The California Air Resources Board voted unanimously to require that all new buses be carbon-free by 2029. Environmental advocates project that the last buses emitting greenhouse gases will be phased out by 2040.While clean buses cost more than the diesel and natural gas vehicles they will replace, say they have lower maintenance and fuel costs. Supporters hope creating demand for thousands of clean buses will bring down their price and eventually other heavy-duty vehicles like trucks.California has 153 zero-emission buses on the road now with hundreds more on order. Most of them are electric, though technology also exists for buses powered by hydrogen fuel cells.'SECRET SANTA' PAYS WALMART SHOPPERS' LAYAWAY, SPREADS HOLIDAY CHEER“Every state could do a strategy like this,” said Adrian Martinez, an attorney for Earthjustice, an environmental legal group that supports the rule. “This is something that California did first because we have major air quality and pollution problems, but this is something other states could pursue.”Existing state and federal subsidies are available to help transit agencies absorb some of the higher costs of carbon-free buses, along with money from the state’s settlement with Volkswagen over the German automaker’s emission-cheating software.In approving the mandate, air board members cited both a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and improved air quality along heavily trafficked transit corridors in smog-polluted cities.'WREATHS ACROSS AMERICA' HONORS FALLEN VETS AT HUNDREDS OF CEREMONIESThe transportation sector accounts for 40 percent of California’s greenhouse gases, and those emissions are rising even as electrical emissions have fallen substantially.California needs to drastically reduce transportation emissions to meet its aggressive climate change goals.The California Transit Association, a lobbying group, does not oppose electrifying the fleet but is concerned that zero-emission buses can’t match the performance of the existing fleet and that there isn’t enough money available for the transition, said Michael Pimentel, who is leading the organization’s work on the issue.“We do want to work alongside the Air Resources Board and our partners at the state and federal level to address these concerns and to ultimately achieve the goal of fully electrified fleets by 2040,” Pimentel said.",1
"U.S. Capitol Police told Fox News 138 people were arrested Monday during demonstrations by Green New Deal supporters at the Capitol Hill office of House Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.“Today, the United States Capitol Police arrested 138 individuals for unlawfully demonstrating in the Cannon and Longworth House Office Buildings. All were charged with D.C. Code §22-1307, Crowding, Obstructing, or Incommoding,” Eva Malecki, communications director of the United States Capitol Police, said.Hundreds of young demonstrators turned out Monday on Capitol Hill to push Democrats on a package of ambitious environmental goals — including a nationwide transition to 100-percent power from renewable sources within as little as 10 years — that’s been dubbed the Green New Deal.Already embraced by Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., an increasingly influential figure on the left, the Green New Deal is designed to nudge prospective Democratic presidential candidates to stake out aggressive positions on climate change.The Green New Deal deliberately omits details on how to reorient the United States toward the drastic carbon-emissions reductions it demands, instead calling for a select committee in the House to devise a plan by 2020. That timetable is designed to rally Democrats behind a climate-change strategy as they’re picking a nominee to take on President Trump, who has rolled back multiple environmental regulations and cast doubt on the scientific consensus that human activity is driving global warming.Organizers with the Sunrise Movement activist group have framed their approach as a make-or-break issue for Democratic voters, particularly young voters.However, they’re fighting recent history on that point. Other issues dominated the debate during the 2016 Democratic presidential primary, and climate change barely registered during the 2016 general election.Stephen O’Hanlon, a spokesman for the Sunrise Movement, said, “Any senators or any other politician who wants the votes of young people in 2020 needs to back a Green New Deal that would transform our economy and create millions of new jobs stopping climate change.”DEMS DENY CHANGING TONE ON VOTER FRAUD AMID NORTH CAROLINA BALLOT MESS“What’s your plan?” read signs held up by protesters. Others said, “Do your job” and “No more excuses.”The plan, named for the New Deal that reshaped America under former President Franklin D. Roosevelt, envisions a costly and dramatically remodeled U.S. energy infrastructure as soon as 2030. It’s a shift from where Democrats laid down their symbolic markers on climate change as recently as last year.

          Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who won her bid for a seat in the House of Representatives in New York's 14th Congressional District, asks 2014 Nobel Laureate Malala Yousafzai a question at the Kennedy School's Institute of Politics at Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass., Thursday, Dec. 6, 2018.
          (AP)Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez promises that going green – removing all fossil fuels from our energy mix – will “establish economic, social and racial justice in the United States.”In fact, her proposal would cripple our economy and hurt our poorest citizens.Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has admirable passion, but needs some schooling in energy economics. The cost of renewable energy is dropping fast, but is still more expensive in many applications than traditional fossil fuels like coal or oil. That’s one reason that adoption of wind and solar power has been slow, and that many countries, including the United States, underwrite renewables with subsidies and tax credits. The International Energy Agency predicts in its 2018 report that “the share of renewables in meeting global energy demand is expected to grow by one-fifth in the next five years to reach 12.4% in 2023.” LIZ PEEK: TRUMP SCORES BIG WINS AT THE G-20The share of renewables remains low because wind and sun power are effective in producing electricity but not, for instance, in powering automobiles or airplanes. Renewables will generate nearly 30 percent of global electricity in 2023, a big jump from 24 percent in 2017, but will still account for only 3.8 percent of transportation fuel, compared to 3.4 percent in 2018.More important, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez should know that lower-income and minority communities in the U.S. are disproportionately disadvantaged by higher energy costs. A 2016 study by the National Research Defense Council found that low income households “spend, on average, 7.2 percent of their income on utility bills…That is more than triple the 2.3 percent spent by higher-income households for electricity, heating and cooling.”  Were we to ditch coal, natural gas and oil in favor of higher-cost renewables, electricity prices would soar, especially harming just those folks whom the young progressive says she wants to help.Evidence of the staggering costs imposed by green policies is provided by other IEA data, which compares electricity costs in different countries. In the United States, the cost of electricity for households earlier this year was $129 per megawatt. In Germany, a country that leapt into renewables with enthusiasm, and imposed hefty taxes to squelch demand for fossil fuels, the cost is $343.59. Does Ms. Ocasio-Cortez really want to impose a near-tripling of electricity costs on Americans?Ms. Ocasio-Cortez might want to visit France, a sympathetic left-leaning country, which is currently convulsed by people who are really, really angry over recently-enacted green policies of the kind that she might embrace.  President Emmanuel Macron raised taxes on diesel fuel and gasoline, hoping to make driving more expensive and thereby discourage fossil fuel use, setting off the worst rioting that country has seen in a generation.The lesson for Macron, for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and other policy makers is that people may be concerned about global warming and increasing emissions, but they are considerably more worried about making ends meet. It is not the high-income elites who are taking to the streets, breaking store windows and burning cars – it is middle class and blue collar people who think Macron has no sympathy for their travails, for their ever-higher cost of living and, in particular, for the cost of their commute.Note that 70 percent of the French people support the protests, while at the same time 79 percent of the country, according to a poll conducted last year, fret about climate change.The lesson for Macron, for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and other policy makers is that people may be concerned about global warming and increasing emissions, but they are considerably more worried about making ends meet.Polling on the subject bears this out. While a global Pew study found that 54 percent of people in 40 countries thought that climate change was a “very serious problem,” a survey conducted by the UN at about the same time, which elicited almost 7 million responses, showed people ranking climate change the least of their concerns. Global warming came in dead last behind better education, better health care, better job opportunities and thirteen other issues.Even in the U.S., where 6 of 10 respondents to the Pew poll say their community is already being impacted by climate change, the issue ranks 17th in a list of policy priorities.Why this disconnect? One reason is that the extreme alarmism from environmentalists has numbed us to the perils of rising emissions. If you are endlessly lectured about how eating meat or driving your Chevy will cause entire populations to be swept away by rising sea levels, it becomes overwhelming. People tune out.It is also true that some of the wilder predictions of disaster have failed to materialize, leading to profound skepticism. Al Gore’s doomed polar bears, for instance, seem to actually be thriving. According to one source, their numbers are increasing except in one location, where in fact they are challenged by too much sea ice, as opposed to too little.Because of abundant natural gas displacing coal, the United States is the only major country in which emissions have been dropping over the past decade. We are not the problem. It is China, whose carbon output is already nearly twice that of the U.S. A recent report from the Global Carbon Project blames a predicted rise in worldwide emissions this year on “a rise in coal consumption in China, which accounts for more than 46% of the projected increase in industrial CO2 emissions in 2018.”The U.S. is blessed with abundant energy, an important competitive advantage. The Trump White House pulled out of the Paris Climate Accord because the demands of that agreement would have destroyed that advantage and hobbled our growth, while demanding virtually no commitments from China.Americans are sensible people. We want clean air and water, and we want to curtail the carbon emissions that appear a danger to our world. But, we do not want to sacrifice our economic wellbeing on the altar of climate dogma. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez should be careful before promoting policies that would build a cleaner planet on the backs of American workers. ",1
"Raw video: Yellow-vested protesters gather in central Paris near the near the Arc de Triomphe as heavily armed French authorities try to prevent violence.The European elites can’t be happy with what is happening in France.Over the last month, hundreds of thousands of angry French citizens have joined in “yellow vest” protests, initially sparked by proposed carbon taxes on fuel. This weekend, protester turnout was down, but the violence was up.While the destructive rioting should be deplored, the underlying problems that led to this moment should not be ignored.French President Emmanuel Macron once heralded as a visionary “centrist” leader who would pull France and the world into glorious modernity, now finds himself in hot water.Macron once mused that France may need a king, and others compared him to Napoleon.But as Abraham Lincoln once said to bumbling Union Gen. Joseph Hooker, who incautiously spoke about setting up an American dictatorship: “Only those generals who gain successes can set up dictators.”The praise of Macron as a transformative leader now seems premature.Just last year, President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the Paris Climate Accord, saying that he would put “no other consideration before the well-being of American citizens.” He also vowed to reject an agreement that would force taxpayers to “absorb the cost in terms of lost jobs, lower wages, shuttered factories, and vastly diminished economic production.”The media blasted Trump for his decision while praising Macron, who enthusiastically endorsed the climate pact. Rubbing his thumb in Trump’s eye, Macron went on to campaign on the pledge of “Make Our Planet Great Again.”It didn’t work out well for Macron or his country. His approval rating has plunged to 23 percent—less than half that of Trump. And Paris is literally burningAs for the climate agenda Macron so warmly embraced: it is turning to ashes as well.The green agenda bills itself as a movement to save the planet and fight inequality. But in truth, its anti-carbon policies fall hardest on middle class and working class people who can’t afford sky high energy costs and may lose their jobs in industries that the Greens want to put out of business.Increasingly, however, those hit hard by these policies are realizing that the environmentalist piety projects of the well-to-do also just so happen to make them even more well-to-do in the process.Revenues from France’s carbon tax were set to subsidize green industries like wind and solar, even as Macron began shuttering 14 nuclear of the nation’s 58 power plants.  The Green God of Paris also aims to shut all French coal plants by 2022.Climate crusaders like Macron may say it’s all about saving the world and stopping climate change, but the process always involves funneling tons of money from constituencies they don’t like to ones they do.In other words: Crony capitalism.Unfortunately, there is no shortage of people who want to import this disastrous agenda to the United States, even as it immolates Europe. It’s already on its way in California and perhaps in Congress through the so-called Green New Deal proposed by Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.The events in France should serve as an early warning for Americans about the costs of ignoring the forgotten man.The yellow jacket protests are over more than just a single, obnoxious tax. They arise from the failure of Western leaders, like Macron, to look out for the interests of their people as a whole instead of just their favored classes.The enraged, resentful citizens in the streets of Paris and rural roads of the countryside have no interest in crowning a new king. But they are fed up with paying ever-rising climate taxes so their “betters” in the drawing rooms of Paris and Brussels can feel good about themselves and pad the wallets of their business cronies.America has fortunately set another course—one toward prosperity and away from the stifling, job-killing energy policies that have left Paris with boarded up shop windows and tear gas wafting down the Champs-Elysées.",1
"The latest National Climate Assessment concludes that without 'substantial and sustained global mitigation,' climate change will cause 'growing losses to American infrastructure and property' and impede the 'rate of economic growth'; Ellison Barber reports.Carbon dioxide emissions across the world made their largest jump in the past year, rising an estimated 2.7 percent, according to three studies released Wednesday.The studies, released by the Global Carbon Project, found that this year the world would spew 40.9 billion tons of carbon dioxide, up from 39.8 billion last year — with the margin of error at about one percentage point on either side.TERRIFYING CLIMATE CHANGE WARNING: 12 YEARS UNTIL WE'RE DOOMEDThe research conducted by the project, which is an international scientific collaboration of academics, governments and industry that tracks greenhouse gas emissions, puts some of the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change almost out of reach, according to scientists.""This is terrible news,"" Andrew Jones, co-director of Climate Interactive, which models greenhouse gas emissions and temperatures, told The Associated Press. ""Every year that we delay serious climate action, the Paris goals become more difficult to meet.""The Paris accord set two goals. The long-held goal would limit global warming to no more than 1.8 degrees from existing levels, with a more ambitious goal of limiting warming to 0.9 degrees from now.The Global Carbon Project uses government and industry reports to come up with final emission figures for 2017 and projections for 2018 based on the four biggest polluters: China, the United States, India and the European Union.The U.S., which had been steadily decreasing its carbon pollution, showed a significant rise in emissions — up 2.5 percent — for the first time since 2013. China, the globe's biggest carbon emitter, saw its largest increase since 2011: 4.6 percent.'COLLAPE OF CIVILIZATION' PREDICTED AT UN CLIMATE SUMMITThe increase is a ""reality check,"" according to the lead author on the study, Corinne Le Quere. She said she doesn't think the world will return to the even larger increases seen from 2003 to 2008, and noted she thinks unusual factors are at play this year.For the U.S., it was a combination of a hot summer and cold winter that required more electricity use for heating and cooling. For China, it was an economic stimulus that pushed coal-powered manufacturing, Le Quere said.John Reilly, co-director of MIT's Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change, said the results aren't too surprising because fossil fuels still account for 81 percent of the world's energy use. The burning of coal, oil and gas release carbon dioxide, which warms the Earth. Reilly, who wasn't part of the study, praised it as impressive.Global carbon dioxide emissions have increased 55 percent in the last 20 years, the calculations show. At the same time, Earth has warmed on average about two-thirds of a degree, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.The Associated Press contributed to this report.",1

          WASHINGTON – It's elemental. President Donald Trump got his facts about earth, water, air and fire wrong as he and his aides spent a week attacking the White House climate report.In interviews and off-the-cuff remarks, public statements and briefings, the president and the White House made a dozen discernible claims about the National Climate Assessment that the White House quietly issued on the day after Thanksgiving. Only one was supported by facts.Here are 11 ways that the president bungled the basics of climate change, the Earth and of science itself. At the end of this list, you can read what the White House got right.TRUMP: ""I don't believe it,"" he said Monday. Then on Tuesday he told The Washington Post: ""One of the problems that a lot of people like myself, we have very high levels of intelligence, but we're not necessarily such believers.""THE FACTS: The president implies that belief is essential to the climate change issue. What to do about it is a matter of debate. But science, unlike faith, works regardless of whether someone believes it.""Science is not a belief system,"" said University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd, a past president of the American Meteorological Society. He added that if someone doesn't believe in gravity, ""guess what happens if you fall off a ladder.""___TRUMP: ""And when you're talking about an atmosphere, oceans are very small,"" he told The Washington Post.THE FACTS: Oceans are plainly huge. About two-thirds of Earth's surface is ocean. The overall atmosphere that circles the globe is bigger and deeper, but the oceans are much weightier. Also, 90 percent of the heat added in recent decades to the climate system from global warming has gone into the oceans, said Stanford University climate scientist Noah Diffenbaugh.Added Princeton University geosciences professor Michael Oppenheimer: ""The oceans' mass is about 300,000 times more than the atmosphere.""___TRUMP: ""If you go back and if you look at articles, they talked about global freezing, they talked about at some point the planets could have freeze to death, then it's going to die of heat exhaustion."" — Post interview.THE FACTS: The president is referring to the 1970s when some mainstream media articles were speculating that the planet was cooling because of increasing air pollution blocking the sun, said Oregon State University climate scientist Phil Mote.Even then, when much less was known about climate change, 44 peer-reviewed scientific papers published between 1965 and 1979 said the world was warming and only seven talked of cooling, according to a 2008 study in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.___TRUMP: ""As to whether or not it's man-made and whether or not the effects that you're talking about are there, I don't see it — not nearly like it is."" — Post interview.THE FACTS: The climate assessment from his White House said more than 90 percent of the warming is from humans. The climate report said ""there are no credible explanations"" for the changing climate other than human causes. Other international and national science reports say the same thing.___SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, Trump press secretary: The report is ""not based on facts. ... it's not data driven.""THE FACTS: That's not so. Data, including observations of temperature, sea level rise and numerous other indicators, are throughout the report.""The report is deeply grounded in facts,"" Stanford's Diffenbaugh said. ""In fact, much of the evidence in the report arises from historical climate changes that have already been observed through direct measurements, making the report deeply data driven.""___SANDERS: ""Modeling the climate is an extremely complicated science that is never exact"" and the report is ""based on modeling, which is extremely hard to do when you're talking about the climate.""THE FACTS: ""It may not be exact but the modeling is good enough to know we have a serious problem,"" said University of Illinois atmospheric sciences professor Donald Wuebbles, one of the authors of the climate assessment. ""We design airplanes and cars with inexact models so being exact is not a necessity.""___LINDSAY WALTERS, deputy press secretary: ""The report is largely based on the most extreme scenario, which contradicts long-established trends by assuming that, despite strong economic growth that would increase greenhouse gas emissions, there would be limited technology and innovation, and a rapidly expanding population.""THE FACTS: The report addresses different scenarios. The worst scenario, used by scientists for more than a decade, is often thought of as business as usual and for years was the trajectory Earth was on. Another scenario is based on moderate cuts globally in emissions, which are more than have been achieved or even pledged in the 2015 Paris agreement. The Earth is now somewhere between those two scenarios. The report also includes a ""very low scenario,"" which is far from what's happening now.For example, when addressing how warm the globe will get, the report gives three scenarios and three ranges of temperatures.____WALTERS: ""To better assess the potential future effects of climate change, we need to focus on improving the transparency and accuracy of our modeling and projections.""THE FACTS: ""No one has hidden anything,"" said University of Oklahoma meteorology professor Jason Furtado. ""All studies referred to in the report are available in published journals and accessible to all who want them. All studies funded with federal monies are public domain, including all coding and data/model output produced.""___TRUMP: ""You look at our air and water and it's right now at a record clean. But when you look at parts of Asia and when you look at South America, and when you look at many other places in this world, including Russia, including just many other places, the air is incredibly dirty."" __ Post interview.THE FACTS: He's wrong about record clean air. Trump's own Environmental Protection Agency's data show that in 2017, among 35 major U.S. cities, there were 729 cases of ""unhealthy days for ozone and fine particle pollution."" That's up 22 percent from 2014 and the worst year since 2012. Data for 2018 is not complete, but this month in California people were wearing breathing masks to filter out the wildfire-caused pollution in Northern California.When it comes to smog, in 2016 the United States averaged 66 parts of ozone per billion parts of air, when weighted by population density, according to the State of Global Air 2018 report by the Health Effects Institute. That's worse than Russia, Japan and Brazil. When averaged out for population, China's smog level was the same as the U.S. But America was far cleaner than all those countries for another air pollutant: soot.___TRUMP: ""I mean, we take thousands of tons of garbage off our beaches all the time that comes over from Asia. It just flows right down the Pacific, it flows, and we say where does this come from?"" __ Post interview.THE FACTS: Singling out Asia for America's dirty Pacific beaches is an evasion.Pacific currents do bring some trash from Asia, most noticeably during the 2011 tsunami, but it is rare that scientists can trace trash to a specific geographic location, said oceanographer Kara Lavender Law at the Sea Education Association, who said Trump's ""statement is not supported by the data.""Americans dirty their own coastlines because ""we produce double more trash per person than most of the people living in Southeast Asia,"" said Jenna Jambeck, a University of Georgia environmental engineering expert who studies marine debris.___TRUMP: ""The fire in California, where I was, if you looked at the floor, the floor of the fire they have trees that were fallen, they did no forest management, no forest maintenance, and you can light — you can take a match like this and light a tree trunk when that thing is laying there for more than 14 or 15 months. And it's a massive problem in California."" __Post interview.THE FACTS: Good luck lighting a dead tree with a match. More broadly, the lack of forest management — by which he means clearing dead trees and brush — is not the main cause of the worst California wildfires. A severe, years-long drought and rising temperatures are at the core of the problem.""Both the US Forest Service and the CalFire have fuel reduction programs, so it's incorrect to say that there's 'no forest management',"" said Phillip Dennison, a fire science professor at the University of Utah. ""In the specific cases of the Camp and Woolsey Fires, forest management practices were not a primary factor in determining the size of the fires or the destruction that they wrought.""""As anyone who has built a campfire knows, you don't use a match to ignite a log, not matter how dry it is,"" Dennison said. ""Instead you use kindling to get the fire hot enough to burn the log. For fire danger, we're much more concerned about the fine fuels — the small stuff — than we are tree trunks. Fine fuels carry fires forward.""___WALTERS: The United States is ""leading the world in reducing carbon dioxide emissions.""THE FACTS: ""This is actually true,"" said Glen Peters, research director at the Center for International Climate Research in Norway.

"Researchers believe managing flow of water in and out of city could help.NEW ORLEANS – “I know where I live,” said Keith Daggett.Daggett’s home sits by the London Avenue Canal. The floodwall along the canal breached during Hurricane Katrina more than 13 years ago. An outdoor exhibition now stands at the site of the devastation, marking the flooding caused by the failures of the canal.“Yes, there is a flood risk here,” said Daggett, who recently moved to the neighborhood.Tulane University environmental sciences professor Alex Kolker reiterated that the future of the area looks dire.“The neighborhood lies eight to 10 feet below the canal, and that’s an enormous flood risk,” said Kolker.Hydrogeologists said the city sinks 6 to 8 mm a year. A large part of the city is already below sea level, and the Gentilly neighborhood, where Daggett lives, is one of the fastest sinking areas.
      Dutch-based company Deltares drilling in New Orleans. It's part of a bigger project to make the city resilient in relation to climate change and sea level rise. 
      (Deltares)Kolker is part of a team of researchers, which includes Dutch-based research institute Deltares and the Water Institute of the Gulf, trying to figure out which sections of the city are sinking, how fast, and why. They say subsidence was one reason why Katrina was catastrophic. Water flooded the low-lying areas and had to be pumped out.“After having experienced the damaged city in 2006 and working there all those years after, New Orleans became part of me. This project helps to collect the missing information needed to take appropriate measures to ensure the [city] is a safe place in the future in relation to sea level rise and changing climate dynamics,” said Roelof Stuurman, a water specialist at Deltares.The city-led project called “Reshaping the Urban Delta” is being funded by a $141.3 million grant from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. It largely focuses on the city’s subsurface.As the first comprehensive resilience district in the Gentilly neighborhood, the city said, the project includes over $90 Million in urban water management projects that largely focus on the city’s subsurface.“We cannot manage what we don’t understand; so the first step is to ground truth the assumptions we’ve made from past studies and build upon the best available science,” said Tyler Antrup, urban water program manager from the city’s Office of Resilience and Sustainability.Experts theorize the underlying geology could be one reason for the sinking, also known as subsidence.
      Homes by the London Avenue Canal in New Orleans sit eight to 10 feet below the canal, a flood risk for residents in the area. 
      (Fox News)“There’s a whole bunch of old swamps beneath the city of New Orleans and when these swamps dry out the ground they take compact and compress and the ground above them sinks,” said Kolker.Cracked pipes could also play a part.“Water and mud can flow into them and erode the ground around them. And then you'd create a hole, and that hole is almost a sinkhole,” added Kolker.Stuurman believes managing the way water flows in and around the city could mitigate the rate of subsidence. Last week, Deltares led a group on several soil drilling operations around the city taking sediment samples, the first step of this study.“The objective was to determine the ‘mean lowest groundwater level’ and the amount of organic material in the soil and clay saturation because these determine the subsidence risk,” said Stuurman.New Orleans is not alone in this ordeal. Tokyo and even parts of the Houston-Galveston area have sunk as well, particularly in the middle of the 20th century.
      The project will take about 18 months, culminating with the design and installation of an integrated water monitoring network. 
      (Tulane University)“There, they did take a lot of effort to better monitor the rate at which they pulled out ground water. And, that did help slow the subsidence in (the Houston-Galveston area),” said Kolker.Researchers said there’s an added sense of urgency as storms, especially in the Gulf Coast region, are expected to become stronger, thanks to climate change.“New Orleans is one of the most vulnerable cities in the United States [due] to the impacts of climate change and sea level rise. As we see more frequent and intense rainfall events, we have to adapt by living with water, reducing the subsidence of our soils, and preserving the quality of life and culture of our City,” said Antrup.The entire study will take about 18 months, culminating with the design and installation of an integrated water monitoring network.“Knowing that they are at least addressing the problem, to whatever degree,” Daggett said, “does give me some comfort.”",1
"The latest National Climate Assessment concludes that without 'substantial and sustained global mitigation,' climate change will cause 'growing losses to American infrastructure and property' and impede the 'rate of economic growth'; Ellison Barber reports.Former Vice President Al Gore accused the Trump administration of trying to “bury’ a damning government report that linked global warming to the worsening of natural disasters by quietly releasing the study on the Friday after Thanksgiving.Gore, who since his time as vice president has become an outspoken advocate for the need to counteract the effects of global warming, said in a statement that the White House was trying to “bury this critical U.S. assessment of the climate crisis” by releasing it the day after Thanksgiving. The day, known as Black Friday, has become the traditional start of the holiday shopping season and one that most Americans have off from work.“Unbelievably deadly and tragic wildfires rage in the West, hurricanes batter our coasts — and the Trump administration chooses the Friday after Thanksgiving to try and bury this critical U.S. assessment of the climate crisis,” Gore said in a statement that he posted on Twitter Friday. “The president may try to hide the truth, but his own scientists and experts have made it as stark and clear as possible.”The National Climate Assessment, which is mandated by law every few years and is based on more than 1,000 previous research studies, details how global warming -- from the burning of coal, oil and gas -- is hurting each region of the United States and how it impacts different sectors of the economy, including energy and agriculture. It was written long before the deadly fires in California this month and before Hurricanes Florence and Michael raked the East Coast and Florida.""Climate change is transforming where and how we live and presents growing challenges to human health and quality of life, the economy, and the natural systems that support us,"" the report says.This includes worsening air pollution causing heart and lung problems, more diseases from insects, the potential for a jump in deaths during heat waves, and nastier allergies, according to the report.“Annual losses in some economic sectors are projected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century — more than the current gross domestic product (GDP) of many U.S. states,"" the report says. It'll be especially costly on the nation's coasts because of rising seas and severe storm surges, which will lower property values. And in some areas, such as parts of Alaska and Louisiana, coastal flooding will likely force people to relocate.”While Gore has become one of the most prominent advocates for reducing carbon emissions and fighting to reduce the effect of climate change, the former vice president has not been immune from claims that his work is not as altruistic as it appears.Gore left the vice president’s residence with a relatively modest net worth of $1.7 million -- mostly from family farm assets -- but since the release of his 2006 documentary “An Inconvenient Truth” and his continuing global tour to preach his message, he has amassed a fortune valued at upward of $200 million. From the fossil fuels he burns jetting around the globe, to his socializing with Hollywood heavy hitters, to his 6,500-square-foot seafront home in California that cost $8.8 million, some climate activists have questioned whether Gore is helping or hurting the climate fight.“He is a flawed character,” Stephen Lacey, editor-in-chief of the magazine GreenTechMedia, said on his podcast “The Energy Gang” last year. “We’re in an era of backlash against elites, so Gore, a guy who bought a 6,500-square-foot seafront home in California for $8.8 million, and who hangs around with other celebrities who talk big on climate but who live lavish lifestyles, is the perfect target at this point in time.”Gore’s lifestyle aside, his statement comes amid what appears to be a continuing denial from Trump and members of his administration about the dangers climate change poses to the environment and to the world’s economy.Earlier in the week, Trump tweeted about the brutal cold spell that hit the East Coast over the Thanksgiving holiday and questioned “Whatever happened to Global Warming?”Friday's report seemed to anticipate such comments, saying: ""Over shorter timescales and smaller geographic regions, the influence of natural variability can be larger than the influence of human activity ... Over climate timescales of multiple decades, however, global temperature continues to steadily increase.""The Lower 48 states have warmed 1.8 degrees (1 degree Celsius) since 1900 with 1.2 degrees in the last few decades, according to the report. By the end of the century, the U.S. will be 3 to 12 degrees (1.6 to 6.6 degrees Celsius) hotter depending on how much greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere, the report warns.Releasing the report on Black Friday ""is a transparent attempt by the Trump administration to bury this report and continue the campaign of not only denying, but suppressing the best of climate science,"" said study co-author Andrew Light, an international policy expert at the World Resources Institute.During a press conference Friday, officials behind the report repeatedly declined to answer questions about the timing of its release and why it contradicts public statements from Trump. Report director David Reidmiller said questions about the timing were ""relevant,"" but said what was in the report was more important.The Associated Press contributed to this report.",1
"The latest National Climate Assessment concludes that without 'substantial and sustained global mitigation,' climate change will cause 'growing losses to American infrastructure and property' and impede the 'rate of economic growth'; Ellison Barber reports.The White House on Friday released a federal report that found that the impacts of climate change are being felt across the country, and “extreme weather and climate-related events” are going to worsen in the years to come -- with a significant impact on the economy.The National Climate Assessment finds that extreme weather disasters “""have already become more frequent, intense, widespread or of long duration and have cost the the U.S. nearly $400 billion since 2015.”The report is mandated every four years and is based on previous research. Its aim is to detail how climate change is affecting the U.S. and how it is impacting the economy. It is written by outside scientists and officials from 13 federal agencies.“Without more significant global greenhouse gas mitigation and regional adaptation efforts, climate change is expected to cause substantial losses to infrastructure and property and impede the rate of economic growth over this century,” the report says, arguing that sectors that require national resources and favorable climates -- such as agriculture, tourism and fishing, are particularly vulnerable.The report also finds that the U.S. will be 3-12 degrees hotter by the end of the century, depending on how much greenhouse gas is released into the atmosphere. It also says that more than 90 percent of current warming is caused by humans.It is unclear how the report will be greeted by the Trump administration, and particularly the White House. President Trump has been vocal in his skepticism about man-made climate change and the effects it is allegedly having both on temperatures and extreme weather events. He also pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord.Trump seemed to take a knock at those calling for action over climate change this week, when he noted that a cold blast was set to hit the U.S.“Whatever happened to Global Warming?” he asked.The report was initially set to be released in December. The White House’s decision to instead release the report on Black Friday was likely to lead to accusations that the administration was attempting to dump the report on a day many Americans were not engaged in the news cycle.Study co-author Andrew Light, an international policy expert at the World Resources Institute, told The Associated Press that the release “ ""is a transparent attempt by the Trump administration to bury this report and continue the campaign of not only denying but suppressing the best of climate science.”Al Gore, the 2000 Democratic presidential nominee and climate activist, accused President Trump of attempting to ""hide the truth.""However, David Reidmiller, the director of the assessment, said the timing was in order to have the report come out ahead of U.N. climate talks, which begin in Poland on December 2, according to Axios.The report comes just as California has been tackling devastating wildfires that have killed at least 84 people. President Trump has said that better forest management could have helped limit the blaze.This week Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke blamed “radical environmentalists” for making the fires worse, saying that a complicating matter was ""lawsuit after lawsuit by, yes, the radical environmental groups that would rather burn down the entire forest than cut a single tree or thin the forest.”But the report issued Friday said that “warmer and drier conditions have contributed to an increase in large forest fires in the western United States and interior Alaska.”Fox News' Paulina Dedaj and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",1

          FILE - In this Monday, Aug. 28, 2017 file photo, floodwaters from Tropical Storm Harvey overflow from Buffalo Bayou in downtown Houston, Texas. A study released on Wednesday, Nov. 14, 2018 says that between being tripped up by downtown and the bigger effect of massive paving and building up of the metro area to reduce drainage, development in Houston on average increased the extreme flooding risk by 21 times. (AP Photo/LM Otero)
          WASHINGTON – Humans helped make recent devastating U.S. hurricanes wetter but in different ways, two new studies find.Hurricane Harvey snagged on the skyscrapers of Houston, causing it to slow and dump more rain than it normally would, one study found. The city's massive amounts of paving had an even bigger impact by reducing drainage. Land development in the metro area, on average, increased the chances of extreme flooding by 21 times, study authors said.A second study looked at last year's major Hurricanes Maria and Irma and 2005's deadly Katrina and used computer simulations to see what would have happened if there had been no human-caused global warming. The study found that climate change significantly increased rainfall from those three storms, but did not boost their wind speed.Both studies are in Wednesday's journal Nature .Houston was a literal drag on Harvey as it sloshed through, with the storm getting tripped up by the skyscrapers, said study co-author Gabriele Villarini, a civil and environmental engineering professor at the University of Iowa.Co-author Gabe Vecchi, a climate scientist at Princeton University, said that forced the storm to move up higher, causing more concentrated rain over Houston and slowing, which also made more rain.He compared it to a river running over rocks, creating bubbles.""That's sort of what's going on here,"" he said.This effect is dwarfed, though, by the paving and building that don't allow water to sink into the ground, Vecchi said.Harvey's record rainfall reached 5 feet in one spot near Houston. The scientists used computer simulations to see the effects of urbanization. In parts of the Houston metro area, the effects of development ranged from a 10 percent higher risk of extreme flooding in the less developed northwest to nearly 92 times the risk in the northeast, they reported.That's on top of the unique weather patterns that made Harvey slow down and stall and climate change which brought more water into the storm, Vecchi said.MIT hurricane and climate expert Kerry Emanuel, who wasn't part of the study, called the Harvey study ""a real advance in our understanding of hurricane impacts on urban areas.""But Texas state climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon wasn't convinced. He said the team used generic shapes instead of the actual Houston skyline. He said the storm's wind speeds may have slowed, but that's different from the storm's forward movement slowing.The other study in Nature looked at a variety of historical damaging storms and tried to calculate past and future effects of climate change. In three cases, the scientists simulated the storms without the changes in the climate from greenhouse gases, showing that global warming increased rainfall 8.9 percent in Hurricane Maria , 6.3 percent in Hurricane Irma and 8.7 percent in Hurricane Katrina .Maria hit Puerto and Rico and other parts of the Caribbean. Irma hit the Caribbean and Florida, while Katrina struck New Orleans and the Gulf Coast.In Maria's case, a warming climate concentrated heavier rain in the center of the storm and reduced it on the edges, said co-author Michael Wehner, a climate scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.For 15 storms, which included the devastating Typhoon Haiyan , the potent Gilbert and 1992's Hurricane Andrew , the scientists projected future warming and found future versions of the same storms would be significantly wetter and stronger.""We are beginning to see a climate change influence emerge on tropical cyclones and that's coming out as rainfall,"" said study lead author Christina Patricola, an atmospheric scientist at the national lab.Although replicating a storm in a different climate is difficult and can't account for certain changes, this work bolsters science understanding of how climate change alters hurricanes, Emanuel said.___Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter: @borenbears .___The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

          Flames climb trees as the Camp Fire tears through Paradise, Calif., on Thursday, Nov. 8, 2018. (AP Photo/Noah Berger, File)
          WASHINGTON – Both nature and humans share blame for California's devastating wildfires, but forest management did not play a major role, despite President Donald Trump's claims, fire scientists say.Nature provides the dangerous winds that have whipped the fires, and human-caused climate change over the long haul is killing and drying the shrubs and trees that provide the fuel, experts say.""Natural factors and human-caused global warming effects fatally collude"" in these fires, said wildfire expert Kristen Thornicke of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany.Multiple reasons explain the fires' severity, but ""forest management wasn't one of them,"" University of Utah fire scientist Philip Dennison said.Trump tweeted on Saturday: ""There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor. Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests.""The death toll from the wildfire that incinerated the Northern California town of Paradise and surrounding areas climbed to 42, making it the single deadliest single blaze in California history. Statewide, the number of fire dead stood at 44, including two victims in Southern California.One reason that scientists know that management isn't to blame is that some areas now burning had fires in 2005 and 2008, so they aren't ""fuel-choked closed-canopy forests,"" Dennison said.In those earlier fires, Paradise was threatened but escaped major damage, he said. In the current blazes, it was virtually destroyed.The other major fire, in Southern California, burned through shrub land, not forest, Dennison said.""It's not about forest management. These aren't forests,"" he said.The dean of the University of Michigan's environmental school, Jonathan Overpeck, said Western fires are getting bigger and more severe. He said it ""is much less due to bad management and is instead the result of our baking of our forests, woodlands and grasslands with ever-worsening climate change.""Wildfires have become more devastating because of the extreme weather swings from global warming, fire scientists said. The average number of U.S. acres burned by wildfires has doubled over the level from 30 years ago.As of Monday, more than 13,200 square miles (34,200 square kilometers) have burned. That's more than a third higher than the 10-year average.From 1983 to 1999, the United States didn't reach 10,000 square miles burned annually. Since then, 11 of 19 years have had more than 10,000 square miles burned, including this year. In 2006, 2015 and 2017, more than 15,000 square miles burned.The two fires now burning ""aren't that far out of line with the fires we've seen in these areas in recent decades,"" Dennison said.""The biggest factor was wind,"" Dennison said in an email. ""With wind speeds as high as they were, there was nothing firefighters could do to stop the advance of the fires.""These winds, called Santa Ana winds, and the unique geography of high mountains and deep valleys act like chimneys, fortifying the fires, Thornicke said.The wind is so strong that fire breaks — areas where trees and brush have been cleared or intentionally burned to deprive the advancing flames of fuel — won't work. One of the fires jumped over eight lanes of freeway, about 140 feet (43 meters), Dennison said.Southern California had fires similar to the Woolsey fire in 1982, when winds were 60 mph, but ""the difference between 1982 and today is a much higher population in these areas. Many more people were threatened and had to evacuated,"" Dennison said.California also has been in drought for all but a few years of the 21st century and is now experiencing its longest drought, which began on Dec. 27, 2011, and has lasted 358 weeks, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor . Nearly two-thirds of the state is abnormally dry.The first nine months of the year have been fourth-warmest on record for California, and this past summer was the second-hottest on record in the state.Because of that, there are 129 million dead trees, which provide fuel for fires, Thornicke said.And it's more than trees. Dead shrubs around the bottom of trees provide what is called ""ladder fuel,"" offering a path for fire to climb from the ground to the treetops and intensifying the conflagration by a factor of 10 to 100, said Kevin Ryan, a fire consultant and former fire scientist at the U.S. Forest Service.While many conservatives advocate cutting down more trees to prevent fires, no one makes money by cutting dead shrubs, and that's a problem, he said.Local and state officials have cleared some Southern California shrub, enough for normal weather and winds. But that's not enough for this type of extreme drought, said Ryan, also a former firefighter.University of Alberta fire scientist Mike Flanigan earlier this year told The Associated Press that the hotter and drier the weather, the easier it is for fires to start, spread and burn more intensely.It's simple, he said: ""The warmer it is, the more fire we see.""For every 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit that the air warms, it needs 15 percent more rain to make up for the drying of the fuel, Flannigan said.Federal fire and weather data show the years with the most acres burned were generally a degree warmer than average.""Everyone who has gardened knows that you must water more on hotter days,"" Overpeck said. ""But, thanks in part to climate change, California isn't getting enough snow and rain to compensate for the unrelenting warming caused by climate change. The result is a worsening wildfire problem.___Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter: @borenbears .___The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

          PARADISE, Calif. – As relatives desperately searched shelters for missing loved ones on Sunday, crews searching the smoking ruins of Paradise and outlying areas found six more bodies, raising the death toll to 29, matching the deadliest wildfire in California history.Wildfires continued to rage on both ends of the state, with gusty winds expected overnight which will challenge firefighters. The statewide death toll stood at 31. The Camp Fire that ravaged a swath of Northern California was the deadliest.A total of 29 bodies have been found so far from that fire, Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea told a news briefing Sunday evening. He said 228 people were still unaccounted for.Ten search and recovery teams were working in Paradise — a town of 27,000 that was largely incinerated on Thursday — and in surrounding communities. Authorities called in a mobile DNA lab and anthropologists to help identify victims of the most destructive wildfire in California history.By early afternoon, one of the two black hearses stationed in Paradise had picked up another set of remains.People looking for friends or relatives called evacuation centers, hospitals, police and the coroner's office.Sol Bechtold drove from shelter to shelter looking for his mother, Joanne Caddy, a 75-year-old widow whose house burned down along with the rest of her neighborhood in Magalia, just north of Paradise. She lived alone and did not drive.Bechtold posted a flyer on social media, pinned it to bulletin boards at shelters and showed her picture around to evacuees, asking if anyone recognized her. He ran across a few of Caddy's neighbors, but they hadn't seen her.As he drove through the smoke and haze to yet another shelter, he said, ""I'm also under a dark emotional cloud. Your mother's somewhere and you don't know where she's at. You don't know if she's safe.""He added: ""I've got to stay positive. She's a strong, smart woman.""Officials and relatives held out hope that many of those unaccounted for were safe and simply had no cellphones or other ways to contact loved ones. The sheriff's office in the stricken northern county set up a missing-persons call center to help connect people.Gov. Jerry Brown said California is requesting aid from the Trump administration. President Donald Trump has blamed ""poor"" forest management for the fires. Brown told a press briefing that federal and state governments must do more forest management but said that's not the source of the problem.""Managing all the forests everywhere we can does not stop climate change,"" Brown said. ""And those who deny that are definitely contributing to the tragedies that we're now witnessing, and will continue to witness in the coming years.""Firefighters battling the Camp Fire with shovels and bulldozers, flame retardants and hoses expected wind gusts up to 40 mph (64 kph) overnight Sunday. Officials said they expect the wind to die down by midday Monday, but there was still no rain in sight.More than 8,000 firefighters in all battled three large wildfires burning across nearly 400 square miles (1,040 square kilometers) in Northern and Southern California, with out-of-state crews arriving.Two people were found dead in Southern California , where flames tore through Malibu mansions and working-class Los Angeles suburbs.The burned bodies were discovered in a driveway in Malibu, where residents forced from their homes included Lady Gaga, Kim Kardashian West and Martin Sheen. Actor Gerard Butler said on Instagram that his Malibu home was ""half-gone,"" and a publicist for Camille Grammer Meyer said the ""Real Housewives of Beverly Hills"" star lost her home in the seaside enclave.Flames also besieged Thousand Oaks, the Southern California city in mourning over the massacre of 12 people in a shooting rampage at a country music bar Wednesday night.In Northern California, Sheriff Honea said the devastation was so complete in some neighborhoods that ""it's very difficult to determine whether or not there may be human remains there.Authorities were also bringing in a DNA lab and said officials would reach out to relatives who had registered their missing loved ones to aid in identifying the dead after the blaze destroyed more than 6,700 buildings, nearly all of them homes.The 29 dead in Northern California matched the deadliest single fire on record, a 1933 blaze in Griffith Park in Los Angeles, though a series of wildfires in Northern California wine country last fall killed 44 people and destroyed more than 5,000 homes.The Camp Fire on Sunday stood at 173 square miles (450 square kilometers) and was 25 percent contained, but Cal Fire spokesman Bill Murphy warned that gusty winds predicted into Monday morning could spark ""explosive fire behavior.""About 150,000 people statewide were under evacuation orders, most of them in Southern California, where nearly 180 structures were destroyed, including a large mobile home community in rugged Santa Monica Mountains north of Malibu.Brown's request for a major-disaster declaration from Trump would make victims eligible for crisis counseling, housing and unemployment help, and legal aid.Drought, warmer weather attributed to climate change, and the building of homes deeper into forests have led to longer and more destructive wildfire seasons in California. While California officially emerged from a five-year drought last year, much of the northern two-thirds of the state is abnormally dry.""Things are not the way they were 10 years ago. ... The rate of spread is exponentially more than it used to be,"" said Ventura County Fire Chief Mark Lorenzen, urging residents to evacuate rather than stay behind to try to defend their homes.One of the Northern California fire's victims was an ailing woman whose body was found in bed in a burned-out house in Concow, near Paradise.Ellen Walker, who was in her early 70s, was home alone when the fire struck on Thursday, according to Nancy Breeding, a family friend.Breeding said Walker's husband was at work and called a neighbor to tell his wife to evacuate, but she was on medication and might not have been alert. Authorities confirmed her death late Friday.""A fireman took him to the house to confirm,"" Breeding said.

"President Trump praises FEMA and first responders as he tours a mobile aid distribution center for victims of Hurricane Michael in Lynn Haven, Florida.President Trump on Monday once again backed off his previous claim that climate change is a hoax, but would not say whether or not he believed it was a man-made problem.Speaking at a Red Cross center in Georgia, where he was touring areas devastated by last week’s Hurricane Michael, Trump said “there is something there” in response to a question on climate change from a reporter.“There is something there, man-made or not,” the president said, before deflecting to note that there have been previous storms that were much more intense and destructive than the recent slew of hurricanes to hit the Southeast. Trump’s comments come a day after CBS aired an interview on “60 Minutes” with the president who said he doesn't want to put the U.S. at a disadvantage in responding to climate change.""I think something's happening. Something's changing and it'll change back again,"" he said. ""I don't think it's a hoax. I think there's probably a difference. But I don't know that it's man-made. I will say this: I don't want to give trillions and trillions of dollars. I don't want to lose millions and millions of jobs.""Trump called climate change a hoax in November 2012 when he sent a tweet stating, ""The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive."" He later said he was joking about the Chinese connection, but in years since has continued to call global warming a hoax.""I'm not denying climate change,"" he said in the interview. ""But it could very well go back. You know, we're talking about over a ... millions of years.""As far as the climate ""changing back,"" temperature records kept by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration show that the world hasn't had a cooler-than-average year since 1976 or a cooler-than-normal month since the end of 1985.Trump's comments came just days after a Nobel Prize-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued a warning that global warming would increase climate-related risks to health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security and economic growth. The report detailed how Earth's weather, health and ecosystems would be in better shape if the world's leaders could somehow limit future human-caused warming.On Monday, the president said that he had heard of the recent report and that he’ll “have to take a look at it.”Trump added: “I want crystal clear water, I want the cleanest air on the planet.”Citing concerns about the pact's economic impact, Trump said in 2017 that the U.S. will leave the Paris climate accord. The agreement set voluntary greenhouse gas emission targets in an effort to lessen the impact of fossil fuels.“I’m truly an environmentalist,” he said on Monday in regards to leaving the Paris Agreement. “But that doesn’t mean we have to put one of our businesses out of business.”The Associated Press contributed to this report.",1

University of Arizona officials say that 25 years after that New Age-style experiment in the Arizona desert, the glass-covered greenhouse thrives as a singular site for researchers from around the world studying everything from the effects of the ocean’s acidification on coral to ways of ensuring food security. (AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin)
          ORACLE, Ariz. – They lived for two years and 20 minutes under the glass of a miniature Earth, complete with an ocean, rain forest, desert, grasslands and mangroves. Their air and water were recycled, and they grew the sweet potatoes, rice and other food they needed to survive.About 1,500 people were invited and some 200 journalists were on hand as the eight original inhabitants of Biosphere 2 left their glass terrarium a quarter-century ago last month in two groups that no longer talked to each other amid the stress of sharing a small space and disputes over how the project should be run. Detractors called the $150 million experiment a failure because additional oxygen was pumped into what was supposed to be a self-sustaining system.A power struggle in subsequent months led Texas billionaire backer Edward P. Bass to hire investment banker Stephen Bannon, who was later President Trump's chief strategist, to bring the project back from financial disarray.Today, Biosphere 2 is a different kind of place, a University of Arizona site where researchers from around the world can study everything from the effects of the ocean's acidification on coral to ways of ensuring food security.""It started out as a great, big kind of societal experiment and was transformed by pure ingenuity into something else that has proved useful,"" said Jeffrey S. Dukes, director of the Perdue Climate Change Research Center. ""It's also a really cool facility to tour.""Joaquin Ruiz, a geologist who directs the project in the Sonoran Desert about 30 miles (48 kilometers) northeast of Tucson, said Biosphere 2's controlled environments allow researchers to conduct experiments they won't try outside ""because you don't want to have unintended circumstances.""That means researchers from the Global Institute for Water Security at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada don't have to worry about harming the environment while studying how plants in the tiny rainforest adjust their water consumption.The miniature ocean is being renovated so researchers from places including the University of Hawaii can continue experiments on a miniature reef without hurting reefs in the Pacific. A $550,000 grant from Johns Hopkins University is helping scientists test theories about water movement on three artificial hillslopes known as the Landscape Evolution Observatory, a gigantic Earth science laboratory.The university assumed management of Biosphere 2 in mid-2007 and in June 2011 announced full acquisition of the glass-enclosed area of just over 3 acres (1 hectare) that reaches as tall as 75 feet (23 meters) in some places, and the buildings and grounds around it.Like Dukes, independent ecologist Christopher Field, director of the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment, said Biosphere 2 has proved useful for science in its current iteration.""You have to separate it from what it was originally to see its worth today,"" said Field, adding that controlled environment facilities like Biosphere 2 ""are a powerful way to help us understand the way the world works. """"It is an important piece in our portfolio for understanding climate change,"" he said.Biologist John Adams, Biosphere 2's deputy director, has been with the project since 1995, when he was a new University of Arizona graduate. ""It's always been an audacious, ambitious project,"" he said.Adams said 55 people now work at the site, including 30 researchers. Bass donated $30 million to Biosphere 2 last year and sits on its advisory board.""They have been doing a really great job, laying some strong foundations for their science,"" Jane Poynter, one of the eight original Biosphere 2 inhabitants, said of the current research. ""Twenty-five years after we came out it's still very forward-looking.""Poynter said that since she and the other ""Biospherians"" emerged from the greenhouse, much of the original animosity has faded away.The initial project was the brainchild of systems ecologist John Allen, and Bass was financial backer when the first group of four women and four men entered Biosphere 2 on Sept. 26, 1991. Now almost 90, Allen lives quietly in Santa Fe, New Mexico.A mission by a second group was terminated early after Bass ousted Allen and other top managers in April 1994 and temporarily made Bannon acting director during a management dispute. Bannon led the project for about two years, and Columbia University then took over, changing the once virtually airtight structure to a ""flow-through"" system and manipulating carbon dioxide levels to study global warming.Poynter and Taber MacCallum later married and settled in Tucson, where they operate World View Enterprises, a company that is pioneering flight to the edge of space with high-altitude balloons. They met during training for Biosphere 2, and their romance flourished after entering the enclosure.The couple hopes World View's high-altitude remote-controlled balloons will eventually be used for weather monitoring, communications and research at a fraction of the cost of satellites. They are also working on a craft called Voyager, which they want to use to take people some 100,000 feet (30,480 meters) above Earth.Crew members Abigail Alling, Mark Van Thillo and Sarah Silverstone work with their Biosphere Foundation, which conducts marine research in southeast Asia. Fellow crew member Linda Leigh, a botanist lives near Biosphere 2 in Arizona. Crew physician Roy Walford , a well-known researcher on the effects of a low-calorie diet on longevity, died from Lou Gehrig's disease in 2004 at age 79.The other crew member, Mark Nelson, lives in Santa Fe and recently published a book called ""Pushing Our Limits: Insights from Biosphere 2.""In the book, Nelson reflects on the group's experiences and calls on people to renew their relationship with nature to help reverse trends threatening the original biosphere, Earth.""I remain optimistic about the prospects for the 'human experiment,'"" he writes. ""Problems humans cause can also be solved by humans.""___Follow Anita Snow on Twitter at: https://twitter.com/asnowreports",1

          WASHINGTON – Moist air, warm waters in the Gulf of Mexico, and ideal wind patterns supercharged Hurricane Michael in the hours before it smacked Florida's Panhandle.Hurricane Michael was barely a hurricane Tuesday morning, with winds of 90 mph. A little over a day later, it had transformed into a monster. When it made landfall Wednesday afternoon, it was blowing at 155 mph. That's a 72 percent increase in wind speed in less than 33 hours.""Michael saw our worst fears realized, of rapid intensification just before landfall on a part of a coastline that has never experienced a Category 4 hurricane,"" University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy said Wednesday morning.Hurricanes have something called a potential intensity. That's how strong a storm can get if all other factors are aligned, said National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration climate and hurricane expert Jim Kossin said. Michael had nothing holding it back.""Everything was there for it to reach its potential and it did,"" Kossin said.As Michael's eye started coming ashore, it boasted the third lowest central pressure of any storm to hit the United States, behind only a 1935 Labor Day storm and 1969's Camille.Meteorologists first got a sense something big could be happening by watching how Michael's eye changed shape. Early Tuesday, it was oddly shaped and ragged. Later in the morning it started to get better organized, and by Tuesday night real-time satellite imagery was showing the eye getting stronger and scarier by the minute.Another factor: Its pressure, the measurement meteorologists use to gauge a hurricane's strength. The lower the pressure, the stronger the storm. Before landfall, Michael's pressure fell so low it looked like the winds were sure to pick up fast, said Ryan Maue, a meteorologist for weathermodels.com.And none of the factors that hold a storm back were present, especially something called ""wind shear."" Wind shear is when there's a mismatch either in speed or direction between winds near the surface and those five to six miles (8 to 10 kilometers) up.That mismatch ""pushes the storm over"" or decapitates it, Kossin said. When the wind shear near Michael eased, the storm took off, he said.""It's kind of like someone was holding on to it when it was trying to run and they let it go,"" Kossin said.Another huge factor was the water temperature. Warm water is the energy that fuels hurricanes, and the Gulf water is 4 to 5 degrees warmer than normal.Water temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico vary along with weather, but some scientists said the warm waters are signs of human-caused climate change.""Have humans contributed to how dangerous Michael is?"" Kossin said. ""Now we can look at how warm the waters are and that certainly has contributed to how intense Michael is and its intensification.""The warm waters, Kossin said, are a ""human fingerprint"" of climate change.Kossin and others have a study out this month in the Journal of Climate with computer simulations showing that human-caused global warming will increase rapid intensification of tropical weather across the globe in the future.Other studies have shown rapid intensification has already increased over past decades. One study this year in Geophysical Research Letters found that since 1986, the rate of intensification of storms like Michael has increased by about 13 mph.___Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter: @borenbears .

          (The Associated Press)Earth is on track to face devastating consequences of climate change – extreme drought, food shortages and deadly flooding – unless there’s an “unprecedented” effort made to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, a new United Nations report warns.The planet’s surface has already warmed by 1 degree Celsius – or 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit – and could see a catastrophic 1.5 C — 2.7 F — increase between 2030 and 2052, scientists say.“This is concerning because we know there are so many more problems if we exceed 1.5 degrees C global warming, including more heat waves and hot summers, greater sea level rise, and, for many parts of the world, worse droughts and rainfall extremes,” Andrew King, a climate science academic at the University of Melbourne, said in a statement to CNN.The stunning statistics were released Monday in a report by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which warned that we must take “rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society” in order to save our planet.Scientists with the Nobel Prize-winning IPCC said in order to have even a 50-50 chance of staying under the 1.5 degree cap, the world must become “carbon neutral” by 2050. Any additional carbon dioxide emissions would require removing the harmful gas from the air.If nothing is done, Earth can expect heat wave temperatures to rise by 3 degrees Celsius, more frequent or extreme droughts, an increase in deadly hurricanes and as much as 90 percent of coral reefs dying off — including the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, according to the report.Countries in the southern hemisphere would see the most drastic effects.“The next few years are probably the most important in human history,” IPCC co-chair Debra Roberts, head of the Environmental Planning and Climate Protection Department in South Africa, told Agence France-Presse.Efforts to curb climate change must also extend beyond the 2015 Paris Agreement reached among 197 countries – which President Trump withdrew the US from in June 2017.“The window on keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees C is closing rapidly and the current emissions pledges made by signatories to the Paris Agreement do not add up to us achieving that goal,” said King.Staying within the 1.5 degrees C target, instead of 2 degrees C, would result in the global sea level rising 3.9 inches less by 2100, reducing flooding. It would also cut down on species loss and extinction and reduce the impact on various ecosystems.“There were doubts if we would be able to differentiate impacts set at 1.5 C and that came so clearly. Even the scientists were surprised to see how much science was already there and how much they could really differentiate and how great are the benefits of limiting global warming at 1.5 compared to 2,” Thelma Krug, vice-chair of the IPCC, told Reuters. “And now more than ever we know that every bit of warming matters.”With Post WiresThis story originally appeared in the New York Post.",1

          WASHINGTON – The Atlantic's warmer waters triggered the unusual number of major hurricanes last year, according to a new study that predicts the region could see a couple of extra whopper storms each year by the end of the century.Six major hurricanes — with winds of at least 111 mph (178 kph) — spun around the Atlantic last year, including Harvey, Irma and Maria which hit parts of the United States and the Caribbean. Since 2000, the Atlantic has averaged three major hurricanes a year. Before that the average was closer to two.It may go up to five to eight major hurricanes a year around the year 2100, according to a study in Thursday's journal Science .""We will see more active hurricane seasons like 2017 in the future,"" said lead author Hiro Murakami, climate scientist and hurricane expert at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.So far this year, though, only one Atlantic hurricane, Florence, has reached major status.Warm water acts as fuel for hurricanes. Water has to be at least 79 degrees (26 degrees Celsius) for a storm to form. The warmer the water, the more it can resist forces that would cause it to weaken, said University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy, who wasn't part of the study.Murakami found that a combination of natural conditions and man-made climate change made the waters warmer in one key area, which caused more major storms. That area is essentially a large box from south of Florida and north of South America, stretching all the way east to Africa.Some of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes form off the coast of West Africa, then chug west toward the Caribbean and the U.S. East Coast.Water in that large box — the main hurricane development region — averaged 0.7 degrees (0.4 degrees Celsius) warmer than normal for the entire 2017 season, which is unusual for a six-month time period, Murakami said.Murakami's study used computer simulations to isolate different climate conditions. Although his research showed both natural and human-triggered causes from the burning of coal, oil and gas, Murakami said he couldn't separate them enough to see which was bigger.He used the computer models to look into the future. The Atlantic is projected to warm faster than the rest of the world's oceans. That difference is why Murakami said the number of major storms will probably increase by two or more on average.Some outside experts had issues with parts of Murakami's study.McNoldy said it makes sense that the unusual warm water was to blame in 2017, but he wasn't quite ready to point the finger at global warming.""Hurricane seasons don't just keep getting more active as the climate warms though. There is enormous variability,"" McNoldy said in an email.Kevin Trenberth of the National Center for Atmospheric Research faulted Murakami's study for not taking into account the large increase in ocean heat in deeper areas, which he said is also due to climate change.Princeton University's Gabriel Vecchi said some computer simulations don't show the Atlantic warming fastest, so it's not quite as certain that there will be more major storms there in the future.___Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter: @borenbears .

          WASHINGTON – Hurricane Florence was the nation's second rainiest storm in 70 years, a top rainfall meteorologist calculated.Only last year's Hurricane Harvey rained more over a 14,000 square mile (36,260 square kilometers) area during a four-day time period, said Ken Kunkel, a meteorologist at the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration and North Carolina State University.Scientists said climate change likely boosted rainfall totals for both storms.Kunkel's preliminary analysis found more than 17.5 inches (0.4 meters) fell on average over five weather stations in the 14,000 square miles of the eastern Carolinas stretching from Fayetteville, North Carolina, to Florence, South Carolina. The amount is second to Harvey's 25.6 inches (0.6 meters).""That's a lot of water,"" Kunkel said.The third rainiest storm was in March 2016 in northern Louisiana and the seventh was in southern Louisiana in August 2016. The three rainiest and four of the top seven have all occurred in the last three years — which Kunkel said is no coincidence.Kunkel, who specializes in analyzing rain data from thousands of weather stations, based his work on rainfall since 1949 when recording became more widespread across the continental United States.Kunkel examined rainfall over a compact area — 14,000 square miles, a figure based on latitude and longitude squares — and larger areas such as 20,000, 30,000 and 80,000 square miles. Florence's unusual amount was most noticeable on the smallest scale.When the scientist looked at a bigger area, 20,000 square miles, Florence fell to seventh place, behind Harvey, 1998's Hurricane Georges, the two Louisiana rainstorms, a 1962 northern California downpour and a 1994 Texas drenching.The analysis has not been published or peer reviewed yet, but will be, Kunkel said.It is ""not surprising — but still terrifying — that the two top ranked soakers happened over the past two years,"" said Pennsylvania State University climate scientist Michael Mann, who wasn't part of Kunkel's research but praised it. He said warmer oceans, more moisture and slower moving storms due in various ways to climate change make storms dump more rain.___Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter: @borenbears .

          WASHINGTON – A warmer world makes for nastier hurricanes. Scientists say they are wetter, possess more energy and intensify faster.Their storm surges are more destructive because climate change has already made the seas rise. And lately, the storms seem to be stalling more often and thus dumping more rain.Study after study shows that climate change in general makes hurricanes worse. But determining the role of global warming in a specific storm such as Hurricane Florence or Typhoon Mangkhut is not so simple — at least not without detailed statistical and computer analyses.The Associated Press consulted with 17 meteorologists and scientists who study climate change, hurricanes or both. A few experts remain cautious about attributing global warming to a single event, but most of the scientists clearly see the hand of humans in Florence.Global warming didn't cause Florence, they say. But it makes the system a bigger danger.""Florence is yet another poster child for the human-supercharged storms that are becoming more common and destructive as the planet warms,"" said Jonathan Overpeck, dean of the environment school at University of Michigan. He said the risk extends beyond the Atlantic Ocean, such as Typhoon Mangkhut, which hit the Philippines on Friday.For years, when asked about climate change and specific weather events, scientists would refrain from drawing clear connections. But over the past few years, the new field of attribution studies has allowed researchers to use statistics and computer models to try to calculate how events would be different in a world without human-caused climate change.A couple of months after Hurricane Harvey, studies found that global warming significantly increased the odds for Harvey's record heavy rains.""It's a bit like a plot line out of 'Back to the Future,' where you travel back in time to some alternate reality"" that is plausible but without humans changing the climate, said University of Exeter climate scientist Peter Stott, one of the pioneers of the field.A National Academy of Sciences report finds these studies generally credible. One team of scientists tried to do a similar analysis for Florence, but outside experts were wary because it was based on forecasts, not observations, and did not use enough computer simulations.As the world warms and science advances, scientists get more specific, even without attribution studies. They cite basic physics, the most recent research about storms and past studies and put them together for something like Florence.""I think we can say that the storm is stronger, wetter and more impactful from a coastal flooding standpoint than it would have been BECAUSE of human-caused warming,"" Pennsylvania State University climate scientist Michael Mann wrote in an email. ""And we don't need an attribution study to tell us that in my view. We just need the laws of thermodynamics.""Georgia Tech climate scientist Kim Cobb looks not just at basic physics but all the peer-reviewed studies that especially link climate change to wetter storms.""We have solid data across decades of rainfall records to nail the attribution — climate change is increasing the frequency of extreme rainfall events,"" Cobb said.Several factors make scientists more confident in pointing the climate-change finger at Florence.For every degree the air warms, it can hold nearly 4 percent more water (7 percent per degree Celsius) and offer measurably more energy to goose the storm, scientists said.""The amount of water that comes out of hurricanes is certainly the most robust connection that we have,"" National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration climate scientist Jim Kossin said.And to look at Florence specifically, ""it's very likely that climate change has warmed the ocean such that the hurricane's intense rainfall is more destructive than without global warming,"" said Weather Underground Meteorology Director Jeff Masters, a former hurricane hunter.The warmer air and water also makes storms more intense or stronger, Stott said.A Kossin study this year showed that tropical cyclones — a category that includes hurricanes and typhoons — are moving slower and even stalling. Kossin said ""it's happening a lot more than it used to."" Several studies agree that climate change is to blame but differ slightly in their conclusions.With the emergence of Florence, some place in the U.S. has been drenched because of a stalled hurricane for four years in a row, storm surge expert Hal Needham said.Kossin and Overpeck also pointed to studies that show storms are intensifying more rapidly than they used to.Just like in Superstorm Sandy, scientists said it is clear that hurricane storm surge is worsened by sea level rise because the power of 6 to 10 feet of water comes on top of seas that were considerably lower decades ago. An extra 8 inches or so can mean the difference between staying dry or getting damaged, Masters said.In the Carolinas, natural and temporary climate factors added to the ""march upwards"" from global warning. Because of that, the seas have risen nearly 5 inches in five years, said Andrea Dutton of the University of Florida.Meteorologist Ryan Maue of weathermodels.com cautioned that observers should ""stick to overall trends around the world and not individual cases.""University of Miami hurricane expert Brian McNoldy said there are too many ever-changing factors that make it hard to blame climate change specifically.""If you are trying to make climate policy,"" Maue said Friday, ""you don't want to make it on a storm-by-storm basis.""___Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter: @borenbears .

          MIAMI – It's about the water, not the wind, with Florence making an extended stay along the North Carolina coast. Forecasters say ""it cannot be emphasized enough that the most serious hazard posed by the slow-moving storm is extremely heavy rainfall, which will cause disastrous flooding that will be spreading inland."" Officials also have confirmed the hurricane's first known fatalities.BY THE NUMBERS—Storm deaths: 4 fatalities confirmed—Intensity: Florence came ashore with top winds of 90 mph (145 kph), below the 111 mph (178 kph) threshold for a ""major"" hurricane but still extremely dangerous. It was downgraded Friday afternoon to a tropical storm with winds of 70 mph (110 kph) before its core slogged into coastal South Carolina hours later.—Still big: tropical-force winds extending out up to 175 miles (280 kilometers) from the center.—Heavy rains: Up to 18 trillion gallons falling on seven states over seven days, as much water as there is the entire Chesapeake Bay—So far: roughly 15 inches (38 centimeters) of rain have fallen north of Swansboro, North Carolina, and it's only going to get worse—Storm surge: up to 13 feet (nearly 4 meters), and seawaters could push inland 2 miles (more than 3 kilometers), depending on how long Florence lingers—Stalled: Florence was nearly at a standstill Friday afternoon, moving at just 3 mph (6 kph)—In the dark: about 890,000 outages, mostly in North Carolina, as of Friday evening, with Duke Energy anticipating 1 million to 3 million homes and businesses losing power—Protected: More than 19,000 people in shelters in North Carolina, 6,400 in South Carolina and 400 in Virginia—Populated coastline: 11 million Americans live in areas that were under storm watches and warnings—Grounded: nearly 2,400 flights canceled—Potential losses: estimated $10 billion to $60 billion in economic damages—Rescued: more than 400 people needed help in high waters in New Bern and Jacksonville, North CarolinaFACES OF FLORENCE Images captured by Associated Press journalists show last-minute preparations to secure homes and businesses and families settling into storm shelters as rain and storm surge began.STORM DEATHSPolice in Wilmington, North Carolina, tweeted that a mother and infant died when a tree fell on their house; the baby's father was injured. Officials also said one person was electrocuted in Lenoir County while plugging in a generator in the rain, and a man died after being blown to the ground while checking on his hunting dogs.BUSY TROPICS Typhoon Mangkhut slammed into the Philippines, ripping off tin roof sheets and knocking out power in an agricultural region of flood-prone rice plains and landslide-prone mountain provinces. In the Atlantic Ocean, the Azores could get gusty winds and heavy rains from Tropical Storm Helene this weekend, while Isaac regained tropical storm strength after earlier weakening in the Caribbean Sea.STAGGERING STATSPicture the entire state of Texas covered with roughly 4 inches (10 centimeters) of water: that's Florence's rainfall forecast over a week. Meteorologist Ryan Maue of weathermodels.com estimates Florence could dump about 18 trillion gallons (68 trillion liters) of rain. That's still less than the 25 trillion gallons (95 trillion liters) Hurricane Harvey dropped last year in Texas and Louisiana.FEMA RUMORSThe Federal Emergency Management Agency has set up a ""rumor control"" website to quash false information in Florence's wake. The page says service animals aren't barred from evacuation shelters, beaches shouldn't be used for sand bags, and evacuation orders aren't enforced by FEMA. It also responds to criticism about money diverted from FEMA to federal immigration authorities.SHIFTING SANDSIf Florence doesn't wipe out oceanfront homes on stilts along the Carolinas coast, rising sea levels will . Florence lashed low-lying barrier islands that experience some of the fastest rates of sea level rise observed anywhere in the world, nearly an inch (2.5 centimeters) a year.DAMAGE REPORTSThe city of New Bern, North Carolina , reported more than 1,200 911 calls in a 12-hour span, and roughly 4,300 residences and 300 commercial buildings damaged. That count is expected to rise significantly.TO THE RESCUE""WE ARE COMING TO GET YOU"" — that's what the city of New Bern, North Carolina, tweeted after hundreds of people needed rescue from rising waters from the Neuse River, and a TV station had to evacuate its newsroom in the middle of its hurricane coverage. The National Weather Service measured storm surge in New Bern at 10 feet (3 meters) deep.THE POWER OF WATERScientists can't say — yet — that climate change helped make Florence worse. But previous research has shown that the strongest hurricanes are getting wetter, more intense and intensifying faster due to human-caused warming. Sea level rise also adds to storm surge damage : When Hurricane Sandy hit in 2012, a study found sea-level rise over the 20th century caused more than $2 billion in additional damage in New York City due to the ""extra"" storm surge it generated.ESCAPING TO FLORIDAHurricanes usually drive people away from Florida, but Florence is making the Sunshine State into a refuge for people from the Carolinas. Cruise ships have diverted to Florida away from the storm's path, and some hotels are offering special discounts for evacuees.

A few experts remain cautious about attributing global warming to a single event, but most of the scientists clearly see the hand of humans in Florence.Global warming didn't cause Florence, they say. But it makes the system a bigger danger.""Florence is yet another poster child for the human-supercharged storms that are becoming more common and destructive as the planet warms,"" said Jonathan Overpeck, dean of the environment school at University of Michigan. He said the risk extends beyond the Atlantic Ocean, such as Typhoon Mangkhut, which hit the Philippines on Friday.For years, when asked about climate change and specific weather events, scientists would refrain from drawing clear connections. But over the past few years, the new field of attribution studies has allowed researchers to use statistics and computer models to try to calculate how events would be different in a world without human-caused climate change.A couple of months after Hurricane Harvey, studies found that global warming significantly increased the odds for Harvey's record heavy rains.""It's a bit like a plot line out of 'Back to the Future,' where you travel back in time to some alternate reality"" that is plausible but without humans changing the climate, said University of Exeter climate scientist Peter Stott, one of the pioneers of the field.A National Academy of Sciences report finds these studies generally credible. One team of scientists tried to do a similar analysis for Florence, but outside experts were wary because it was based on forecasts, not observations, and did not use enough computer simulations.As the world warms and science advances, scientists get more specific, even without attribution studies. They cite basic physics, the most recent research about storms and past studies and put them together for something like Florence.""I think we can say that the storm is stronger, wetter and more impactful from a coastal flooding standpoint than it would have been BECAUSE of human-caused warming,"" Pennsylvania State University climate scientist Michael Mann wrote in an email. ""And we don't need an attribution study to tell us that in my view. We just need the laws of thermodynamics.""Georgia Tech climate scientist Kim Cobb looks not just at basic physics but all the peer-reviewed studies that especially link climate change to wetter storms.""We have solid data across decades of rainfall records to nail the attribution — climate change is increasing the frequency of extreme rainfall events,"" Cobb said.Several factors make scientists more confident in pointing the climate-change finger at Florence.For every degree the air warms, it can hold nearly 4 percent more water (7 percent per degree Celsius) and offer measurably more energy to goose the storm, scientists said.""The amount of water that comes out of hurricanes is certainly the most robust connection that we have,"" National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration climate scientist Jim Kossin said.And to look at Florence specifically, ""it's very likely that climate change has warmed the ocean such that the hurricane's intense rainfall is more destructive than without global warming,"" said Weather Underground Meteorology Director Jeff Masters, a former hurricane hunter.The warmer air and water also makes storms more intense or stronger, Stott said.A Kossin study this year showed that tropical cyclones — a category that includes hurricanes and typhoons — are moving slower and even stalling. Kossin said ""it's happening a lot more than it used to."" Several studies agree that climate change is to blame but differ slightly in their conclusions.With the emergence of Florence, some place in the U.S. has been drenched because of a stalled hurricane for four years in a row, storm surge expert Hal Needham said.Kossin and Overpeck also pointed to studies that show storms are intensifying more rapidly than they used to.Just like in Superstorm Sandy, scientists said it is clear that hurricane storm surge is worsened by sea level rise because the power of 6 to 10 feet of water comes on top of seas that were considerably lower decades ago. An extra 8 inches or so can mean the difference between staying dry or getting damaged, Masters said.In the Carolinas, natural and temporary climate factors added to the ""march upwards"" from global warning. Because of that, the seas have risen nearly 5 inches in five years, said Andrea Dutton of the University of Florida.Meteorologist Ryan Maue of weathermodels.com cautioned that observers should ""stick to overall trends around the world and not individual cases.""University of Miami hurricane expert Brian McNoldy said there are too many ever-changing factors that make it hard to blame climate change specifically.""If you are trying to make climate policy,"" Maue said Friday, ""you don't want to make it on a storm-by-storm basis.""___Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter: @borenbears .

          WILMINGTON, N.C. – The big slosh has begun, and the consequences could be disastrous.Hurricane Florence's leading edge battered the Carolina coast Thursday, bending trees and shooting frothy sea water over streets on the Outer Banks, as the hulking storm closed in with 90 mph (135 kph) winds for a drenching siege that could last all weekend. Tens of thousands were without power.Winds and rain were arriving later in South Carolina, and a few people were still walking on the sand at Myrtle Beach while North Carolina was getting pounded. Heavy rainfall began after dark.Forecasters said conditions will only get more lethal as the storm smashes ashore early Friday near the North Carolina-South Carolina line and crawls slowly inland. Its surge could cover all but a sliver of the Carolina coast under as much as 11 feet (3.4 meters) of ocean water, and days of downpours could unload more than 3 feet (0.9 meters) of rain, touching off severe flooding.Florence's winds weakened as it drew closer to land, dropping from a peak of 140 mph (225 kph) earlier in the week, and the hurricane was downgraded from a terrifying Category 4 to a 1.But North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper warned: ""Don't relax, don't get complacent. Stay on guard. This is a powerful storm that can kill. Today the threat becomes a reality.""More than 80,000 people were already without power as the storm approached, and more than 12,000 were in shelters. Another 400 people were in shelters in Virginia, where forecasts were less dire.Forecasters said that given the storm's size and sluggish track, it could cause epic damage akin to what the Houston area saw during Hurricane Harvey just over a year ago, with floodwaters swamping homes and businesses and washing over industrial waste sites and hog-manure ponds.""It truly is really about the whole size of this storm,"" National Hurricane Center Director Ken Graham said. ""The larger and the slower the storm is, the greater the threat and the impact — and we have that.""The hurricane was seen as a major test for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which was heavily criticized as sluggish and unprepared for Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico last year.As Florence drew near, President Donald Trump tweeted that FEMA and first responders are ""supplied and ready,"" and he disputed the official conclusion that nearly 3,000 people died in Puerto Rico, claiming the figure was a Democratic plot to make him look bad.Schools and businesses closed as far south as Georgia, airlines canceled more than 1,500 flights, and coastal towns in the Carolinas were largely emptied out.Around midday, Spanish moss blew sideways in the trees as the winds increased in Wilmington, and floating docks bounced atop swells at Morehead City. Some of the few people still left in Nags Head on the Outer Banks took photos of angry waves topped with white froth.Wilmington resident Julie Terrell was plenty concerned after walking to breakfast past a row of shops fortified with boards, sandbags and hurricane shutters.""On a scale of 1 to 10, I'm probably a 7"" in terms of worry, she said. ""Because it's Mother Nature. You can't predict.""Forecasters' European climate model is predicting 2 trillion to 11 trillion gallons of rain will fall on North Carolina over the next week, according to meteorologist Ryan Maue of weathermodels.com. That's enough water to fill the Empire State Building nearly 40,000 times.More than 1.7 million people in the Carolinas and Virginia were warned to evacuate over the past few days, and the homes of about 10 million were under watches or warnings for the hurricane or tropical storm conditions.Homeless after losing her job at Walmart three months ago, 25-year-old Brittany Jones went to a storm shelter at a high school near Raleigh. She said a hurricane has a way of bringing everyone to the same level.""It doesn't matter how much money you have or how many generators you have if you can't get gas,"" she said. ""Whether you have a house or not, when the storm comes it will bring everyone together. A storm can come and wipe your house out overnight.""Duke Energy Co. said Florence could knock out electricity to three-quarters of its 4 million customers in the Carolinas, and outages could last for weeks. Workers are being brought in from the Midwest and Florida to help in the storm's aftermath, it said.As of 11 p.m., Florence was centered about 85 miles (135 kilometers) east-southeast of Wilmington, its forward movement slowed to 5 mph (7 kph). Hurricane-force winds extended 80 miles (130 kilometers) from its center, and tropical-storm-force winds up to 195 miles (315 kilometers).A buoy off the North Carolina coast recorded waves nearly 30 feet (9 meters) high as Florence churned toward shore.Scientists said it is too soon to say what role, if any, global warming played in the storm. But previous research has shown that the strongest hurricanes are getting wetter, more intense and intensifying faster because of human-caused climate change.Florence's weakening as it neared the coast created tension between some who left home and authorities who worried that the storm could still be deadly.Frustrated after evacuating his beach home for a storm that was later downgraded, retired nurse Frederick Fisher grumbled in the lobby of a Wilmington hotel several miles inland.""Against my better judgment, due to emotionalism, I evacuated,"" said Fisher, 74. ""I've got four cats inside the house. If I can't get back in a week, after a while they might turn on each other or trash the place.""Authorities pushed back against any suggestion the storm's threat was exaggerated.The police chief of a barrier island in Florence's bulls'-eye said he was asking for next-of-kin contact information from the few residents who refused to leave.""I'm not going to put our personnel in harm's way, especially for people that we've already told to evacuate,"" Wrightsville Beach Police Chief Dan House said.___Associated Press writers Seth Borenstein in Washington; Jeffrey Collins and Claire Galofaro in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina; Jennifer Kay in Miami; Gary Robertson in Raleigh, North Carolina; Sarah Rankin and Denise Lavoie in Richmond, Virginia; Meg Kinnard in Columbia, South Carolina; Skip Foreman in Charlotte, North Carolina; Jeff Martin in Hampton, Georgia; David Koenig in Dallas; Gerry Broome at Nags Head, North Carolina; and Jay Reeves in Atlanta contributed to this report.___For the latest on Hurricane Florence, visit https://www.apnews.com/tag/Hurricanes",1

          President Trump and California Gov. Jerry Brown have been at odds on a number of issues.

      (Fox News)California has positioned itself as the center of the Trump resistance...It’s bloody combat.LOS ANGELES – The Trump administration and lawmakers in California have seemingly been at odds from the day the president took office. Last weekend, their long-running battled moved to the seas.California Gov. Jerry Brown put his signature on two pieces of legislation over weekend that effectively ban the construction of any new offshore oil and gas pipelines in the state’s waters and thwart a Trump plan to open nearly 1.7 billion acres of coastal waters to drilling.“Today, California’s message to the Trump administration is simple: Not here, not now,” Brown said at the signing of SB 834 and AB 1775. “We will not let the federal government pillage public lands and destroy our treasured coast.”The new laws represent California’s latest strike against the Trump administration’s energy agenda and its moves to dismantle Obama-era climate regulations. Together, they continue a trend of state officials here working to combat the White House on everything from land use to immigration.“California has positioned itself as the center of the Trump resistance,” Jessica Levinson, a clinical law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, told Fox News. “It’s bloody combat.”Issues like sanctuary cities and other immigration-related matters have been front and center in the California-versus-Trump fight, given the president’s focus on cracking down on illegal immigration and building a border wall.But there is perhaps no other area where Brown and state Attorney General Xavier Becerra have been more effective at resisting the White House’s agenda than the environment.While California cannot directly block oil and gas drilling off its coast, the legislation that Brown signed last weekend aims to drive up the operating costs of these operations enough to make the effort unprofitable. The new law does this by blocking state land managers from permitting the construction of new pipelines, piers, wharves or other infrastructure projects necessary to bring oil and gas from offshore drilling sites to land.In a state where 69 percent of the population opposes drilling, according to a recent poll conducted by the Public Policy Institute of California, the new laws were praised by many conservation groups.“We are extremely pleased,” said Kim Delfino, the California program director of Defenders of Wildlife, according to The Mercury News. “The bills are intended to make it difficult to bring any new oil to shore, so it makes any new offshore oil drilling unlikely.""They put up a pretty significant obstacle. They don’t make it economically feasible for an oil company to do new drilling.”The legislation, however, also created some strange bedfellows, as it was panned by both oil industry insiders and some environmental groups, who called Brown a hypocrite.“Today’s announcement is incredibly ironic since Brown has refused every effort by hundreds of community groups to get him to slow the pace of new permits for oil wells,” 350.org co-founder Bill McKibben said in a statement.California banned offshore drilling in state waters out to three miles back in 1994 and there haven’t been any new platforms built in the last 30 years. But California is the nation’s third-largest oil-producing state, behind Texas and North Dakota, and there are still 32 offshore oil platforms and artificial islands in federal and state waters off the coasts of Santa Barbara, Ventura, Los Angeles and Orange Counties.Brown has himself approved more than 20,000 new drilling permits across the state since 2011 – although fewer than 1,500 of those have been issued in the last two years – and his previous gubernatorial campaigns have received hundreds of thousands of dollars from oil giants like Chevron and Occidental.Despite the cries of hypocrisy, California – under Brown and Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom – is dedicated to fighting back against the White House’s energy agenda.California already has a waiver under the federal Clean Air Act allowing it to impose tougher emission standards than the U.S. rules, which runs counter to the Trump administration’s move to roll back Obama-era rules focused on curbing greenhouse gas emissions. It is also one of 17 states suing the Trump administration over the rollback.As he prepared to host a summit of climate change leaders from around the world in San Francisco (starting Wednesday), Brown earlier this week also signed legislation phasing out electricity in the state produced by fossil fuels by 2045""We want others to do likewise, and if enough people often enough do what is needed we will curb global warming,"" Brown said during an interview with The Associated Press. ""But we're definitely at the beginning of what's going to be a long and difficult and contentious journey.""In filing suit against the Trump administration over emissions standards – and over the federal census, and over separation of migrant families, and over regulations on small business health insurance policies, and in more than three dozen other lawsuits – Brown, Becerra and other Democratic lawmakers in California are taking a page from the playbook of Texas Republicans.During the Obama administration, Texas filed so many lawsuits against the White House that the state Attorney General Greg Abbott, who is now the governor, joked that “I go to the office in the morning, I sue Barack Obama, and then I go home.”And with the demographics of California continually shifting in favor of the Democrats and the administration not looking to drastically shift its own agenda, experts say that the Golden State and the White House look to be at odds for the foreseeable future.“The marriage is broken and we’re in litigation right now,” Levinson said. “Neither side has any motivation to back down.”",1

""It's one of those situations where you're going to get heavy rain, catastrophic, life-threatening storm surge, and also the winds.""The National Hurricane Center Tuesday afternoon increased its rainfall forecast to 15 to 25 inches of rain and 35 inches in isolated spots. But a computer simulation known as the European model predicts some places could get 45 inches. Sound unlikely? It's the same model that accurately predicted that last year's Hurricane Harvey, which also stalled over land, would drop 60 inches.""It does look a bit similar to Harvey in a sense that it goes roaring into shore and then comes to a screeching stop,"" said MIT meteorology professor and hurricane expert Kerry Emanuel. ""This is not a pretty sight.""Florence is unusual in that it is aiming at the Carolinas from the east. Usually storms come to the Carolinas and mid-Atlantic from the south — and those usually curve safely out to sea.But a weather formation known as a high-pressure ridge is parked over the U.S. East coast, preventing Florence from doing the normal turn, said University of Miami hurricane expert Brian McNoldy.After Florence makes landfall, that ridge, now over Washington and New York, will move east — but be replaced by another one forming over the Great Lakes that will likely keep the storm stuck, McNoldy said.Florence's path remains uncertain. It may move a little north into Virginia or a little south into South Carolina. But it's such a large storm that the rain will keep coming down in the region no matter where it wanders. And with the Appalachian Mountains to the west, there could be flooding and mudslides, experts worry.Florence's large size — tropical storm force winds extend 170 miles from the center in all directions — means its fury will arrive long before the center of the storm comes ashore, Graham said.Some of Florence's behavior, both what has been seen so far and what experts expect, show the influence of climate change.Its expected sluggishness is becoming more common, possibly a result of climate change, said National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration climate scientist and hurricane expert Jim Kossin.The ocean waters that Florence is travelling over are about 2.7 degrees (1.5 degrees Celsius) warmer than normal, McNoldy said. Even normal water is warm enough for a storm to form there, but this adds to the storm's fuel and its rainfall. The air is holding 10 percent more water that can be dumped as rain.And the storm surge, which could be as much as 12 feet in some areas, will be on top of sea level rise from climate change.

          As Hurricane Florence churns toward the East Coast with catastrophic power, the storm has become a reminder of how vulnerable North Carolina's coast is.Vast amounts of new development now stand on the shifting sands of barrier islands there, amid the rising waters of climate change.Except for a few short stretches, the state is flanked almost entirely by those islands, which are susceptible to flooding and storm surges. Climate change and development are only making matters worse. North Carolina's governor has ordered a mandatory evacuation for the barrier islands.Here's a look at why North Carolina could be particularly hit hard and how climate change and development have made living on the coast even more risky.WHY IS NORTH CAROLINA SO VULNERABLE?North Carolina's coast is almost entirely made up of narrow, low-lying barrier islands. And a modern wave of tourist-driven development, including acres of pricey vacation homes, has been built in places where it probably should not have been.The Outer Banks stretch along the northern half of the state's coast and jut out into the Atlantic. But barrier islands also flank much of the lower part of the state. These islands are particularly vulnerable to storm surges and to being washed over from both sides.Development only makes the problem worse because communities replenish shorelines that are eroding or have been depleted by storms. As sea levels rise, barrier islands typically move toward the mainland over long periods of time. Holding them in place by artificial means only makes them more vulnerable.""You look out there and you think the shoreline is a fixed line in the sand, and it's not,"" said Laura J. Moore, an associate professor of geology at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill.""The sea level is rising and the shoreline needs to move with it,"" she said. ""By preventing islands from moving, we're ultimately leading to the diminishment and loss of the islands.""WHAT COULD HAPPEN?Florence could be the most destructive storm to hit North Carolina's coast since record keeping began, said Robert S. Young, director of the Program for the Study of Developed Shorelines, which is a joint venture between Duke University and Western Carolina University.The storm surge could surpass the one wrought by Hurricane Hazel in 1954, which was 18 feet above median sea level when it hit Sunset Beach near the South Carolina border.On the Outer Banks, new inlets could form while others are widened and deepened. The storm likely will blow water into the Pamlico and Albemarle sounds. As Florence churns back out, the wind could blow that water back over the Outer Banks.""We will once again kiss Highway 12 goodbye,"" Orrin H. Pilkey, a professor emeritus of geology at Duke University, said of the Outer Banks' main highway.Much of the mainland in eastern North Carolina is also likely to flood from heavy rains because the terrain is so flat and the water table is so high.But the damage likely won't be as catastrophic as Hurricane Sandy was when it hit New Jersey or other storms that have struck far more developed areas in places like Florida.""It's not a worst-case scenario for property damage,"" said Young. ""Many of these communities have tried to limit development. But there's still a lot of property value there. The damage still might be catastrophic on a North Carolina scale.""WHAT ROLE DOES CLIMATE CHANGE PLAY?Climate change is making a bad situation worse.Warmer waters increase the size and intensity of hurricanes. The storm season is longer. As sea levels rise, shorelines become more vulnerable. Water tables are higher, making coastal areas more susceptible to flooding.""A storm like this would have been massively destructive 100 years ago, even before we had that century of rising sea levels,"" Young said. ""And it will be significantly greater 100 years from now depending on what sea-level rise does.""Pilkey, of Duke University, said he hopes Florence offers people more motivation to retreat from North Carolina's barrier islands.""Sooner or later we need to get out of there,"" he said. ""We'll retreat now in a planned fashion. Or we'll retreat later in response to a catastrophe like the one that's about to happen.""___For the latest on Hurricane Florence, visit www.apnews.com/tag/Hurricanes .",1

          LOS ANGELES – The mayors of Paris and Los Angeles met Tuesday ahead of a global climate summit to memorialize the victims of the 9/11 attacks on the U.S. and to talk about the commonalities between the two cities in an increasingly divided world.Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo attended a 9/11 memorial ceremony in Los Angeles and then helped pack lunches for the hungry.Afterward, they spoke of how much Paris and Los Angeles have in common: an affordable housing crisis, increasing homelessness, a commitment to combat climate change, experience with terror attacks and preparations to host the Olympics next decade — Paris in 2024 and Los Angeles in 2028.""We always learn from each other,"" Garcetti said.Garcetti also announced Los Angeles will send a group of community college students from poor backgrounds to Paris next summer.""At a moment when we're so divided in the world we hope that this will breathe some strength and some friendship back into the world,"" Garcetti said.Hidalgo said Paris and Los Angeles also share the same core values and similar visions for the future, and both are planning for their Olympic games to help improve homelessness and increase opportunities for young people.""In Paris, the Olympic games, I saw that fight as very important because I am convinced that we need to help the poor neighborhoods in northern Paris a little more,"" she said in Spanish at a trilingual question-and-answer session with reporters. ""We have to help accelerate the transformation in these neighborhoods.""Garcetti said homelessness ""is the great moral crisis of this city and many cities.""While ""some people run away from these problems,"" Garcetti said he and Hidalgo run toward them, ""even in the face of people saying, 'I don't want this in my neighborhood.'""""We already have homelessness in our neighborhoods,"" he said. ""The decision is, 'Will we solve it or will we avert our eyes and walk away?' To me that is an easy decision.""Both mayors will join scientists, activists, celebrities and other politicians Wednesday at a global summit on climate change in San Francisco, where they plan to announce pledges from cities for more spending on cleaner energy.Hidalgo said climate change and homelessness ""are not two different issues,"" and both boil down to the greater good for humanity.",1
"BILLINGS, Mont. – Wildfires in the U.S. have charred more than 10,000 square miles so far this year, an area larger than the state of Maryland, with large fires still burning in every Western state including many that are not fully contained.Whether sparked by lightning or humans, fire has long been a force shaping the landscape of the U.S. West.Hot, dry winds can whip flames into firestorms that leave behind charred wastelands prone to erosion and mudslides. Other fires clear out underbrush, open the forest floor to sunlight and stimulate growth.Government agencies in recent decades effectively upended that cycle of destruction and rebirth. Fire suppression policies allowed fuels to build up in many Western forests, making them more susceptible to major fires.Those influences are magnified as development creeps ever deeper into forests and climate change brings hotter temperatures. Recent images of subdivisions ablaze thrust the power and ecological role of wildfires into the spotlight.A look at the environmental effects of wildfires:SMOKE AND RUINMost immediately fire brings destruction.Temperatures from extreme fires can top 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit — hot enough to kill all plant life, incinerate seeds hidden beneath the surface and bake the soil until it becomes impervious to rain.The lifeless landscape becomes prone to severe erosion, fouling streams and rivers with silt that kills fish and other aquatic life. Torrents of muddy debris following fires last year in Southern California killed 21 people and destroyed 129 homes.U.S. Geological Survey scientists say the problem is getting worse as the area burned annually by wildfires increases. A study last year concluded sediment from erosion following fires would more than double by 2050 for about a third of western watersheds.Smoke from this summer's Western wildfires — a potential health hazard for at-risk individuals — prompted the closure of Yosemite National Park for more than two weeks and drifted to the East Coast , according to NASA. Recent research says it also impacts climate change as small particles spiral into the upper atmosphere and interfere with the sun's rays.CLIMATE QUESTIONSScientists broadly agree wildfires are getting bigger in North America and other parts of the world as the climate warms. But still emerging is how that change will alter the natural progression of fire and regrowth.The time interval between wildfires in some locations is getting shorter, even as there's less moisture to help trees regrow. That means some forests burn, then never grow back, converting instead into shrub land more adapted to frequent fire, said Jonathan Thompson, a senior ecologist at Harvard University.""They get stuck in this trap of repeated, high-severity fire,"" Thompson said. ""Through time we'll see the California shrub land shifting north.""Similar shifts are being observed in Colorado, Wyoming's Yellowstone National Park and Glacier National Park in Montana, he said.The relationship between climate and fire cuts both ways. A longer fire season and bigger fires in the boreal forests of Alaska and Canada are burning not just trees but also tundra and organic matter in soils, which hold roughly a third of the Earth's terrestrial carbon, said David Peterson, a former U.S. Forest Service research scientist.The carbon enters the atmosphere and contributes to higher temperatures, leading to bigger fires that release yet more carbon.BIRD IN THE BALANCELife and property still top the list of priorities for firefighters, but in recent years another asset has been deemed worth extra protection in many Western states: a chicken-sized bird known as the greater sage grouse.Fires burned an estimated 3,240 square miles (8,390 square kilometers) of the bird's sage bush habitat in 2017 and have burned almost 2,400 square miles (6,215 square kilometers) so far in 2018.When sage brush burns, it's often replaced with a plant from Europe called cheatgrass, which crowds out native plants and is more prone to burning.That's challenging government efforts to keep greater sage grouse off the endangered species list, which could restrict economic development.Areas considered crucial to the bird's survival now get extra attention: A military-type Blackhawk helicopter is under government contract to deploy quick-reaction teams to snuff out sage brush fires in portions of Idaho, Nevada, Utah and Oregon.REGENERATIONA turning point in public understanding of the ecological importance of fire came in 1988 , when 1,240 square miles (3,200 square kilometers) of Yellowstone National Park burned.The devastation, punctuated by images of wildlife fleeing flames, fed into the perception of wildfires as a menace to be battled.The events drew criticism of the park's ""let it burn"" policy. Officials didn't immediately squelch lightning-caused fires that June because they did not pose an immediate threat to life or property, but eventually ended up deploying 10,000 firefighters.By that fall, seedlings already were emerging in some burned out areas. Park biologist Roy Renkin recalls a visitor reacting with surprise a decade later when he told her a thick stand of young trees emerging from a burned area had come back on their own.Lodgepole pines are commonly cited as an example of forest resiliency. The fire's heat releases seeds from the pine's cones.Several species of woodpeckers thrive on insects attracted to fire-killed trees. A plant called fireweed is specially adapted to take root in fire-damaged soils, multiplying rapidly and forming carpets of pink petals against a blackened backdrop.""It's isn't all death and destruction,"" Renkin said. ""These forests have evolved with fire.""___Follow AP's wildfire coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/Wildfires",1
"WASHINGTON – Hurricanes seldom get close to Hawaii and it's even rarer for one of the islands to take a direct hit.Hurricane Lane is already drenching and pummeling the island chain, even without reaching land.The last time a major hurricane hit Hawaii was in 1992 when Category 4 Iniki caused billions in damage. On average, the central Pacific hurricane region, which includes Hawaii, sees about four or five storms moving through, but that may be changing with global warming.A look at the hurricane season in Hawaii:WIND IS KEYUsually wind is what keeps storms from threatening Hawaii. Most eastern Pacific hurricanes form in the warm waters off Mexico and head west. But before they get too far, wind currents usually cause them to circle back toward the coast. The storms that stay a bit further south are the rare ones that make it to the central Pacific, said Princeton University climate scientist Gabe Vecchi.This year, those winds aren't quite steering storms back east. Add to that weaker than normal winds aloft — about where airplanes fly — that usually shred storms. Winds at that level would normally be 23 mph to 29 mph (27 to 47 kph). Now, they are less than half as strong, allowing storms to stay alive, explained Colorado State University hurricane scientist Phil Klotzbach.That also happened in 2014 and 2015, which were busier than normal years for storms getting close to Hawaii. There were four in 2015 and three in 2014, including Iselle, which hit the Big Island but was a weakened tropical storm.But the central Pacific is a big area and the islands occupy a small area, so most storms aren't likely to come too close.WARM WATERHurricanes are fueled by warm water. The water temperature in the region is about 2 to 3.5 degrees (1 to 2 degrees Celsius) warmer than normal, according to Vecchi. That was also the case in 2014-2015. ""We've come to learn that an unusually warm ocean in the subtropical Pacific will tend to increase the number of hurricanes around Hawaii,"" Vecchi said.The Pacific has more storms during a strong El Nino, a weather event that warms the water. Meteorologists expect an El Nino to form in the next couple months, but right now El Nino conditions are still more neutral than hot. Vecchi and others attribute the warming to a natural cousin of El Nino, with help from climate change. When it comes to hurricane activity in the central Pacific, warming from that north-south weather pattern is much more connected to causing more storms than east-west El Nino, Vecchi said.THE SEASONSo far this year, the entire eastern Pacific region, which includes the central region, is much more active with more storms, stronger ones and longer lasting ones than normal, Klotzbach calculated . On average, the region gets 15 named storms for the total season. Lane, which formed Aug. 15 far off Mexico, is already the 12th named storm and the second to get close to Hawaii. In contrast, the Atlantic region is running around its average for this point in the season, with stormy conditions slowing down recently. Storms get named when winds reach 39 mph (63 kph).August is the biggest month far for central Pacific hurricanes, compared to September for the Atlantic. The central Pacific hurricane season runs from June through November, just like the Atlantic. The eastern Pacific runs from May through October.CLIMATE CHANGEWhile climate scientists are reluctant to link individual weather events or even seasons to global warming, they can make the connections with elaborate detailed studies. National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration climate scientist Hiro Murakami, Vecchi and others studied the 2014 hurricane season around Hawaii and found it was ""made substantially more likely"" by climate change caused by emissions from burning coal, oil and gas, with a natural boost from El Nino.In a study last year, they also connected global warming to 2015's record number of major storms in the region, including three Category 4 hurricanes in the central and eastern Pacific at the same time. These studies are limited because of weak records of storms in the area before 1970, Vecchi said.WHAT'S AHEADMany climate studies recently predict that as the world warms, the globe overall and the Atlantic region will have fewer named storms but more intense ones. However, the central Pacific bucks that prediction.Several studies forecast that the central Pacific will become busier with more storms, stronger storms and faster developing ones, Vecchi said. A Murakami study used computer simulations to predict a noticeable increase in storms around the Hawaiian Islands.It's once again because of winds and water. The water in the region is predicted to warm faster than elsewhere around the globe because of a weakening of trade winds, Vecchi said.___Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter: @borenbears .

"Andrew Wheeler says the Affordable Clean Energy Rule sets guidelines for states to work with utilities, give states the authority to implement emission restrictions.The Trump administration announced new plans Tuesday to roll back and replace Obama-era regulations on emissions from coal-fired power plants – a move praised by the coal industry as a job saver but panned by critics as a green-light to polluters.The newly unveiled Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) Rule, as it’s called, would give states broad authority to determine how to restrict carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming. It’s meant as a replacement to the Obama-era Clean Power Plan that sought to speed up the closure of coal-burning power plants and cut back on greenhouse gases by cutting carbon dioxide emissions and encouraging utilities to invest in cleaner energy sources like wind and solar.“The ACE Rule would restore the rule of law and empower states to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide modern, reliable, and affordable energy for all Americans,” Environmental Protection Agency Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a statement. “Today’s proposal provides the states and regulated community the certainty they need to continue environmental progress while fulfilling President Trump’s goal of energy dominance.”The effort is part of Trump’s overall bid to roll back regulations and help the struggling coal sector in particular. He is likely to highlight the plan at a rally in Charleston, W.Va., Tuesday evening.While the Obama administration and Democrats saw the Clean Power Plan as a crucial component in international efforts to curb global warming, Republicans have long claimed those regulations went too far and were too costly. From the start of President Trump’s administration, his Environmental Protection Agency has been working to overhaul the program. “An important part of what we are doing here is getting us back in our lane -- we believe the CPP went beyond the EPA's legal authority in many ways,” EPA Assistant Administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation Bill Wehrum said during a press call on Tuesday. “We think we are on very firm legal ground -- much more so than the CPP was.”Without making a specific reference to the EPA proposal, Trump tweeted Tuesday that he’s “done so much for West Virginia” as he teased the rally, adding: “CLEAN COAL!!!!”The new plan would let states set performance standards for existing coal-fired power plants, providing them with a list of “candidate technologies” that can be used to draft their plans. The proposal would let states relax pollution rules for power plants that need upgrades, according to a summary reviewed by The Associated Press.Tuesday’s announcement was slammed by top Democrats and numerous environmental activists as a “desperate attempt” to save the flagging coal industry.""The proposed rollback of life-saving clean air and climate safeguards is unacceptable and exposes Wheeler’s EPA as a puppet of the very coal executives who used to sign his paychecks and want to pollute with impunity,"" Patrick Grenter, a Pennsylvania official with the Sierra Club, said in a statement. “This is another desperate attempt by the Trump Administration to prop up the dirty and obsolete coal industry, but it won’t work.”House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called ACE “a brazen special interest handout” in a statement.The EPA projects that the overhaul of the Clean Power Plan could cut regulatory compliance costs by up to $400 million per year, while also reducing CO2 emissions.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from the coal state of Kentucky, praised the Trump administration’s move, while taking aim at the Clean Power Plan.“This so-called ‘Clean Power Plan’ they dreamed up would’ve had no meaningful effect on global emissions,” McConnell said in a statement. “It would, however, have packed up middle-class American jobs and sent them overseas.”The EPA plans to hold a public hearing and accept public comment on the proposal for another two months.Combined with a planned rollback of car-mileage standards, the plan represents a significant shift from Obama efforts to fight global warming and shift away from coal and toward less-polluting energy sources such as natural gas, wind and solar power. Trump has already vowed to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement.Obama's plan was designed to cut U.S. carbon dioxide emissions to 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. The rule dictated specific emission targets for states based on power-plant emissions and gave officials broad latitude to decide how to achieve reductions.The Supreme Court put the plan on hold in 2016 following a legal challenge by industry and coal-friendly states, an order that remains in effect.Even so, the Obama plan has been a factor in a wave of retirements of coal-fired plants, which also are being squeezed by lower costs for natural gas and renewable power and state mandates that promote energy conservation.Fox News' Jennifer Bowman and Judson Berger and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",1
"LAS VEGAS – Climate change could be to blame for the collapse of bird populations in the desert along the Nevada-California border, scientists said.The number of bird species has fallen by an average of 43 percent over the past century at survey sites across an area larger than New York state, according to a new study by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley.The study shows almost a third of species are less common and widespread now than they once were throughout the region.The study's authors, Steven Beissinger and Kelly Iknayan, point to less hospitable conditions in the Mojave Desert as the probable cause.""California deserts have already experienced quite a bit of drying and warming because of climate change, and this might be enough to push birds over the edge,"" said Iknayan, who conducted the research for her doctoral thesis at UC Berkeley. ""It seems like we are losing part of the desert ecosystem.""""The Mojave Desert is now nearly half empty of birds,"" said Beissinger, a UC Berkeley professor of environmental science, policy and management. ""This appears to be a new baseline, and we don't know if it's stable or if it will continue to decline.""The researchers spent three years searching for birds at 61 locations on both sides of the border, including survey sites in the Spring Mountains and at Desert National Wildlife Refuge, just outside of Las Vegas, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported .They also surveyed sites across Death Valley and Joshua Tree national parks and Mojave National Preserve,Iknayan revisited the same sites UC Berkeley biologist Joseph Grinnell and his colleagues surveyed between 1908 and 1947.Iknayan and Beissinger found that areas with reduced rainfall lost more birds species than sites that remained wetter.Their findings were published earlier this month in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.Researchers are calling it a collapse because it has occurred across the entire desert bird community.""Studies elsewhere have found that climate change typically makes places unfavorable for some birds but opens the door for others to come in,"" Iknayan said. ""In the desert, we are not seeing increases in any of our species except for the common raven. There are a lack of climate change winners in the system.""___Information from: Las Vegas Review-Journal, http://www.lvrj.com",1
"As temperatures rise in the U.S. West, so do the flames.The years with the most acres burned by wildfires have some of the hottest temperatures, an Associated Press analysis of fire and weather data found. As human-caused climate change has warmed the world over the past 35 years, the land consumed by flames has more than doubled.Experts say the way global warming worsens wildfires comes down to the basic dynamics of fire. Fires need ignition, oxygen and fuel. And what's really changed is fuel — the trees, brush and other plants that go up in flames.""Hotter, drier weather means our fuels are drier, so it's easier for fires to start and spread and burn more intensely,"" said University of Alberta fire scientist Mike Flannigan.It's simple, he said: ""The warmer it is, the more fire we see.""Federal fire and weather data show higher air temperatures are turbocharging fire season.The five hottest Aprils to Septembers out West produced years that on average burned more than 13,500 square miles (35,000 square kilometers), according to data at the National Interagency Fire Center and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .That's triple the average for the five coldest Aprils to Septembers.The Western summer so far is more than 3 degrees Fahrenheit (1.7 degrees Celsius) warmer than the 20th century average. California in July logged its hottest month in 124 years of record-keeping.The five years with the most acres burned since 1983 averaged 63.4 degrees from April to September. That's 1.2 degrees warmer than average and 2.4 degrees hotter than the years with the least acres burned, AP's data analysis shows.In California, the five years with the most acres burned (not including this year) average 2.1 degrees warmer than the five years with the least acres burned.A degree or two may seem like not much, but it is crucial for fuel. The hotter it is, the more water evaporates from plants. When fuel dries faster, fires spread more and burn more intensely, experts said.For every 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit that the air warms, it needs 15 percent more rain to make up for the drying of the fuel, Flannigan said.Fuel moisture levels in California and Oregon are flirting with record dry levels, NOAA western regional climate center director Tim Brown said.And low humidity is ""the key driver of wildfire spread,"" according to University of Colorado fire scientist Jennifer Balch who says the Western U.S. soon will start to see wildfires of 1 million acres (1,562 square miles).Veteran Colorado hotshot firefighter Mike Sugaski used to consider 10,000-acre (16-square-mile) fires big, now he fights ones 10 times that or more.""You kind of keep saying, 'How can they get much worse?' But they do,"" Sugaski said.The number of U.S. wildfires hasn't changed much over the last few decades, but the area consumed has soared.""The year 2000 seemed to be some kind of turning point,"" said Randy Eardley, the fire center's chief spokesman.From 1983 to 1999, the United States didn't reach 10,000 square miles burned annually. Since then, 10 years have had more than 10,000 square miles burned, including 2017, 2015 and 2006 when more than 15,000 square miles burned.Some people who reject mainstream climate science point to statistics that seem to show far more acres burned in the 1930s and 1940s. But Eardley said statistics before 1983 are not reliable because fires ""may be double-counted, tripled-counted or more.""Nationally, more than 8,900 square miles (23,050 kilometers) have burned this year, about 28 percent more than the 10-year average as of mid-August. California is having one of its worst years.Scientists generally avoid blaming global warming for specific extreme events without extensive analysis, but scientists have done those extensive examinations on wildfire.John Abatzgolou of the University of Idaho looked at forest fires and dry conditions in the Western United States from 1979 to 2015 and compared that to computer simulations of what would be expected with no human-caused climate change. He concluded that global warming had a role in an extra 16,200 square miles (42,000 square kilometers) of forests burning since 1984.A study of the 2015 Alaska fire season — the second biggest on record — did a similar simulation analysis, concluding that climate change from the burning of coal, oil and gas increased the risk of the fire season being that severe by 34 to 60 percent.One 2015 study said globally fire seasons are about 18.7 percent longer since 1979. Another study that year says climate change is increasing extreme wildfire risk in California where wildfires already are year-round.Also, drought and bark beetles have killed 129 million trees in California since 2016, creating more fuel.Contrary to fire scientists, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke this week told Breitbart radio that ""what's driving"" increased wildfires is an increase in fuel. He said the government has ""been held hostage by environmental terrorist groups"" that oppose clearing dead trees that they say provide wildlife habitat. Zinke, however, has acknowledged that climate change was a factor in worsening wildfires.___Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter: @borenbears .

"LAKEPORT, Calif. – Twin Northern California blazes fueled by dry vegetation and hot, windy weather grew Monday to become the largest wildfire in state history, becoming the norm as climate change makes the fire season longer and more severe.The two fires burning a few miles apart and known as the Mendocino Complex are being treated as one incident. It has scorched 443 square miles (1,148.4 square kilometers), fire officials said Monday.The fires, north of San Francisco, have burned 75 homes and is only 30 percent contained.The size of the fires surpasses a blaze last December in Southern California that burned 440.5 square miles (1,140.8 kilometers). It killed two people, including a firefighter, and destroyed more than 1,000 buildings before being fully contained on Jan. 12.Hotter weather attributed to climate change is drying out vegetation, creating more intense fires that spread quickly from rural areas to city subdivisions, climate and fire experts say. But they also blame cities and towns that are expanding housing into previously undeveloped areas.More than 14,000 firefighters are battling over a dozen major blazes throughout California, state Department of Forestry and Fire Protection spokesman Scott McLean said.""I can remember a couple of years ago when we saw 10 to 12,000 firefighters in the states of California, Oregon and Washington and never the 14,000 we see now,"" he said.Crews did make progress over the weekend against one of the two blazes in the Mendocino Complex with help from water-dropping aircraft, Cal Fire operations chief Charlie Blankenheim said in a video on Facebook.But the other one is growing after spreading into the Mendocino National Forest.The complex of fire has been less destructive to property than some of the other wildfires in the state because it is mostly raging in remote areas. But officials say the twin fires threaten 11,300 buildings and some new evacuations were ordered over the weekend as the flames spread.A new fire erupted Monday in Orange County, south of Los Angeles, and prompted the evacuation of two canyons and some campgrounds as it expanded into the Cleveland National Forest. By nightfall, the fire had burned 4,000 acres (6 square miles or 16 square kilometers) of chaparral-covered hillsides and destroyed one building.Farther north, crews gained ground against a deadly blaze that has destroyed more than 1,000 homes in and around Redding. It was nearly halfway contained, Cal Fire said.The wildfire about 225 miles (360 kilometers) north of San Francisco started more than two weeks ago by sparks from the steel wheel of a towed-trailer's flat tire. It killed two firefighters and four residents and displaced more than 38,000 people.Officials began allowing some residents to return to their neighborhoods. But tens of thousands of others were still evacuated.The fires in Northern California have created such a haze of smoke in the Central Valley that Sacramento County health officials advised residents to avoid outdoor activities for the entire week.Another blaze that ignited last week has damaged a historic Northern California resort in the Stanislaus National Forest. The nearly century-old Dardanelle Resort has sustained massive structural damage, though the details were unclear, the Sacramento Bee newspaper reported.The rustic lodge 180 miles (290 kilometers) east of San Francisco is nestled in the Sierra Nevada mountains and offers cabin and motel rentals along with RV sites, a store and restaurant.The U.S. Forest Service reported that the fire crossed a highway Sunday evening, forcing crews to retreat from the fire's edge.The resort owners said in a Facebook post that ""at this point it has been confirmed that there is 'massive structural damage.' We are heartbroken and struggling with this news.""___Follow AP's wildfire coverage here: https://apnews.com/tag/Wildfires",1
"REDDING, Calif. – A fire that started in a rural community in Northern California underscored a new reality in the state when days later it suddenly roared through neighborhoods on the edge of the city of Redding: Urban areas are increasingly vulnerable to wildfires.In the last year, neighborhoods in the Northern California wine country city of Santa Rosa and the Southern California beach city of Ventura have been devastated.Hotter weather attributed to climate change is drying out vegetation, creating more intense fires that spread quickly from rural areas to city subdivisions, climate and fire experts say. But they also blame municipalities that are expanding housing into previously undeveloped areas.""There are just places were there should not be subdivisions,"" said Kurt Henke, a former fire chief in Sacramento who now serves as a consultant to fire organizations. ""We're not talking about a single family who wants to build a house in the woods. I'm talking about subdivisions encroaching into the wild land urban interface that put them in the path of these destructive fires.""Henke wants more funding from the state legislature to deploy firefighters to areas where conditions are ripe for fast-moving fires, so they can be respond quickly if a blaze breaks out.The fire that affected Redding — a city of about 92,000 people about 250 miles (400 kilometers) north of San Francisco — started Monday about 10 miles (16 kilometers) west of the city before sweeping Thursday through the historic Gold Rush town of Shasta and nearby Keswick. It then jumped the Sacramento River and took out subdivisions on the western edge of Redding.Redding sits at the northern end of the agricultural Central Valley, surrounded by a scenic landscape. It has a downtown with a theater and wine bar and homes spread out in subdivisions.Two firefighters were killed — one from the Redding Fire Department and the other a bulldozer operator hired for the fire. Hundreds of homes were destroyed and nearly 40,000 people were under evacuation orders.Like the fires in Santa Rosa and Ventura last year, wind was a major contributor to the blaze's spread.""It's ripping trees off the ground and throwing them across the street into homes,"" Chad Carroll, a spokesman for CalFire said Friday. ""That's pretty strange and unusual.""Calfire Director Ken Pimlott described the fire activity at a news conference on Friday as almost like a ""tornado.""""What we're seeing not just here in Shasta County but literally statewide, fires that are growing exponentially,"" he said.While touring Ventura County neighborhoods ravaged by fire last year, Gov. Jerry Brown said drought and climate change mean California faces a ""new reality"" where lives and property are continually threatened by fire.The state is experiencing longer periods of warm temperatures and dry conditions that are making major fires nearly a year-round possibility, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles.""What we're seeing with some of the most dangerous fires is that they're spreading quickly, burning very hot or producing their own weather,"" he said.Still, he agreed with other experts that say the destruction was also the result of more people living closer to fire-prone areas.""Over the years, we're putting more people in harm's way,"" he said. ""More people living in high fire risk areas than usual.""The fire in Santa Rosa in October 2017 destroyed nearly 2,700 homes, including in one neighborhood with expensive new subdivisions on a hillside at the edge of the city. The blaze in Ventura two months later destroyed more than 500 buildings.Jacque Chase, an urban planning expert at California State University, Chico, said U.S. government statistics show more homes are going up across the country in areas that sit on the boundary of urban areas and undeveloped land. That increases the risk of fires caused by human activity. It also means firefighters have to change their approach.""They have to deal with actually saving lives and saving property,"" she said.___Associated Press writer Sudhin Thanawala reported from San Francisco.",1

          (Copyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.)When President Trump announced his plan to pull the United States out of the Paris Climate Accords in June 2017, the howling cries from left-wing environmentalists could be heard across the globe.From Canada to China and throughout Europe, the world denounced the president’s decision as reckless and in contradiction to “settled science.” Without the Paris Climate Accords, they argued, Earth would soon find itself cascading off the global warming cliff.One year later, Earth is still here, as you may have noticed.And the U.S. economy – due in large part to the Trump administration’s commitment to deregulation and energy dominance – has continued to grow at breakneck speed. On Friday the federal government announced our nation’s gross domestic product grew at an annualized rate of 4.1 percent in the second quarter of this year – the highest growth rate in four years.On top of this good news, despite the warnings of gloom and doom from President Trump’s opponents, America is now the world leader in cutting carbon dioxide emissions. Yes, you read that right.According to a June report by BP – measuring global carbon dioxide emissions from the use of oil, gas and coal – the United States reduced its carbon dioxide emissions by 41.8 million tons from 2016 to 2017, marking the third consecutive year Americans’ carbon dioxide emissions fell.The United States’ carbon dioxide reduction is more than double the next closest nation included in the study, Ukraine. And the U.S. reductions are part of a larger, decade-long trend. From 2006 to 2016, BP reports the United States slashed its carbon dioxide emissions by about 12 percent.The recent drop in U.S. carbon dioxide emissions is the result of increased consumption of natural gas relative to other forms of energy production, renewable energy and a more efficient use of electricity.In the wake of America’s declining carbon dioxide emissions, the dire warnings issued by global warming alarmists have proven to be yet another example of environmentalists’ fear-mongering.One of those alarmists was Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who called President Trump’s decision to exit the Paris Accords a “devastating failure of historic proportions.”After world leaders from countries big and small also harshly criticized President Trump for choosing not to make Americans beholden to the United Nations, the leaders spent the rest of 2017 presiding over countries that emitted millions of tons of additional carbon dioxide – illustrating clearly the utter worthlessness of the Paris Accords.China, for example, increased its carbon dioxide emissions by 119 million tons from 2016 to 2017 – more than any other country in the world – despite its alleged commitment to the Paris Accords. Spain added more than 18.7 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions. France’s carbon dioxide emissions increased by 5.5 million tons.But it’s the Canadian government that might deserve the award for being the world’s biggest carbon dioxide hypocrite. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was critical of the Trump administration for its decision to leave the Paris Accords, saying in a statement that he was “deeply disappointed” by the “disheartening” decision.“Canada is unwavering in our commitment to fight climate change and support clean economic growth,” Trudeau said. “Canadians know we need to take decisive and collective action to tackle the many harsh realities of our changing climate.”So, after those bold words Canada cut its carbon dioxide emissions dramatically, right? Well, not exactly. In 2017 Canada emitted 17 million additional tons of carbon dioxide compared to its emissions in 2016.Perhaps the reason Canada, China, France, Spain and dozens of other Paris signatories added carbon dioxide emissions – while at the same time chastising America for working toward energy independence – is because the leaders of those countries know what skeptics of global warming alarmism have known for decades: The world is much better off with affordable energy than it is trying to combat a problem many scientists say doesn’t exist.Of course, Prime Minister Trudeau and the rest of the Paris cabal will never publicly admit it. It’s much easier to spend time in office boasting of their own virtue and lamenting the tragic individualism of the American way.H.

Europe suffered its deadliest fire in more than a century, and one of nearly 90 large fires in the U.S. West burned dozens of homes and forced the evacuation of at least 37,000 people near Redding, California. Flood-inducing downpours have pounded the U.S. East this week.It's all part of summer — but it's all being made worse by human-caused climate change, scientists say.""Weirdness abounds,"" said Rutgers University climate scientist Jennifer Francis.Japan hit 106 degrees on Monday, its hottest temperature ever. Records fell in parts of Massachusetts, Maine, Wyoming, Colorado, Oregon, New Mexico and Texas. And then there's crazy heat in Europe, where normally chill Norway, Sweden and Finland all saw temperatures they have never seen before on any date, pushing past 90 degrees. So far this month, at least 118 of these all-time heat records have been set or tied across the globe, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.The explanations should sound as familiar as the crash of broken records.""We now have very strong evidence that global warming has already put a thumb on the scales, upping the odds of extremes like severe heat and heavy rainfall,"" Stanford University climate scientist Noah Diffenbaugh said. ""We find that global warming has increased the odds of record-setting hot events over more than 80 percent of the planet, and has increased the odds of record-setting wet events at around half of the planet.""Climate change is making the world warmer because of the build-up of heat-trapping gases from the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil and other human activities. And experts say the jet stream — which dictates weather in the Northern Hemisphere — is again behaving strangely.""An unusually sharply kinked jet stream has been stuck in place for weeks now,"" said Jeff Masters, director of the private Weather Underground. He says that allows the heat to stay in place over three areas where the kinks are: Europe, Japan and the western United States.The same jet stream pattern caused the 2003 European heat wave, the 2010 Russian heat wave and fires, the 2011 Texas and Oklahoma drought and the 2016 Canadian wildfires, Pennsylvania State University climate scientist Michael Mann said, pointing to past studies by him and others. He said in an email that these extremes are ""becoming more common because of human-caused climate change and in particular, the amplified warming in the Arctic.""Climate scientists have long said they can't directly link single weather events, like a heat wave, to human caused climate change without extensive study. In the past decade they have used observations, statistics and computer simulations to calculate if global warming increases the chances of the events.A study by European scientists Friday found that the ongoing European heat wave is twice as likely because of human-caused global warming, though those conclusions have not yet been confirmed by outside scientists. The World Weather Attribution team said they compared three-day heat measurements and forecasts for the Netherlands, Denmark and Ireland with historical records going back to the early 1900s.""The world is becoming warmer and so heat waves like this are becoming more common,"" said Friederike Otto, a member of the team and deputy director of the Environmental Change Institute at the University of Oxford.Erich Fischer, an expert on weather extremes at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich who wasn't part of the analysis said the authors used well-established methods to make their conclusions.Georgia Tech climate scientist Kim Cobb said the link between climate change and fires isn't as strong as it is with heat waves, but it is becoming clearer.A devastating fire in Greece — with at least 83 fatalities — is the deadliest fire in Europe since 1900, according to the International Disaster Database run by the Centre for the Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters in Brussels, Belgium.In the United States on Friday, there were 89 active large fires, consuming nearly 900,000 acres, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. So far this year, fires have burned 4.15 million acres, which is nearly 14 percent higher than average over the past 10 years.The first major science study to connect greenhouse gases to stronger and longer heat waves was in 2004. It was titled ""More intense, more frequent and longer lasting heat waves in the 21st century."" Study author Gerald Meehl of the National Center for Atmospheric Research said Friday that now it ""reads like a prediction of what has been happening and will continue to happen as long as average temperatures continue to rise with ever-increasing emissions of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels.

"Conservative commentator Kurt Schlichter reacts to a bill proposed in California that would make it illegal for restaurants servers to give guests plastic straws unless requested.Sippers, beware.A California coastal city has become the latest municipality to ban plastic straws, enacting what is potentially the strictest plastic prohibition in the country.Santa Barbara earlier this month passed the ordinance authorizing hefty fines and even a possible jail sentence for violators who dole out plastic straws at restaurants, bars and other food establishments.According to the ordinance, violators on their first offense will be given a written warning notice. But the second time a purveyor of plastic straws defies the ban is when the heavy hand of the law could clamp down.In that case, the ordinance cites penalties from the city’s municipal code for a “fine not exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000), imprisonment for a term not exceeding six (6) months.”In comparison, Seattle, which in the beginning of July became the first major city in the U.S. to ban plastic straws, only fines businesses $250 per offense.It’s unlikely the maximum penalties would be imposed in Santa Barbara, but Assistant City Attorney Scott Vincent told Reason.com that criminal charges would be pursued after repeat violations and if there were aggravating circumstances.The Santa Barbara ordinance, which goes into effect in 2019, was supported by all but one city council member and comes at a time of growing concern over the problems that plastics cause for marine life.Santa Barbara bore a “trifecta of responsibility,” said Councilmember Kristen Sneddon, the Santa Barbara Independent reported, noting the city’s location along the coast, affluent population and status as a tourist destination.While the ban does have a few exceptions, it does not include one that many other municipalities have added: an exemption for the disabled.“All things considered, this new ordinance isn’t going to be making a real dent in the problem it’s intended to solve — but it could create some harm,” Katherine Timpf wrote in the National Review, adding that “straw bans could end up having a negative impact on disabled people who cannot drink without them.”The city joined a growing list of municipalities and private businesses to ditch the use of plastic straws.Coffee giant Starbucks made headlines earlier in July when it became the largest food and beverage company operating globally that will ban plastic straws from all its stores within two years amid environmental concerns. Plastic straws, which Americans use 500 million of daily, still are not a top contributor to the 8 million tons of plastic trash that flow into the world’s oceans yearly, according to National Geographic.Starbucks was quickly joined by Marriott International and American Airlines.On Tuesday, the board of supervisors in California’s second-largest city, San Francisco, gave unanimous approval to a measure banning plastic straws alongside carryout containers and wrappers treated with fluorinated chemicals.Supervisor Katy Tang called the negative environmental impact of single-use plastics astronomical.""San Francisco has been a pioneer of environmental change, and it's time for us to find alternatives to the plastic that is choking our marine ecosystems and littering our streets,"" she said in a statement.The legislation requires a second approval, which is expected next week, and the ban would go into effect July 1, 2019, along with a new requirement to make napkins, utensils and other to-go accessories available only upon request, unless a self-serve station is available where people can take what they need.The Associated Press contributed to this report. EDITOR'S NOTE: A previous version of this report incorrectly stated that plastic straws were the top contributor to plastic trash in the world's oceans. ",1
"LOS ANGELES – Officials say California greenhouse gas emissions have fallen below 1990 levels, putting the state well on its way toward meeting long-term goals to fight climate change.The state Air Resources Board announced Wednesday that pollution levels are down 13 percent since their 2004 peak — as the economy grew 26 percent since that year.The agency says greenhouse gas emissions dropped 2.7 percent in 2016 — the latest year available — to about 430 million metric tons. That's just below the 431 million metric tons produced in 1990.California law requires that emissions return to 1990 levels by 2020 and reach 40 percent below that marker by 2030. The Air Resources Board has broad authority to achieve those goals.Gov. Jerry Brown says California is setting — and meeting — ambitious targets.",1
"WASHINGTON – You don't just feel the heat of global warming, you can see it in action all around.Some examples of where climate change's effects have been measured:—Glaciers across the globe are melting and retreating, with 279 billion tons of ice lost since 2002, according to NASA's GRACE satellite. Jakobshavn Glacier in Greenland is flowing faster than any other glacier on Earth. In 2012, it hit a record pace of about 75 inches per hour (1.9 meters). In 2017, it slowed down to 40 inches per hour (1 meter). The Portage Glacier in Alaska has retreated so much it cannot be seen from the visitor center that opened in 1986.—In the Rocky Mountains, the first robins of spring are arriving 10.5 days earlier than 30 years ago. The first larkspur wildflower is showing up eight days earlier and the marmots are coming out of hibernation five days earlier, according to data gathered by the Rocky Mountain Biological Lab.—On average, during the past 30 years there have been more major hurricanes (those with winds of more than 110 mph), they have lasted longer and they produced more energy than the previous 30 years, according to an Associated Press analysis of storm data. Other studies have shown that the first named storm in the Atlantic forms nearly a month earlier than 30 years ago and storms are moving slower, allowing more rain to fall.—Across the globe, seas have risen about 3 inches since 1993. That doesn't sound like much, but it is enough to cover the entire United States in water about 9 feet deep. Places like Miami Beach, Florida, and Norfolk, Virginia, flood frequently with high tides.—The number of acres burned in the U.S. by wildfire has doubled compared with 30 years ago. Last year, more than 10 million acres burned. Over the last five years, an average of 6.7 million acres burned a year. From 1984 to 1988, about 2.8 million years burned, on average.—Allergies have gotten worse with longer growing seasons and more potent pollen. High ragweed pollen days have increased by between 15 and 29 days since 1990 in a swath of the country from Oklahoma City north to Winnipeg, Canada, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture study.—In the western United States the cute rodent called a pika needs weather around freezing for most of the year. But those habitats are shrinking, forcing them to higher altitudes. University of Colorado's Chris Ray, a pika expert, said she hasn't definitively linked climate change to dramatic reductions in pika populations, but she found that they have disappeared more from places that are warming and drying.—Extreme one-day rainfall across the nation has increased 80 percent over the past 30 years. Ellicott City, Maryland, had so-called thousand-year floods in 2016 and this year. Flooding in Louisiana, West Virginia and Houston in 2016, South Carolina, Texas and Oklahoma in 2015, Michigan and parts of the Northeast in 2014 all caused more than $1 billion in damage, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.—The number of polar bears in parts of Alaska dropped 40 percent since the late 1990s. When scientists have weighed polar bears recently in certain locations they were losing 2.9 to 5.5 pounds per day at a time of year when they were supposed to be putting on weight.—Warmer water is repeatedly causing mass global bleaching events to Earth's fragile coral reefs. Before 1998 there had been no global mass bleaching events — which turn the living coral white and often lead to death. But there have been three in the last two decades. U.S. government coral reef specialist Mark Eakin said for multiple reasons, including global warming, ""most of the reefs that were in great shape in the 1980s in Florida are just barely hanging on now.""___The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

"Berkeley's city council declares a 'climate emergency' and calls for stabilizing the population; #Tucker takes on political commentator Anushay Hossain.The Berkeley City Council on Tuesday night declared what it called a ""climate emergency"" with more global significance than World War II, and demanded an immediate effort to ""humanely stabilize population"" and ""reverse ecological overshoot.""The resolution, which invokes the global conflict between the Axis and Allies, charges that Americans bear an ""extraordinary responsibility to solve the crises"" facing the environment.""[D]uring World War II, the Bay Area came together across race, age, class, gender and other differences in an extraordinary regional mobilization, building and repairing Liberty ships, converting car assembly plants into tank manufacturing facilities,"" the resolution reads.A similar effort is necessary today to confront an even greater threat, according to the document.""[W]e can rise to the challenge of the greatest crisis in history by organizing politically to catalyze a national and global climate emergency effort, employing local workers in a mobilization effort building and installing renewable energy infrastructure,"" the resolution says.More than 60 million people died during World War II, according to most estimates -- a huge portion of the global population.But according to the Berkeley City Council, another thinning of the herd might be needed.The resolution notes that ""reversing ecological overshoot and halting the sixth mass extinction requires an effort to preserve and restore half Earth’s biodiversity in interconnected wildlife corridors and to humanely stabilize population.""UC BERKELEY CONVERTS HOMELESS, DRUG-USER HAVEN INTO STUDENT HOUSINGThe resolution, introduced in the ultra-progressive city by councilwoman Cheryl Davila, then invokes Pope Francis' comment that humanity is on the verge of global ""suicide"" and that ""God's creation"" is at stake.Davila's resolution also calls for a global climate summit in San Francisco in September and a push to ""educat[e] our citizens about the climate emergency.""The document's most substantial promise is for Berkeley to become a ""carbon sink"" by 2030 -- a term that means the city's greenhouse gas emissions will be in the negative.In addition to population control and a national mobilization effort, according to the Berkeley City Council, residents should avoid ""consumerism"" and ""narcissism.""",1

          Pope Francis meets a group of children who traveled on a special train from Milan and arrived at St. Peter's station at the Vatican, Saturday, June 9, 2018 as part of an initiative to give children living in disadvantaged areas of the country a day of joy.  (AP Photo/Andrew Medichini)
          (Copyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.)Pope Francis had a stern warning for global oil executives on Saturday: satisfying the world's growing energy needs ""must not destroy civilization.""During the two-day conference, which was a follow-up to his encyclical three years ago that called on people to save the planet from climate change and other environmental ills, the leader of the world's Catholics said the transition to less-polluting energy sources is ""a challenge of epochal proportions.""Participants included the CEOs of Italian oil giant ENI, British Petroleum, ExxonMobil and Norway's Statoil as well as scientists and managers of major investment funds. Their remarks on the first day of the closed-door conference were not released by the Vatican.""Civilization requires energy, but energy must not destroy civilization,"" he implored the assembled executives.VOLCANO CREATES NEW LAND AFTER LAVA FILLS HAWAII OCEAN BAYWhile Francis lauded the oil executives for embedding an assessment of climate change risks into their planning strategies, he also put them on notice for their ""continued search for fossil fuel reserves,"" two and a half years after the Paris climate accord ""clearly urged keeping most fossil fuels underground.""Energy experts and those who advocate fighting climate change expressed doubts before the conference that it would amount to anything other than a PR opportunity for the companies to burnish their image without making meaningful changes.In his remarks, the pope said he hoped the meeting gave participants the chance to ""re-examine old assumptions and gain new perspectives.""Francis said that modern society with its ""massive movement of information, persons and things requires an immense supply of energy."" And still, he said, as many as one billion people still lack electricity.
      Pope Francis told oil executives that they need to do more to mitigate the impact of climate change. In this June 4, 2018 photo, buildings under construction and finished buildings are seen in Boston's Seaport District. Some Seaport developers are building with climate change in mind, but others are not.
      (AP)The pope said meeting the energy needs of everyone on the planet must be done in ways ""that avoid creating environmental imbalances, resulting in deterioration and pollution that is gravely harmful to our human family, both now and in the future.""Frances also recalled his own appeal in the ""Laudato Si"" encyclical for an energy policy ""aimed at averting disastrous climate changes that could compromise the well-being and future of the human family, and our common home."" That includes transitioning to efficient, clean energy sources.""This is a challenge of epochal proportions,"" he said Saturday. ""At the same time it is an immense opportunity to encourage efforts to ensure fuller access to energy by less developed countries ... as well as diversifying energy sources and promoting the sustainable development of renewable forms of energy.""The pope called for specific commitments to combat climate change and provide energy security.He said it was ""disturbing and a cause for real concern"" that the levels of carbon dioxide emissions and the concentrations of greenhouse gases remain high despite commitments taken in the 2015 Paris accord to fight global warming.OIL LEAK DETECTED FROM HAWAII ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATORYHe urged the executives to use their ""demonstrated aptitude for innovation"" to address ""two of the great needs in today's world: the care of the poor and the environment.""  He noted that the poor pay the highest price for climate change, often being forced to migrate due to water insecurity, severe weather and an accompanying collapse in agriculture.""The transition to accessible and clean energy is a duty that we owe toward millions of our brothers and sisters around the world, poor countries and generations yet to come,"" the pope said.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

"WASHINGTON – Tropical cyclones around the world are moving slightly slower over land and water, dumping more rain as they stall, just as Hurricane Harvey did last year, a new study found.This isn't about how powerful a storm's winds are, just how fast it chugs along. Storms in the last few years — before 2017's Harvey — were moving about 10 percent slower globally than in the late 1940s and 1950s, according to a study published in Nature Wednesday. Storms worldwide in 2016 moved about 1.25 mph (2 kph) slower than 60 some years ago.In the Atlantic Ocean basin, the slowdown was not dramatic, just 6 percent. But when Atlantic storms hit land — like Harvey — the study said the slowdown is a significant 20 percent. Atlantic storms that make landfall moved 2.9 mph (4.7 kph) slower than 60 some years ago, it said.""The slower a storm goes, the more rain it's going to dump in any particular area,"" said study author James Kossin, a government climate scientist. ""Hurricane Harvey last year was a great example of what a slow storm can do.""Harvey, which killed at least 68 people, dropped a record 60 inches of rain in parts of southeastern Texas, according to the National Hurricane Center .Kossin started his research before the 2017 season, stopping his analysis at 2016. Adding last year's storms would have made the slowdown a bit more prominent, he said.Unhurried hurricanes also mean strong winds blowing more often over the same place and possibly more storm surge, Kossin said.The trend has all the signs of human-caused climate change, Kossin said. But the study did not look at causes by using computer models to simulate the Earth with and without warming. It is based solely on past observations, he said.Another study that came out recently, using computer models, concluded that future storm movements will slow because of climate change.Climate change is tinkering with and slowing down atmospheric circulation patterns — the wind currents that move weather along, Kossin said.Outside scientists were skeptical. That's mostly because data before the 1970s is not reliable so it is hard to make such conclusions, said University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy.Kossin acknowledged problems with pre-1970s data but said that most of it deals with how strong storms are. Older data on location, and thus movement, are more reliable, Kossin said.""Kossin is right that a 10 percent change in tropical cyclone motion would be an important change due to its effect on accumulated precipitation,"" Texas state climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon said in an email. ""I just need more convincing that there actually has been a 10 percent motion change.""___Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter: @borenbears .

"Administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency talks jobs, climate and President Trump's agenda on 'Fox News Sunday'One year ago, on June 1, 2017, President Trump boldly and courageously announced that the United States would withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement.This was a historic moment that upheld the president’s campaign promise and demonstrated to the world that he puts the American people first. The president’s decision, together with his decisive actions through regulatory reforms and tax relief, is unleashing the American economy.The unemployment rate has fallen to 3.9 percent – a low not seen since 2000. Since Election Day, the economy has added 3.3 million new jobs and wages are rising.The president’s actions rejected the misguided narrative that we must choose between protecting the environment and growing the economy. That is a false choice. And it is inconsistent with America’s environmental track record. We can do both, and we have done both – better than any other nation, in fact.The president’s actions rejected the misguided narrative that we must choose between protecting the environment and growing the economy. That is a false choice. And it is inconsistent with America’s environmental track record. From 2000 to 2014, we reduced our carbon dioxide footprint by more than 7 percent. More recently, the Energy Information Administration projects that from 2010 to 2018 total U.S. energy-related carbon dioxide emissions are falling by nearly 7 percent. In contrast, global emissions are increasing by 10 percent.We have also made incredible strides improving air quality throughout the nation over the past several decades. Since 1970, total emissions of the six criteria air pollutants regulated under the National Ambient Air Quality Standards established through the Clean Air Act have dropped 73 percent.These achievements are attributed largely to American innovation, such as highly effective pollution-control equipment, advanced production technologies, and increasingly efficient practices across all sectors of our economy.It is the genius of the free market, not burdensome government mandates, that has delivered this unrivaled accomplishment.The previous administration threatened to derail this progress through regulatory overreach. But President Trump’s actions ensure that we will continue to promote America’s energy independence and economic growth, while also protecting the environment.Under the commitments made by the prior administration, the Paris Agreement was estimated to put at risk as many as 2.7 million American jobs by 2025, according to NERA Economic Consulting.At the same time, the Paris Agreement imposed no serious emissions reduction obligations on China or India for many years. On top of this, the Paris Agreement would also require the United States to contribute billions of American taxpayer dollars in the coming years, with no clear benefit to hardworking Americans.President Trump understood that this was a bad deal for the American people.The president’s actions declared to the world that this administration will put the American people first. The days of Washington prioritizing the interests of other countries over the interests of the American people are over.Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, the Environmental Protection Agency has refocused on its core responsibilities of protecting human health and the environment.We are making tremendous progress on these fronts, including working cooperatively with states to improve air quality throughout the country, accelerating the cleanup of contaminated lands in the Superfund program, and incentivizing repairs to the nation’s water infrastructure.Our booming economy and improved environment are a uniquely American success story that should be recognized, celebrated, and replicated around the world. We owe no apologies to other nations for our environmental stewardship.President Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement was one of the earliest indications of his commitment to put America first. From regulatory reforms to tax relief, the president continues to take decisive action on behalf of hardworking Americans. America is stronger today because of President Trump’s actions.",1
"A church with a minuscule stake in Range Resources has won shareholder approval of a resolution to force Pennsylvania's largest natural gas driller to produce a report on its effort to scale back methane emissions.The Unitarian Universalist Association, which owns Range stock valued at about $2,000, sought to force the energy giant to produce a report that ""reviews the company's policies, actions and plans related to methane emissions management.""Range's board opposed the measure, saying the Fort Worth, Texas-based company already discloses that information to stockholders as well as to federal and state environmental regulators. A board statement that urged shareholders to reject the proposal archly noted that it was ""submitted on behalf of a stockholder who holds 130 shares.""Shareholders at the company's annual meeting on Wednesday approved the activist church's resolution by the slimmest of margins, giving it just over 50 percent of the vote. A similar measure offered by the church in 2014 was withdrawn after getting just 8 percent.Environmentalists hailed shareholders' change of heart.""This vote provides further proof that the public is increasingly concerned about the impact of oil and gas pollution,"" said Andrew Williams, director of legislative and regulatory affairs at the Environmental Defense Fund.The Boston-based Unitarian Universalist Association wants Range and other drillers to limit emissions from methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. It said Range had not provided ""adequate disclosure"" of its mitigation strategy. The resolution approved by shareholders demands that Range produce a report by September on its efforts to stop methane leaks.Range said it's not a significant emitter of methane and already takes steps to limit pollution.The company said in a statement on Thursday that it ""appreciates the perspective brought forward by the proposal creators, and looks forward to working together with them to further articulate the company's approach to emissions management.""Range pioneered drilling and fracking in the Marcellus Shale, an underground rock formation that holds the nation's largest reservoir of natural gas. It has nearly 1,300 active shale wells in Pennsylvania, the nation's No. 2 gas-producing state. Range earned $333 million on $2.6 billion in revenue last year.",1

          Chevron Corp's refinery is shown in Richmond, California August 7, 2012.
          (REUTERS/Robert Galbraith)Fifteen state attorneys general have filed a brief in federal court pushing back on a lawsuit by the California cities of San Francisco and Oakland that would punish oil and gas companies for their role in climate change.The attorneys general argued last week that if the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ruled in favor of the two California cities, it would likely cause broad, unintended consequences for cities and states across the country.A decision against the oil companies could require them ""to pay to build sea walls, raise the elevation of low-lying property and buildings, and construct other infrastructure projects necessary to combat the effects of global climate change,” according to the brief.“Such a remedy could cost several billion dollars and seriously impact [oil companies’] ability to provide energy to the rest of the country. The brief said any ruling in the case ""would be imposing limitations on commerce that takes place wholly outside California’s borders.”The Bay Area cities individually filed suit against five oil companies – BP, Chevron, Shell, ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil – last September. Several other cities and counties in California have followed, with similar legal moves. The suits don’t specify an exact dollar amount, but the long-term improvements of San Francisco’s seawall alone could be as much as $5 billion.“These fossil fuel companies profited handsomely for decades while knowing they were putting the fate of our cities at risk,” San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera said in a statement last September. “Now, the bill has come due. It’s time for these companies to take responsibility for the harms they have caused and are continuing to cause.”The San Francisco and Oakland lawsuits claim the oil giants created a public nuisance as heat-trapping gases emitted from their fossil fuels produced a rise in sea levels.“These companies knew fossil fuel-driven climate change was real, Oakland City Attorney Barbara Parker said. ""They knew it was caused by their products and they lied to cover up that knowledge to protect their astronomical profits.

They argue these types of lawsuits will not help address the environmental crisis.""Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a global issue that requires global engagement and action,"" Melissa Ritchie, a spokesperson for Chevron, said in a statement. ""Should this litigation proceed, it will only serve special interests at the expense of broader policy, regulatory, and economic priorities.""While plaintiffs have recently seen success in similar California courts rulings on public nuisance cases – a state judge ruled that paint companies were to be held liable for any damages caused by a lead based products – they have not seen such success on this issue.U.S. District Judge William Alsup denied the two cities’ request to move the case to state court – arguing the scope of the issue puts the matter in federal jurisdiction.",1

          Officials in Los Angeles are painting streets white to reduce the effect of urban ""heat islands.""
          (LA Street Services)California officials are hoping their latest attempt to stem the rising tides of climate change leads to a more socially conscious -- and cooler -- summer.Officials in Los Angeles have been painting streets white to reduce the effect of urban ""heat islands"" and combat the effects of climate change.The LA Street Services began rolling out the project last May, which preliminary testing shows has reduced the temperature of roadways by up to 10 degrees. The project involves applying a light gray coating of the product CoolSeal, made by the company GuardTop.""CoolSeal is applied like conventional sealcoats to asphalt surfaces to protect and maintain the quality and longevity of the surface,"" according to the company website. ""While most cool pavements on the market are polymer based, CoolSeal is a water-based, asphalt emulsion.""While each coasting could can last up to seven years, they are also pricey, with the estimated cost of $40,000 per mile, the L.A. Daily News reported.
      Each coating of CoolSeal is estimated to cost $40,000 a mile, city officials told the LA Daily News.
      (LA Street Services)CoolSeal does pass the California skid test in addition to the slip test for wet traction, and is applied in two coats, each 50 microns thick, over an asphalt roadway or a slurry-sealed asphalt roadway, according to the streets department.BOY, 13, FOUND ALIVE AFTER FALLING INTO LOS ANGELES DRAINAGE DITCH 'MAZE'By reducing the temperature of the city streets, officials say it can help reduce temperatures in the neighborhoods where the sealant is applied.With its numerous streets and freeways, Los Angeles suffers from the ""heat island"" effect, which causes urban regions to become warmer than their rural surroundings, forming an ""island"" of higher temperatures.
      The sealant has reduced roadway temperatures by up to 10 degrees in testing.
      (LA Street Services)""Heat islands occur on the surface and in the atmosphere,"" according to the Environmental Protection Agency. ""On a hot, sunny summer day, the sun can heat dry, exposed urban surfaces, such as roofs and pavement, to temperatures 50–90°F hotter than the air1, while shaded or moist surfaces—often in more rural surroundings—remain close to air temperatures.""Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, who may make a run for president in 2020, has used the project as part of an overall plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the city by 45 percent below 1990 levels by 2025.""Climate change is a fact of life that people in Los Angeles and cities around the world live with every day. It is a grave threat to our health, our environment, and our economy — and it is not debatable or negotiable,"" he said in a statement last year after President Trump said he would walk away from the Paris Climate Agreement.",1
"What to know about EPA administrator Scott Pruitt's announcement to scrap Obama-era fuel economy standardsEnvironmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt laid out plans on Tuesday to roll back Obama-era fuel standards in a move seen as a win for automakers, but one that is likely to ignite a major political and legal battle with the nation’s most populous state.“These standards that were set were inappropriate and need to be revised,” Pruitt said during a speech at the EPA in Washington D.C., adding that the rules are too expensive and hurt car buyers by making vehicles costlier.“The focus should be on making cars that people actually buy and that are efficient,” he said.Pruitt’s decision to rewrite the nation’s first carbon limits on automobiles, which requires cars and light trucks sold in the United States to average more than 50 miles per gallon by 2025, reflects both the power of the country’s automakers and the Trump administration’s determination to jump start the car industry.“This was the right decision, and we support the Administration for pursuing a data-driven effort and a single national program as it works to finalize future standards,” the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which includes General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler, said in a statement. “We appreciate that the Administration is working to find a way to both increase fuel economy standards and keep new vehicles affordable to more Americans.”The move, however, once again pits the Trump administration against the state of California.Under the 1970 Clean Air Act, California can set its own greenhouse gas emissions standards and has threatened to sue the federal government if its waiver is withdrawn and the state is blocked from imposing the more austere limits. A showdown between California and the Trump administration would have wide-ranging implications as currently 12 other states – making up more than a third of the U.S. auto market – follow the Golden State’s emissions standards.“The Trump Administration’s assault on clean car standards risks our ability to protect our children’s health, tackle climate change, and save hardworking Americans money,” California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement on Monday. “We’re ready to file suit if needed to protect these critical standards and to fight the Administration’s war on our environment. California didn’t become the sixth-largest economy in the world by spectating.”
      California Attorney General Xavier Becerra.
      (Copyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.)A coalition of at least 14 state attorneys general joined Becerra on Monday in calling the rollback “irrational and irresponsible” and vowing to “vigorously and aggressively challenge President Trump’s dangerous anti-environmental agenda in court.”While Pruitt did not specifically address California during Tuesday’s announcement, the administrator noted in a statement released Monday that the EPA would be reexamining California’s waiver and that “[c]ooperative federalism doesn’t mean that one state can dictate standards for the rest of the country.”“EPA will set a national standard for greenhouse gas emissions that allows auto manufacturers to make cars that people both want and can afford — while still expanding environmental and safety benefits of newer cars,” he added. “It is in America's best interest to have a national standard, and we look forward to partnering with all states, including California, as we work to finalize that standard.”The move by the EPA is the latest in a series of battles between the federal government and California, which has emerged as the staunchest opponent to the Trump administration’s policies. The EPA’s announcement of the rollback occurred on the same day the Justice Department sued California to block a new state law limiting the transfers of federal lands.""Yet again, Donald Trump and his administration are attacking our state and our very way of life,"" Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, a member of the State Lands Commission and a Democrat running for governor, said in a statement.The Trump administration also wants to make it easier to drill for oil and gas off California’s coast and last year’s tax overhaul law is seen as particularly harmful to the state as it limits mortgage interest and state and local taxes.Then there is the immigration debate, with the Justice Department suing California to overturn a state law that limits the power of federal immigration authorities and Trump recently calling the state “out of control” during a visit to view border wall prototypes.Pruitt’s announcement was originally scheduled for Monday at a Chevrolet car dealership in Chantilly, Virginia, but was cancelled. Guy Eberhart, the general manager of Pohanka Chevrolet, told Fox News that he had no knowledge of Pruitt planning to visit the dealership.",1
"NEW ORLEANS – The effects of global warming can be seen and touched in Louisiana, where officials have begun buying higher ground to relocate an entire town in a bayou being swallowed by higher seas.The Louisiana Office of Community Development announced Tuesday that it will spend $11.7 million on a 515-acre (208-hectare) tract of high ground to house about 80 residents of Isle de Jean Charles, an island that has lost 98 percent of its land area since 1955 as sea levels rise due to climate change. Most are Native Americans, members of the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Indians and the United Houma Nation.Groundbreaking is expected next year at the resettlement project near Schriever in northern Terrebonne Parish — the culmination of many years of planning for people who long survived in isolation along Lousiana's swampy coast.Some in Isle de Jean Charles are concerned that 2019 may be too long a wait for homes to be built at the location, however.""We're going to have to go through another hurricane season, maybe two,"" Albert Naquin, chief of the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Indians told NOLA.com/The Times-Picayune in December. ""That makes us very, very edgy.""Naquin did not immediately respond Wednesday to a request for comment from The Associated Press. Messages left for tribal council members of the United Houma Nation, which also is affected by the project, were not immediately returned.Isle de Jean Charles has been the full-time home to the band of the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw tribe for more than 170 years, since Native Americans were uprooted from better lands across the young United States during what became known as the Trail of Tears. Barred by law from buying land elsewhere, these families found swampland that the state considered uninhabitable and made it their home.In 2016, Isle de Jean Charles became the first community in the U.S. to receive federal assistance for a large-scale retreat from the effects of climate change. About $48 million was allotted to purchase land, build homes and move the island's remaining people.Pat Forbes, who directs the state's community development agency, said in a statement that a majority of the island's residents prefer the Terrebonne Parish site for what will become their new home.""This is not to say that they want to leave the island, but the island is, in effect, leaving them,"" Forbes said.The proposed resettlement is closer to stores, schools and health care and is less flood-prone than the island, which has been continually battered by hurricanes and tropical storms.""Unfortunately, coastal Louisiana is experiencing subsidence, relative sea level rise and coastal land loss faster than anywhere in the country. Fortunately, we're also on the leading edge of resilience-building approaches to adaptation, drawing on innovative science and technology right here in Louisiana,"" Forbes said.Louisiana hopes the resettlement will serve as a model for other coastal communities facing these same risks, but ""we also know success depends on due consideration of the island's history, as well as the needs of the residents,"" said Mat Sanders, the department's resilience policy and program administrator.The state agency hosted four community meetings for current and former residents of Isle de Jean Charles to collaborate on new community's design. The discussions included site preferences, budget considerations and off-island housing where residents can stay during the transition. A steering committee of residents and other stakeholders meets with the planning team each month to review the resettlement's progress.",1
"President blasts the agreement as 'unfair at the very highest levels'President Trump's pick to be the new secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, is not a fan of the Paris climate agreement, the treaty that claims it will slow global warning by reducing the world's carbon dioxide emissions. Politicians from most of the world's nations signed the deal, and President Obama said ""we may see this as the moment that we finally decided to save our planet.""That's dubious.Trump wisely said he will pull America out of the deal. He called it a ""massive redistribution of United States wealth to other countries.""Unfortunately, Trump often reverses himself.The climate change lobby has been trying to change Trump's mind. Al Gore called his stance ""reckless and indefensible."" Most of the media agree. So do most of my neighbors in New York.That's why it's good that Pompeo opposes the Paris deal. Such treaties are State Department responsibilities. Pompeo is more likely to hold Trump to his word than his soon-to-be predecessor Rex Tillerson, who liked the agreement.The Paris accord is a bad deal because even if greenhouse gases really are a huge threat, this treaty wouldn't do much about them.I'll bet Al Gore and most of the media don't even know what's in the accord. I didn't until I researched it for this week's YouTube video.Manhattan Institute senior fellow Oren Cass is the rare person who actually read the Paris accord.Cass tells me it's ""somewhere between a farce and a fraud."" I interviewed him for a video project I am doing with City Journal, a smart policy magazine that often makes the case for smaller government. ""You don't even have to mention greenhouse gases in your commitment if you don't want to. You send in any piece of paper you want.""The Paris accord was just political theater, he says. ""They stapled it together and held it up and said, 'This is amazing!'""The media announced that China and India made major commitments.In truth, says Cass, ""They either pledged to do exactly what they were already going to do anyway, or pledged even less. China, for instance said, 'we pledge to reach peak emission by about 2030.' Well, the United States government had already done a study to guess when Chinese emissions would peak, and their guess was about 2030.""In other words, China simply promised to do what was going to happen anyway.""China was actually one of the better pledges,"" says Cass. ""India made no pledge to limit emissions at all. They pledged only to become more efficient. But they proposed to become more efficient less quickly than they were already becoming more efficient. So their pledge was to slow down.""It's hard to see how that would help the planet.""My favorite was Pakistan, whose pledge was to 'Reach a peak at some point after which to begin reducing emissions,'"" says Cass. ""You can staple those together, and you can say we now have a global agreement, but what you have is an agreement to do nothing.""However, Cass says one country did make a serious commitment. ""The one country that showed up in Paris with a very costly, ambitious target was the United States. President Obama took all the zero commitments from everybody else but threw in a really expensive one for us.""Obama pledged to reduce emissions by 26 percent. If that ever happened, it would squash America's economy.Nevertheless, when Trump said he was leaving the Paris accord, he was trashed by politicians around the world.The UK's Theresa May was ""dismayed,"" and Obama said, ""This administration joins a handful of nations that reject the future.""Cass counters that if ""the future is worthless climate agreements ... we should be proud to reject.""Don't get me wrong: The Earth has been warming, and humans probably contribute to it.But the solution isn't to waste billions by making emissions cuts in America while other countries do nothing.Trump was right to repudiate this phony treaty. It's good that Pompeo is around to remind him of that.",1

          Sunset on Bali August 13, 2003
          Climate alarmism has become the chant of the media and liberals who favor more government regulations. As Chairman of the House Science Committee, I have challenged the alarmist rhetoric and pursued the facts about climate change.The Committee follows the scientific method, which welcomes critiques, avoids exaggerated predictions, and relies on unbiased data. Unfortunately, alarmists ignore all these principles.Those of us who subscribe to the scientific method by questioning assertions are wrongly labeled “climate denier.” So much for welcoming critiques.While I have never denied that the climate is changing, I have asked tough questions about how much the climate has changed and how much of an impact humans have had on the climate. Furthermore, I have supported technological innovation, rather than costly federal regulations and mandates, as the solution to a changing climate.On the other hand, climatologist Dr. Stephen Schneider has said, “…we have to offer up scary scenarios, make simplified, dramatic statements, and make little mention of any doubts we might have.” His message is clear: never express doubt and never accept any critiques. And the Los Angeles Times refuses to publish opinion pieces from anyone the paper deems a “denier.” The paper should present both sides of controversial issues, not just their side.Climate alarmists seek to silence those whose research raises doubts. Instead of claiming that “the science is settled,” alarmists should welcome new research that furthers the science of climate change.Instead of claiming that “the science is settled,” alarmists should welcome new research that furthers the science of climate change.Alarmists also violate the second tenant of the scientific method, avoiding exaggerated predictions.Since the late 1970s, climate scientists have told the American people that global temperatures would increase more than one degree Celsius by 2020. However, actual satellite temperature observations do not support these predictions. Observed temperatures were less than half as high as the climate models’ predictions. When the predictions are so far off, we should not make policy decisions based on them. Much more research into the complexity of changing temperatures is needed.Furthermore, the idea that anyone can make precise predictions of what kind of climate will exist 85 or more years from now is laughable. There is simply no way to take into consideration climate variables or technological breakthroughs.Commenting on the recent hurricanes, many climate scientists have tried to link these storms and climate change. But the historical record disproves them. Hurricane landfalls in the United States since 1900 are on a steady decline. The cost of damages from these storms, as a percentage of gross domestic product, is also shrinking. Even the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has affirmed that they have “low confidence” in climate change contributing to extreme weather.Examination of patterns of other extreme weather events in the United States shows that a changing climate does not increase the frequency of these events. For example, U.S. wildland fires are decreasing in frequency. The number of recorded fires in recent years is nearly one-fourth the number of fires observed in the 1970s. Climate alarmists just won’t let the facts get in the way of their science fiction.The third tenant of the scientific method, reliance on unbiased data, is violated by climate alarmists who present the American people with suspect data to advance a political agenda.For example, some claim that the Paris Climate Accord will reduce global warming by 1.5 degrees Celsius. They have barraged the American people with this falsehood to garner support for the deal. But MIT data shows that the agreement would decrease warming only 0.16 degree Celsius by 2100 – over 80 years from now – and only if all 195 countries completely abided by the agreement.While I am sure that the alarmists will continue to shout fire when there is none, I believe the American people will call their bluff and insist that the scientific method be followed. The way to address climate change is not by increasing regulations and taxes. The future lies with research and development. Forget the alarmists’ hysteria and look to technology and innovation to solve climate change challenges.",1
"California cities are learning the meaning of hypocrisy. They have sued Exxon and other energy companies for concealing the costs of climate change from investors and customers. But now these same cities have confessed to the markets that they have no idea whether the climate is changing and whether it will have any effect on their citizens.During the last year, Oakland, San Francisco, and several other California cities and towns took to the courts to set their own policies on global warming, even though no activity within their borders could make the slightest dent in worldwide temperatures.They filed lawsuits against Exxon and more than a dozen energy companies claiming that future rises in sea levels will literally erode property values.  They demand that the companies fork over millions to remedy this imminent economic calamity.Put aside for the moment the absurdity of pinning sole responsibility for the effects of climate change on a handful of companies. Climate change is a worldwide phenomenon to which human activity for decades, if not centuries, has contributed.  Scholars continue to argue how much global temperatures will change in the future, which conduct is responsible, and whether reducing it is worth the costs in reduced economic growth. Californians have certainly not restrained themselves in the cause of climate control: they have a love affair with driving, especially Angelenos, many of whom seem to hate public transportation almost as much as they hate “big oil.”Californians have certainly not restrained themselves in the cause of climate control: they have a love affair with driving, especially Angelenos, many of whom seem to hate public transportation almost as much as they hate “big oil.”Also put aside for a moment the factual errors in the municipalities’ suits. Exxon, in particular, has acknowledged the link between fossil fuel use and climate change, supported the Paris climate agreement, and even backed a revenue-neutral carbon tax (which we did not). Yes, it is a fossil fuel company but far from concealing the truth, Exxon has been more than willing to adapt to changing climate awareness.Can the lawsuits even show how much Exxon has individually contributed to changes in global temperature?  If San Francisco and Oakland are suing Exxon, why don’t they also sue every company in China and India?  The economic growth of these two developing giants no doubt has contributed far more to global warming than any American company or the United States in general.Instead, consider the hypocrisy laid bare this week in an Exxon court filing.  It points out that many of the California towns and cities took the exact opposite position in their municipal bond offerings.  When borrowing money, they took pains to insulate themselves from liabilities stemming from climate change when offering bonds to investors.  Some said they had no way to predict accurately risk related to rising sea levels or climate change or simply failed to mention such risks.  Apparently, these cities and towns believe it is better to tell the truth to the markets in New York City than to judges and jurors in court.For example, in its bond offering in 2017, Santa Cruz states, “Areas within the county may be subject to unpredictable climatic conditions, such as flood, droughts and destructive storms.” And yet, in its lawsuits against the energy companies, Santa Cruz declared with righteous certainty that there is a “…a 98% chance that the County experiences a devastating three-foot flood before the year 2050, and a 22% chance that such a flood occurs before 2030.”In its 2017 bond offering, San Francisco acknowledged, “The City is unable to predict whether sea-level rise or other impacts of climate change or flooding from a major storm will occur, when they may occur, and if any such events occur, whether they will have a material adverse effect on the business operations or financial condition of the City and the local economy.” But in its lawsuit, the city declared, “Global warming-induced sea level rise is already causing flooding of low-lying areas of San Francisco…”And this was even before smoking marijuana became legal in California.These contradictions only underscore the highly political origin and motivation of the city lawsuits. The plaintiffs’ lawyers include Matthew Pawa, long regarded as an innovative and entrepreneurial strategist when it comes to using the court room as a substitute for the legislature to advance climate change orthodoxy. It is no coincidence that Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro, a large plaintiffs firm based in Seattle, recently announced that it is expanding its environmental practice by acquiring the Pawa Law Group.  Municipalities likely welcome the chance to outsource the costs of litigation to firms working on a contingency basis. Rulings by environmentalist-friendly judges could mean a big pay day for all, giving new meaning to the “green” movement.In a petition filed in Texas court early this week, Exxon lays out the conflict between what the cities have told judges and what they have told the bond markets. Exxon is asking the court to require government officials to answer questions under oath about those statements. The case could have broad implications for the bond markets, as investors could have legal grounds to challenge the local governments for similar inconsistencies.  In the end, the cities’ mismanagement will come home to roost in higher borrowing costs and, ultimately, higher taxes for their residents.",1
"The growth of bitcoin is fueling speculation and debate about the environmental impact of the energy needed to power the virtual currency in the era of climate change. Some questions and answers about the issue:___WHAT IS BITCOIN?Bitcoin is the most popular virtual currency in the world, and it has fluctuated significantly in value over the past year. It was created in 2009 as a new way of paying for things that would not be subject to central banks that are capable of devaluing currency. The sustainability concerns about bitcoin, voiced by economists and environmentalists, stem from the process of ""mining"" that is central to its existence.The ""miners"" use computers to make complex calculations that verify transactions in bitcoins. This uses a tremendous amount of energy via computers and server farms all over the world, which has given rise to concerns about the amount of fossil fuel-dependent electricity used to power the computers. Some estimates say bitcoin's energy impact is more than that of a small country.___WHY IS BITCOIN ATTRACTIVE?Bitcoin is a kind of digital money that isn't tied to a bank or a government, and its value rose swiftly in the second half of 2017 before falling early this year. It's volatile. The value of one bitcoin was about $16,500 in late December 2017, compared with about $1,000 in March 2017, and then it dipped to about $7,700 in the first week of February this year. A bitcoin itself is essentially a line of computer code. It's signed digitally when it goes from one owner to another.___WHY ARE CRITICS CONCERNED ABOUT BITCOIN ENERGY USE?Bitcoin can't exist without computers, which can't exist without a source of electricity. And the number of computers and the energy needed to power them is rising.The growing value of bitcoin is directly tied to the amount of energy it uses. The miners unlock bitcoins by solving complex, unique puzzles. As the value of bitcoin goes up, the puzzles become increasingly more difficult, and it requires more computer power to solve them.Some estimates say more than 60 percent of the processing power used to mine bitcoin is in China, where it relies heavily on the burning of coal. The Chinese government revealed plans in January to shut down bitcoin mining, partly because of concerns about energy consumption.Coal and other fossil fuels are also the largest generator of electricity for the rest of the world, and coal is a significant contributor to manmade climate change. Burning it produces carbon dioxide, a gas that is a primary contributor to global warming.This reliance on fossil fuels has given rise to speculation that bitcoin's energy consumption will continue to rise as it grows in popularity.___HOW MUCH DOES BITCOIN REALLY AFFECT ENERGY CONSUMPTION?Estimates vary, and a true figure could be impossible to come by because of the intentionally anonymous nature of bitcoin use. But Dutch bitcoin analyst Alex de Vries, who operates a Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index on the website Digiconomist, has produced estimates he believes are alarming.If bitcoin miners are using the most efficient machines possible, the lowest amount of electricity they could possibly be using is 13 terawatt hours, de Vries said in an interview. That's about as much as the entire country of Slovenia. De Vries said less conservative estimates make it entirely possible that bitcoin is using as much energy as Ireland, which consumes about twice as much as Slovenia, or about 0.7 percent of the U.S. total.The problem is getting worse, said de Vries, who estimated the annual amount of energy consumed by bitcoin rose by a fifth in the final weeks of 2017.On the other hand, Oscar Lafarga, co-founder of a Fort Lauderdale, Florida, technology company that consults on cryptocurrency, said bitcoin's growth could spur interest in green energy.""In a way, it could be the driving force for breakthroughs on renewable energy,"" he said.In Iceland, an abundance of renewable energy from geothermal and hydroelectric plants has helped spawn bitcoin mining.___WHO IS RIGHT IN THE BITCOIN DEBATE?The extent of bitcoin's impact on the environment, and how much that should matter to people who use it, is a source of debate.While de Vries says bitcoin is consuming an ""insane amount of energy,"" both on its own and relative to older payment systems such as credit cards, others think the situation is not so dire.Bitcoin investor Marc Bevand, of St. Louis, has written that bitcoin likely uses close to four or five terawatt hours, less than the annual electricity consumption for Christmas lights in the U.S. He said that he believes bitcoin's benefits, such as making payments more efficient and helping people escape inflation, outweigh the environmental toll.However, he added: ""We don't have exact data to say how much we are benefiting from bitcoin.""",1
"BISMARCK, N.D. – An environmental activist from Seattle was sentenced Tuesday to serve one year in prison for targeting an oil pipeline in North Dakota.Michael Foster, 53, cut through a chain link fence and turned a shut-off valve on the Keystone pipeline in northeastern North Dakota on Oct. 11, 2016. His action was part of a four-state protest to draw attention to climate change and support demonstrations in southern North Dakota against the Dakota Access pipeline.A Pembina County jury last October convicted Foster of conspiracy, criminal mischief and trespass but acquitted him of reckless endangerment. State District Judge Laurie Fontaine sentenced him in Cavalier on Tuesday to three years in prison with two years suspended, $825 in fees and possible restitution. He'll be on probation for two years following his time behind bars.Samuel Jessup of Winooski, Vermont, who filmed Foster's protest, was sentenced Tuesday to two years of probation for conspiracy.Foster and Jessup were among 11 activists with the group Climate Direct Action who were arrested in North Dakota, Minnesota, Montana and Washington state the day of the protest. The activists broke into private property and turned shut-off valves at five pipelines that moved oil from Canada to the U.S.Foster said in an interview before his sentencing that he likely would appeal his conviction only if he received ""a pretty strict sentence of incarceration,"" which he defined as more than five years. He could have been sentenced to as many as 21 years, and Jessup up to 11 years.Foster noted that the pipeline he targeted leaked an estimated 210,000 gallons of oil in northeastern South Dakota a year later, and he said he's unsure how successful the coordinated protest was in promoting environmentalists' message of the dangers of fossil fuels.""Whether it's making a difference or not, I wish I could say more than a year later that we could see the ripple effect, but I'm not sure I see that,"" he said.Among the other protesters, Ken Ward, of Corbett, Oregon, was convicted in Washington last June of burglary and sentenced to two days in jail plus community supervision and community service. Leonard Higgins of Portland, Oregon, was convicted in November of criminal mischief and trespassing in Montana and awaits a March 20 sentencing.The Minnesota cases of Seattle-area residents Emily Johnston and Annette Klapstein are ongoing, with a state appeals court weighing a judge's decision to allow the two women to use the so-called necessity defense. The defense is popular among environmental activists who argue that global warming caused by fossil fuels is a greater harm than their actions calling attention to it, though legal experts say it's a long-shot defense. The judge didn't allow it in Foster's case.The other arrested activists, like Jessup, were accused of filming the vandalism. Prosecutors dropped charges against two of them in Washington. Trials are pending for two others in Minnesota and one in Montana.___Follow Blake Nicholson on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/NicholsonBlake",1
"The state's Democratic governor wants to tax residents every time they fill up at the pump, heat their homes and even when they plug in their electric vehicles; Dan Springer explains on 'Special Report.'SEATTLE – When President Trump was candidate Trump, he called climate change a hoax. Since taking the Oval Office, he’s said very little about greenhouse gasses and their impact on the planet. But he did issue a statement that he plans to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Agreement, which aims to reduce emissions as a way to stop global warming.But West Coast states are driving in the opposite direction, with designs of erecting a green wall built on taxing carbon.“This is both an economic benefit for the state of Washington and a job creator,” said Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat. “Jobs in the clean energy sector are growing twice as fast as the rest of the economy.”In Inslee’s State of the State address, he announced his plan to put a tax of $20 per ton of carbon emitted. The tax would go up 3.5 percent every year. The result will be taxing residents every time they fill up their tanks at the gas pump, every time they turn the heat on at their home and even when they plug in their electric vehicles.Businesses, like Boeing that compete internationally, would be exempt from the tax. The hit to residents and small businesses is expected to be $3.3 billion over the first four years. The money would go to so-called green jobs.Critics see it as a money grab that won’t have any impact on climate change.“You’re not just subsidizing clean energy or help to the environment,” said Todd Myers of the Washington Policy Center, a libertarian think tank, “you’re also subsidizing a big expansion in government bureaucracy, which does nothing to help the environment.”British Columbia was the first in North America to tax carbon in 2008. The results are mostly viewed as good. Emissions are slightly down even as the population and the economy grow. But BC’s policy has actually been more of a tax shift that’s revenue neutral. Higher energy costs to individuals and businesses have been offset by lower income and business taxes.California already has a cap-and-trade system, while Oregon lawmakers are considering what Democratic sponsors call Cap and Invest. It’s all an attempt to change behavior.“When you have pollution going up into the atmosphere for free, that’s a market failure,” said Kristin Eberhard of the Sightline Institute, “And a carbon tax corrects for the market failure within the market.”The fate of the carbon tax bills is uncertain in the Pacific Northwest. Meantime, there’s a similar movement forming in the Northeast. A bill in Massachusetts would also tax energy use, but residents would get a rebate at the end of the year, making it revenue neutral.

"WASHINGTON – With three strong hurricanes, wildfires, hail, flooding, tornadoes and drought, the United States tallied a record high bill last year for weather disasters: $306 billion.The U.S. had 16 disasters last year with damage exceeding a billion dollars, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Monday. That ties 2011 for the number of billion-dollar disasters, but the total cost blew past the previous record of $215 billion in 2005.Costs are adjusted for inflation and NOAA keeps track of billion-dollar weather disasters going back to 1980.Three of the five most expensive hurricanes in U.S. history hit last year.Hurricane Harvey, which caused massive flooding in Texas, cost $125 billion, second only to 2005's Katrina, while Maria's damage in Puerto Rico cost $90 billion, ranking third, NOAA said. Irma was $50 billion, mainly in Florida, for the fifth most expensive hurricane.Western wildfires fanned by heat racked up $18 billion in damage, triple the U.S. wildfire record, according to NOAA.Besides Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico, California, Colorado, Minnesota, Nebraska, Missouri, Illinois, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee and North Carolina all had more than $1 billion in damage from the 16 weather disasters in 2017.""While we have to be careful about knee-jerk cause-effect discussions, (many scientific studies) show that some of today's extremes have climate change fingerprints on them,"" said University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd, a past president of the American Meteorological Society.NOAA announced its figures at the society's annual conference in Austin, Texas.The U.S. averages six of the billion-dollar weather disasters each year, costing a bit more than $40 billion annually.The increase in billion-dollar weather disasters is likely a combination of more flooding, heat and storm surge from climate change along with other non-climate changes, such as where buildings are put, where people move and how valuable their property is, said Deke Arndt, NOAA's climate monitoring chief.""Perhaps it is time to mandate urban development in a more resilient and sustainable manner given the increasing frequency of weather extremes, especially along the nation's coasts,"" Susan Cutter, director of the University of South Carolina's Hazards and Vulnerability Research Institute, said in an email.The weather agency also said that 2017 was the third hottest year in U.S. records for the Lower 48 states with an annual temperature of 54.6 degrees (12.6 degrees Celsius) — 2.6 degrees warmer than the 20th century average . Only 2012 and 2016 were warmer. The five warmest years for the Lower 48 states have all happened since 2006.Arndt said the U.S. — which has had above normal annual temperatures for 21 straight years — is showing the same warming effects as the rest of the world. The burning of coal, oil and gas emits heat-trapping gases that change Earth's climate.This was the third straight year that all 50 states had above average temperatures for the year.Five states — Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and New Mexico — had their warmest year ever.Temperature records go back to 1895.___Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at @borenbears .

"At a U.N. conference in Germany, President Trump's top climate change adviser David Banks says the White House believes renewable energies alone are insufficient to meet the world's energy needs.A new study by Australian researchers says that data on how sea levels are rising, relied upon by the United Nations, was adjusted upward in “arbitrary” ways.The researchers examined sea level measurements in three locations around the Indian Ocean dating back to the 1800s and found that the raw sea level measurements showed no clear rise in sea levels.Their study was published in the journal Earth Systems and Environment, and it calls into question adjusted official data showing steadily rising sea levels – which most scientists say is caused by manmade global warming. The adjustments are done by the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL), which is funded by the United Kingdom government.The top graph in the following image shows the unadjusted sea level data in Mumbai, India, where each color represents a different set of measurements at the same location. The bottom graph shows the adjusted data:The study’s authors say this is evidence that the adjustments are biased.“The adjustments are always in the direction of increasing the alarm,” one of the study authors, Clifford Ollier, told Fox News. Ollier is a geologist and honorary research fellow at the University of Western Australia.“If the raw data show no alarming rise, and you want to create an alarm, you have to alter the raw data,” he said.The PSMSL did not immediately respond for a request for comment, but other scientists were critical of the study for citing too few locations and for being published in a low-tier journal.“I have some major concerns about the credibility of this study,” Kristina Dahl, a scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists, told Fox News.“It is very unusually written. ... This paper also appears to have been published just one month after being received by the journal, which is an astoundingly short time that calls into question the quality of the peer-review process.”The adjustments are always in the direction of increasing the alarm.The journal that published it is based in Saudi Arabia and is associated with King Abdulaziz University. It just started operating this year.“This specific journal is new but well above average,” said Albert Parker, one of the co-authors – a retired scientist and former automotive engineer who has written many papers on sea levels and also goes by the name Alberto Boretti.The authors say critics should evaluate the strength of their arguments rather than credentials or the publisher’s prestige.“If anybody wants to argue, they must argue with the facts; the place of publication is irrelevant,” Ollier said.Regarding the facts, Dahl says that the major data adjustments done by British researchers are understandable, given that the locations examined by the study had spotty measurement records spanning different measurement gauges.“There is a complete lack of measurements [in Aden, Yemen] between 1970 and 2010. ... In cases such as this, researchers have to try to fit the different data chunks together like pieces of a puzzle. You can imagine how difficult it is to infer long-term trends over the past 100 years when 40 years of data are missing.”She says other studies agree with the PSMSL adjustments: “At least one study using [approximately] 20 gauges in the northern Indian Ocean, for example, found that regional sea level rise rates were on par with the global average.”Sea level change varies a lot around the world. The U.N., relying in part on data from PSMSL, reports that worldwide sea levels rose over the last two decades by about a foot per century. However, the U.N. notes that some parts of the world, such as the coast of California, saw sea levels fall.Ollier and Parker say their study calls into question the accuracy of the established estimates on sea level rise, because the PSMSL and the U.N. say sea levels are rising in the Indian Ocean despite raw data like that in the image pictured above.Ollier agrees with the U.N. that world sea levels are rising on average, but thinks it is rising only half as fast (about half a foot per century), and says it might not be due to manmade climate change.Maxim Lott can be reached on Twitter at @maximlott",1
"NEW ORLEANS – Global warming's fingerprints were all over the record rainfall from Hurricane Harvey this year, confirming what scientists suspected, according to new research.While scientists say man-made climate change didn't trigger Harvey, new studies calculate that a warmer, wetter world made it at least three times more likely that the stalled storm over Houston would flood the fourth most populous U.S. city. Researchers also said global warming often goosed aspects of two other destructive hurricanes this year, Irma and Maria.Findings were discussed Wednesday at the American Geophysical Union meeting in New Orleans.The Harvey studies used a combination of established and new techniques. An international team used computer simulations and decades of past observations to estimate the odds for the record rainfall that came with Harvey over a period of three days in August with and without global warming. By comparing those two, they concluded global warming tripled the likelihood for the deluge, which reached more than 50 inches in one location.Based on Houston's weather history, researchers said a storm like Harvey would occur about once every 9,000 years.""Did climate change make this event more likely than in the past? Yes,"" said Karin van der Wiel of the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute.Another study by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory used computer simulations to analyze Harvey's downpours over a week and calculated that global warming increased rainfall by nearly 20 percent.Kevin Trenberth of the National Center for Atmospheric Research linked Harvey's downpours to the heat content in the ocean. Most of the heat trapped by greenhouse gases gets absorbed by oceans and that energy serves as fuel for hurricanes and other storms. The ocean heat content was record high in the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere before Harvey hit. If it had been lower, there would have been much less rain, he said.Changes in the jet stream — the rivers of air that steer weather — led to Harvey's stalling over Houston, unleashing rain, said Kerry Emanuel of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who presented two studies.While Emanuel wouldn't directly blame climate change on Harvey, he said destructive hurricanes will be more likely in a warmer world.""I think this is a window into the future. I think nature is giving us a foretaste of the future,"" Emanuel said in an interview.___Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at @borenbears. His work can be found here.",1

          The passes are selling for $40,000
          (iStock)Last June, President Trump announced he would withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Agreement climate treaty on greenhouse gases. It was a bold move, defying legions of foreign leaders, U.S. politicians, corporate CEOs, media pundits, and activist groups. But there is a faster way  to do it than he has chosen—and he should take it.December 12 is the second anniversary of the adoption of the Agreement, making this a fitting occasion to restate the obvious: remaining in the treaty endangers the U.S. economy, the Constitution’s treaty process, and the nation’s political independence.The bad effects stem from the fact that then-President Obama, aware the Senate was unlikely to approve the treaty, bypassed the constitutional ratification process and declared it to be an “executive agreement” instead.President Trump is certainly correct that Obama negotiated a bad deal in the process. Obama’s pledge to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 26-to-28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2025—the U.S. “nationally determined contribution” (NDC) in U.N. parlance—would have significant adverse impacts on U.S. jobs, household income, and economic growth.In contrast, China and India’s NDCs essentially “commit” those countries to follow their current emissions trajectory.Even if all 195 signatory nations implement their NDCs, the Agreement will have no discernible effect on climate change. For America, the Paris Agreement is great pain for no gain.The exit option President Trump selected comes from the Paris Agreement itself and takes four years to complete. His decision was also provisional, meaning America will withdraw—unless he can negotiate a “better deal” that is “fair.”In effect, Mr. Trump invited pro-Paris advocates to try to change his mind, and gave them lots of time for it.To be sure, other governments may be willing to accept drill-baby-drill as Trump’s new NDC so long as America pays them billions in “climate finance” foreign aid. Nonetheless, staying in the Agreement would still imperil vital U.S. interests.First, it would validate President Obama’s evasion of the Constitution’s treaty process—his approval of the pact without obtaining the Senate’s advice and consent.The Paris Agreement is a treaty by virtue of its potential costs to the nation as a whole, dependence on subsequent legislation by Congress, and other traditional treaty criteria.It is telling that virtually all other parties, including non-democratic regimes like China, ratified the Agreement through their legislatures. Obama’s collusion with foreign elites to adopt an unpopular treaty by deeming it not a treaty becomes a constitutionally-damaging precedent unless President Trump overturns it.Second, NDC promises are “non-binding” under international law, but that would make them harmless only if elected officials were immune to political pressure—a laughable idea—or balked at the harm they would cause.Governments honor their non-binding NDCs, however,  by turning them into binding laws and regulations. The Paris Agreement is  in reality designed to mobilize a permanent, global campaign to “name and shame” policymakers who fail to rig energy markets against fossil fuels.The Agreement effectively demands the suppression of America’s surging oil and gas production—a major source of new jobs, geopolitical strength, consumer savings, and competitive advantage.Why would any sensible person stay in a club organized to browbeat them into acting against their best interests and better judgment?Moreover, even non-binding commitments can create legal liabilities, as the Netherlands government discovered. Citing the government’s endorsement of non-binding declarations at previous U.N. climate conferences, the Hague District Court ordered Dutch policymakers to match deeds with words and adopt tough new emission controls. Further, membership in the Agreement fuels regulatory and tort litigation on behalf of alleged climate victims.In short, no revisions of Obama’s NDC can make the Paris Agreement safe for the U.S. But merely following the Agreement’s four-year withdrawal procedure would allow a new President to rejoin in 2021 and pick up where Obama left off. It would also do nothing to repair Obama’s breach of the treaty process.Mr. Trump should instead send the Agreement to the Senate for a ratification vote, with a recommendation that it be rejected. There is virtually no chance the requisite “two- thirds of the Senators present” would approve the treaty.After the Agreement dies in the Senate, it is also exceedingly unlikely a future executive would try to rejoin it unilaterally on the pretense that the “most ambitious” climate pact in history is not a treaty.So don’t follow the treaty’s rules, Mr. President. Follow the Constitution.",1

          (Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.)Backers of the United Nations-sponsored Paris climate agreement are switching strategies after the Trump administration’s withdrawal from the deal, by dramatically stirring up grassroots forces.Their aim: to keep greenhouse gases declining drastically despite the Trump setback by whipping up state and local promises to “roll back the forces of carbonization,” culminating in a Global Climate Action Summit in San Francisco next September -- just before the U.S. off-year federal elections.Business and social leaders also will be urged to join in, along with “scientists, students, nonprofits—anyone who recognizes that climate change is an existential threat to humanity,” according to the Climate Summit’s website exhortations.In other words, the climate movement is in the throes of acknowledging that it needs to renew its own energy—or, as the Summit website puts it, “underscore the urgency of the threat and channel the energy and idealism of people everywhere to overcome it,” just as top heavy U.N.-sponsored climate summits have tried to do several times in the past.The host of the San Francisco event, California Gov. Jerry Brown, has already vowed to regulate greenhouse gas emissions in California down to 1990 levels by 2020. His chief cohorts are former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, since 2014 the U.N.’s Special Envoy in charge of  mobilizing cities around the climate change issue, and Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the U.N. body sponsoring the Paris treaty.
      Former President Barack Obama, left, shares a laugh with Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel after Emanuel introduced Obama at a summit on climate change involving mayors from around the globe on Dec. 5, 2017, in Chicago.
      (AP)Quietly acting as “administrative fiduciary” for the event is the United Nations Foundation originally created by Ted Turner, which will “support the Summit’s fundraising, partnership and communications needs,” the Foundation told Fox News, and is already adding staff for the event.“More than just an event, the Summit will catalyze climate action through 2020 and beyond,” the Foundation promises in one of its Help Wanted advertisements.The catalyzing, in fact, is already starting this week, with a first-ever North American Climate Summit in Chicago of mayors from the U.S., Canada and Mexico—including nearly 400 U.S. mayors who have committed to the goals of the Paris Agreement, and who hope to encourage still more to join in.One of the keynote speakers on December 5 was former President Barack Obama, who hailed U.S. cities and states as the “new face of American leadership” on climate change. Obama set the U.S. target for the Paris accord of a 26 to 28 percent reduction in U.S. greenhouse gases by 2025, and unleashed a dramatic array of regulatory policies to try to make that happen.Former President Barack Obama hailed US cities and states as the “new face of American leadership” on climate change. Some of the most draconian of those measures, like the EPA-sponsored Clean Power Plan, are under review by the Trump administration and are certain to be scaled back.As a countermeasure, mayors at the Chicago meeting were invited to sign a Chicago Climate Charter, committing them to “addressing climate change at the local level,” and declaring that the gathered mayors’ reductions will happen “regardless of action taken by their respective federal governments.”Just how the promises made in Chicago will be enforced, or even monitored, and the cumulative impact they will have, is still fairly unclear.Nonetheless, the North American local politicians will be cheered on by a Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate And Energy, which says it is an “international alliance of cities and local governments” of all shapes and sizes—a heavy concentration are in Europe-- with a “shared long-term vision of promoting and supporting voluntary action to combat climate change and move to a low emission, resilient society.”U.N. Special Envoy Bloomberg, as it happens, is also one of the co-chairs of the Global Covenant Board. The vice chair is Christiana Figueres, who was the UNFCCC executive director before Espinosa, from 2010 to 2016.The top leadership of the grassroots movement, in other words, is something of a closed circle.More than anything else, the Chicago and San Francisco events, as well as others that doubtless will occur in 2018, are intended as much to rebuild flagging enthusiasm for climate change goals as to cause significant impact on the world’s carbon emissions.The problem for the Paris supporters is not merely the Trump Administration, but more the fact that the goals themselves currently appear far out of reach. .According to the most recent annual global greenhouse gas emissions report by the U.N. Environmental Program, issued last November, government pledges “cover no more than a third of the emissions reductions needed” under the Paris agreement.This, the report says, is “creating a dangerous gap, which even growing momentum from non-state actors cannot close.”And beyond that, the report says, “more ambitious” state commitments “will be necessary by 2020.” According to the assessment, “between 80 and 90 percent of coal reserves worldwide will need to remain in the ground, if climate targets are to be reached. This compares with approximately 35 percent for oil reserves and 50 percent for gas reserves.”Whether that would ever happen is a question that goes far beyond the U.S. and the Trump administration.In Germany, Angela Merkel’s anti-fossil fuel and anti-nuclear policies have become almost as unpopular in many circles as her controversial immigration policies were.  In Japan, anti-nuclear policies are leading to a major planned hike in coal-fired electrical plans.Canada, Mexico, South Africa and the European Union, as well as  the  now-dissenting U.S. were all deemed in the UNEP emissions report as  “likely to require further action” to meet their further carbon reduction targets for 2030.Moreover, the report adds, “it is currently unclear how many of the actions by non-state actors” are already included in those unsatisfactory national pledges.",1
"GATLINBURG, Tenn. – Bob Bentz had just installed underground utility lines and paved a new road when wildfires roared through the eastern Tennessee treetop canopy he wanted to transform into a $30 million adventure park.A year later, after the blaze killed 14 people and damaged or destroyed about 2,500 buildings in the Gatlinburg area, tourists now take a ski lift from downtown up 600 feet to the Anakeesta resort, where they can zip-line, shop, explore a treehouse playground and wander tree to tree on a sky-bridge. The otherwise whimsical park saved space at its highest point for a memorial walk, featuring photos and stories about the heroism, heartbreak and raw destructive force of the fires.Despite such somber reminders, Bentz is sticking with his plan and, like others, forging ahead, even after a National Parks Service report said the conditions that let flames burn into the city could become the ""new normal.""Climate change, the report concluded, has coupled with other factors to expose more areas like the Great Smoky Mountains foothills to wildfires. The report suggests a new level of vulnerability, with sweeping implications for some of the nation's most revered wilderness areas and the tourism economy that surrounds them.But Bentz and city and county officials are unconvinced. They say it's unlikely that Gatlinburg will again endure a perfect storm of factors that caused the blaze. Teens were playing with matches in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, winds whipped up to about 100 miles per hour to carry embers for miles and down powerlines to start more fires, and months of drastic drought created the perfect dry kindling.Other businesses are investing with the same confidence. A $35 million Margaritaville Resort is slated to open in Gatlinburg this spring. And two other hotels are already up and running since the fires.""I'm a believer in climate change,"" said Bentz, Anakeesta's managing partner, who has a forestry background. ""But I don't think we have concern about another fire coming to Gatlinburg and doing the same kind of damage.""Though downtown Gatlinburg was essentially untouched by the fire, and Sevier County was open for business quickly afterward, it cost an extra $1 million-plus in Gatlinburg advertising and more state money to convey that to travelers.It took a persistent campaign with simple messaging — ""If you want to help, come visit"" — to draw people back.Most of the damage in Gatlinburg was to residential buildings, and more than half of those were second homes or rental cabins, said Gatlinburg City Manager Cindy Ogle.""A lot of folks thought everything in Gatlinburg and Sevier County burned down,"" said Sevier County Mayor Larry Waters.Gatlinburg is bustling again along its downtown strip of candy kitchens, restaurants, shops, distilleries with moonshine tastings, mini-golf courses, old-time photo storefronts, and Ripley's Believe It or Not-brand attractions, including an aquarium.But there's also the occasional vacant lot along the winding mountain roads, with only the foundation of a torched home left behind.The area's tax revenues bolster its case for a comeback. Gatlinburg's gross tax receipts were down 36 percent in December 2016, right after the fire, compared to December 2015. This September's revenues were down only 2.4 percent compared to September 2016, before the fires.About 92 percent of Gatlinburg's destroyed properties have been cleared out ahead of the end-of-the-year deadline to do so, Ogle said. More than 500 rebuilding permits have been issued in the city and county, but at times it's been slow because there are only so many carpenters, plumbers and contractors, Ogle said.Waters, a 64-year-old who's lived in Sevier County his whole life, said the fires were nothing like anything he's experienced, and firefighters said it's the type of blaze usually seen out West. How climate change plays into it all, he said he doesn't know.Still, even though he doesn't think there will be a repeat of the fires, the region has to prepare for one, Waters said.Gatlinburg's flood warning system, which mainly reaches the downtown, is being expanded into other areas the fire torched. There will be an AM radio station for emergency purposes, and local officials won't have to get state emergency officials' approval to send mobile emergency alerts, which they weren't able to do last year because essentially all lines of communication went down.Additionally, Great Smoky Mountains National Park will undergo a $2.5 million radio communications system upgrade, seven local fire departments will receive radios and protective equipment, and an emphasis will be placed on clearing out dead and dying trees.Anakeesta, which opened in September, has another $8 million in projects in the works, including a scenic restaurant, mountain coaster and an amphitheater.Bentz cleared out plenty of dead trees after the fire, revealing a sprawling view of the mountains and Gatlinburg below that he hadn't planned for.The charred-black trees that were kept standing to line the memorial walk say plenty about what has happened there, Bentz said.""It remembers what happened and the loss that occurred, but it also remembers, I think, the generation of new life coming back,"" Bentz said.",1
"WASHINGTON – The chances of a hurricane flooding parts of Texas, like Harvey did, have soared sixfold in just 25 years because of global warming and will likely triple once again before the end of the century, a new study says.Study author Kerry Emanuel, a meteorology professor and hurricane expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, found that what was once an extremely rare event — 20 inches of rain over a large area of Texas — could soon be almost common.From 1981 to 2000, the probability of 20 inches of rain happening somewhere over a large chunk of Texas was 1 in 100 or even less, Emanuel said. Now it's 6 in 100 and by 2081, those odds will be 18 in 100, he said.""The changes in probabilities are because of global warming,"" Emanuel said.The study was released Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.Emanuel said he hurried the study to help Houston officials think about what conditions they should consider when they rebuild.Texas state climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon said he was struck by the potential for much higher rainfall that Emanuel's simulations predict for the future and how important it is for the design of critical structures like dams and nuclear facilities.""If the worst-case precipitation scenario is getting worse, as Kerry's study and other evidence implies, that safety margin is shrinking,"" Nielsen-Gammon said in an email, highlighting Emanuel's results that also show the worst-case storms becoming wetter and more common.Gabriel Vecchi, a climate scientist at Princeton who wasn't part of the study, said the study confirms what scientists have already thought: ""that the most extreme rainfall events will become more likely as the planet warms.""""These results highlight the importance of finding ways to incorporate our understanding of climate change in long-term urban planning, storm water management and in flood mapping,"" Vecchi said in an email.To do the study Emanuel had to use some innovative modeling techniques. Global climate models used for future warming studies aren't detailed enough to simulate hurricanes. Hurricane models don't say anything about the larger climate. So Emanuel combined the models and then created thousands and thousands of fictional storm ""seedlings"" to see what would happen.Emanuel's calculations used the 20-inch (half a meter) rainfall total because that was the initial figure discussed as the storm was dying down.Later measurements showed that Harvey's rain was far heavier — and far rarer — than initially reported. After Emanuel had started his work, records showed Harvey's Houston-wide rainfall ended up closer to 33 inches (84 centimeters). And in individual areas pit peaked at 60 inches (1.5 meters).Emanuel called those numbers ""biblical.""""By the standards of the average climate during 1981-2000, Harvey's rainfall in Houston was 'biblical' in the sense that it likely occurred around once since the Old Testament was written,"" Emanuel's study said.While several scientists praised the study's technique, Christopher Landsea, science operations chief at the National Hurricane Center, had some reservations. He said Emanuel's results don't fit with other climate change model projections which do show higher rainfall totals but also show a decrease in the number of storms.",1

"HOBOKEN, N.J. – Superstorm Sandy and a series of lesser coastal storms since that 2012 disaster compelled some coastal communities to defend themselves by elevating homes and critical infrastructure, building sand dunes, widening beaches and erecting or raising sea walls.But as sea levels continue to rise around the world, that's not an option in large cities, where skyscrapers can't be elevated and subway and train tunnels act as turbocharged flumes when millions of gallons of stormwater rush through them.The answer, some cities have decided, is a mixture of hard and soft barriers; green infrastructure to capture rain and absorb storm water; temporary storage space for runoff; and drastically increased pumping measures.Here's a look at some steps being taken by cities around the world to address the issue:___LOS ANGELESIn addition to physical barriers and widened beaches, Los Angeles is planting trees and paving some roads with cooler surface material so that less heat is reflected. They and other cities have also baked sustainability and resiliency concerns into municipal polices on development.""It's a challenge and an opportunity at the same time,"" said Matt Petersen, who served as the city's chief sustainability officer until earlier this year. ""Infrastructure and buildings are vulnerable to sea level rise. We can't solely build our way out this this, but we can take steps to mitigate it long term. There are 150 million Americans that are vulnerable to sea level rise, and cities need to address that.""The Port of Los Angeles recently added 6 inches (152mm) to the height of its proposed Wilmington Waterfront Promenade to compensate for anticipated sea level rise.___BALTIMOREBaltimore requires new construction to have an additional two feet of elevation, and some existing buildings have been raised. The city uses bulkheads, and is integrating parks into green space flood-absorption areas. It is considering protective walls for certain vulnerable parts of the city.___LONDONLondon is protected in part by a flood gate on the Thames River that can block exceptionally high tides or storm surges from the North Sea. Storm defenses were elevated for 11 miles (17.7 km) of the riverfront.___SHANGHAI and WUHANFlood gates and levees help protect the Chinese city of Shanghai. Elsewhere in China, the city of Wuhan is undergoing a test project to make it a ""sponge city"" capable of absorbing rain through a variety of green methods, including capturing stormwater and using it for its own water needs.___Follow Wayne Parry at http://twitter.com/WayneParryAC",1
"NEW YORK – Within the next three decades, floods that used to strike the New York City area only once every 500 years could occur every five years, according to a new scientific study released just days before the fifth anniversary of Superstorm Sandy.The study, performed by researchers at several universities and published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, primarily blames the predicted change on sea-level rise caused by global warming.""This is kind of a warning,"" said Andra Garner, a Rutgers University scientist and study co-author. ""How are we going to protect our coastal infrastructure?""The researchers based their analysis on multiple models that factored in predictions for sea level rise and possible changes in the path of future hurricanes.Many of the models had a dose of good news for the nation's largest city: Climate changes may mean that storms are more violent, but are also likely to swing further off-shore, meaning storm surge heights aren't likely to increase substantially through 2300.However, rising sea levels could mean that floods of 7.4 feet (2.25 meters) or more that struck the New York city area roughly once every 500 years before 1800, and which occur roughly every 25 years now, could happen once every five years between 2030 and 2045.Researchers made no recommendations on what public officials or others should do to prepare.""The idea is this kind of study we hope will provide information that people making those kinds of decisions can use,"" Garner said. ""We know that when Sandy hit in 2012, of course, subways, tunnels flooded, power was knocked out, parts of the city were just really devastated so studies like this provide some warning.""Other researchers included scientists from Penn State University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Princeton University, Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, the University of Massachusetts Amherst and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.The researchers said there is scientific consensus that global sea level will rise in the coming centuries, although it is not certain how high. They cautioned that sea-level rise at New York City could exceed 8 feet by the end of the century if, in a high-emissions future, the West Antarctic ice sheet rapidly melts.The study expects about 5 inches to 11 inches (12.7 centimeters to 27.9 centimeters) of sea-level rise likely in New York City between 2000 and 2030.The study examined sea level rise through the year 2300.""I think the study is valid, but year 2300 is a long way off,"" said Billy Sweet, an oceanographer for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who was not involved in it. ""What is more certain is the amount of sea level rise likely to occur in the next 50 to 100 years or so and that storm surges from nor'easters and hurricanes will continue to pose a risk for New York City.""Hurricane Sandy merged with two other weather systems into an unusual storm that devastated the oceanfront coastline and caused catastrophic flooding in New York and cities in New Jersey on Oct. 29, 2012. It was blamed for at least 182 deaths and $65 billion in damage in the U.S.State and city officials in New York say they are planning numerous projects to guard against future flooding, including fortifying utilities and transit facilities, and note other projects are still in the design stage.___This story has been corrected to reflect estimated sea level rise of 5 inches to 11 inches is between 2000 and 2030, not 2000 and 2300.",1
"WASHINGTON – It's not just this year. The monster hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, Jose and Lee that have raged across the Atlantic are contributing to what appears to be the most active period for major storms on record.And the busiest part of hurricane season isn't even over.An analysis of 167 years of federal storm data by The Associated Press found that no 30-year period in history has seen this many major hurricanes, this many days of those whoppers spinning in the Atlantic, or this much overall energy generated by those powerful storms.Scientists caution it is too soon to draw conclusions from the data, and they don't say the intense activity confirms a trend. Storms in the distant past may have gone unnoticed, which could make earlier generations appear quieter than they were. Some scientists say past hurricane data is so weak that it's impossible to connect the recent activity to global warming.But more intense storms are what scientists expect to see as the planet's climate changes because warmer ocean water is fuel for hurricanes. And they say it is important to better understand this current intense period to save lives and prevent worse future destruction.Georgia Tech climate scientist Kim Cobb said it would be ""foolish"" for policymakers to ignore the data. ""We may not have as much data as we would like, but we have enough to aggressively invest in a variety of defenses for coastal communities,"" she said in an email. ""We face a triple threat of rising seas, stronger winds, and literally off-the-charts rainfall totals.""The Atlantic hurricane season was more intense than normal in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2008, 2010, 2012 and 2016. The 2005 season, which included Katrina, Rita and Wilma, was so active forecasters ran out of names for storms.Then came this year. Fueled by warmer than normal ocean temperatures and ideal wind conditions, September 2017 had more days with major hurricanes spinning and more overall hurricane energy expelled than any month on record, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach. Harvey spawned record rainfall. Irma had record high winds in the open Atlantic. And Maria hit the U.S. stronger than the earlier two.The Associated Press looked at all major hurricanes — not just the small fraction that hit the U.S. — and grouped them into 30-year periods to mirror the 30-year cycles climate scientists use to understand how the climate is changing. The analysis found that in the period from 1988 to 2017:— There have been 90 major hurricanes, an average of three a year. That's 48 percent more than during the previous 30 years. This hurricane season is at five and still counting.— During the past 30 years major hurricanes have churned for an average of 7.2 days. That's 65 percent more than the average during the previous 30 years. There have been 18.8 major hurricane days so far this year.— Scientists use a measure called Accumulated Cyclone Energy, or ACE, that factors in wind speed and storm duration to gauge hurricane power. The annual average ACE of the past 30 years is 41 percent more than in the previous 30 years. An average year ACE is just shy of 100 and this year's ACE, with two months still to go, is 204.2.— Of the last 30 years, nine hurricane seasons were considered ""hyperactive"" according to the definition used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and seven were above normal. Only seven years were below normal.Was it just as busy for major storms in the 1930s or 1890s? The numbers say no, but scientists won't draw conclusions because they fear a large undercount of storms before the 1960s.""There's no question that the storms are stronger than they were 30 years ago,"" said NOAA climate and hurricane scientist James Kossin. ""The questions are if you go back a little further if that's what you'll find. We do know for sure that things have increased a hell of a lot since 1970.""So what's going on?Scientists talk about two important factors for long-term hurricane activity: man-made climate change and a natural pattern of changes in the Atlantic.The world's oceans go through long cycles as water circulates like a giant conveyor belt. They last 20 to 30 years, carrying water with different levels of salt and temperature. That cycle seems coincide with hurricane activity, Klotzbach said.Klotzbach predicts that a period of high salinity and warmer water in the North Atlantic that has been present since 1995 will soon fade — and take with it this ultra-busy period for storms. Other scientists dispute this.More frequent and more intense storms fit what scientists expect to see accompany global warming, MIT hurricane and climate professor Kerry Emanuel said. Physics, computer simulations and numerous scientific studies show that as the world warms the strongest storms should get wetter and more intense, and probably more frequent. Yet, the overall number of all named storms is likely to drop because there will likely be fewer weaker ones, scientists say.Still, scientists say it would take more years — and maybe decades — of good data to know for sure if there's a direct connection to climate change.National Hurricane Center science officer Chris Landsea said the problems with missing past storms are so severe ""making any conclusions for the entire (Atlantic) basin would not be justified"" and several other scientists agreed with him.Climate scientist Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute in Germany said the data showing increased intensity is clear enough for him: ""The only caveat being that the increase might be exaggerated somewhat because of undercounting early storms.""What's happening with hurricanes — the frequency, the duration, and the energy — is probably a combination of factors caused by both nature and man, Klotzbach said: ""a mish-mosh of everything.""___AP data journalist Nicky Forster contributed to this story from New York.___Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at @borenbears .

"BISMARCK, N.D. – An environmental activist who targeted an oil pipeline in North Dakota a year ago as part of a broader four-state effort to draw attention to climate change is due to stand trial along with the man who filmed his deeds.Michael Foster's trial starts Monday in Pembina County. He is among the first in that group of activists to go to trial, following a man in Washington state who was convicted of a burglary charge and served just two days in jail.Here's a look at Foster's case, an update on others and an examination of the defense Foster and other activists hope to use: that their lawbreaking was in the public's interest.WHAT HAPPENED LAST FALL?On Oct. 11, 2016, 11 activists with the group Climate Direct Action were arrested when they tried to shut down pipelines in North Dakota, Minnesota, Montana and Washington state. They did it to protest fossil fuels and as a show of support for people demonstrating against the Dakota Access pipeline, which was still under construction.The activists broke into private property and turned shutoff valves on five pipelines operated by Enbridge, Spectra Energy, Kinder Morgan and TransCanada that move oil from Canada to the U.S.The protesters warned pipeline company officials about their intent ahead of time. Company officials said pipelines at four of the sites were temporarily shut down before the protesters could reach the valves. The pipeline in Washington wasn't operating at the time of the attempt.WHERE DO THE COURT CASES STAND?The first activist to stand trial, Ken Ward, was convicted of burglary in Washington in June. Jurors deadlocked on a sabotage count. Ward was sentenced to the two days he had already spent behind bars, plus community supervision and community service. Prosecutors earlier dropped charges against filmmakers Lindsey Grayzel and Carl Davis, who recorded Ward's pipeline protest.In North Dakota, Foster faces various felony and misdemeanor charges, including criminal mischief, conspiracy, reckless endangerment and criminal trespass. Samuel Jessup, who filmed Foster's protest, will also stand trial.Criminal cases involving similar charges are pending against activists Leonard Higgins and Reed Ingalls in Montana, and against Emily Johnston, Annette Klapstein, Steve Liptay and Ben Joldersma in Minnesota.HOW MIGHT THE NORTH DAKOTA CASE PLAY OUT?There's no question about what Foster did. The mental health counselor from Seattle surrendered peacefully to authorities on the day of his protest and doesn't deny using a bolt cutter to get through a chain link fence so he could turn the pipeline's shutoff valve. He said he did it to make a more forceful statement.""Not just another parade or a hearing or a petition,"" he said.Still, Foster has pleaded not guilty, as has Jessup, of Burlington, Vermont.If convicted, Foster could face more than 20 years in prison and could be fined more than $40,000. Jessup would face a maximum sentence of about half that.HOW CAN FOSTER DEFEND HIMSELF?Foster is hoping to use a legal tactic known as the necessity defense — justifying a crime by arguing that it prevented a greater harm from happening.""I'm going into this to challenge the jury to use their conscience to consider my act of conscience,"" he said.The necessity defense is popular among environmental activists. The Climate Defense Project even offers an educational guide on what it calls an area of the law that is ""developing rapidly.""However, whether the defense is permitted by law varies from state to state, and in some states including North Dakota it's unclear whether there's a statutory basis, according to University of Mississippi law professor Michael Hoffheimer.""It's not the most common defense, but it gets raised in high-profile controversial cases where political activists are seeking to challenge the law,"" he said. ""Activists in these cases really want to have an opportunity in the legal system to show the crime they're charged with is prohibiting conduct that's not as bad as the harm they're trying to avoid.""Other suspects in the October pipeline shutdown effort also have turned to the necessity defense.The judge overseeing Ward's trial wouldn't permit it, though he did allow Ward to tell jurors about what motivated his actions. Ward said after his conviction that ""I'm leaving this trial heartened, knowing that we are bringing these arguments into the jury system.""A decision is pending on whether the necessity defense will be allowed in the Minnesota cases. In the Montana case, Judge Daniel Boucher denied the necessity defense, saying Higgins wanted to attract publicity and was trying to ""place U.S. energy policy on trial.""Assistant North Dakota Attorney General Jon Byers has asked state District Judge Laurie Fontaine not to allow the necessity defense in the Pembina County trial.""Although the defendants may testify what was going through their mind at the time they took the actions they did, the court should prohibit any other presentation of a climate necessity defense or the attempt to turn this into a trial on global warming,"" Byers wrote.___Follow Blake Nicholson on Twitter at: https://twitter.com/NicholsonBlake",1
"On 'America's Newsroom,' Space.com's Tariq Malik offers insight on data found on telescopeThe sun is like a teenager that cycles through mood swings – from dramatic to chill and back again – roughly every eleven years. But this time it’s different. It now appears the sun is heading for a rare, super-chill period that threatens to add some unexpected drama to today’s climate change discussion.For most of its history, science believed the sun’s output was constant. It was wrong. Today, we realize that lots of things about the sun wax and wane every eleven years, most notably its brightness and the number of explosive disturbances on its surface called sunspots and faculae.That’s not all. The eleven-year cycle itself snakes up and down like a roller coaster, reaching “grand maxima” and “grand minima” every 100-200 years. The last grand maximum peaked circa 1958, after which the sun has been steadily quieting down. Today, the drop in activity is at its steepest in 9,300 years.Is the sun headed for a grand minimum? If so, it immediately calls to mind the famous Maunder Minimum, during which the sun languished for seventy years. From 1645 to 1715 the sun’s brightness dimmed by a fraction of one percent and the number of sunspots and faculae plummeted to nearly zero.On top of that, the Maunder Minimum occurred precisely during the coldest part of the centuries-long Little Ice Age, when the average temperature of the northern hemisphere dropped by about 1.1 degrees Fahrenheit. Was it a coincidence? Or did the Maunder Minimum help drive the ice age? Here’s where the story about today’s apparent plunge toward a solar grand minimum really heats up.According to NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, Earth’s temperature has increased by about 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit since 1880, roughly the end of the Little Ice Age. The worst warming is yet to come, most scientists claim, and not even a grand solar minimum will prevent it.Using computer simulations, scientists at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, estimate that “a grand solar minimum in the middle of the 21st century would slow down human-caused global warming and reduce the relative increase of surface temperatures by several tenths of a degree [Celsius, equal to about 0.5 degrees Fahrenheit].” But at the end of the grand minimum, they say, the warming would simply pick up where it left off. “Therefore … a grand solar minimum would slow down and somewhat delay, but not stop, human-caused global warming.”But the sun’s dramatic quiescence comes with a surprising complication: cosmic rays. They are subatomic particles – mainly protons and helium nuclei – that originate from somewhere deep within our galaxy. Their source is still a mystery.Usually, the sun’s powerful magnetic field and radioactive winds keep cosmic rays away from our neighborhood. But when the sun weakens, the cosmic rays are freer to move in and bombard Earth. New research shows that upon striking the atmosphere, cosmic rays produce showers of particles and ions that seed clouds with extraordinary efficiency. The increased cloudiness shades Earth from the sun.Recently, a team of Russian scientists compared the cosmic-ray cooling mechanism to two other well-known drivers of climate change – the sun’s inconstant brightness and greenhouse gases. Publishing in the ""Bulletin of the Russian Academy of Sciences: Physics,"" they maintain the cosmic-ray cooling phenomenon will dominate everything else in the coming decades and actually force a period of global cooling.It is a radical hypothesis, to be sure, but even mainstream scientists monitoring the sun’s rapidly flagging behavior agree the growing likelihood of a grand minimum is stirring up a grand maximum of uncertainty and excitement. “We are not quite sure what the consequences of this will be,” says Yvonne Elsworth, a solar physicist at England’s University of Birmingham, “but it’s clear that we are in unusual times.”",1
"Todd Starnes reacts to a study NPR reported claiming babies are a leading cause of global warmingThe folks at National Public Radio are touting a study that says making babies may be to blame for global warming.“A recent study from Lund University in Sweden shows that the biggest way to reduce climate change is to have fewer children,” NPR declared.Click here for a free subscription to Todd’s newsletter: a must-read for ConservativesIt’s bad enough that the global warming crowd wants us to use recycled toilet paper and battery-powered cars, but now they want to tell Americans what they can and cannot do in the bedroom.“I know this is a sensitive topic to bring up,” study co-author Kimberly Nicholas told NPR’s Morning Edition. “Certainly it’s not my place as a scientist to dictate choices for other people. But I do think it is my place to do the analysis and report it fairly.”The study reportedly found that having one fewer child reduced carbon emissions.“I think the decision to become a parent is a really personal decision,” she told NPR. “I think the way people relate to it in terms of climate change depends on their view about climate change.”In addition, the study urged people to consider living car-free, avoiding airplane travel and eating a plant-based diet.Meanwhile, Bill Nye, the alleged Science Guy, told the Los Angeles Times that older people need to “age out” before climate science can advance.And by “age out” – he means kick the bucket.“Climate change deniers, by way of example, are older. It’s generational,” he said. “We’re just going to have to wait for those people to ‘age out,’ as they say.”In other words, the global warming crowd would be willing to sacrifice your grandmother to save a polar bear. Sorry, Nanna.So let's review - the liberals believe the only way to save planet earth is to stir-fry lawn clippings, kill off granny and drive one of those effeminate cars that you have to plug into a wall outlet.I feel a raging microaggression coming on, America.So for the sake of our great nation, I call upon my fellow countrymen to gas us their F-150’s, barbecue some burgers, grab the Mrs. and put on some Barry White baby-making music.And if the NPR chatterboxes give you any grief, just tell them to take their global warming nonsense and kindly blow it out their tailpipe.",1

          (Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.)SAN FRANCISCO  – When Arnold Schwarzenegger was the governor of California, he backed environmental legislation that's become one of the world's most closely watched initiatives in the fight against global warming.On Tuesday, Schwarzenegger will join his successor, Jerry Brown, as Brown keeps alive a cap and trade program that both men have urged the rest of the world to emulate.The program puts a cap and a price on carbon emissions, creating an incentive for polluters to reduce emissions.Brown, a Democrat, and Schwarzenegger, a Republican, have enthusiastically picked fights with President Donald Trump on climate change since Trump announced he was pulling the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord.""One man cannot destroy our progress. One man can't stop our clean energy revolution,"" Schwarzenegger said in a video shared widely online last month.

      THE PLASTIC WE'VE MADE WEIGHS AS MUCH AS 1 BILLION ELEPHANTSCalifornia's cap and trade program has been hailed as a successful way to reduce emissions that hasn't taken the steam out of California's thriving economy.Brown's signature Tuesday will add 10 years to the program, which had been scheduled to expire in 2020. The signing follows a frenetic push by Brown and his legislative allies to craft a plan that businesses and environmentalists would find acceptable.In the end, the extension was supported by a wide range of groups that said it's the most cost-effective way to combat climate change. But it met fierce opposition from environmental justice groups that said it's riddled with giveaways to the oil industry, including too many free pollution permits.Schwarzenegger signed a bill in 2006 that authorized state environmental regulators to create a cap and trade program, but the authorization would have expired in 2020 without action from lawmakers.After the extension passed, Schwarzenegger highlighted the support from eight Republican lawmakers, saying they've shown that the GOP can get behind free-market solutions to climate change.Schwarzenegger's bill required the state to reduce its carbon emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 — a target the state is on track to meet. Legislation approved last year set a new, much more aggressive goal to reduce emissions another 40 percent by 2030.Cap and trade puts a limit on carbon emissions and requires polluters to obtain permits to release greenhouse gases. Some permits, known as allowances, are given away while others are auctioned, generating billions of dollars in revenue for the state. The money is a key funding source for a planned high-speed train between San Francisco and Los Angeles, one of Brown's priorities.The governor's office said he'll sign separate legislation tied to the cap and trade extension later this week. It includes a bill that could give Republicans more say in spending the money and another to improve efforts to monitor and clean up the air around some of the dirtiest sources of pollution, such as oil refineries.",1
"MIAMI – Almost 25 years have passed since a Category 5 hurricane struck south of Miami, and the city's vulnerability to catastrophic storm damage has grown exponentially, according to a new insurance underwriters' analysis.At the time, Hurricane Andrew was the most expensive natural disaster in U.S. history, causing more than $26 billion of damage in Florida's most populous areas, including $15.5 billion in insurance payouts. Stringent building code enforcement followed in Miami, but so did population growth, coastal development and climate change.""Our concerns lie with the fact that even though we've made good changes, 25 years later you have a much larger population living in Florida, and people forget what can happen or they don't know what could happen,"" said Monica Ningen, chief property underwriter for the U.S. and Canada at Swiss Re.U.S. government forecasters gave coastal residents more reasons Wednesday to worry and prepare for disaster: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's updated hurricane season forecast predicts 14 to 19 named storms, with five to nine hurricanes. Two to five hurricanes are expected to be ""major"" with sustained winds of at least 111 mph (178 kph).Gerry Bell, lead seasonal hurricane forecaster at NOAA's Climate Prediction Center, said wind patterns and warmer-than-average water temperatures that can fuel storm development are expected to persist throughout the tropical Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea.Six tropical storms have formed so far this year, including two that hit the U.S. A National Hurricane Center advisory said Tropical Storm Franklin became Hurricane Franklin on Wednesday afternoon as it approached Mexico's central Gulf coast.Swiss Re, a Switzerland-based reinsurance company, released an analysis Wednesday estimating the losses if a hurricane similar to Andrew's size and strength hit Miami and its suburbs today.___CATASTROPHIC LOSSESOn Aug. 24, 1992, Andrew blasted ashore about 20 miles southwest of Miami with winds topping 165 mph (265 kph). The hurricane killed 15 people and indirectly caused the deaths of 25 more in Miami-Dade County alone, according to the National Hurricane Center.Andrew destroyed 25,524 homes and damaged another 101,241; nearly all the mobile homes in its path were completely lost.If a similar hurricane barreled down the same track today, Swiss Re estimates damage would range from $80 billion to $100 billion, including up to $60 billion in insured losses.Should a similar hurricane target Miami directly, Swiss Re estimates unprecedented losses: $100 billion to $300 billion, including insured losses up to $180 billion.___STORM SURGEFor all the extreme conditions Andrew produced, storm surge flooding from the compact hurricane was relatively minor in Florida. The abnormal rise of sea levels, driven ashore by storm winds, can be a hurricane's most deadly hazard, but no one died because of Andrew's storm surge — a fact the hurricane center considered ""a fortunate aberration.""According to hurricane center records, only $96 million in federal flood claims were reported after Andrew.Rising sea levels caused by climate change is expected to exacerbate storm surge flooding. Even a moderate rise of 3.5 inches by the 2030s could increase storm-surge-related losses along South Florida's coastline to roughly $11 billion, said Megan Linkin, a meteorologist and natural hazards expert at Swiss Re.That's particularly troubling because even a tropical storm can cause major coastal flooding.For example, Sandy's enormous size drove catastrophic storm surge onto the New Jersey and New York coastlines even though the storm weakened and lost its tropical characteristics before making landfall in October 2012. Causing more than $50 billion in losses, Sandy now ranks as the second most costly hurricane to hit the U.S., ahead of Andrew and surpassed by only Hurricane Katrina.___PROTECTION GAPSSwiss Re now estimates the combined residential values in three Miami-area counties are roughly $660 billion and commercial values are about $550 billion.Insuring those properties can be expensive and difficult in Florida. Only 19 percent of the state's homeowners have flood insurance. Many insurers stopped renewing homeowner policies after eight hurricanes hit the state in 2004 and 2005, forcing property owners into the state-managed insurance company created 10 years after Andrew, which lawmakers intended to act as Florida's insurer of last resort.That company, Citizens Property Insurance, now has more than 451,000 customers statewide who face rate increases that officials say are needed to cover rising costs associated with water damage claims not related to tropical storms or hurricanes.Ningen advises homeowners and elected officials to focus on closing protection gaps by exploring new insurance products that can help cover losses, upgrading existing structures through the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety's ""Fortified Home"" program, heeding new hurricane center advisories setting deadlines for completing storm preparedness and supporting infrastructure projects such as the installation of a $400 million system of stormwater pumps in Miami Beach.""To us, resiliency does not mean waiting for the federal government to bail you out,"" she said. ""It's what you can do, and local governments stepping in to do what they can do.""",1

"As Al Gore's documentary, 'An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power,' prepares to open, the electric bill in environmental icon Nashville home suggests he may not practice what he has preached for so long #TuckerI was surprised to discover that Al Gore's new movie begins with words from me!While icebergs melt dramatically, Gore plays a clip of me saying, ""'An Inconvenient Truth' won him an Oscar, yet much of the movie is nonsense. ‘Sea levels may rise 20 feet' -- absurd."" He used this comment from one of my TV shows.The ""20 feet"" claim is absurd -- one of many hyped claims in his movie.His second film, ""An Inconvenient Sequel,"" shows lower Manhattan underwater while Gore intones: ""This is global warming!""My goodness! Stossel doubts Al Gore's claim, but pictures don't lie: The 9/11 Memorial is underwater! Gore is right! Stossel is an ignorant fool!But wait. The pictures were from Superstorm Sandy. Water is pushed ashore during storms, especially ""super"" storms. But average sea levels haven't risen much.Over the past decade, they have risen about 1 inch. But this is not because we burn fossil fuels. Sea levels were rising long before we burned anything. They've been rising about an inch per decade for a thousand years.In his new movie, Gore visits Miami Beach. No storm, but streets are flooded! Proof of catastrophe!But in a new e-book responding to Gore's film, climate scientist Roy Spencer points out that flooding in ""Miami Beach occurs during high tides called 'king tides,' due to the alignment of the Earth, sun and moon. For decades they have been getting worse in low-lying areas of Miami Beach where buildings were being built on reclaimed swampland.""It's typical Al Gore scaremongering: Pick a place that floods every year and portray it as evidence of calamity.Spencer, a former NASA scientist who co-developed the first ways of monitoring global temperatures with satellites, is no climate change ""denier."" Neither am I. Climate changes.Man probably plays a part. But today's warming is almost certainly not a ""crisis."" It's less of a threat than real crises like malaria, terrorism, America's coming bankruptcy, etc. Even if increasing carbon dioxide warming the atmosphere were a serious threat, nothing Al Gore and his followers now advocate would make a difference.""What I am opposed to is misleading people with false climate science claims and alarming them into diverting vast sums of the public's wealth into expensive energy schemes,"" writes Spencer.Gore does exactly that. He portrays just about every dramatic weather event as proof that humans have changed weather. Watching his films, you'd think that big storms and odd weather never occurred before and that glaciers never melted.In his first movie, Gore predicted that tornadoes and hurricanes would get worse. They haven't. Tornado activity is down.What about those dramatic pictures of collapsing ice shelves?""As long as snow continues to fall on Antarctica,"" writes Spencer, ""glaciers and ice shelves will continue to slowly flow downhill to the sea and dramatically break off into the ocean. That is what happens naturally, just as rivers flow naturally to the ocean. It has nothing to do with human activities.""Gore said summer sea ice in the Arctic would disappear as early as 2014. Nothing like that is close to happening.Gore's movie hypes solar power and electric cars but doesn't mention that taxpayers are forced to subsidize them. Despite the subsidies, electric cars still make up less than 1 percent of the market.If electric cars do become more popular, Spencer asks, ""Where will all of the extra electricity come from? The Brits are already rebelling against existing wind farms.""I bet most Gore fans have no idea that most American electricity comes from natural gas (33 percent), coal (30 percent) and nuclear reactors (20 percent).Gore probably doesn't know that.I'd like to ask him, but he won't talk to me. He won't debate anyone.Critics liked ""An Inconvenient Sequel."" An NPR reviewer called it ""a hugely effective lecture."" But viewers were less enthusiastic. On Rotten Tomatoes, my favorite movie guide, they give ""Sequel"" a ""tipped over popcorn bucket"" score of 48 percent. Sample reviews: ""Dull as can be."" ""Faulty info, conflated and exaggerated.""Clearly, Nobel Prize judges and media critics are bigger fans of big government and scaremongering than the rest of us.",1
"WASHINGTON – By the time the rain stops, Harvey will have dumped about 1 million gallons of water for every man, woman and child in southeastern Texas — a soggy, record-breaking glimpse of the wet and wild future that global warming could bring, scientists say.While scientists are quick to say that climate change didn't cause Harvey and that they haven't determined yet whether the storm was made worse by global warming, they do note that warmer air and water mean wetter and possibly more intense hurricanes in the future.""This is the kind of thing we are going to get more of,"" said Princeton University climate scientist Michael Oppenheimer. ""This storm should serve as warning.""There's a scientifically accepted method for determining if some wild weather event has the fingerprints of man-made climate change, and it involves intricate calculations. Those could take weeks or months to complete, and then even longer to pass peer review.In general, though, climate scientists agree that future storms will dump much more rain than the same size storms did in the past.That's because warmer air holds more water. With every degree Fahrenheit, the atmosphere can hold and then dump an additional 4 percent of water (7 percent for every degree Celsius), several scientists say.Global warming also means warmer seas, and warm water is what fuels hurricanes.When Harvey moved toward Texas, water in the Gulf of Mexico was nearly 2 degrees (1 degree Celsius) warmer than normal, said Weather Underground meteorology director Jeff Masters. Hurricanes need at least 79 degrees F (26 C) as fuel, and water at least that warm ran more than 300 feet (100 meters) deep in the Gulf, according to University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy.Several studies show that the top 1 percent of the strongest downpours are already happening much more frequently. Also, calculations done Monday by MIT meteorology professor Kerry Emanuel show that the drenching received by Rockport, Texas, used to be maybe a once-in-1,800-years event for that city, but with warmer air holding more water and changes in storm steering currents since 2010, it is now a once-every-300-years event.There's a lot of debate among climate scientists over what role, if any, global warming may have played in causing Harvey to stall over Texas, which was a huge factor in the catastrophic flooding. If the hurricane had moved on like a normal storm, it wouldn't have dumped as much rain in any one spot.Harvey stalled because it is sandwiched between two high-pressure fronts that push it in opposite directions, and those fronts are stuck.Oppenheimer and some others theorize that there's a connection between melting sea ice in the Arctic and changes in the jet stream and the weather patterns that make these ""blocking fronts"" more common. Others, like Masters, contend it's too early to say.University of Washington atmospheric scientist Cliff Mass said that climate change is simply not powerful enough to create off-the-chart events like Harvey's rainfall.""You really can't pin global warming on something this extreme. It has to be natural variability,"" Mass said. ""It may juice it up slightly but not create this phenomenal anomaly.""""We're breaking one record after another with this thing,"" Mass said.Sometime Tuesday or early Wednesday, parts of the Houston region will have broken the nearly 40-year-old U.S. record for the heaviest rainfall from a tropical system — 48 inches, set by Tropical Storm Amelia in 1978 in Texas, several meteorologists say.Already 15 trillion gallons of rain have fallen on a large area, and an additional 5 trillion or 6 trillion gallons are forecast by the end of Wednesday, meteorologist Ryan Maue of WeatherBell Analytics calculates. That's enough water to fill all the NFL and Division 1 college football stadiums more than 100 times over.",1

"WASHINGTON – At nearly 6-foot-6, Tom Bossert is hard to miss. Yet he came and went through the gilded lobby at Trump Tower multiple times during the presidential transition largely unnoticed among the parade of White House job candidates headed for the elevators.A Nov. 17 video from the lobby shows Trump adviser Dave Bossie twirling colleague Kellyanne Conway as Bossert looks on, generally ignored by reporters staking out the scene.Bossert quickly caught the eye of the transition team, though, and then of Donald Trump. The president-elect offered Bossert the job of White House homeland security adviser nearly as soon as they met, on Dec. 22 at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.Bossert, with his smooth but unassuming manner, isn't in the background anymore. He's squarely out front as Trump's details man on the hurricane recovery effort, a fitting follow-up to Bossert's work helping write the ""lessons learned"" report after the Bush administration's botched response to Hurricane Katrina.His portfolio also includes the Equifax hack, counterterrorism, cybersecurity, flood insurance and more.When Trump makes his first presidential visit to the U.N. General Assembly this coming week, Bossert is expected to be there as well.Current and former White House aides say Bossert has been a bastion of competence in a White House riven by feuding, investigations and Trump's unpredictable temper.Trump has signaled his trust in Bossert by seeking his advice in private meetings and allowing him to speak for the administration in the most public of settings, from Sunday talk shows to the White House podium.""I want to make sure you understand that you should continue to have confidence in what we're doing as a government,"" Bossert assured the nation from the briefing room on Aug. 31 as Texas reeled from the effects of Hurricane Harvey and Florida braced for Irma.Polls show wide swaths of Americans have concerns about Trump's presidency. But Bossert was determined to send the message that when it comes to handling hurricanes, the administration is on it.At another briefing, Bossert was open about his intentions, offering reporters an atypical preface for such White House sessions: ""I like to try to categorize my thoughts into informing, influencing and inspiring, if I can.""Bossert got his start in Washington — and his subsequent invitation to Trump Tower — courtesy of David Bossie, who hired him fresh from the University of Pittsburgh when Bossie was chief investigator on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee in the 1990s. The committee launched investigations into an assortment of then-President Bill Clinton's activities, including his campaign finances.When Trump won the presidency, Bossie says he immediately called Bossert to try to lure him back to the White House.""There was simply no one else who could even come close"" to being as qualified, Bossie recalls.The 42-year-old Bossert, a fly-casting enthusiast, is regarded as a human briefing book for a president famously averse to the nitty-gritty, an expert in even the most mundane-sounding matters that make up the post-9/11 discipline known as homeland security. He's figured out how to communicate with Trump — and Vice President Mike Pence and others — in ways the new administration values as it has confronted its first major natural disasters.He also seems acutely aware that it doesn't pay to attract more attention than the boss in the cauldron that is the Trump White House. Bossert declined an interview request for this story.""Tom's got a very good ability to read people"" and deliver information in ways tailored to their styles, said President George W. Bush's homeland security adviser Fran Townsend, who worked with Bossert in that administration. ""I think that we see real differences in the way that, for example, that the president and vice president process information. ... Tom's got a strong relationship with both of them.""For Bossert, politics is perhaps more challenging than details. He has gotten some blowback when asked how he lines up with Trump's approaches to racial violence and climate change.Asked on CNN's ""State of the Union"" about the confrontations in Charlottesville, Virginia, Bossert at first repeated Trump's language that ""both sides"" were responsible for what led to the death of one person. Pressed, he specifically condemned white supremacists.Later, from the White House podium, Bossert declined to say whether man-made climate change might be responsible for multiple historic hurricanes. He promised an analysis on the subject at a later date.""The politics is way outside my lane,"" Bossert said.Bossert ""is more candid sometimes than a politician and more open than any of the politicians I know,"" said Stewart Baker, a lawyer who worked at the Department of Homeland Security while Bossert served Bush. ""That's going to be an issue. Does he really want to do what people in political positions have to do?""Bossert got his law degree in 2003, but by then the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks had claimed the life of a friend and former colleague — Barbara Olson, chief investigative counsel for the House committee where Bossert worked.On the 16th anniversary of the attacks this year, Bossert said from the White House podium that 9/11 was the reason he's in the homeland security business, though he did not mention Olson.""Tom was affected just like the rest of us were, that Barbara Olson was on the plane,"" said Bossie.In the Bush White House, Bossert dove into the many disciplines that make up what's now known as homeland security — cybersecurity, counterterrorism and general emergency preparedness. Eventually, he served as Bush's deputy homeland security adviser.When President Barack Obama took over, Bossert founded a risk management business in Arlington, Virginia.Josh Corman of the Atlantic Council, where Bossert did a fellowship on cybersecurity, said the president's adviser can keep up with the more subtle and obscure parts of the field that Trump has called, ""the cyber.""""Tom's role covers three things: homeland security, counterterrorism and cybersecurity. Every predecessor in that role has treated those as separate domains, Tom uniquely understood the intersection,"" Corman said. ""There are only maybe only five people in the whole government who understand that, and he's one.""___Follow Kellman on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/APLaurieKellman",1
"Many neighborhoods still swamped by Harvey's floodwaters; Will Carr reportsHouston’s mayor says America’s fourth largest city is “open for business” but more than a week after Harvey parts of the city remain flooded, up to 500,000 vehicles have been damaged, floodwaters contain a toxic brew of chemicals and the total cost of repairs could exceed $180 billion.Harvey, which roared ashore as a Category 4 hurricane, brought 52 inches of rain to some parts of the Houston metropolitan area and resulted in at least 60 deaths. The ferocious storm, which knocked out 30 percent of U.S. oil refining capacity, has led to price spikes and sporadic gasoline shortages in some parts of the city.Flood models released by the Federal Emergency Management Agency show more than 90,000 residential structures in Harris, Galveston and Fort Bend Counties could have been damaged by flood waters from the storm. Only 15 percent of Harris County’s 1.5 million properties, which includes Houston, are insured for floods.Despite all that, Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said much of the city was hoping to get back on track after Labor Day.“Anyone who was planning on a conference or a convention or a sporting event or a concert coming to this city, you can still come,” Turner, a Democrat, told CBS. ""We can do multiple things at the same time.”One worry has eased--further explosions at the damaged Arkema chemical plant in Crosby after officials carried out a controlled burn Sunday evening of highly unstable compounds. The 1.5-mile evacuation zone around the Arkema facility was lifted on Monday and officials determined it was safe for residents to return to their homes.Authorities said they would continue to monitor air quality around the site.

      (AP)Floodwaters have also inundated at least five Superfund toxic waste near Houston and some may be damaged, though Environmental Protection Agency officials have yet to assess the full extent of what occurred.Turner said Houston's drinking water hadn't been affected by the storm, but told CBS, “We would hope that the EPA would be on the ground now to take a look at those Superfund sites, to make sure that contamination is contained and limited.”Other issues across the region: too much water still in houses, no water to drink and no way to get to work in the freeway-heavy city.Utility crews went door-to-door Sunday shutting off power and warning those still in some waterlogged homes in western parts of the city that more flooding was possible — not from rain, but from releases of water from overtaxed reservoirs. Thousands of Houston dwellings were under mandatory evacuation orders, though about 300 people were thought to be refusing to leave.

      (AP)According to data compiled by Solera Holdings, up to a half-million cars have been damaged in Texas. Even rental vehicles have likely been damaged in Houston, a city where 94 percent of the population owns a car.People briefly returned Sunday to some homes in the area, which included brick two-story and ranch homes bordering Buffalo Bayou, to try to salvage valuables.More than a week since the storm hit, the 4 feet of water in her parents' home had receded just a foot, said Karen Mace. She was trying to retrieve family photos from the one-story ranch her parents built and have lived in for 56 years, which backs up to Buffalo Bayou.""It came up fast. They had to get out by canoe,"" Mace said, adding they thought the home would have to be demolished.Meanwhile, repairs continued on the water treatment plant in Beaumont, about 85 miles from Houston, which failed after the swollen Neches River inundated the main intake system and backup pumps halted.President Donald Trump has asked Congress for a $7.9 billion down payment toward Harvey relief and recovery efforts. Abbott suggested the cost of recovery could be as much as $180 billion.The Associated Press contributed to this report.",1
"WASHINGTON – In a story Sept. 6 about the hurricane season, The Associated Press reported erroneously the extent of hurricane forecasts. Usually forecasts do not go out further than five days.A corrected version of the story is below:Why Irma is so strong and other questions about hurricanesBy SETH BORENSTEINAP Science WriterWASHINGTON (AP) — A powerful Hurricane Irma is threatening millions of people in the Caribbean and Florida. Some answers to questions about Irma and hurricanes:WHERE DO THESE STORMS COME FROM?Irma is a classic Cape Verde storm, which begin near the islands off the west coast of Africa. Some of the worst hurricanes start as puffs of unstable air and storminess there and chug west, gaining strength over the warm open Atlantic. Another storm, Jose, has followed in Irma's footsteps. Some of those storms fizzle from wind shear or other weather conditions. Still others curve harmlessly north into the mid-North Atlantic and are called ""fish storms."" Storms also start in the Gulf of Mexico, like Katia which formed off Mexico and was declared a hurricane on Wednesday.WHY ARE STORMS HAPPENING NOW?Hurricane season starts June 1 and ends Nov. 30. That's usually when the water is warm enough and other weather conditions are conducive to storm formation. Hurricanes need water that's at least 79 degrees (26 degrees Celsius). Peak hurricane season is from mid-August to mid-October with the peak of the peak being Sept. 10 or 11.WHAT'S AN AVERAGE SEASON LIKE?An average season produces 12 named storms, according to the National Weather Service. Wednesday's Katia is the 11th this season. Storms get names when winds reach 39 mph. The average season produces six hurricanes and three of those become major at 111 mph winds or higher. So far this year, there have been six hurricanes: two major ones, Harvey and Irma; two new ones Wednesday, Katia and Jose; and Franklin and Gert.DID FORECASTERS SEE THIS BUSY YEAR COMING?Yes. In May, the weather service predicted a 70 percent likelihood of 11 to 17 named storms with 5 to 9 becoming hurricanes. They predicted 2 to 4 major hurricanes. In early August, it was changed to a 60 percent chance of 14 to 19 named storms, 5 to 9 hurricanes and 2 to 5 major hurricanes.ARE BACK-TO-BACK BIG HURRICANES UNUSUAL?Major storms can and do form back-to-back and did so last year with Matthew and Nicole, but having more than one hit the U.S. in a season is strange. If Irma hits Florida as a category 4 or 5 storm, it will be the first time in historical record that the U.S. was hit by two category 4 or 5 storms in one year, said Colorado State University meteorology professor Phil Klotzbach.WHY IS IRMA SO STRONG?Hurricanes use warm water as fuel. Irma has been over water that is 1.2 to 1.8 degrees (0.7 to 1 degree Celsius) warmer than normal. And that warm water goes deeper than usual. High altitude winds, which can fight or even decapitate storms, are not strong, also helping Irma. While over the open Atlantic Ocean on Tuesday, Irma's 185 mph winds set a record for that region. In the entire Atlantic, Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico, only Hurricane Allen in 1980 was stronger with 190 mph winds. Others with 185 mph winds: a 1935 Florida storm, 1988's Gilbert, and 2005's Wilma.HOW UNUSUAL IS IRMA?This is only the second time since satellite-tracking began about 40 years ago that one maintained 185 mph winds for more than 24 hours, said Klotzbach. The other was the massive killer typhoon Haiyan that killed more than 6,000 people in the Philippines in 2013.IS THIS GLOBAL WARMING?Scientists take weeks or months to conduct intricate studies, using computer simulations, to see if a storm was worsened by man-made climate change. There have been a limited number of hurricanes since record-keeping began in 1851, which makes it difficult to do robust statistical analyses. However, scientists have long said future global warming would make some of the worst storms stronger and wetter and recently have linked climate change to future rapid intensification of storms. There's been scientific debate over whether global warming means more storms, but the stronger and wetter is generally accepted by scientists.WASN'T THERE A HURRICANE DROUGHT?In the U.S., yes. Until Harvey last month, no major hurricane had hit the United States since Wilma. That 2005 storm also was the last major hurricane to hit Florida. Scientists say the 12-year landfall drought was likely chance. There were still the same number of hurricanes brewing, they just missed the United States or were not major hurricanes. During that span, Superstorm Sandy was a minor hurricane in terms of wind speed but catastrophic in damage when it hit in 2012.HOW ARE STORMS FORECAST?Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center rely on dozens of computer simulations and their own expert experience. They use real-time readings of wind, temperature, air pressure, humidity and more. But those real-time readings are sparse and spread out. Figuring out a storm's path and strength is tricky and usually forecasts do not go out further than five days.___HURRICANE NEWSLETTER - Get the best of the AP's all-formats reporting on Irma and Harvey in your inbox: http://apne.ws/ahYQGtb",1
"WASHINGTON – With four big hurricanes, a powerful earthquake and wildfires, it seems that nature recently has just gone nuts.Some of these disasters, like Friday's earthquake in Mexico, are natural. Others may end up having a mix of natural and man-made ingredients after scientists examine them. We also always tend to look for patterns and order in chaos, even when they aren't there, psychologists say.""Nature's gone crazy,"" mused Jeff Masters, meteorology director at the private service Weather Underground. ""Welcome to the future. Extreme weather like this is going to be occurring simultaneously more often because of global warming.""A look at a rough few weeks in North America:HURRICANE QUARTETHurricane Harvey hadn't even fizzled and Houston hadn't even dried out from record flooding before Hurricane Irma formed and also grew into a powerful Category 4 storm. Right behind Irma, Jose has powered up to a Category 4 storm. It is highly unusual, but not unprecedented to have back-to-back storms of that strength, Masters said. And then there is Hurricane Katia, just a shade under major hurricane status, due to hit Mexico's Gulf coast.The last couple of years were quiet for Atlantic hurricanes, which makes this year seem even worse, said Colorado State University meteorology professor Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane expert. He said calculations that measure strength and duration show the three current Atlantic storms set a one-day record for energy on Friday. In just three days, Irma, Jose and Katia have produced as much as energy as about half a normal six-month hurricane season.EARTHQUAKEAs Mexico was bracing for Katia off the Gulf coast, one of the strongest earthquakes in the country's history hit late Thursday off its Pacific coast, near the Guatemala border. The magnitude 8.1 earthquake was felt for more than 650 miles (1,000 kilometers). The quake shook at a depth of 43 miles (69 kilometers) and a quake hitting at that depth with that strength is unusual, according to Cornell University geophysics professor Geoff Abers. It was one of the five largest for that deep in the past 40 years, he said.WILDFIRESOn Friday, 82 wildfires were burning in the United States involving nearly 1.5 million acres in nine states in the West. So far this year, more than 8 million acres have burned, only behind 2015 and 2012. One fire at the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest in Oregon has burned more than 175,000 acres and is only 5 percent contained as of Friday, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.Drought and a heat wave contributed. On Sept. 1, in normally temperate San Francisco, the temperature hit 106 degrees and at least six deaths were reported from the heat wave.WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?Sometimes there's a pattern in chaos. Sometimes there isn't. Looking for patterns gives us a sense of control, even if we don't really have it, said Scott Lilienfeld, a psychology professor at Emory University in Atlanta. ""The human mind is a pattern-seeking organ,'"" he said. ""That's how our minds work.""It can take weeks or months for scientists to determine whether an extreme weather event was worsened by man-made climate change. But scientists have long predicted that the strongest hurricanes will get stronger and wetter, fueled by warmer ocean water. And some say the recent global increase in powerful hurricanes fits perfectly with global warming.While warming may play a small role, so does Twitter and Facebook in making things appear worse, said Klotzbach.""It just feels like, you know, it's the apocalyptic end times,"" he said. ""But a lot of this stuff is getting attention because of social media.""___Researcher Monika Mathur contributed to this report.___Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at @borenbears .

"The biggest danger to life and property from Hurricane Irma could come from storm surge that forces seawater inland, which could topple houses, isolate residents who don't evacuate and make drowning an imminent threat, the National Hurricane Center is warning.Storm surge occurs when heavy winds push the ocean onto the land, and it's a destructive feature of many cyclones and hurricanes, including Hurricane Harvey in Texas last month. Irma's surge could top 12 feet in areas of the Florida coast, and some surge is predicted up and down the state's Atlantic and Gulf coasts.The most severe storm surge is projected for a more than 200-mile stretch of southern Florida coast from Miami to north of Fort Myers, while the Florida Keys also are expected to see significant surge.On Saturday, Florida Gov. Rick Scott warned residents that the storm surge would inundate houses.The rising seas could cause fatalities among people who do not evacuate, hurricane center storm surge specialist Jamie Rhome said.""We evacuate for storm surge, not wind,"" Rhome said. ""People don't understand the water. You're not going to get out and swim away. It's got waves on it, it's got debris in it. Get out quickly.""The hurricane center is forecasting that storm surge could be the most dramatic in the Miami area and in Collier, Monroe and Lee counties, all of which could see surge higher than nine feet above ground. Storm surge could be noticeable 10 or more miles inland in some areas, with the depth of the water becoming shallower away from the coast, the center has said.There are dozens of locations along the Florida coast where the sea level has risen in recent decades because of climate change, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has said the pace is accelerating.The surge from Irma could be a few inches higher in some areas that already have experienced sea level rise, Rhome said.He added that sea level rise remains a long-term threat to Floridians while the threat of catastrophic surge created by Irma is ""a short term crisis in front of them.""Federal Emergency Management Agency chief Brock Long said Friday that Irma will have a ""devastating"" impact on the state. The surge is likely to start before the storm makes landfall.Conditions in some parts of coastal Florida make it ideal for heavy storm surge, said Stephen Leatherman, a professor in Florida International University's department of earth and environment.Storm surge can be severe where offshore water is shallow and the geography of the land creates a ""funnel effect"" that forces the surging water to become higher, Leatherman said. Those conditions exist in places such as Biscayne Bay, which is near Miami and is especially susceptible to storm surge, he said.Similar conditions proved disastrous in New York and New Jersey during Superstorm Sandy in 2012. Some areas around northern New Jersey and New York City were inundated by more than seven feet of water from the storm, according to the National Weather Service. This summer, Hurricane Harvey brought storm surge higher than 10 feet to some areas of the middle Texas coast, the weather service said.Harvey wasn't a major storm surge event for Houston since much of the damage was from wind, rain and flooding, said Philip Bedient, professor of engineering in civil and environmental engineering at Rice University. The surge from Irma could be potentially much worse, ""a monster event,"" for Miami, he said.Irma could be bigger and more destructive than prior major storms, with its surge reaching inland and disrupting house wiring and causing fires, Leatherman said.The hurricane also has the potential to do considerable environmental damage to the fragile Everglades, parts of which are still recovering from Hurricane Andrew in 1992, he said.Beach erosion is expected along the Florida coast, but Rhome of the hurricane center said there is a graver threat to coastal inhabitants.""You're talking about communities and areas inundated by salt water,"" he said. ""Beach erosion is the least of their concerns right now.""___HURRICANE NEWSLETTER - Get the best of the AP's all-formats reporting on Irma and Harvey in your inbox: http://apne.ws/ahYQGtb",1
"WASHINGTON – Florida's economy has long thrived on one import above all: People.Until Irma struck this month, the state was adding nearly 1,000 residents a day — 333,471 in the past year, akin to absorbing a city the size of St. Louis or Pittsburgh. Every jobseeker, retiree or new birth, along with billions spent by tourists, helped fuel Florida's propulsive growth and economic gains.Yet Hurricane Irma's destructive floodwaters renewed fears about how to manage the state's population boom as the risks of climate change intensify. Rising sea levels and spreading flood plains have magnified the vulnerabilities for the legions of people who continue to move to Florida and the state economy they have sustained.Florida faces an urgent need to adapt to the environmental changes, said Jesse Keenan, a lecturer at Harvard University who researches the effects of rising sea levels on cities.""A lot is going to change in the next 30 years — this is just the beginning,"" Keenan said.People might need to live further inland, Keenan said, and employers might have to relocate to higher ground, with the resulting competition between offices and housing driving up land prices. It would become harder to adequately insure houses built along canals. Traffic delays could worsen across parts of Florida as more roads flood. Developers might shift away from sprawling suburban tracts toward denser urban pockets that are better equipped to manage floods.At the same time, the belief remains firm among some developers and economists that for all the threats from rising water levels, the state's population influx will continue with scarcely any interruption. The allure of lower taxes and easier living, the thinking goes, should keep drawing a flow of residents and vacationers.""Irma doesn't change the fact that there is no state income tax,"" said Sean Snaith, director of the University of Central Florida's Institute for Economic Competitiveness. ""In a few months, when the first Alberta Clipper starts blowing down cold weather across the United States and it's 80 degrees and sunny down here, the memories of Irma will be blown away.""Certainly, the influx of people has been testament to that appeal. After slowing when the housing bubble burst in 2007, the population has marched steadily upward. The number of Floridians, now above 20 million, is projected to hit 24 million by 2030, with more than half the increase coming from retiring baby boomers. Many of them first experienced Florida as tourists. More than 112 million people visited the state last year — a 33 percent increase over the past decade.All of which means that compared with Hurricane Andrew 25 years ago, Irma struck a far more densely packed state. It is also one marked by greater extremes of wealth and poverty. Luxury condo towers populated by the global elite now crowd the Miami skyline. But the metro area is also cursed by the worst rental housing affordability in the United States, according to Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies.Flooding washed away mobile home parks in the Florida Keys where lower-income workers live. As a magnet for jobs at restaurants, hotels and other parts of the services sector, the state attracts workers with relatively low incomes who can't pay higher rents if flooding eliminates a chunk of the housing stock.Still, Citigroup estimated that damages were just $50 billion — well below initial estimates — in part because some homes were better equipped to weather the wind and rain than during Andrew.Storms can cause population loss in the near term. A year after Andrew hit in 1992, Miami-Dade County lost 31,000 residents. Many appear to have moved to Broward and Palm Beach counties, where the risks of flooding were lower, a pattern that could be repeated after Irma.Given the brisk pace of construction and population growth, Florida could endure a heavy economic blow in coming decades if it fails to reduce the risks from climate change. Homes that were too close to eroding beaches could become effectively worthless. Those along canals that flood could become too costly to rebuild. The state's economic fuel — tourism and residential development — could dissipate.Sean Becketti, chief economist at Freddie Mac, the mortgage giant, warned in an analysis last year that rising sea levels and widening flood plains ""appear likely to destroy billions of dollars in property and to displace millions of people.""""The economic losses and social disruption,"" Becketti added, ""may happen gradually, but they are likely to be greater in total than those experienced in the housing crisis and Great Recession.""Federal taxpayers might oppose bailing out these homeowners, Becketti said, mortgage lenders could absorb heavy losses and employers might choose to move to safer parts of the country — and take their jobs with them.Still, for now at least, the heads of several major Florida real estate companies say they expect people to keep flocking to Florida despite the increasing risks.Budge Huskey, president of Premier Sotheby's International Realty, drove around Naples, Florida, and said he observed ""very little damage"" to homes constructed under new building codes after Hurricane Andrew. These houses had wind-resistant hurricane windows and stronger roofs.""Let's face it, people work their whole lives to retire to Florida — that's where they want to be,"" Huskey said.Jay Parker, CEO of Douglas Elliman's Florida brokerage, monitored Irma from an Atlanta hotel. He was gratified that Florida escaped much of the expected destruction. And he said would-be buyers, sniffing out potential bargains, were approaching him at the hotel about cut-rate deals on condos in the storm's wake.""If anything,"" Parker said, ""this might create some short-term buying sprees.""",1

They wouldn't. It's all for show.

"Rising sea levels and fierce storms have failed to stop relentless population growth along U.S. coasts in recent years, a new Associated Press analysis shows. The latest punishing hurricanes scored bull's-eyes on two of the country's fastest growing regions: coastal Texas around Houston and resort areas of southwest Florida.Nothing seems to curb America's appetite for life near the sea, especially in the warmer climates of the South. Coastal development destroys natural barriers such as islands and wetlands, promotes erosion and flooding, and positions more buildings and people in the path of future destruction, according to researchers and policy advisers who study hurricanes.""History gives us a lesson, but we don't always learn from it,"" said Graham Tobin, a disaster researcher at the University of South Florida in Tampa. That city took a glancing hit from Hurricane Irma — one of the most intense U.S. hurricanes in years — but suffered less flooding and damage than some other parts of the state.In 2005, coastal communities took heed of more than 1,800 deaths and $108 billion in damages from Hurricane Katrina, one of the worst disasters in U.S. history. Images of New Orleans under water elicited solemn resolutions that such a thing should never happen again — until Superstorm Sandy inundated lower Manhattan in 2012. Last year, Hurricane Matthew spread more deaths, flooding and blackouts across Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas. From 2010-2016, major hurricanes and tropical storms are blamed for more than 280 deaths and $100 billion in damages, according to data from the federal National Centers for Environmental Information.Harvey, another historically big hurricane, flooded sections of Houston in recent weeks. Four counties around Houston, where growth has been buoyed by the oil business, took the full force of the storm. The population of those counties expanded by 12 percent from 2010 to 2016, to a total of 5.3 million people, the AP analysis shows.During the same years, two of Florida's fastest-growing coastline counties — retirement-friendly Lee and Manatee, both south of Tampa — welcomed 16 percent more people. That area took a second direct hit from Irma after it made first landfall in the Florida Keys, where damage was far more devastating.Overall growth of 10 percent in Texas Gulf counties and 9 percent along Florida's coasts during the same period was surpassed only by South Carolina. Its seaside population, led by the Myrtle Beach area of Horry County, ballooned by more than 13 percent.Nationally, coastline counties grew an average of 5.6 percent since 2010, while inland counties gained just 4 percent. This recent trend tracks with decades of development along U.S. coasts. Between 1960 and 2008, the national coastline population rose by 84 percent, compared with 64 percent inland, according to the Census Bureau.Cindy Gerstner, a retiree from the inland mountains of upstate New York, moved to a new home in January in Dunedin, Florida, west of Tampa. The ranch house sits on a flood plain three blocks from a sound off the Gulf of Mexico. She was told it hadn't flooded in 20 years — and she wasn't worried anyway.""I never gave it a thought,"" she said during a visit back to New York as Irma raked Florida. ""I always wanted to live down there. I always thought people who lived in California on earthquake faults were foolish.""Her enthusiasm for her new home was undiminished by Irma, which broke her fence and knocked out power but left her house dry.In Horry County, where 19 percent growth has led all of South Carolina coastline counties, Irma caused only minor coastal flooding. The county's low property taxes are made possible by rapid development and tourism fees, allowing retirees from the North and Midwest to live more cheaply. Ironically, punishing hurricanes farther south in recent years has pushed some Northerners known locally as ""half-backers"" to return halfway home from Florida and to resettle in coastal South Carolina.Add the area's moderate weather, appealing golf courses, and long white strands — the county is home to Myrtle Beach — and maybe no one can slow development there. ""I don't see how you do it,"" said Johnny Vaught, vice chairman of the county council. ""The only thing you can do is modulate it, so developments are well designed.""Strong building codes with elevation and drainage requirements, careful emergency preparations, and a good network of roads for evacuation help make the area more resilient to big storms, said the council chairman, Mark Lazarus. Such measures give people ""a sense of comfort,"" said Laura Crowther, CEO of the local Coastal Carolina Association of Realtors.Risk researchers say more is needed. ""We're getting better at emergency response,"" said Tobin at the University of South Florida. ""We're not so good at long-term control of urban development in hazardous areas.""The Federal Emergency Management Agency helps recovery efforts with community relief and flood insurance payments. The agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It provides community grants for projects aimed at avoiding future losses. Some projects elevate properties, build flood barriers, or strengthen roofs and windows against high winds. Others purchase properties subject to repeated damage and allow owners to move.But coastline communities face more storm threats in the future.Global warming from human-generated greenhouse gases is melting polar ice and elevating sea levels at an increasing pace, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That amplifies storm surges and other flooding. Also, some climate models used by scientists predict stronger, more frequent hurricanes as another effect of global warming in coming decades.""There will be some real challenges for coastal towns,"" predicted Jamie Kruse, director of the Center for Natural Hazards Research at East Carolina University in Greenville, North Carolina. ""We'll see some of these homes that are part of their tax base becoming unlivable.""Hazard researchers said they see nothing in the near term to reverse the trend toward bigger storm losses. As a stopgap, communities should cease building new high-rises on the oceanfront, said Robert Young, director of the Program for the Study of Developed Shorelines at Western Carolina University in Cullowhee, North Carolina.He said big changes probably will not happen unless multiple giant storms overwhelm federal and state budgets.""The reason why this development still continues is that people are making money doing it,"" he said. ""Communities are still increasing their tax base — and that's what politicians like.""___Donn reported from Plymouth, Massachusetts.___Online:National Centers for Environmental Information: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/Center for Natural Hazards Research: http://www.ecu.edu/cs-cas/hazards/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration: http://www.noaa.gov/Program for the Study of Developed Shorelines: https://psds.wcu.edu/___HURRICANE NEWSLETTER - Get the best of the AP's all-formats reporting on Irma and Harvey in your inbox: http://apne.ws/ahYQGtb",1

"NOAA lists extreme weather events as one of several phenomena occurring more frequently due to climate change, but attributing specific storms is 'much harder;' James Rosen explains on 'Special Report'After seeing the terrible flooding, property destruction, power outages and tragic deaths caused by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, we all wish we could do something to keep future hurricanes from forming or make them less severe. Unfortunately, we can’t.But despite what you hear from environmental extremists – who oppose the use of oil, coal and natural gas – even if we stopped using these fossil fuels tomorrow hurricanes would still be part of our natural world. They always have been and always will be.Radical greens and their political and media allies have latched onto the suffering caused by Harvey and Irma to advance their ideological jihad against fossil fuels. They want to keep these valuable resources locked up underground and never used to provide the efficient, reliable and affordable energy that makes our economy and modern life possible.The extremists don’t care that ending our use of fossil fuels would dramatically reduce our living standards by making energy much more scarce and expensive, or that the poor would suffer far more than the wealthy.My geology, ecology and natural resources background taught me that climate change has been “real” throughout our planet’s history, including long before humans walked the Earth.Some on the left are also using Harvey and Irma as yet another weapon in their non-stop attacks on President Trump, his administration, Republicans and our very way of life.My geology, ecology and natural resources background taught me that climate change has been “real” throughout our planet’s history, including long before humans walked the Earth. I’ve studied climate change, spoken at length with dozens of renowned experts, and written numerous articles explaining climate, energy and environmental issues in lay terms.I’ve learned to be humble, respectful and vigilant in the face of nature’s power; to recognize that climate change can range from beneficial or benign to harmful or unbelievably destructive; and to understand that the sun and other powerful natural forces totally dwarf whatever meager powers humans might muster in attempting to control Earth’s climate and weather.Hurricane Harvey marked the end of a record 12-year absence of Category 3 to 5 hurricanes hitting the U.S. mainland. If global warming was the reason our nation is being battered by major hurricanes this year, how do you explain their absence for the past dozen years? There hasn’t been such a long period when the U.S. was free of major hurricanes since 1860 to 1869.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Hurricane Research Division counts ten Category 4 and 5 monster hurricanes in the U.S. between 1920 and 1969 – but only three between 1970 and 2016, when our planet was warming more rapidly. If warming causes more severe hurricanes, the number of big storms should have been greater in the latter period and fewer in the earlier part of the 20th century.If Harvey’s rainfall was due to growing fossil fuel use and atmospheric carbon dioxide, how do you explain previous deluges like Hurricane Easy (45 inches in Florida in 1950), Tropical Cyclone Amelia (48 inches in Texas in 1978) and Tropical Storm Claudette (a record 43 inches in 24 hours on Alvin, Texas in 1979), when global fossil fuel use was much lower?Natural factors not affected by manmade climate change played a key role in enabling Harvey and Irma to strike with such devastating force.Consulting meteorologist Joe D’Aleo notes that “hurricanes entering Texas are almost always very wet and often stall or meander.”WeatherBELL Analytics chief forecaster Joe Bastardi explains that a large (and predicted) cool trough trapped Harvey and kept it from moving inland, enabling the Gulf of Mexico to feed it trillions of gallons of water for days,It was “an unusual confluence of events,” said Weather Channel founder John Coleman, “but it was certainly not unprecedented.”If there was a “human factor” in Harvey and Irma, climate alarmists need to explain exactly where it was, how big it was and what role it played. They must present hard evidence to show that fossil fuels and carbon dioxide emissions played a significant role compared to the hundreds of natural forces involved in these storms. They have done none of these things and cannot.The Atlantic, Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico are warm enough every summer to produce major hurricanes, says climatologist Roy Spencer. But you also need other conditions that have unknown origins and mechanisms: pre-existing cyclonic circulation off the African coast, upper atmospheric calm, and sea surface temperatures that change on a cyclical basis in various regions, to name just a few.The combination of all these factors – plus weather fronts and land masses along the way – determines whether a hurricane arises, how strong it gets, how long it lasts and what track it follows.Damage from hurricanes has certainly increased over the years. But that’s because far more people now live and work in far more homes and businesses in many expensive communities along America’s Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. Since 1920, Greater Houston grew from 138,000 people to 5.7 million; Miami from 43,000 to 6.1 million; Tampa from 50,000 to 3 million.Meanwhile, hurricane death tolls have declined dramatically over the years, despite much larger populations today in areas in the path of the storms. This is thanks in part to fossil fuels that enable us to construct stronger buildings; track storms; evacuate and rescue people; and bring in water, food, clothing, and materials to rebuild.Our Earth is a complex, wondrous, resilient planet. But it can unleash incredible fury. Wealthy, technologically advanced nations fueled by oil, natural gas, coal and nuclear power are far better able to avoid, survive and recover from those disasters.",1
"NASHVILLE, Tenn. – Drought-stricken Great Smoky Mountains National Park was not prepared for last year's catastrophic fire, and climate change is among the factors that will likely make conditions that led to the disaster the ""new normal"" for the park, according to a federal review released Thursday.At a news conference, National Park Service officials said it was impossible to predict that hurricane-force winds around 90 mph would blow the fire from the remote, rough terrain of the park into the Gatlinburg area in November. The fire merged with others, contributing to 14 deaths and up to $2 billion of damage.""No one expected a tragedy of this scale 5.5 miles from the city to occur,"" U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke said via webcam at the news conference.No one acted negligently as they tried to quell a fire that they couldn't have imagined, the review team said, but problems ensued when park fire staffers couldn't communicate with some other agencies' first responders because of serious radio limitations.In response, the park will undergo a $2.5 million radio communications system upgrade, seven neighboring fire departments will receive reportable radios and protective equipment, and an emphasis will be placed on clearing out dead and dying trees, among other changes.The report calls on park leaders to challenge long-held assumptions and practices about managing fires. The same drastic circumstances — drought, heavy wind and fire — will likely align again and allow a large-scale wildfire to leave the park and burn into residential areas, it says.""Changes in wildland fuels resulting from past land management practices, climatic change, and decades of fire suppression have all conspired to create a fire exclusion conundrum that can no longer be ignored,"" the report states.Joe Stutler, a senior advisor for Deschutes County, Oregon who led the review team, pointed to last year's wildfire activity amid drought across the Southeast.""I'm certainly not going to engage in a debate on change or climate change, but I can tell you that what we're seeing, we're hearing the phrase, 'I've never seen that before in my entire career.'"" Stutler said. ""So, those are the changes that we're talking about.""On Thursday, Zinke said it was appropriate that fire crews decided not to attack the fire in the park, and instead try to contain it.Authorities said two juveniles started the fire on Nov. 23 and it left the park on Nov. 28. Local prosecutors dropped charges against the boys in June because other fires from downed power lines contributed to the inferno in Gatlinburg. Federal prosecutors have said they're reviewing the case.The park had not requested sufficient extra resources for the fire season, and only asked for additional hours for existing staff, the report said. Its own crews were fatigued because they had been steadily fighting fires since July amid a lively fire season, it says.The National Weather Service had not issued ""Red Flag Warnings"" for extreme burn conditions because the weather didn't fit the criteria in the area, the review team said.The set of circumstances presented a perfect storm that ravaged Gatlinburg, leaving people without cell phone signals trapped in their cars, buildings and on foot while trees and power lines blocked roadways and walls of flames closed in.""The whole mountain is on fire up here,"" one woman said in a 911 call released in a public records request. ""We're trying to make our way down, but I think we're all going to burn up quick. Can you do something?""",1

          Daffodils bloom in February 2017 in New York's Central Park. Federal meteorologists say a freakishly warm February broke more than 11,700 local records in the U.S.
          (AP)WASHINGTON – A freakishly balmy February broke more than 11,700 local daily records for warmth in the United States, but it didn't quite beat 1954 for the warmest February on record, climate scientists said.The average temperature last month was 41.2 degrees — 7.3 degrees warmer than normal but three-tenths a degree behind the record, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported Wednesday.It was unseasonably toasty for most of the country east of the Rockies, but a cool Pacific Northwest kept the national record from falling, said NOAA climate scientist Jake Crouch.Chicago had no snow. Oklahoma hit 99 degrees. Texas and Louisiana had their hottest February. NOAA said local weather stations broke or tied warm temperature records 11,743 times but set cold records only 418 times.An international science team's computer analysis of causes of extreme weather calculated that man-made global warming tripled the likelihood for the nation's unusually warm February. The mostly private team of researchers, called World Weather Attribution, uses accepted scientific techniques to figure if climate change plays a role in extreme events based on computer simulations of real world conditions and those without heat-trapping gases.""I don't recall ever seeing a February like this,"" said Princeton University climate scientist Gabe Vecchi, who was part of the quick attribution study that was not peer reviewed. ""We expect this to happen with more and more frequency over time.""Several outside scientists praised the quick study including Pennsylvania State University meteorology professor David Titley, who was on a National Academy of Sciences panel that certified the accuracy of climate change attribution science.""This is the new climate normal that we all need to come to grips with,"" Titley said. ""And it's stunning how quickly our climate has changed.""Natural random weather variations and climate change combined to make it a weird February, meteorologists said.Overall, NOAA said it was the sixth warmest U.S. winter on record, about 3.7 degrees warmer than the 20th century average.""You definitely do feel that this is going to be something that you get to enjoy now and you pay for after the fact,"" said Vecchi, who was biking in short-sleeves in New Jersey last month.Oklahoma University meteorology professor Jason Furtado said he worries that the lack of deep Arctic cold plunges in February means the Gulf of Mexico never cooled down. And when severe weather season in the spring starts, the moisture coming north from warmer Gulf waters will goose outbreaks and increase the probability of nasty spring storms and tornadoes. Massachusetts already had an unprecedented February tornado.A March frost could kill early blooming trees and flowers and the lack of a proper winter could lead to more mosquitoes and ticks this year, Vecchi said.""What is lurking behind the corner while we're outside throwing a Frisbee might be looking to make our lives less pleasant,"" he said.",1

          In this Wednesday, Nov. 23, 2016, photo, a cows are seen feeding at the New Hope Dairy in Galt, Calif.
          (AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli)GALT, Calif. – California is taking its fight against global warming to the farm.The nation's leading agricultural state is now targeting greenhouse gases produced by dairy cows and other livestock.Despite strong opposition from farmers, Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation in September that for the first time regulates heat-trapping gases from livestock operations and landfills.Cattle and other farm animals are major sources of methane, a greenhouse gas many times more potent than carbon dioxide as a heat-trapping gas. Methane is released when they belch, pass gas and make manure.""If we can reduce emissions of methane, we can really help to slow global warming,"" said Ryan McCarthy, a science adviser for the California Air Resources Board, which is drawing up rules to implement the new law.Livestock are responsible for 14.5 percent of human-induced greenhouse gas emissions, with beef and dairy production accounting for the bulk of it, according to a 2013 United Nations report.Since the passage of its landmark global warming law in 2006, California has been reducing carbon emissions from cars, trucks, homes and factories, while boosting production of renewable energy.In the nation's largest milk-producing state, the new law aims to reduce methane emissions from dairies and livestock operations to 40 percent below 2013 levels by 2030, McCarthy said. State officials are developing the regulations, which take effect in 2024.""We expect that this package ... and everything we're doing on climate, does show an effective model forward for others,"" McCarthy said.Dairy farmers say the new regulations will drive up costs when they're already struggling with five years of drought, low milk prices and rising labor costs. They're also concerned about a newly signed law that will boost overtime pay for farmworkers.""It just makes it more challenging. We're continuing to lose dairies. Dairies are moving out of state to places where these costs don't exist,"" said Paul Sousa, director of environmental services for Western United Dairymen.The dairy industry could be forced to move production to states and countries with fewer regulations, leading to higher emissions globally, Sousa said.""We think it's very foolish for the state of California to be taking this position,"" said Rob Vandenheuvel, general manager for the Milk Producers Council. ""A single state like California is not going to make a meaningful impact on the climate.""Regulators are looking for ways to reduce so-called enteric emissions — methane produced by bovine digestive systems. That could eventually require changes to what cattle eat.But the biggest target is dairy manure, which accounts for about a quarter of the state's methane emissions.State regulators want more farmers to reduce emissions with methane digesters, which capture methane from manure in large storage tanks and convert the gas into electricity.The state has set aside $50 million to help dairies set up digesters, but farmers say that's not nearly enough to equip the state's roughly 1,500 dairies.New Hope Dairy, which has 1,500 cows in Sacramento County, installed a $4 million methane digester in 2013, thanks to state grants and a partnership with California Biogas LLC, which operates the system to generate renewable power for the Sacramento Municipal Utility District.Co-owner Arlin Van Groningen, a third-generation farmer, says he couldn't afford one if he had to buy and run it himself.""The bottom line is it's going to negatively impact the economics of the California dairy industry,"" Van Groningen said of the new law. ""In the dairy business, the margins are so slim that something like this will force us out of state.""State officials say they're committed to making sure the new regulations work for farmers and the environment.""There's a real opportunity here to get very significant emissions reductions at fairly low cost, and actually in a way that can bring economic benefits to farmers,"" Ryan said.",1

          Secretary of Energy Rick Perry speaks at 2017 SelectUSA Investment Summit in Oxon Hill, Maryland, U.S., June 19, 2017.
          (REUTERS/Joshua Roberts )Asked in an interview on CNBCs “Squawk Box” whether he believed carbon dioxide was “the primary control knob for the temperature of the Earth and for climate,” Energy Secretary Rick Perry said, “No, most likely the primary control knob is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in.”Perry added, “the fact is this shouldn’t be a debate about, ‘Is the climate changing, is man having an effect on it?’ Yeah, we are. The question should be just how much, and what are the policy changes that we need to make to effect that?”In response, the Executive Director of the American Meteorological Society (AMS), Keith Seitter, said in a letter to Perry (emphasis added):While you acknowledged that the climate is changing and that humans are having an impact on it, it is critically important that you understand that emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are the primary cause.This is a conclusion based on the comprehensive assessment of scientific evidence. It is based on multiple independent lines of evidence that have been affirmed by thousands of independent scientists and numerous scientific institutions around the world.We are not familiar with any scientific institution with relevant subject matter expertise that has reached a different conclusion. These indisputable findings have shaped our current AMS Statement on Climate Change, which states:“It is clear from extensive scientific evidence that the dominant cause of the rapid change in climate of the past half century is human-induced increases in the amount of atmospheric greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide (CO2), chlorofluorocarbons, methane, and nitrous oxide.”Most of the headlines I’ve seen on the CNBC interview, like one in the Washington Post, refer to Perry with the usual “denier” terms.Does Perry deserve the epithet? And was AMS’s Seitter right to scold him?Basically, Perry is saying he believes nature has a larger role than humans in recent warming. I, too, believe the oceans might well be a primary driver of climate change, but whether the human/nature ratio is 50/50, or less, or more than that is up for debate. We simply don’t know.So, while Sec. Perry goes against the supposed consensus of scientists, what he said was not outlandish, and it wasn’t a denial of a known fact. It was a valid opinion on an uncertain area of science.Seitter calls the claims in his letter “indisputable.” Really? In my opinion, the AMS view (which draws upon the U.N. IPCC view) is much more definitively stated than the evidence warrants.Sure, all the scientific institutions are on the bandwagon, with politically savvy committees agreeing with each other. They are, in effect, being paid by the government to agree with the consensus through billions of dollars in grants and contracts.No global warming crisis, no government funding—or very little—to study it. And then thousands of climate-dependent careers (including mine) cease to exist.That money also trickles down to the AMS, which is paid to hold scientific conferences and workshops and publish the resulting research studies in scientific journals. They have a vested interest in keeping the gravy train going.So, maybe I can ask the AMS: Just what percentage of recent warming was natural in origin? None? 10%? 40%? How do you know? Why was the pre-1940 warming rate—caused by Mother Nature—almost as strong as recent warming?The truth is, no one knows just how much of recent warming was human-caused, including those thousands of “independent” scientists. They pin the blame on CO2 partly because that’s all they can think of, and we still don’t understand natural sources of climate change.Besides, in the climate business, there are no thousands of independent scientists, anyway. They live and work in an echo chamber, and very few have the breadth and depth of knowledge to make an informed judgement on the issue. The vast majority are specialists in some narrow field of research. They go along to get along … and to keep funding coming.Young climate researchers today cannot voice doubts about anthropogenic global warming, or they might not have a career. They can’t go to Big Energy for research funding because, as far as I know, such funding does not exist. Big Energy knows they don’t have to pay people to prop up petroleum, natural gas, and coal, because the world (for the time being) runs on the stuff.What we do know with considerable confidence is that increasing CO2 should cause some warming. (I’ll admit that my opinion here is mostly based upon a theoretical extrapolation from laboratory measurements of how CO2 absorbs and emits infrared energy.) But we really don’t know how much. We certainly don’t have enough confidence to claim it is “indisputable” that our greenhouse gas emissions are the dominant cause, as Seitter claims.I am ashamed that the climate research community allows such pronouncements to be made. The AMS became a global warming advocacy group many years ago, and as a result it lost a lot of established members, including myself.",1

"WASHINGTON – Killer heat is getting worse, a new study shows.Deadly heat waves like the one now broiling the American West are bigger killers than previously thought and they are going to grow more frequent, according to a new comprehensive study of fatal heat conditions. Still, those stretches may be less lethal in the future, as people become accustomed to them.A team of researchers examined 1,949 deadly heat waves from around the world since 1980 to look for trends, define when heat is so severe it kills and forecast the future. They found that nearly one in three people now experience 20 days a year when the heat reaches deadly levels. But the study predicts that up to three in four people worldwide will endure that kind of heat by the end of the century, if global warming continues unabated.""The United States is going to be an oven,"" said Camilo Mora of the University of Hawaii, lead author of a study published Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change .The study comes as much of the U.S. swelters through extended triple-digit heat. Temperatures hit records of 106, 105 and 103 in Santa Rosa, Livermore and San Jose, California on Sunday, as a heat wave was forecast to continue through midweek. In late May, temperatures in Turbat, Pakistan, climbed to about 128 degrees (53.5 degrees Celsius); if confirmed, that could be among the five hottest temperatures reliably measured on Earth, said Jeff Masters, meteorology director of Weather Underground.Last year 22 countries or territories set or tied records for their hottest temperatures on record, said Masters, who wasn't part of the study. So far this year, seven have done so.""This is already bad. We already know it,"" Mora said. ""The empirical data suggest it's getting much worse.""Mora and colleagues created an interactive global map with past heat waves and computer simulations to determine how much more frequent they will become under different carbon dioxide pollution scenarios. The map shows that under the current pollution projections, the entire eastern United States will have a significant number of killer heat days. Even higher numbers are predicted for the Southeast U.S., much of Central and South America, central Africa, India, Pakistan, much of Asia and Australia.Mora and outside climate scientists said the study and map underestimate past heat waves in many poorer hot areas where record-keeping is weak. It's more accurate when it comes to richer areas like the United States and Europe.If pollution continues as it has, Mora said, by the end of the century the southern United States will have entire summers of what he called lethal heat conditions.A hotter world doesn't necessarily mean more deaths in all locales, Mora said. That's because he found over time the same blistering conditions — heat and humidity — killed fewer people than in the past, mostly because of air conditioning and governments doing a better job keeping people from dying in the heat. So while heat kills and temperatures are rising, people are adapting, though mostly in countries that can afford it. And those that can't afford it are likely to get worse heat in the future.""This work confirms the alarming projections of increasing hot days over coming decades — hot enough to threaten lives on a very large scale,"" said Dr. Howard Frumkin, a University of Washington environmental health professor who wasn't part of the study.Mora documented more than 100,000 deaths since 1980, but said there are likely far more because of areas that didn't have good data. Not all of them were caused by man-made climate change.Just one heat wave — in Europe in 2003 — killed more than 70,000 people.___Online:Nature Climate Change: http://www.nature.com/nclimateInteractive map of heat waves: http://arcg.is/2tuZFIH___Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at @borenbears .

"SAN FRANCISCO – Germany's environment minister is offering encouragement for American efforts against climate change, saying the Earth's climate will last longer than Donald Trump's presidency.German Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks spoke Friday alongside Gov. Jerry Brown at a news conference in San Francisco. She notes that the United States limits presidents to two, four-year terms. Jokingly, the German official says that the climate can make it eight years.Trump announced last week he would pull out of the 2015 Paris climate accord. The accord has most of the world's countries committing to cutting emissions from climate-changing fossil fuels.Brown says the U.S. retreat from a leadership role on climate change is temporary. The California leader says he believes Trump's decision to leave the Paris accord will eventually be reversed.",1
"Announces U.S. will withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement; reaction and analysis on 'The Five'For sheer hilarity and hyperbole it’s hard to beat a recent headline on a Washington Post editorial opposing President Trump’s decision to remove the U.S. from the nonbinding and unenforceable Paris climate agreement.“Trump turns his back on the world,” it screamed.A close second goes to the headline on a New York Times piece by columnist David Brooks: “Donald Trump Poisons the World.”Dishonorable mention goes to former presidential adviser David Gergen, who said on CNN that Trump had committed “one of the most shameful acts in U.S. history.”The secular progressives have again revealed their diminished capacity, which ought to disqualify them from leading anything, especially the country.The central argument supporting “climate change” has been that a “scientific consensus” exists on the subject. Two things about this. The first is that climate scientists who disagree on that consensus have been largely shutout of the debate. Their papers and ideas are blocked from mainstream scientific journals and, thus, are not subject to peer review. Politics appears to have overshadowed science.Second, there have been numerous cases in the not too distant past where an empirical conclusion among scientists was touted as rock-solid truth, but which later, after further examination, proved to be dead wrong. As with climate change, politicians and editorialists told us we had to accept the conclusions, related costs and possibly even diminished lifestyles in order to save the planet. After all, these were scientists and were thought by many to be as close to God as secularists get.Newsweek magazine featured a cover story in 1975 about “global cooling.” That was supposed to be a scientific consensus.A June 2010 article in Reason magazine lists some of the other Chicken Little claims about doomsday being just around the corner. The magazine’s science writer, Ronald Bailey, found a July 1, 1979 issue of The Washington Post claiming a “broad scientific consensus” that saccharin causes cancer. It took 30 years before the National Cancer Institute reported, “There is no clear evidence that saccharin causes cancer in humans.”That same year, notes Bailey, the Post published a story citing researchers who believed eating more fiber appeared to significantly reduce the incidence of colon cancer. “Twenty years later,” writes Bailey, “a major prospective study of nearly 90,000 women reported that, ‘No significant association between fiber intake and the risk of colorectal adenoma was found.’”Prior to 1985, there was “scientific consensus” that acid rain caused by electricity generating plants fueled by coal and emitting sulfur dioxide was destroying vast acres of forests and lakes in the eastern U.S. In 1991, notes Bailey, “after 10 years and $500 million, the National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program study … concluded, “That acid rain was not damaging forests, did not hurt crops, and caused no measurable health problems.”There is much more in the article that is worth reading. It should humble the scientists, politicians and editorialists who want us to embrace another “scientific consensus” on “climate change.”President Trump should counter his critics by convening a White House conference on climate. In addition to the apostles of climate change, he should invite scientists — and only those specializing in climate science — that have been marginalized from the debate. These would include MIT climate scientist Dr. Richard Lindzen, who claims believing that CO2 controls the climate “is pretty close to believing in magic.”None of those participating in the proposed conference should be academics or scientists who receive federal grants or have other connections to government. This might give them a conflict of interest and reduce their credibility.Let’s have a high-level debate on this issue and settle it once and for all.",1
"Bill Peduto responds after President Trump invokes city in speechPittsburgh's Democratic Mayor Bill Peduto signed an executive order on Friday promising the city will continue to comply with the Paris Climate Agreement, joining at least 91 other cities defying President Trump's decision to withdraw the U.S. from the global climate commitment.Under the executive order, Pittsburgh will continue working toward clean energy climate objectives, including 100 percent renewable energy consumption for municipal operations by 2030. The Pittsburgh mayor on Thursday blasted the President's decision to abandon the Paris accord, stating ""it will set us back decades.""The steel city became the focal point of the opposition to Trump's climate decision after the president said he backed out of the Paris deal because it was unfair to the U.S. ""I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris,"" was his signature line from the speech.Peduto told the local Pittsburgh press he was ""personally offended"" by the Trump's speech. In part, he said, for evoking a dated image of Pittsburgh as an old city stuck in the 19th century, relying on steel and coal.""During the 80s and 90s, we said our future economy may not be based on big manufacturing and we were able to turn the corner and build a new economy,"" Peduto said. ""Pittsburgh is the poster child of showing why the Paris agreement is good economics for the United States.""After the collapse of the steel industry in the 80s Pittsburgh was forced to reinvent itself. Today, the city has turned into a tech hub -- Google, Amazon, Apple, and Uber have offices there. The city is now home to about 10,000 startup tech firms, according to the Pittsburgh Technology Council.The shift in the economy is 30 years in the making. The largest private employer is no longer steel in Pittsburgh, it is is now the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, with 65,000 employees. In fact, over the last 20 years, manufacturing jobs in the city have fallen 33 percent (82,900) while education and healthcare service jobs have risen 34 percent (248,600), according to the Bureau of labor statistics.Pittsburgh's mayor has also said that President Trump does not represent the vast majority of voters in Pittsburgh. Citing the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Peduto is quick to point out that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton won 77 percent of the vote in Pittsburgh.""Maybe he should have a speech writer that understands the difference between cities and regions and not just try to use cute iteration in order to make a point,"" the mayor said Thursday.On a map, Pittsburgh is a blue liberal haven in an ocean of red conservative counties. Republicans and those in the fossil fuel industries point out while Allegheny County voted for Clinton, the state of Pennsylvania voted for Trump, including every other county in Western Pennsylvania.In the 3rd district, just north of the city of Pittsburgh, Republican Rep. Mike Kelly supports Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord.""It would result in unfair domestic harm for American workers, taxpayers, consumers, manufacturers, and energy producers,"" Kelly said in a statement. ""We would shoulder most of the cost and gain no measurable reward.""Communities in counties around Pittsburgh rely more on the fossil fuel energy industry than the city itself. The Pennsylvania Coal Alliance applauded the president for backing out of a deal ""which put America’s competitiveness at risk and threatened energy independence and economic security.""Just 50 miles southeast of Pittsburgh, the president said he might attend the opening ceremony of a brand new coal mine in Acosta by Corsa Coal Corporation,  which would add 70 new jobs. The coal industry has lost 2,400 jobs in Pennsylvania since 2007, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St.Louis. Only 4,800 jobs are left.""We want a level playing field for all forms of energy, whether that's any sort of fossil fuels, coal, oil, natural gas or renewable or hydro,"" Corsa Coal Corporation CEO George Dethlefsen told Fox News. ""And if we can get that, we think that coal can compete effectively.""Meantime, the natural gas industry in Pennsylvania says it is optimistic that Trump will figure out a deal that will be good for the environment and for natural gas. The industry has exploded in Pennsylvania since the discovery of the Marcellus Shale, and the advent of hydrofracking, quadrupling natural gas jobs since 2007 to over 20,000 in the state. Natural gas companies hope Trump will invest in infrastructure to make it easier to ship excess supplies of natural gas worldwide.""I think if you take a look at what the president said in his speech, he commented about the fact that there may be a better deal for America,"" said David J. Spigelmyer, President of the Marcellus Shale Coalition. ""We are going to turn the page and use American energy as our American advantage and our international advantage I think we have that opportunity today.""",1

Bob Casey, D.-Pa., also took issue with the president’s Pittsburgh mention, tweeting that if Trump “really wanted to help the people of Pittsburgh, he would protect their clean air & opportunity for jobs.”Conversely, Casey argued, Pittsburgh residents support moves to halt climate change. “Earlier this year I held a town hall in Pittsburgh & the residents in attendance called for action on climate change,” Casey tweeted.Around 200 nations, including the U.S. under President Barack Obama's administration, agreed to voluntarily reduce their greenhouse gas emissions as part of the deal.",1

          Former vice president Al Gore tried to purchase Twitter over a bottle of tequila.
          Former Vice President Al Gore blasted the decision of President Donald Trump to remove the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement on Thursday, calling it ""reckless"" and ""indefensible.""Gore, who has made two documentaries advocating climate change action, said in a statement, “Removing the United States from the Paris Agreement is a reckless and indefensible action. It undermines America’s standing in the world and threatens to damage humanity’s ability to solve the climate crisis in time. But make no mistake: if President Trump won’t lead, the American people will.""Civic leaders, mayors, governors, CEOs, investors and the majority of the business community will take up this challenge,"" Gore said. ""We are in the middle of a clean energy revolution that no single person or group can stop. President Trump’s decision is profoundly in conflict with what the majority of Americans want from our president; but no matter what he does, we will ensure that our inevitable transition to a clean energy economy continues.”PARIS AGREEMENT ON CLIMATE CHANGE: WASHINGTON REACTS TO US PULLOUT“The Paris accord will undermine our economy,” Trump said during the announcement in the White House Rose Garden. Participating in the deal, the president argued, “puts us at a permanent disadvantage.”“It’s time to exit,” he said.The Paris Climate Agreement is a pact among nearly 200 nations made to voluntarily cut greenhouse gas emissions in an effort to combat climate change. Under the terms of the deal the U.S., the world’s second largest emitter of carbon, would be required to reduce fossil fuel emissions around 30 percent by 2025.Gore and Trump previously met at Trump Tower in New York City in December. Gore called the conversation he had with Trump at the time “extremely interesting.”",1
"President says his first responsibility is to put American workers first, will seek to negotiate a better dealPresident Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord has sparked widespread hysteria in juice bars and luxury spas across Hollywood.As a candidate, Trump vowed to “cancel” the Paris climate deal – slamming what he called “draconian climate rules.”Click here for a free subscription to Todd’s newsletter: a must-read for Conservatives!“The Paris accord is very unfair at the highest level to the United States,” the president told a gathering Thursday in the Rose Garden.House Speaker Paul Ryan praised the president’s decision and thanked him for “withdrawing from this bad deal.”“The Paris climate agreement was simply a raw deal for America,” Ryan said. “Signed by President Obama without Senate ratification, it would have driven up the cost of energy, hitting middle-class and low-income Americans the hardest.”But some of Hollywood’s most esteemed scientists fear the president’s decision will put the nation on a slippery slope to the hothouse – an apocalyptic future with homeless Eskimos and polar bears unable to put their Coca-Colas on ice.Click here to join the fastest-growing Conservative page on Facebook!“If this is true he will have the death of whole nations on his hands,” warned scientist/actor Mark Ruffalo. “People will be looking to the USA for retribution for what they loose.”I wonder which nation will be the first to spontaneously combust –  Iceland?

It’s an inconvenient truth, but it needed to be said.And many of us appreciate President Trump putting America first – instead of a bunch of godless European vegetarians who don’t put ice in their soft drinks.“I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris,” the president said in the Rose Garden.So, let’s celebrate, America!

"President announces decision to pull out of the Paris climate agreement When the Paris climate agreement was signed in April 2016, it was touted by the Obama administration and a vast array of its climate-alarmist proponents as a supreme victory for the global environmental movement. Now, a little more than a year later, the agreement that had effectively been in the works for nearly a decade in one form or another is dead, and with it, much of President Barack Obama’s climate-change legacy.Americans of every stripe should celebrate the Paris agreement’s demise, for it represents a stunning victory for taxpayers and middle- and lower-income families and the elevation of science over irrational fears about the future of Earth’s climate.The Paris climate agreement required the United States to cut its carbon dioxide emissions by 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. To meet this target, the United States would have had to reduce its emissions by such a radical extent that virtually every aspect of American life would have been negatively impacted.Mandates would have forced the closure of many of the least-expensive power plants nationwide, raising energy prices at a time of tepid economic growth and sky-high deficits. Manufacturers, domestic energy producers, and countless related industries would have been driven out of business or forced to significantly scale back their operations while taxpayer-subsidized, inefficient, high-cost renewable-energy industries thrived—all at the expense of everyday Americans.Under the Paris agreement, major economic and geopolitical competitors—including China, India, and Russia—would have been allowed to grow their low-cost carbon dioxide emissions while the United States would have been forced to implement draconian cuts, making their economies comparatively more attractive to corporations looking to slash costs and significantly reducing Americans’ ability to compete in an increasingly global marketplace.Despite the Paris agreement’s immense costs, the treaty’s proponents insist it is a necessary step forward in the alleged battle against human-caused climate change. But even the U.N. Environment Programme, a noted climate alarmist agency, admitted on its own website the treaty would deliver no meaningful environmental improvements.According to the United Nations’ post-Paris analysis, if all the parties to the agreement were to meet their promised emissions goals, the Paris treaty would result in less than half the greenhouse gas cuts required to halt temperatures at an upper limit of 2 degrees Celsius. Even if one believes human greenhouse gas emissions are driving dangerous climate change—and we think the best science shows they aren’t—the Paris agreement would not have prevented one iota of rising temperatures, sea levels, or instances of extreme weather.Climate alarmists, including some within the White House, have told the president any rollback of the Paris agreement would have detrimental political consequences for the president. Thankfully, Trump was not swayed by these empty threats. There was absolutely no political upside for Trump to reverse course on his campaign promise to exit the Paris agreement. Had he done so, left-wing environmentalists would not have suddenly fallen in love with Trump, and the “swamp” Republican establishment wouldn’t have warmly embraced him either.However, what would have unquestionably occurred had Trump kept the Paris treaty alive is there would have been a tidal wave of criticism from climate skeptics and working class Americans, turning some of the president’s closest allies into his fieriest critics.By rejecting climate alarmists’ sky-is-falling political fear mongering, Trump adamantly declared he isn’t interested in being bullied by the anti-science, redistributionist zealots on the left. Instead, Trump is standing alongside entrepreneurs, business owners, and working American families, many of whom voted for Trump in November, in declaring with one voice that U.S. climate and energy policies ought to put America first.",1
"President announces decision to pull out of the Paris climate agreement Editor's note: The following column is adapted from a post which originally appeared on AEIdeas.org, the blog of the American Enterprise Institute.The left-wing Guardian newspaper said the president’s decision to withdraw from the global climate treaty signed by his Democratic predecessor represents “a blunt rebuff to European hopes” and has turned America into “the ultimate rogue state.”Britain’s Independent declared: “It is not even isolationism, it is in-your-face truculence.” The president of France called the decision “disturbing and unacceptable.” The US National Environmental Trust declared: “This is no way to conduct policy. It looks like amateur hour at the White House.”The president being attacked is not Donald Trump. It is George W. Bush, who was chastised for his 2001 decision to withdraw the United States from the Kyoto treaty on global climate change signed by the Clinton administration.Of course, the predicted apocalypse never happened. To the contrary, the Wall Street Journal reports that after Bush’s withdrawal the U.S. “reduced emissions faster than much of Europe thanks to business innovation—namely, hydraulic fracturing that is replacing coal with natural gas.”It turns out that technology, not treaties, is the best way to curb emissions – and to do so without harming consumers by dramatically increasing the cost of electricity.In the years after Bush’s Kyoto withdrawal, electricity prices in the U.S. were half of the European Union average (which went up by 55% from 2005 to 2013) and one-third of the price in Germany—where emissions, ironically, went up thanks to the abandonment of nuclear power.No matter; the left-wing outrage machine savaged Bush anyway, just it is savaging Trump today for his pending announcement of America’s withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement signed by Barack Obama.Keep the pangs of outrage in perspective. We’ve seen this movie many times before. Republican president withdraws from cherished international agreement. Left goes into apoplexy. Rinse and repeat.It’s like Groundhog Day.The same thing happened when Bush withdrew the U.S. signature from the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. The Guardian declared it would “provoke anger from the international community, and provide further evidence for what many see as the Bush administration’s increasing unilateralism.” Judge Richard Goldstone, the chief prosecutor at The Hague war crimes tribunal on the former Yugoslavia called it “unprecedented” and “a very backwards step” that “smacks of pettiness” adding, “The US have really isolated themselves and are putting themselves into bed with the likes of China, the Yemen and other undemocratic countries.”To continue reading Marc Thiessen's column on AEIdeas, click here.",1

They've worked as a stall and diversion, a way to say something without having to say anything, until the next shooting happens and everyone moves on.Because everyone does move on now. And they will again, more quickly each time. This is the new nightmare — that we've become deadened to the worst in us because it no longer feels like the worst. It's just who we are, and it's our turn to live it.Online:https://www.charlotteobserver.com/___April 30The Washington Post on unrest in Venezuela:Deep uncertainty surrounds the latest events in Venezuela. Tuesday began with a pre-dawn recorded address to the public by interim president Juan Guaidó, who stood with members of the security forces at a Caracas air base and declared that a long-anticipated barracks uprising against the regime of Nicolás Maduro had begun. Accompanying Mr. Guaidó was opposition leader Leopoldo López, apparently released from his four-year detention by defecting guards. Venezuelans responded to Mr. Guaidó's call for street protests and were met by troops loyal to Mr. Maduro. By late afternoon, clashes were taking place, regime officials were promising a decisive ""counterattack,"" and there was no way to know whether ""Operation Liberty,"" as Mr. Guaidó dubbed this high-risk move, would succeed or be crushed — or devolve into civil war.What is not, or should not be, ambiguous is the political and moral essence of this volatile situation. The Maduro regime has violated human rights on a massive scale, leaving hundreds of peaceful opponents dead, and it has led Venezuela into economic catastrophe. Millions of Venezuelans have fled to other countries, including hundreds of thousands to the United States. Having first been elected in 2013, Mr. Maduro forfeited democratic legitimacy in January 2016, when he purported to deprive the National Assembly of its powers because the opposition had won control the previous month. He then manipulated the political system to create a parallel puppet legislature and, on May 20, 2018, engineered his re-election through a flawed process from which both international observers and leading opposition figures were effectively barred. His inauguration as president for a new term in January, in defiance of warnings from neighboring Latin democracies, prompted Mr. Guaidó, leader of the National Assembly, to declare the presidential office vacant and himself its interim occupant, as provided in the Venezuelan Constitution — and supported by more than 50 countries, including the United States.Therefore, whatever its ultimate outcome or, indeed, its strategic wisdom, Tuesday's uprising is not a ""coup attempt,"" as the Maduro regime, echoed by too many people abroad, calls it. Rather, it is the latest in a series of legitimate and, for the most part, nonviolent efforts by Venezuelans, both civilian and military, to throw off an oppressive, toxic regime so that they can freely elect a legitimate government. Supporters of freedom and democracy should stand in solidarity with Mr. Guaidó and the many thousands of Venezuelans now bravely asserting their rights.The Trump administration has backed Mr. Guaidó, including — appropriately — through the use of tough new economic sanctions aimed at pressuring the Maduro regime to cede power, or persuading the Venezuelan military to oust him itself. Possibly, Tuesday's events are a sign that Mr. Trump's policy is succeeding; or, possibly, that there is nothing left of it but desperate measures. A hopeful sign was the immediate and unequivocal backing Mr. Guaidó received from six South American nations, including Venezuela's four largest neighbors: Colombia, Ecuador, Brazil and Peru. By working closely with these countries, and not by intervening militarily, the Trump administration may increase the chances that Mr. López's declaration Tuesday — ""It's time to conquer freedom"" — proves out.Online:https://www.washingtonpost.com/___April 30The New York Times on anti-Semitism and a political cartoon it recently published:The Times published an appalling political cartoon in the opinion pages of its international print edition late last week. It portrayed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel as a dog wearing a Star of David on a collar. He was leading President Trump, drawn as a blind man wearing a skullcap.The cartoon was chosen from a syndication service by a production editor who did not recognize its anti-Semitism. Yet however it came to be published, the appearance of such an obviously bigoted cartoon in a mainstream publication is evidence of a profound danger — not only of anti-Semitism but of numbness to its creep, to the insidious way this ancient, enduring prejudice is once again working itself into public view and common conversation.Anti-Semitic imagery is particularly dangerous now. The number of assaults against American Jews more than doubled from 2017 to 2018, rising to 39, according to a report released Tuesday by the Anti-Defamation League. On Saturday, a gunman opened fire during Passover services at a synagogue in San Diego County, killing one person and injuring three, allegedly after he posted in an online manifesto that he wanted to murder Jews. For decades, most American Jews felt safe to practice their religion, but now they pass through metal detectors to enter synagogues and schools.Jews face even greater hostility and danger in Europe, where the cartoon was created. In Britain, one of several members of Parliament who resigned from the Labour Party in February said that the party had become ""institutionally anti-Semitic."" In France and Belgium, Jews have been the targets of terrorist attacks by Muslim extremists. Across Europe, right-wing parties with long histories of anti-Semitic rhetoric are gaining political strength.This is also a period of rising criticism of Israel, much of it directed at the rightward drift of its own government and some of it even questioning Israel's very foundation as a Jewish state. We have been and remain stalwart supporters of Israel, and believe that good-faith criticism should work to strengthen it over the long term by helping it stay true to its democratic values. But anti-Zionism can clearly serve as a cover for anti-Semitism — and some criticism of Israel, as the cartoon demonstrated, is couched openly in anti-Semitic terms.The responsibility for acts of hatred rests on the shoulders of the proponents and perpetrators. But history teaches that the rise of extremism requires the acquiescence of broader society.As anti-Semitism has surged from the internet into the streets, President Trump has done too little to rouse the national conscience against it. Though he condemned the cartoon in The Times, he has failed to speak out against anti-Semitic groups like the white nationalists who marched in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017 chanting, ""Jews will not replace us."" He has practiced a politics of intolerance for diversity, and attacks on some minority groups threaten the safety of every minority group. The gunman who attacked the synagogue in San Diego claimed responsibility for setting a fire at a nearby mosque, and wrote that he was inspired by the deadly attack on mosques in New Zealand last month.A particularly frightening, and also historically resonant, aspect of the rise of anti-Semitism in recent years is that it has come from both the right and left sides of the political spectrum. Both right-wing and left-wing politicians have traded in incendiary tropes, like the ideas that Jews secretly control the financial system or politicians.The recent attacks on Jews in the United States have been carried out by men who identify as white supremacists, including the killing of 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue last year. But the A.D.L. reports that most anti-Semitic assaults, and incidents of harassment and the vandalism of Jewish community buildings and cemeteries, are not carried out by the members of extremist groups. Instead, the perpetrators are hate-filled individuals.In the 1930s and the 1940s, The Times was largely silent as anti-Semitism rose up and bathed the world in blood. That failure still haunts this newspaper. Now, rightly, The Times has declared itself ""deeply sorry"" for the cartoon and called it ""unacceptable."" Apologies are important, but the deeper obligation of The Times is to focus on leading through unblinking journalism and the clear editorial expression of its values. Society in recent years has shown healthy signs of increased sensitivity to other forms of bigotry, yet somehow anti-Semitism can often still be dismissed as a disease gnawing only at the fringes of society. That is a dangerous mistake. As recent events have shown, it is a very mainstream problem.As the world once again contends with this age-old enemy, it is not enough to refrain from empowering it. It is necessary to stand in opposition.Online:https://www.nytimes.com/___April 29China Daily on China's domestic agenda:When President Xi Jinping outlined China's to-do list at the Second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in Beijing on Friday, many foreign listeners started taking notes.People familiar with China's domestic agenda may marvel at the extent to which its domestic policy discourse — ranging from innovation, green development and sustainability to anti-corruption and transparency — has captured such a global audience.But it is hard for foreign participants not to be grabbed by the relevance that Xi's proposals have to their respective nations, whether that be improving people's livelihoods or cultivating growth drivers. Interestingly, what sounds domestic to China sounds global to other countries, and vice versa. Because what China has been doing since the late 1970s — opening its door wider to foreign investment, welcoming foreign trade, and strengthening intellectual property protection — has over the years acquired increasingly more global significance.That China has come to such a stage in its development that foreign competition is a welcome spur to its economic restructuring and industrial upgrading necessarily means it has to coordinate its inbound and outbound efforts on a single chessboard.Many developed countries have experienced this stage. But none could boast of such a complete industrial structure and such a huge population as China. And, since starting from scratch 70 years ago, China has not sought — nor will it seek — development based on the enslaving or exploitation of other countries.China's rise offers unprecedented opportunities to the world. Both the developed and developing countries can find partners in China, as well as sources of investment and technology. And the Belt and Road Initiative is a means to materialize the opportunities into concrete benefits.Neither a sea nor big river selects the streams that flow into it. And without the water that flows from these, they will dry up, no matter how big they are, Xi said, calling on countries to remove institutional obstacles and break any cliques they may have formed.The symbiosis of countries that Xi envisions, which is embodied by the Belt and Road Initiative, explains why the forum — or the initiative, to be more precise — can attract nearly 5,000 participants from over 150 countries at various development stages and 29 international organizations. And why, when Xi touched on some problems and challenges, the participants all shared similar expressions of concern.The popularity of the initiative and how far it has progressed since the first forum two years ago, shows that the canards — such as it being merely a geopolitical tool or a creator of ""debt traps"" — have already been disposed of. For the foundation on which the Belt and Road is being built is trust. The reality is that, whether between people or countries, a promise kept is worth more than any amount of gold.Online:http://global.chinadaily.com.cn___April 28The San Diego Union-Tribune on a shooting at a California synagogue:Saturday's horrific shooting at the Chabad of Poway on the last day of the sacred Jewish holiday of Passover — for which a 19-year-old college student from Rancho Peñasquitos is expected to be charged — left Lori Gilbert-Kaye, 60, dead and Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein, 57, Almog Peretz, 34, and Noya Dahan, 8, with injuries they will survive but never forget.There could have been more victims had the gunman's assault-style rifle not apparently jammed. It was a gut-wrenching reminder to San Diegans that our community is afflicted by the same roiling hatred seen across the nation and the world, especially since the act of terror was foreshadowed by another, a failed attempt to burn down the Islamic Center of Escondido on March 24, reportedly by the synagogue gunman himself.The heroism of Gilbert-Kaye, who took bullets seemingly intended for Goldstein, and of Goldstein, who delivered a sermon after the gunman fled despite his wounds, should be lasting memories from Saturday's tragedy. So should the immediate response of law enforcement. So should the rapid outpouring of sympathy and grief from so many of our region's churches and civic groups, and the condolences they offered to Gilbert-Kaye's family and friends.But what happened in Poway — and the killings in churches and elsewhere in Sri Lanka on Easter, at Islamic centers in New Zealand last month and at a synagogue in Pittsburgh six months ago, which reportedly inspired the gunman — demand introspection.The easy dissemination of hate through technology seems to have made irrational ""fear of the other"" — the belief that those who look differently or who have different views and priorities are malign threats — more common than ever. This is reflected in government statistics showing a surge in hate crimes, most of which are anti-Jewish, against religious and racial minorities.Yet the gunman reportedly had no previous criminal history, and one family friend expressed shock at news of his involvement and his anti-Jewish and anti-Muslim views.This is alarming evidence that online, the most disturbed among us have found secret echo chambers that embolden them.So what can be done?Poway Mayor Steve Vaus offered a powerful and appropriate sentiment on Saturday: ""This is not Poway,"" he declared. ""We always walk with our arms around each other, and we will walk through this tragedy with our arms around each other.""But as Rabbi Goldstein said Sunday: ""Everyone needs to step up and do something in the face of terror."" A good start is to be more determined than ever. To limit troubled individuals' access to guns. To try to understand those with different views. To appreciate how much we have in common. To show solidarity with and empathy for our neighbors. To recognize the importance of fellowship, social exchange and understanding.The tragedy in Poway and the near-tragedy in Escondido should unite San Diegans. So far, that's just what seems to have happened. May this resolve and unity endure — and may it help us overcome the hatred that fouls social media and the sunless corners of our communities.Online:https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/___April 26The Orange County Register on Sen. Elizabeth Warren's student debt relief plan:The bidding war for votes in the Democratic presidential primary escalated quickly this week with a proposal by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to wipe out student debt, courtesy of the taxpayers.Warren's proposal, put forward not in proposed legislation but in a blog post, would cancel up to $50,000 of student debt for every American with household income under $100,000. Individuals with household incomes up to $250,000 would also get debt relief, though not quite as much. She says this will benefit 95% of the 45 million Americans who are carrying student debt.The proposal is estimated to cost $1.25 trillion over 10 years. Warren says the money would come from a plan she previously proposed — a tax on accumulations of wealth collecting 2% of $50 million or more of household net worth, and an extra 1% on $1 billion and up. Assuming nobody leaves the country over it, the tax would hit about 75,000 families and raise $2.75 trillion over 10 years.Warren also wants to spend $100 billion expanding Pell grants to cover non-tuition expenses, and make public colleges tuition-free.The wealth tax might raise more legal challenges than revenue. The Constitution prohibits any national ""direct"" tax not collected evenly from the states, based on population. The income tax was unconstitutional until the Constitution was amended in 1913. An additional tax on ""wealth"" that has already been taxed as income might run into trouble at the Supreme Court. But even without debating the legality of a wealth tax, the idea of canceling student debt by having taxpayers cover it is terrible.Start with the problem of fundamental fairness — student debt would be canceled for all income-eligible borrowers with outstanding loans without regard to financial need, so even people who are working and able to make regular payments would get the bailout. On the other hand, people who did not take out loans they couldn't afford to repay, and people who already repaid their loans, would be out $50,000 for making responsible financial decisions.Then there's the problem of moral hazard: If the taxpayers pay the debts of everyone with outstanding student loans, how will that affect the decisions made by current students thinking about their choices for financing higher education? What's the message? Borrow as much as you can and wait for the debt to be canceled during the next presidential primary campaign?The proposal certainly doesn't encourage restraint in tuition increases. Universities considering whether to raise tuition could reasonably believe there's no need to hold the line when the new policy is to step in and generously pay off old student loans with somebody else's money.It's also troubling to hear a sitting United States senator so casually proposing the confiscation of some people's property so it can be given to other people. Warren has also put forward a proposal for a ""Real Corporate Tax"" that would collect $1 trillion over 10 years as well as an increase in the estate tax.Student debt weighs on millions of Americans and on the economy more broadly as people find it more difficult to obtain credit or make major purchases. Serious proposals for new repayment plans and eventual debt forgiveness deserve consideration and debate in this presidential race.But Warren's plan doesn't.Online:https://www.ocregister.com/",1
"TAORMINA, Italy – President Donald Trump's views on climate change are ""evolving"" following discussions with European leaders who are pushing for him to stay in the Paris climate accord, a top White House official said Friday.""He feels much more knowledgeable on the topic today,"" said Gary Cohn, Trump's top White House economic adviser. ""He came here to learn, he came here to get smarter.""European leaders have used Trump's stops on the continent this week, including at the Group of 7 meeting in Sicily, to launch a last-ditch campaign for Trump to stay in the climate accord. Nearly 200 nations agreed to the 2015 pact aimed at reducing carbon emissions.French President Emmanuel Macron spoke with Trump at length about the climate deal during a meeting Thursday in Brussels. At the Vatican earlier in the week, Cardinal Secretary of State Pietro Parolin made his own pro-Paris pitch to Trump and his advisers. The matter was also a central focus of Trump's two days of talks at the Group of 7 summit, which kicked off Friday on the picturesque Sicilian coast.At the close of Friday's talks, Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni said six of the G-7 nations — Italy, Britain, France, Germany, Canada and Japan — confirmed ""our commitment and our determination"" to the Paris agreement. The United States, meanwhile, confirmed ""a period of reflection"" on the issue, he said.German Chancellor Angela Merkel said ""we put forward very many arguments"" for the U.S. sticking with the agreement.The White House's slow decision-making on the future of the landmark 2015 climate change agreement created the opening for the European leaders' persuasion campaign. Multiple White House meetings on the matter were delayed in recent weeks, and Trump advisers ultimately said he would not make a decision until after he returns to Washington from a nine-day, five-stop international trip.As a candidate, Trump vowed to withdraw the U.S. from the accord, which was negotiated during the Obama administration. But as the opening months of his presidency have shown, Trump can be moved to change his positions and can be heavily influenced by other world leaders. He backed away from his tough campaign talk about trade with China after a summit with President Xi Jinping and abandoned his criticism of Saudi Arabia's human rights record following his warm welcome in the desert kingdom earlier this week.Cohn said Trump was struck during his discussions Friday by ""how important it is for the United States to show leadership."" He said many of the European leaders noted that even if a hundred countries are parties to an agreement, there's ""a big gap when you take the biggest economy out.""In Washington, discussions over the climate deal have sown divisions within the White House, splitting the nationalists and the globalists competing for influence within Trump's administration. One potential compromise that's emerged in the White House discussions involves staying in the climate accord, but adjusting the U.S. emissions targets.Cohn hinted at that prospect as he briefed reporters Thursday night as Air Force One flew from Brussels to Sicily, the final stop on Trump's trip.""The last levels we put out in the Paris agreement were levels that would be constraining to our economic growth,"" Cohn said. ""But then you get into the whole discussion on Paris, is it non-binding, is it not non-binding, can you change your levels, how easy is it to change your levels.""In a striking comment given Trump's support during the campaign for American coal miners, Cohn also said ""coal doesn't even really make that much sense anymore as a feedstock."" He singled out natural gas as ""such a cleaner fuel"" and also noted that the U.S. could become a ""manufacturing powerhouse"" by investing in wind and solar energy.Nearly 200 countries are part of the Paris accord and each set their own emissions targets, which are not legally binding. The U.S. pledged to reduce its annual greenhouse gas emissions in 2025 by 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels, which would be a reduction of about 1.6 billion tons of annual emissions.A senior French official said Macron and Trump spoke at length about the Paris agreement — at Macron's behest — when they met for lunch Thursday. There was no ""disagreement"" over the accord itself, the official said, but there were ""differences"" about how to apply it.Macron, the newly elected French president, was critical of Trump's threats to pull out of the Paris deal during his own campaign. In a dig at Trump, he invited American climate scientists who felt alienated by the Republican administration to come to France to work.Even Pope Francis, who has framed climate change as an urgent moral crisis and blamed global warming on an unfair, fossil fuel-based industrial model that harms the poor the most, appeared to be sending a message to Trump. Among the three documents the pope presented Trump as a gift was his 2015 encyclical on the need to protect the environment.It's unclear if the pope pressed Trump specifically on the Paris accord in their private meeting. But Parolin, the Vatican's secretary of state, did make a direct appeal in a broader meeting with the president and his top aides.""They were encouraging continued participation in the Paris accord,"" U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said. ""We had a good exchange on the difficulty of balancing climate change, responses to climate change and ensuring that you still have a thriving economy, you still offer people jobs so they can feed their families and have a prosperous economy. That's a difficult balancing act.""___Associated Press writers Sylvie Corbet in Taormina, Italy; Angela Charlton in Brussels; and Geir Moulson in Berlin contributed to this report.___Follow Julie Pace at http://www.twitter.com/jpaceDC and Colleen Barry at http://www.twitter.com/collbarryIf you haven't sent yet, can you add this from Merkel: Merkel on urging the US to stick with the Paris climate agreement: ""We put forward very many arguments.""",1

          Demonstrators sit on the ground along Pennsylvania Ave. in front of the White House in Washington, Saturday, April 29, 2017, during a demonstration and march. Thousands of people gathered across the country to march in protest of President Donald Trump's environmental policies, which have included rolling back restrictions on mining, oil drilling and greenhouse gas emissions at coal-fired power plants.
          (AP)Tens of thousands of people across the U.S. marched in rain, snow and blistering heat to demand action on climate change in mass protests that fell on President Trump's 100th day in office and blasted his administration for rolling back environmental protections.At the marquee event, the Peoples Climate March in Washington, D.C., approximately 150,000 to 200,000 people made their way down Pennsylvania Avenue on their way to encircle the White House. Organizers had secured a permit for 100,000 but video and photos on social media showed a larger turnout.It's official! The march extends over 20 blocks, far exceeding our NPS permit for 100,000! https://t.co/s2G1vYCiU4Organizers said about 300 sister marches or rallies were being held around the country, including in Seattle, Boston and San Francisco. A wet spring snow fell in Denver, where several hundred activists posed in the shape of a giant thermometer for a photograph and a dozen people rode stationary bikes to power the loudspeakers. In Chicago, a rain-soaked crowd of thousands headed from the city's federal plaza to Trump Tower.""We are here because there is no Planet B,"" the Rev. Mariama White-Hammond of Bethel AME Church told a rally in Boston.The demonstrations came one week after supporters of science gathered in 600 cities around the globe, alarmed by political and public rejection of established research on topics including climate change and the safety of vaccines.Participants Saturday said they object to Trump's rollback of restrictions on mining, oil drilling and greenhouse gas emissions at coal-fired power plants, among other things. Trump has called climate change a hoax, disputing the overwhelming consensus of scientists that the world is warming and that man-made carbon emissions are primarily to blame.

Speakers included a lobsterman, a solar company owner and members of the Penobscot Nation tribe.""I've seen firsthand the impacts of climate change to not only the Gulf of Maine, but also to our evolving fisheries, and to the coastal communities that depend upon them,"" said lobsterman Richard Nelson of Friendship, Maine.People in the crowd spoke about the importance of addressing climate change to industries such as renewable energy, forestry, farming and seafood. Saharlah Farah, a 16-year old immigrant from Somalia who lives in Portland, talked about how climate change could have a bigger toll on marginalized groups that have less financial resources.

"James Rosen reports from Washington D.C. Bill Nye, an engineer and educator known as “the science guy” through his appearances on television, spoke to thousands of enthusiastic marchers in Washington, D.C. on Saturday, declaring that science serves everyone and must be for all.“Today we have a great many lawmakers, not just here, but around the world, deliberately ignoring and actively surpassing science,” he told the crowd of scientists, students and research advocates at the National Mall, according to Variety. “Their inclination is misguided, and in no one’s best interest.”Nye, who served as an honorary co-chair for the March for Science, chided lawmakers who ignore scientific research in areas like climate change and railed against the Trump administration’s proposed budget cuts.The March for Science protests, according to News Corp Australia Network, come amid growing anxiety over what many see as a mounting political assault on facts and evidence and fears that research is being excluded from policymaking. Triggered by concern over the rise of “alternative facts,” marchers sought to present a united front, particularly against the roll back of environmental protection policies and apparent lack of support for climate change.

      (REUTERS)Nye, the CEO of the Planetary Society, said the march was to “remind people everywhere” of the significance of science “for health and prosperity,” according to Variety.“The framers of the Constitution of the United States, which has become a model for constitutional governments everywhere, included Article One, Section 8, which refers to promoting the progress of science and useful arts,"" Nye said.Nye told The Guardian earlier this week that scientists should unapologetically throw themselves into the political fray as Trump’s administration seeks to dismantle large areas of scientific endeavor, from cancer research to climate analysis.“We are in a dangerous place right now,” Nye told The Guardian. “Science has always been political but we don’t want science to be partisan. Objective truths have become set aside and diminished and lawmakers are acting like a strong belief in something is as valid as careful peer review.”More than 600 companion marches conveying a global message of scientific freedom without political interference occurred around the world.",1
"Ed Henry reports from Washington, D.C.In 2015, then-President Obama finalized a massive, regressive energy regulatory scheme that purported to be about helping the climate but, in reality, would have done little to meaningfully impact global emissions.What it would have done is punish low-income families, ship middle-class jobs overseas, and hurt families who could least afford it. It was also likely illegal.I sent a letter counseling governors to wait for the courts to rule on the legality of the regulation before submitting a compliance plan.It was not a popular move at the time. Turns out it was the right one.I’m glad that nearly half of our nation’s governors agreed with my advice to take a ‘wait and see’ approach before needlessly putting their states in economic jeopardy.I commend President Trump for sending this flawed regulatory plan, along with a number of others, back to the drawing board with Tuesday’s Energy Independence Executive Order.As the administration now begins the task of reworking these failed regulations, I think it’s worth taking a look back at how we got here in the first place.President Obama came into office with huge majorities in both houses of Congress. He could’ve done virtually anything he wanted and he certainly tried. He pushed through one left-wing bill after the other. He even tried to push through a regressive, anti-middle class energy regulatory scheme — a legislative proposal so extreme that he couldn’t even get his own Democrat-controlled Congress to go along.Undeterred, he went around Congress and imposed a similarly regressive scheme anyway. He nonsensically tried to brand the main pillar of that scheme a “Clean Power Plan” (CPP), the same way one might try to brand Obamacare an “Affordable Care Act” or brand a rabbit a rhinoceros, even though it wouldn’t have had a meaningful impact on the climate.It did, however, threaten to eliminate tens of thousands of American jobs, raise energy costs by double-digits in more than 40 states, and increase the pain in parts of my own state that were already experiencing a depression.So I fought back against it.In the states, I wrote a letter to every governor concerning the serious legal, political, and financial implications associated with the CPP.In the courts, I joined more than 30 Senators and 170 Representatives in filing an amicus brief in support of the 27 states that sued to overturn the CPP, and the Supreme Court agreed to halt it.In Congress, I successfully worked with members in both parties to pass measures that would have eliminated the CPP and other harmful energy regulations.In the White House, although President Obama may have wielded his veto pen, the American people sent us a new president with a different view, and President Trump just agreed to send these regulations back to the drawing board with Tuesday’s executive action. Now we have a chance to help bring relief and pursue a smarter approach.For the past eight years, coal communities across the country, and especially in my home state, have been under attack from heavy-handed regulations that kill jobs and devastate the economy.Moreover, these massive regulatory burdens were imposed during a period when production and supply of natural gas had been high and its costs relatively low — a devastating one-two punch to families already struggling to make it.Coal communities face enough challenges without Washington piling on with these unreasonable attacks. What we need now is a different approach: an all-of-the-above energy strategy that is realistic, serious, balanced, and economically viable.We need a level playing field for coal communities and investments in clean-coal technology.We need to foster a diverse and competitive fuel supply, prioritize innovation, and continue breaking down barriers that prevent us from reaching our full potential on energy production.These are just some of the priorities I outlined in a letter to President Trump earlier this year. Both Congress and the administration have important roles to play in making these goals a reality.I’m committed to doing my part. I know the new administration is committed to doing its part as well.We all want clean air, we all want clean water, we all want a better environment.But that’s not what former President Obama’s regulatory scheme was really about. It was a vanity project, not serious environmental policy, and it wouldn’t have accomplished much beyond crushing more middle-class dreams and chasing more jobs overseas.It’s time for us to move past this failed story of yesterday.Now, we have that chance. EPA can finally start fresh with stronger and more balanced policy that truly respects America’s middle class.At the end of the day, whether we’re Democrats or Republicans, isn’t that what we should all want?",1

          Led by Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti (center) the Mayors National Climate Action Agenda recently declared that they will not enforce President Trumps recent rollback of federal climate policy.
          (Mayors National Climate Action Agenda )A cadre of 75 mayors, taking a page from mayors and governors who announced they will not assist federal authorities with illegal immigrants, has announced they will not enforce the White House’s recent rollback of Obama-era climate policies.The signatories include mayors of major metropolitan areas like New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and D.C., as well as smaller cities like Santa Monica, California, Park City, Utah, and Eugene, Oregon as part of the Mayors National Climate Action Agenda (also known as Climate Mayors.) The group is standing together in defiance of Trumps recent executive order, according to Curbed.“Climate action is also an investment in our economy and job creation  —  electric vehicles, solar power, energy efficiency and battery storage are all avenues to restoring our nation’s manufacturing base and create good, middle class jobs,” reads the Climate Mayors letter to Trump.“Today, one in fifty American jobs is now in the solar sector, surpassing employment in oil, gas, and coal extraction combined. Texas is once again experiencing an energy boom — this time, with wind power. In fact, the majority of wind jobs in the U.S. are in congressional districts that voted for you.”The action is reminiscent of another defiance by America’s cities on a recent executive order — elimination of sanctuary cities.For example, when Trump announced he was changing vehicle fuel-efficiency standards, a group of Climate Mayors, which included the mayors of New York and Los Angeles, responded by ordering $10 billion worth of electric vehicles for their city fleets.“No matter what President Trump does or what happens in Washington, cities will continue leading the way on tackling climate change,” Matt Petersen, Los Angeles chief sustainability officer, said in an email to Bloomberg.com regarding the purchases.Los Angeles’ Mayor Eric Garcetti, a co-founder of the Climate Mayors, said cities such as his need to double down on their commitment to the environment.“President Trump’s moves today to undo the Clean Power Plan and roll back other key climate policies undermine the important efforts — throughout the country and the world — to tackle the single greatest threat and economic opportunity of our time: climate change,” Garcetti said in a statement released  Tuesday when the executive order was announced.",1
"Ed Henry reports from Washington, D.C.Climate change is happening; the question is what to do about it. President Obama had one answer: reduce greenhouse-gas emissions aggressively.Unfortunately, his approach was heavy on cost and light on benefit, and with yesterday’s executive order rolling back those efforts, President Trump has rightly begun the process of reversing it.But President Trump's own response to climate change appears to be: nothing. That’s not the right answer either.Most climate policy falls into one of two categories: There is “mitigation,” which means trying to prevent climate change by reducing greenhouse-gas emissions -- think wind farms. And then there is “adaptation,” which means dealing well with whatever change occurs -- think sea walls.The basic problem with Obama’s mitigation-focused approach is that the overwhelming majority of future emissions will come from the developing world as it grows rapidly. U.S. policy has shown little ability to influence that trend, even when we make brave commitments to incur large costs ourselves.We can -- and should -- invest in developing new technologies that might reduce emissions more cheaply, but that takes time, and success is not guaranteed.Without major mitigation, though, adaptation becomes all the more important. And that is a place where good American policy can make a major difference.For instance, continued research into the likely effects of climate change can inform policymakers and private actors about what to expect, so that they can make better investments.If certain areas of the country are likely to get wetter or drier, hotter or colder, we should want to know that. Yet the Trump Administration seems inclined -- at least so far -- to dismiss such research and cut its funding as aggressively as possible.The instinct is understandable, given the research sloppily conducted or misappropriated for activist ends under the previous Administration.The Obama-era EPA's “Climate Change Impacts and Risk Analysis” project, for example, managed to conclude that the rate of heat-related deaths for New York in the year 2100 would be 50 times higher than it was for Phoenix in 2000 -- even though New York would be nowhere near as hot in 2100 as Phoenix is already.But that egregious effort does not make good research less valuable. It just underscores the need for research to be well focused and insulated from politics.Similarly, we should want government planners at every level to take the best existing research into account as they make public investments and set policy that will influence others.If farmers and resort owners and mayors and naval planners all build with an eye toward how the future might change, then those changes as they arrive won’t be so harmful or expensive.Yet, in addition to starting the repeal of costly mitigation efforts like Obama’s Clean Power Plan, Trump’s executive order entirely erases an Obama order aimed at “preparing the United States for the impacts of Climate Change.” Many of the points in that program still make sense.Perhaps the greatest mistake made by those who overinflate the risk of climate change is to forget that our society has a tremendous capacity to adapt and innovate. But it would also be a major mistake to forget that public policy can either foster or hinder that process.If President Trump dislikes his predecessor’s approach to adaptation he should put forward an alternative. Ignoring the problem entirely is one of the few things he can do that really would make it worse.",1

          WASHINGTON – With just three days left in office, the Obama administration has doubled an initial $500 million commitment to a fund that helps developing nations fight climate change and adapt to its consequences.The incoming Trump administration and some Republicans oppose the program.The State Department's announcement Tuesday brings U.S. contributions to the Green Climate Fund to $1 billion since 2016. The fund helps poor countries reduce carbon emissions by promoting clean energy and spurring private investment in the field.""This administration has committed to this fund, in fact helped stand it up, establish it,"" State Department spokesman John Kirby said. ""And it is entirely in keeping with the work that we've been doing across the interagency to try to look for ways to stem the effects of climate change, and this fund helps other economies, other countries develop their own initiatives and help them deal with this.""Obama promised a total of $3 billion to the fund in 2014 as part of the Paris climate change accord, but it is far from certain that full amount will be pledged.President-elect Donald Trump and a number of GOP lawmakers have complained that support for the fund wasn't specifically approved by Congress. The administration argues the current fiscal year's budget allows it to take the money from an unobligated portion of a total of $4.3 billion in economic support fund assistance. The previous $500 million installment was made in the same way.",1
"Doug McKelway reportsThanks, Environmental Protection Agency! You’ve required sewage treatment plants, catalytic converters on cars and other things that made the world cleaner than the world in which I grew up. Good work.Today, America’s waterways are so much cleaner that I swim in New York City’s once-filthy Hudson River -- right beside skyscrapers in which millions of people, uh, flush. The air we breathe is also cleaner than it’s been for 60 years.In a rational world, environmental bureaucrats would now say, “Mission accomplished. We set tough standards, so we don’t need to keep doing more. Stick a fork in it! We’re done.”[pullquote]OK, I went too far. America does still need some bureaucrats to enforce existing environmental rules and watch for new pollution problems. But we don’t need what we’ve got: 16,000 environmental regulators constantly trying to control more of our lives. EPA should stand for: Enough Protection Already.But bureaucracies never  say they’ve done “enough.” That would mean they were out of work.Like all bureaucracies -- regulatory, poverty-fighting and military -- the EPA spends every day hunting for new things to do, even if its new efforts cost much more and accomplish far less. Its biggest current crusade is global warming -- I mean, “climate change.”Even if it turns out that man’s emission of greenhouse gases is a threat, “EPA’s own cost-benefit analyses don’t really identify any benefits” from additional regulation, says Case Western Reserve law professor Jonathan Adler. “If we are serious about dealing with climate change, we need to reduce per capita emissions of carbon dioxide to the level they were during the period of Reconstruction after the Civil War.”That reduction in our industrial capacity would be one of the worst costs the human race had ever suffered, all for tiny benefits. Even if we did everything the environmentalists want, the regulators admit it might only lower temperatures a fraction of a degree, a century from now. By that time, we will have cheaper ways of dealing with the problem, if it is a problem. But government rarely pays attention to costs vs. benefits.Today, instead of environmental regulations that actually save lives, we pay to subsidize politicians’ cronies and pet projects, such as electric cars.Voters rarely object to such deals, says David Harsanyi of The Federalist, because government hides their real costs. “If people actually paid what a Chevy Volt cost to make, it would probably be around $200,000. Without government -- essentially, government cronyism and all kinds of subsidies -- the Volt wouldn’t exist.”He says Chevy, even with its government subsidies, loses about $49,000 on every Volt it builds. It’s ironic that, as environmentalists talk about “sustainability,” they create totally unsustainable subsidy schemes.“It’s happening with all kinds of alternative energy companies that rely on government subsidies,” Harsanyi says. Politicians, by shifting money away from private-sector experiments, “are hurting companies that actually have some innovation that might work better.”Since people rarely question spending that supposedly is “good for the environment, green subsidies create opportunity for corruption,” Harsanyi says. “The people who lobby and have the closest ties to government are typically the ones who benefit from the subsidies the government gives.”Close associates of President Obama, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, former Energy Secretary Bill Richardson and former Vice President Al Gore all benefited from well-timed investments in green companies that got a leg up from government subsidies and regulations. Unfortunately, green companies often do poorly even with government assistance, as was the case with solar panel maker Solyndra.I don’t doubt there are important technological advances ahead that will make energy use more efficient -- and make the environment cleaner, sometimes as an unintended side effect. But I don’t trust government to pick the technologies.Why should we think government’s ideas for cleaning the environment are on the cutting edge? As Harsanyi points out, windmills, one of environmentalists’ favorite ideas and biggest subsidy-recipients, “have been around since the Middle Ages.”There will be a better way.

"""The heavens reek, the waters below are foul ... we are in a crisis of survival."" That's how Walter Cronkite and CBS hyped the first Earth Day, back in 1970. Somehow we've survived since then, and most of life got better, although I never hear that from the worrywarts.Of course, some things got better because of government: We passed environmental rules that got most of the filth out of the air and sewage out of lakes and rivers. Great -- but now we're told that we're in big trouble because greenhouse gases cause global warming. I mean, climate change.[pullquote]""Crop yields are down, deaths from heat are up,"" says the Los Angeles Times. The ""Worst Is Yet to Come,"" warns The New York Times. This hype is not new. Alarmists always fool the gullible media. They once fooled me.A few years back, we were going to be killed by global cooling, overpopulation, pesticide residues, West Nile virus, bird flu, Y2K, cellphone radiation, mad cow disease, etc. Now it's global warming.Reporters don't make these scares up. The recent hype about global warming comes from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Most of its members are serious scientists. But reporters don't realize that those scientists, like bird flu specialists, have every incentive to hype the risk. If their computer models (which so far have been wrong) predict disaster, they get attention and money. If they say, ""I'm not sure,"" they get nothing.Also, the IPCC is not just a panel of scientists. It's an intergovernmental panel. It's a bureaucracy controlled by the sort of people who once ran for student council and are ""exhilarated by the prospect of putting the thumb of the federal government on the scale.""Actually, that wasn't a quote from a global warming alarmist. It's from anti-marijuana alarmist and former Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare Joe Califano. But it's the same crisis mindset.Scientists who disagree, who are reluctant to put their thumbs on the government scale, don't feel welcome in the IPCC.It's possible climate change may become a problem. But even if industrialization brings warming, we've got more important problems.On my TV show this week, statistician Bjorn Lomborg points out that ""air pollution kills 4.3 million people each year ... We need to get a sense of priority."" That deadly air pollution happens because, to keep warm, poor people burn dung in their huts.Yet, time and again, environmentalists oppose the energy production most likely to make the world cleaner and safer. Instead, they persuade politicians to spend billions of your dollars on symbolism like ""renewable"" energy.""The amazing number that most people haven't heard is, if you take all the solar panels and all the wind turbines in the world,"" says Lomborg, ""they have (eliminated) less CO2 than what U.S. fracking (cracking rocks below ground to extract oil and natural gas) managed to do.""That progress occurred despite opposition from environmentalists -- and even bans in places like my stupid state, New York, where activists worry fracking will cause earthquakes or poison the water.Do environmentalists even care about measuring costs instead of just assuming benefits? We spend $7 billion to subsidize electric cars. Even if America reached the president's absurd 2015 goal of ""a million electric cars on the road"" (we won't get close), how much would it delay warming of the Earth?""One hour,"" says Lomborg. ""This is a symbolic act.""Symbolic. Environmentalism is now more religion than science. It even comes with built-in doomsday stories to warn people about what will happen if they disobey -- a bit like the movie ""Noah"" that's in theaters now.While environmentalists lament that our time is running out, environmental indicators get better, technological improvements reduce carbon dioxide, water gets cleaner for millions, and human life expectancy goes up.This Earth Day, instead of attacking those who sell fossil fuels, I will applaud them for overcoming constant environmental hysteria -- while providing affordable energy that will allow us to fight poverty, which is the real threat to the people of the world.",1

(Reuters)The Hill, the newspaper that covers Congress, says this year, there will be a major policy battle over ""climate change."" Why?We already waste billions on pointless gestures that make people think we're addressing global warming, but the earth doesn't notice or care. What exactly is ""global warming"" anyway?That's really four questions:1. Is the globe warming? Probably. Global temperatures have risen. Climate changes. Always has. Always will.2. Is the warming caused by man? Maybe. There's decent evidence that at least some of it is.[pullquote]3. But is global warming a crisis? Far from it. It's possible that it will become a crisis. Some computer models suggest big problems, but the models aren't very accurate. Some turned out to be utterly wrong. Clueless scaremongers like Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Cal., seize on weather disasters to blame man's carbon output. After Oklahoma's tragic tornadoes last year, Boxer stood on the floor of the Senate and shrieked, ""Carbon could cost us the planet!"" But there were actually fewer tornadoes last summer.4. If the globe is warming, can America do anything about it? No. What we do now is pointless. I feel righteous riding my bike to work. That's just shallow. Even if all Americans replaced cars with bicycles, switched to fluorescent light bulbs, got solar water heaters, etc., it would have no discernible effect on the climate. China builds a new coal-fueled power plant almost every week; each one obliterates any carbon reduction from all our windmills and solar panels.Weirdly, the only thing that's reduced America's carbon output has been our increased use of natural gas (it releases less greenhouse gas than oil and coal). But many environmentalists fight the fracking that produces it. Someday, we'll probably invent technology that could reduce man's greenhouse gas creation, but we're nowhere close to it now. Rather than punish poor people with higher taxes on carbon and award ludicrous subsidies to Al Gore's ""green"" investments, we should wait for the science to advance.If serious warming happens, we can adjust, as we've adjusted to big changes throughout history.It will be easier to adjust if America is not broke after wasting our resources on trendy gimmicks like windmills.Environmental activists say that if we don't love their regulations, we ""don't care about the earth."" Bunk. We can love nature and still hate the tyranny of bureaucrats' rules. We do need some rules. It's good that government built sewage treatment plants.Today, the rivers around Manhattan are so clean that I swim in them. It's good that we forced industry to stop polluting the air. Scrubbers in smokestacks and catalytic converters on cars made our lives better.The air gets cleaner every time someone replaces an old car with a new one. But those were measures against real pollution -- soot, particulates, sulfur, etc.What global warming hysterics want to fight is merely carbon dioxide. That's what plants breathe. CO2 may prove to be a problem, but we don't know that now.The world has real problems, though: malaria, malnutrition, desperate poverty. Our own country, while relatively rich, is deep in debt. Obsessing about greenhouse gases makes it harder to address these more serious problems. Environmentalists assume that as people get richer and use more energy, they pollute more. The opposite is true. As nations industrialize, they pay more attention to pollution. Around the world, it's the most prosperous nations that now have the cleanest air and water.Industrialization allows people to use fewer resources. Instead of burning trees for power, we make electricity from natural gas. We figure out how to get more food from smaller pieces of land. And one day we'll probably even invent energy sources more efficient than oil and gas.We'll use them because they're cost-effective, not because government forces us to. So let's chill out about global warming. We don't need more micromanagement from government. We need less.Then free people -- and rapidly increasing prosperity -- will create a better world.",1

          Scientists who are fine-tuning a landmark U.N. report on climate change are struggling to explain why global warming appears to have slowed down in the past 15 years even as greenhouse gas emissions keep rising.
          (AP Photo/John McConnico)The curtain has come down on Climate Change: The Musical and reviews of the taxpayer-funded play about global warming are downright icy.The play, which is actually entitled ""The Great Immensity,"" and was produced by Brooklyn-based theater company The Civilians, Inc. with a $700,000 grant from the National Science Foundation, ended its run early amid a storm of criticism from reviewers and lawmakers alike. It opened a year late, reached just five percent of its anticipated audience and likely fell short of its ambitious goal of informing a new generation about the perceived dangers of man-caused climate change.Plus, it apparently wasn't very good.“Despite fine performances, the musical mystery tour is an uneasy mix of fact and credulity-stretching fiction. It’s neither flora nor fauna,” New York Daily News reviewer Joe Dziemianowicz wrote in a review at the time. “[The] songs — whether about a doomed passenger pigeon or storm-wrecked towns — feel shoehorned in and not, pardon the pun, organic.”The play, which featured songs and video exploring Americans’ relationships to the environment, opened in New York in April with a three-week run before going on a national tour that was supposed to attract 75,000 patrons. But it stalled after a single production in Kansas City, falling short of the lofty goals outlined in a grant proposal. It was envisioned as a chance to create ""an experience that would be part investigative journalism and part inventive theater,” help the public ""better appreciate how science studies the Earth’s biosphere” and increase “public awareness, knowledge and engagement with science-related societal issues.”According to a plot description on the theater company’s website, ""The Great Immensity"" focuses on a woman named Phyllis as she tries to track down a friend who disappeared while filming an assignment for a nature show on a tropical island. During her search, she also uncovers a devious plot surrounding an international climate summit in Auckland, New Zealand.The description touts the play as “a thrilling and timely production” with “a highly theatrical look into one of the most vital questions of our time: How can we change ourselves and our society in time to solve the enormous environmental challenges that confront us?”Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, chairman of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, said the dramatic debacle was a waste of public money.“There is no doubt that the Great Immensity was a great mistake,” Smith told FoxNews.com. “The NSF used taxpayer dollars to underwrite political advocacy dressed up as a musical. And the project clearly failed to achieve any of its objectives.”In a statement to FoxNews.com, the NSF said it is too soon to tell if the grant funds were wasted.“This particular project just concluded in August and the final report has not yet been submitted to NSF,” the statement said. “Final reports are due to NSF within 90 days following expiration of the grant. The final report will contain information about project outcomes, impacts and other data.”But Smith and others in Congress said the foundation owes an explanation to lawmakers - and taxpayers.“The NSF has offered no comment, neither a defense of the project nor an acknowledgement that funding was a waste of money,” Smith said. “The NSF must be held accountable for how they choose to spend taxpayer dollars.”Other reviews of the play were similarly dismal.""Even the best adventurers can wander off course, and the Civilians do so on a global scale in The Great Immensity,” read a review from Time Out New York. “The inventive troupe’s latest effort is all over the map… It’s not easy preaching green.”The Civilians, Inc. did not return requests for comment.FoxNews.com first reported on the House Committee’s dismay over the grant program back in March. Smith had also questioned the validity of other grants from the NSF including; $200,000 towards a three-year study of the Bronze Age, Another $50,000 towards the survey of archived lawsuits from 17th century Peru and $20,000 for a study on the causes of stress in Bolivia.“All government employees and their agency heads need to remember they are accountable to the American taxpayer who pays their salary and funds their projects,” Smith said at a March hearing.",1

          (AP2013)The hottest topic in climate research is the observation that global average surface temperature, as well as satellite observations of temperatures in the atmosphere, has shown little or no warming during the 21st century.Now the political climate is heating up over the same issue. Heated words began circulating last summer, when a team of government scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), led by Thomas Karl, published a paper in Science titled “Possible Artifacts Of Data Biases In The Recent Global Surface Warming Hiatus.”  The press release from NOAA included this statement from Karl, who is head of the National Centers for Environmental Information:   “Adding in the last two years of global surface temperature data and other improvements in the quality of the observed record provide evidence that contradict the notion of a hiatus in recent global warming trends.”Media headlines quickly touted the Karl conclusion that science now shows the hiatus in warming never existed.The significance of the hiatus is that it contradicted the 2007 assessment report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which projected a rate of warming of 0.2oC per decade in the early part of the 21st century.  The discrepancy between the climate models and the observations raised serious questions about the climate models.Scientists on both sides of the debate have been critical of Karl’s paper and temperature adjustments made in the new data set, particularly the ocean data analysis.Some said that adjusting reliable ocean surface buoy data upwards to match much less reliable data from engine intake channels in ships causes an artificial upward trend in the readings.Another recent paper used a different NOAA ocean surface temperature data set to find that since 2003 the global average ocean surface temperature has been rising at a rate that is an order of magnitude smaller than the rate of increase reported in Karl’s paper.Clearly, scientists have much work to do to better understand the problems with historical ocean temperature data, adjust the biases among different types of measurements, and understand the differences among different data sets.But the hiatus fuss is also telling us about the politicization of climate science.The surface temperature data set plays a central role in the political debate over climate change. In his 2015  State of the Union address, President Obama declared: “2014 was the planet’s warmest year on record.”This statement followed a joint press release from NOAA’s Karl and Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, that said the same thing. The release was widely criticized for failing to point out that 2014 was in a statistical tie with several other recent years.NOAA’s press release in June for Karl’s paper on the hiatus also appeared just before a big event: EPA was getting ready to issue its very controversial Clean Power Plan. And the politics are heating up even more with the approach of the United Nations Conference on Climate Change in Paris at the end of this month.Last month, the House Science Committee, chaired by Lamar Smith (R-Texas), subpoenaed NOAA for data and communications relating to Karl’s article.  NOAA is refusing to give up the documents, citing confidentiality concerns and the integrity of the scientific process.Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Tex) called the request “a serious misuse of Congressional oversight powers.”Is the subpoena harassment or appropriate constitutional oversight?There are two legitimate concerns here.The first is data quality, an issue that needs to be resolved owing to the central role that this data set is playing in U.S. climate policy.The second issue is arguably more worrisome and difficult to uncover: a potential alliance between NOAA scientists and Obama administration officials that might be biasing and spinning climate science to support a political agenda.Rep. Smith stated: “The American people have every right to be suspicious when NOAA alters data to get the politically correct results they want and then refuses to reveal how those decisions were made.”The House Committee’s investigation should provide insight into the following questions that deserve answers.To what extent did internal discussions occur about the more questionable choices made in adjusting the ocean temperature data?Was any concern raised about the discrepancies of the new ocean temperature data set and NOAA’s other ocean temperature data set (OISST) that shows no warming since 2003?Were any Obama administration officials communicating with NOAA about these statements prior to issuing press releases?Was the release of the land and ocean temperature data sets, which were documented in papers previously published, delayed to follow Karl’s June press release?Earlier this year, Rep. Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz., initiated an investigation into possible industry funding of scientists (including myself) who had recently provided Congressional testimony for the Republicans.While potentially undisclosed industrial funding of research is a legitimate concern, climate science research funding from government is many orders of magnitude larger than industrial funding of such work.If the House Science Committee can work to minimize the political influence on government-funded research, and also help to resolve legitimate scientific issues, it will have done both science and the policies that depend on science a big favor.",1
"Scientists have many important roles to play in preparations for the upcoming UN Conference on Climate Change in Paris. Some are working hard to clarify uncertainties in the science, others on developing and evaluating alternative climate policies.One group of climate scientists is trying a different approach. Dismayed by what they see as a lack of progress on the implementation of climate policies that they support, these 20 scientists sent a letter to the White House calling for their political opponents to be investigated by the government.In particular, they are voicing their support of a proposal by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) for a RICO investigation of fossil fuel corporations and their supporters, who the scientists allege have deceived the American people about the risks of climate change, with the consequence of forestalling America’s response to reducing carbon emissions.RICO, short for Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, is a federal law enacted in 1970 as a crime-fighting tool for use against the Mafia. It includes prison sentences of up to 20 years and seizure of financial assets for those found guilty of  such “racketeering.”What these 20 scientists have done with their letter is the worst kind of irresponsible advocacy. Attempts by powerful people to silence other scientists, especially in this brutal fashion, is a recipe for stifling scientific progress and for making poor policies.Senator Whitehouse singled out one climate scientist, Willie Soon, a solar physicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics who argues that changes in solar radiation, rather than carbon emissions, are the major force behind global warming.Seven other climate scientists were the targets of a recent McCarthyite ‘witch hunt’ by Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.). I was one of the seven. Rep. Grijalva indicated that I was investigated because of my recent Congressional testimony summarizing peer-reviewed research indicating that the magnitude and impacts of expected warming could be less than generally believed.None of the Grijalva 7 was found to have engaged in wrongdoing of any sort, yet there have been significant career consequences for some.The demand by Senator Whitehouse and the 20 climate scientists for legal persecution of people whose research on science and policy they disagree with represents a new low in the politicization of science.The role of these 20 scientists is particularly troubling.  The consequence of this persecution, intended or not, is to make pariahs of scientists who are doing exactly what we expect of researchers: to critically evaluate evidence and publish that work in the scientific literature.Minority perspectives have an important and respected role to play in advancing science, as a mean for testing ideas and pushing the knowledge frontier forward. While President Obama bows to no one in attacking climate ‘deniers’, he recently made an important statement in a town hall meeting at the University in Iowa on the importance of challenging received knowledge in a university setting:""Because there was this space where you could interact with people who didn’t agree with you and had different backgrounds from you … I started testing my own assumptions, and sometimes I changed my mind,"" he said. ""Sometimes I realized, maybe I’ve been too narrow-minded; maybe I didn’t take this into account; maybe I should see this person’s perspective. That’s what college, in part, is all about.""That’s even more what real science is about. It is important for scientists to engage the public and to work with policy makers to assess the impacts and unintended consequences of policy options. However, it has become ‘fashionable’ for academic scientists to advocate for certain political outcomes, without having much understanding of the policy process, economics, or the ethics of such advocacy.What these 20 scientists have done with their letter is the worst kind of irresponsible advocacy. Attempts by powerful people to silence other scientists, especially in this brutal fashion, is a recipe for stifling scientific progress and for making poor policies.Climate policy has been limited by an overly narrow set of narratives and policy options. Expanding the frameworks for thinking about climate change and climate policy can lead to developing a wider choice of options in addressing the risks from it.That is how democracy is supposed to work. We search for solutions that can garner a critical mass of support. We don’t try to criminalize our political opponents, and especially should not try to criminalize scientists who have a different view.",1

          In this Nov. 9, 2016, photo, President-elect Donald Trump speaks during a rally in New York.
          (AP Photo/ Evan Vucci)There are still many unknowns about President-elect Donald Trump’s likely course when it comes to climate change policy, but his campaign trail rhetoric has signaled that his administration may drop the Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean Power Plan, more aggressively develop fossil fuels and loosen environmental regulations.While this is not unexpected given the president-elect's stated skepticism about climate change, it is worth keeping in mind that states may well choose to pursue their own environmental initiatives in this arena.For more than 40 years, the United States has achieved significant environmental progress despite differing regional economic interests, environmental impacts, and levels of environmental concern by allowing some states to lead the way. Enactment of the Clean Air Act of 1970, the Clean Water Act of 1972, and other landmark environmental legislation followed a similar pattern. In each case, states led the way with new approaches that the federal government later adopted. Each of these laws struck a balance between consistent federal legal standards applicable to interstate commerce (good for business and the economy) and state-centric compliance and enforcement. Indeed, states’ rights were a cornerstone of the compromises that Congress struck in the 1970s as it tackled one environmental issue after another.It is often said that states are the laboratories of democracy. State level experiments may prove particularly important for addressing climate change, because states have greater freedom to pursue significant institutional and technological innovation. National and global efforts to reduce carbon emissions from all aspects of the economy (known as decarbonization) will proceed more quickly and easily if states can demonstrate decarbonization is possible and affordable.Some states are already among the most innovative regions in the world in advancing climate policy. For instance, California has pioneered a carbon trading system and energy efficiency programs that have kept per capita energy use nearly flat for decades amidst a fast growing economy and population. It also has established new low carbon fuel standards and significantly increased its use of low-carbon energy. New York is a leader in deploying technology and a new regulatory system to enable a more efficient, more resilient, and more renewable-friendly smart grid. As part of the Governors’ Accord for a New Energy Future, Michigan is aggressively pursuing energy efficiency and renewable energy strategies. These states are betting that their actions will drive innovation within their borders and create new jobs and opportunities for their citizens. They are not alone: 29 states have adopted renewable energy standards; and every state offers some form of tax credits or other types of incentives for renewable energy sources. Their experiences are building America’s knowledge base and stimulating new technologies and economic opportunities. There are now more people working in the solar energy industry than in oil and gas fields.Federal law gives states significant leeway in these pursuits. For example, for the express purpose of enabling experimentation, the Clean Air Act specifically allows states to set more stringent air quality standards for all sources of pollution. They should be allowed to keep going unimpeded, even if the federal government moves in a different direction. Some fear that President-elect Trump’s campaign commitment to bringing jobs back to communities most dependent on the fossil fuel industry will result in scaling back the federal commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In the name of harmonizing regulations, it is possible that the new administration could take actions to impede the ability of states to forge more aggressive climate policies if they so choose.However, there is no credible policy purpose, or likely existing legal basis, to hinder states that choose to make different judgments about mitigation of climate change and their economic future by continuing to pursue their own climate policies. Hindering states could do more to damage technological innovation and a growing economy than might initially be apparent.The stated goals of the new administration include growing the economy with good jobs, promoting foreign policies that demonstrate strength and leadership and reducing the influence of moneyed interests in Washington. Curbing states’ rights to innovate on climate policies would move in the opposite direction and undermine an ongoing U.S. leadership opportunity. It would put many up-and-coming U.S. firms now at the forefront of technological innovation at a disadvantage in world markets. Leaving states free to forge a path toward a greener economy and well-paying jobs powered by innovation is consistent with a long American tradition.",1

          Petitioner Gabe Mandell, center, 14, addresses media members and supporters as he stands with other children asking a court to force state officials to adopt new rules to limit carbon emissions Tuesday, Nov. 22, 2016, in Seattle.
          (The Associated Press)Eight children asked a state judge on Tuesday to find Washington in contempt for failing to adequately protect them and future generations from the harmful effects of climate change.The petitioners asked the judge to require the state Department of Ecology to come up with science-based numeric emissions reductions.The state argued that it has complied with the court's prior orders and there's no basis for finding the Department of Ecology in contempt.King County Superior Court Judge Hollis Hill said she needed more time to deliberate after she heard arguments on Tuesday. The case which is led by children ranging between 12 and 16 years old, is part of a national effort led by the Oregon-based nonprofit Our Children's Trust to force states and the federal government to take action on climate change.A similar climate change case was allowed to proceed in Oregon earlier this month. In that lawsuit, activists argued the government’s actions violate their constitutional rights to life, liberty, and property.""The most concerning thing to me is that our planet will be destroyed and I would have done nothing about it,"" Aji Piper, a plaintiff in both the federal and Seattle cases said. ""We're bringing this case because we need to have a stronger voice and right now that's through the legal system.""The children's attorney, Andrea Rodgers told the judge on Tuesday that, ""Ecology has the legal authority and responsibility to remedy the ongoing legal violations of these young people's fundamental rights.”Assistant Attorney General Kay Shirey said in court that the department complied with court orders by adopting its clean air rule requiring power plants, refineries and others large polluters to reduce emissions by an average 1.7 percent each year.Rodgers said that the case is not about the clean air rule but instead about the state’s constitutional and statutory duties in protecting the rights of young people from the dangers climate change pose. ""This is the world I'm going to have to grow up in,"" said Gabe Mandell, of Seattle, before the hearing. ""Ecology has a mandate to protect our future and they're not doing it. They're not doing their job and they're not doing what the judge ordered.""The Associated Press contributed to this report. ",1
"The Secretary of State calls the Republican nomination race an embarrassment; 'The O'Reilly Factor' investigatesCall it people-to-penguin diplomacy.In a new bid to highlight the threat of climate change, Secretary of State John Kerry will make an unusual official visit to barely populated Antarctica next week. The State Department said Friday that Kerry would travel from Nov. 10 to Nov. 12 to the McMurdo research station on Antarctica's Ross Island and the South Pole. Kerry will be the first secretary of state and highest-ranking U.S. official to visit Antarctica.He hopes to draw attention to the decline in polar ice and its impact on sea levels, although most of the world will likely still be fixated on the results of Tuesday's presidential election.Kerry has made climate change a priority as America's top diplomat. He led the U.S. delegation to the final negotiations over last year's Paris climate change agreement, has attended numerous conferences on limiting greenhouse gas and carbon emissions and traveled to the Arctic Circle this spring while visiting Denmark and Greenland. However, unlike Denmark and Greenland, which have large permanent human populations, governments, politicians and specific foreign policy positions, Antarctica is home to 1,000 people in the winter with a summer surge to 4,500 scientists and support staff, has no resident politicians and is ungoverned in the traditional sense.State Department spokesman John Kirby said the timing of Kerry's trip was dictated by weather conditions and accessibility to the world's southern-most continent and not the contentious 2016 election. He said Kerry had already cast his ballot.Kirby said Kerry did not plan any personal interaction with the millions of penguins that live in the Antarctic, but would be meeting with scientists and researchers who are studying the Earth's extreme south and the impact of climate change in the region. Kerry will also have the chance to fly over the world's largest marine protected area, which was declared in the Ross Sea last week by the European Union and 24 nations that have decision-making power in the Antarctic.In addition to the McMurdo facility, Kerry will visit the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, another U.S. base that is run by the federally funded National Science Foundation. State Department officials said Kerry's travel to and from Antarctic would be on regularly scheduled foundation flights from its base in Christchurch, New Zealand.His Antarctic stop comes at the start of an environmentally heavy round-the-world journey that will also take Kerry to New Zealand's capital of Wellington, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, a global climate conference in Morocco and Peru, where he will join President Barack Obama at an Asia-Pacific economic summit.",1

          (REUTERS/Bret Hartman)Seventeen attorneys general got more than they bargained for when they held a March 29, 2016 “publicity stunt” press conference to announce, with former Vice President Al Gore by their sides, a campaign to target opponents of the global warming agenda under racketeering laws.It wasn’t long before several batches of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) emails, obtained by the Energy & Environment Legal Institute (E&E Legal) and Free Market Environmental Law Clinic (FME Law), revealed that the AGs were working behind closed doors with professional ""climate"" activists, from both pressure groups and law firms. If that isn’t bad enough, they also show a plan for the AGs to coordinate efforts to stonewall public records requests that threaten to expose their scheme.How do we know that? The initial batch of emails from the Vermont Attorney General office revealed that RICO ringleader Eric Schneiderman, New York's AG, created a legal document called a Common Interest Agreement (CIA) that sought to write all participating AG offices out from under their own open records laws — including their dealings with those same outside activists — just for this campaign. This cloak of invisibility extends to other AGs, and ""certain outside parties"".  Records obtained to date show these include a Who's Who of the global warming industry.Subsequent emails indicate the AGs indeed signed such an agreement; however, the very stonewall called for in the agreement has ensured that no one has yet been able to confirm it. AGs have denied requests for the signed pacts, outright, and are ducking reporters’ questions. But emails we have been able to obtain and blocking efforts both show a clear pattern of evasion.Attorneys general in states including Illinois, Kentucky and Minnesota have, sometimes comically, labored to deny that the RICO records are public, or keep them secret by claiming that even, e.g., invitations to happy hours are privileged ""law enforcement"" records. Other responses of interest include Rhode Island’s AG office imposing delays and hundreds of dollars in fees before handing over records which, on their face, revealed the existence of other ""responsive"" records not produced.  For example, these show Rhode Island's AG agreed to a second CIA to exempt the AGs' ongoing campaign from FOIA laws; they withheld it, without admitting they did so, even though it was plainly an attachment to one of the produced emails.Massachusetts shows no indication it is processing one FOIA request and, after being pressed on another, demanded approximately $4,000.00 to process it.  Of course, it also threatened to withhold most if not all of the approximately 700 emails and 400 attachments even if paid, on the basis of the same “exemptions” already improperly invoked by its partner AGs.The capo di tutti capi, New York’s Schneiderman, is the most obstructionist of all, taking every delay and extension the law permits and then some, saying he’ll get back to us after the summer. The unwillingness of the AGs to release even the secrecy pact itself -- let alone the records showing their coordination, which they claim it shields -- contrasts sharply with activist claims that they have been open and transparent about their involvement with the AGs. Further, both the AGs and the activist groups have deigned to respond only to Democrats on Capitol Hill, ignoring Republican concerns over the coordinated scheme to deny others' First Amendment rights.This campaign with outside activists is exactly the sort of sneaky misuse of power that elected representatives adopted FOIA laws to protect against. Collectively this behavior shows abusive attorneys general going into the bunker to keep their pursuit of political opponents from further exposure.  This also represents chief law enforcement officers organizing to subvert the same transparency laws they are sworn to uphold.E&E Legal and FME Law have already sued Vermont and the District of Columbia AGs for refusing to process RICO-related FOIA requests.  Sadly, it appears more suits will be necessary, and one record already obtained suggests this is the AGs’ strategy. Every aspect of the AGs’ campaign is an outrage.  But in the end, these tactics will not work, and the public will see what they’ve been up to, and with whom.",1

          (Reuters)Two Republican attorneys general have come out fighting against a sweeping investigation into whether ExxonMobil misled the public on global warming, asking a judge to block a subpoena that they call an abuse of power -- and a threat to First Amendment rights.Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange asked a Texas state judge Monday to put an end to the investigation being pursued by Virgin Islands Attorney General Claude Walker.Walker, an independent, issued a subpoena in March seeking 40 years' worth of Exxon communications with 90 conservative groups “and any other organizations engaged in research or advocacy concerning Climate Change or policies.” Walker claims the company misled the public on climate change by downplaying the risks.But Paxton called the subpoena against the Texas-based company “a fishing expedition of the worst kind.”“This case is about abusing the power of the subpoena to force Exxon to turn over many decades’ worth of records, so an attorney general with an agenda can pore over them in hopes of finding something incriminating,” Paxton said in a statement. “[It] ... represents an effort to punish Exxon for daring to hold an opinion on climate change that differs from that of radical environmentalists.”Walker’s office did not respond to a request for comment from FoxNews.com.The subpoena is part of a broader battle against the oil giant by a coalition of 20 attorneys generals, led by New York’s Eric Schneiderman, and environmental groups.While a number of states -- including Massachusetts, Vermont and California -- have launched different investigations against the company, they generally aim to replicate the success of the federal government’s 1999 case against Big Tobacco, in which the industry was accused of misleading the public about smoking and nicotine risks.Schneiderman, who himself subpoenaed Exxon’s financial records and emails last November, has indicated ExxonMobil is not the only energy company in his office's crosshairs, vowing to prosecute any that committed fraud to maximize profit at the public's expense “to the fullest extent of the law.”Exxon challenged the Virgin Islands’ subpoena in March, dismissing it as “politically motivated and based on discredited reporting by activist organizations.” The company also noted that it does not have any operations or staff located in the Virgin Islands.A spokesman for Exxon told FoxNews.com Tuesday that they welcomed the intervention by the Texas and Alabama attorneys general.“We appreciate that Texas and Alabama support our position opposing the Virgin Island’s subpoena for lacking jurisdiction, not recognizing First Amendment rights and the obvious conflict of interest in delegating to a contingency-fee law firm the duty to conduct an impartial investigation,” Alan Jeffers, media relations manager for Exxon, told FoxNews.com.Meanwhile, a prominent libertarian think tank subpoenaed by Walker as part of the same operation is also going to court, seeking to fine Walker for allegedly violating their First Amendment rights.The Competitive Enterprise Institute says the subpoena, that sought 10 years of communications regarding its work on climate change, should never have been issued and caused constitutional damage for which it is seeking compensation.“Mr. Walker’s attempt to silence us and others who share our views is an unconstitutional abomination,” CEI President Kent Lassman said in a statement. “CEI will not sit still with this illegal threat hanging over our head, which is why we are asking the court to fine AG Walker and end his abuse of the legal process to intimidate CEI.”FoxNews.com’s Adam Shaw and Jennifer Hickey contributed to this report.",1
"Attorney General Loretta Lynch says the DOJ has discussed legal action against the energy industryThe attorney general of the U.S. Virgin Islands is targeting dozens of conservative and libertarian organizations in a racketeering lawsuit against climate change skeptics that has been widely described as an effort to silence political opponents.In a subpoena issued in March, the office of USVI attorney general Claude Walker demanded from Exxon Mobil copies of communications between the oil company and 90 different political and policy organizations “and any other organizations engaged in research or advocacy concerning Climate Change or policies.”The subpoena was part of a national, coordinated legal campaign by state attorneys general and left-wing advocacy groups to use the legal system against companies and organizations that disagree with and advocate against Democratic policies to address global climate change.The existence of the subpoena was first reported by the Wall Street Journal in April. A newly released copy obtained by the Washington Free Beacon reveals the names of the organizations targeted in the effort, which had previously been redacted.Those organizations include some of the nation’s preeminent conservative and libertarian nonprofit groups. The AG is requesting Exxon Mobil communications with the Heritage Foundation, the Cato Institute, the Federalist Society, the Hoover Institution, the Reason Foundation, and the Mercatus Institute, among other groups.One target of the subpoena, the libertarian Competitive Enterprise Institute, has already publicly responded to Walker. Its attorney called the attorney general’s subpoena “a blatant attempt to intimidate and harass an organization for advancing views that you oppose.”Click for more from The Washington Free Beacon.",1

          FILE - This April 29, 2014, file photo shows an Exxon sign at a mini-mart in Dormont, Pa.
          (AP)ALBANY, N.Y. – New York's attorney general is examining statements by Exxon Mobil and Peabody Energy to determine whether they deceived investors about the causes and impacts of climate change, an official familiar with the investigations said Thursday.A subpoena was sent Wednesday to Dallas-based Exxon after a yearlong review of shareholder disclosures, said the official, who wasn't authorized to publicly discuss the probes and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's office sought similar documents on climate change from St. Louis-based Peabody in 2013, which the company disclosed last year.A spokesman for Schneiderman declined to comment Thursday. New York's attorney general has authority under the state's Martin Act to investigate and prosecute securities fraud.Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri said the company has received the subpoena and rejects allegations in media reports that it suppressed research. Silvestri said that for years, Exxon has provided shareholders information about the business risks of climate change.He cited ""ExxonMobil's nearly 40-year history of climate research that was conducted publicly in conjunction with the Department of Energy, academics and the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.""""ExxonMobil recognizes that climate risks are real and responsible actions are warranted,"" Vice President Ken Cohen told reporters in a conference call late Thursday.He said scientists have publicly issued nearly 150 papers and obtained nearly 300 patents for technological advances in cutting emissions.""Beginning in the last decade, we've informed shareholders and investors on our perception of the business risks associated with climate change through regulatory filings, our annual corporate citizenship report and in other reports to shareholders,"" Cohen said.InsideClimate News reported on the New York investigation earlier Thursday. The nonprofit publication reported on its own investigation earlier this year that found documents showing Exxon recognized in the late 1970s the possible threat to its own existence from global warming, said John Cushman, an editor.Company researchers later confirmed the emerging scientific consensus that doubling carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels would warm the earth with unpalatable effects, Cushman said.At Peabody, spokeswoman Kelley Wright said the company continues to work with the Attorney General's Office ""regarding our disclosures, which have evolved over the years.""",1
"On 'America's Newsroom,' Sen. Joe Manchin explains why he believes the emissions rule is 'wrong'The battle over the Environmental Protection Agency’s contentious Renewable Fuel Standard is about to get incandescent.After more than a year of uncertainty, the EPA is preparing to finalize new targets -- they are supposed to be revealed annually -- for the controversial standard, or RFS, by the end of this month. EPA is so far behind, in fact, that some of the quotas it is about to deliver are for 2014 and 2015 -- years that are long gone and nearly so.Adding further to the strange situation, the quotas for future years, especially for rare so-called cellulosic bio-fuels made from specialty grass, or crop refuse, are likely to continue to be, as the agency puts it, sharply “higher than what the market would produce and use in the absence of such market-driving standards.”Even so, those amounts  are going to be lower than current law otherwise mandates, meaning that, as it has in the past, EPA will set standards that no one can meet, then waive them in favor of targets that EPA only guesses can be met,  and “that would not be expected to occur in the absence of those volume requirements.”The quotas for corn-based bio-fuel, however, could well remain flat, or even slightly less: a proposed version of the new standards, which could still vary in the final version, set the amount for 2015 at 14 billion gallons.As EPA ruminates, a growing chorus of business and environmental critics, as well as neutral scientists, are charging that the decade-old bio-fuel quota system, still mostly centered on corn-based ethanol, is distorting food markets, polluting national waters, and throwing off more greenhouse gases than the gasoline they currently replace. The new targets, they argue, will only make things worse.“The EPA is in a real bind.” Some critics want the RFS eliminated entirely. Others charge that the quota for corn-ethanol production, which makes up about 85 percent of U.S. biofuels, is the worst offender while other bio-fuels -- mostly non-existent in practical terms -- need a mandate to flourish.RFS supporters -- among them corn grower and biofuel associations, legislators (including Republicans) from corn producing states and some environmental groups -- insist naysayers are distorting the issue, millions of tons of greenhouse gases are being eliminated, U.S. consumers are saving billions of dollars using biofuels, and thousands of jobs are at stake.Both sides are laying down barrages of targeted TV ads in selected states to reinforce their permissions as the new deadline approaches.

      For its part, the Obama administration is maintaining an intriguing silence, at least in some quarters.In documents filed for the Paris climate summit that begins Nov. 30 -- the same day EPA is slated to unveil its new bio-fuel goals -- the administration makes no mention at all of the impending RFS changes in its plan to make more drastic cuts in U.S. greenhouse gases through 2025 to slow “climate change.”In effect, the White House is making no claim that the RFS will help the U.S. make additional draconian 26 to 28 percent cuts (against a 2005 baseline) in U.S. greenhouse gases by 2025.The silence has already drawn a complaint from the Renewable Fuel Association, the country’s biggest biofuel lobby, which says that “the U.S. seems poised to ignore the most successful U.S. climate-energy policy ever enacted.”Others see the RFS as a wrong-headed and exasperating flop --based on flawed calculations of international oil prices and ongoing U.S. dependence on foreign oil, bad arithmetic on U.S. fuel economy, overly narrow estimates of the carbon emissions involved in the full life-cycle of corn ethanol production, and too-optimistic visions of how fast alternatives to corn-based biofuels would come into production.Making it worse has been an expanded, ratchet-style mandate as part of a 2007 updated version of the standard (known as RFS2) to hike the renewable fuel portion of the U.S. transport fuel supply from 9 billion gallons in 2008 to 36 billion gallons in 2022.That has been achieved largely by blending 10 percent corn ethanol into increasing portions of the nation’s gasoline supply, which helped push corn ethanol production to 14.3 billion gallons last year.But the 10 percent limit is as much ethanol as most U.S. car engines can use without suffering significant damage, known in refinery circles as the “blend wall.”  Simultaneously, thanks to drastically tightening fuel-efficiency standards, U.S. gasoline consumption projections have dramatically declined. And thanks to the fracking revolution, the U.S. is now wallowing in domestically-produced oil, which has led to a steep price drop, making biofuels far less competitive or attractive.The result? Faced with what it discreetly calls “real-world limitations,” the EPA has been stumbling since 2013 to juggle its mandate for ever-increasing amounts of transportation bio-fuels with lack of further opportunities to use them -- where the fuels even exist.Remarkably, the agency failed last year to publish RFS targets at all. EPA said the cause was the time it took to digest more than 340,000 comments on the proposed RFS quotas.In its proposed version of targets for next year and beyond, however, the agency has indicated that it no longer intends to respect the limits of the blend wall, by greatly expanding the future production of non-corn biofuels.Among other things, this would make higher percentages of bio-additives available for the limited number of engines that can use 15 percent blending or, in the case of “flex-fuel” vehicles, up to 85 percent.As the EPA more opaquely put it in the proposed version of its rule that was issued last summer, and will be revised for November 30:  “We believe that the supply of renewable fuels can continue to increase in the coming years despite the constraints associated with shortfalls in cellulosic biofuel production and other advanced biofuels, and constraints associated with supplying renewable fuels to the vehicles and engines that can use them.”The EPA assertions have set off loud alarm bells in Congress. In a Nov. 4 letter to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, 184 Representatives declared it was “critical” that EPA keep from breaching the blend wall and “help limit the economic and consumer harm this program has already caused.”Many of EPA’s assertions also have been challenged by academic researchers, including the way EPA calculates environmental and greenhouse gas benefits.A study released last month by researchers at the University of Tennessee cited a 2011 National Academies of Science study in arguing that figures on corn ethanol’s greenhouse gas benefits in relation to gasoline do not include the emissions, usually from burning natural gas, that are used in processing the fuel before burning it in engines. Nor do the calculations include emissions involved in switching agricultural or forest land to corn production, which has happened as a result of the corn ethanol boom.(A 2010 EPA environmental impact study, in fact, estimates that even using the agency’s own greenhouse accounting, it takes roughly 30 years for corn plantings to make up the emissions that result from converting non-agricultural land to their use.)The study notes that corn ethanol also has additional environmental problems, starting with higher rates of soil erosion than other crops, high amounts of required water use, and greater amounts of ozone precursors and other air-polluting by-products.Moreover, the study notes, diluting current gasoline supplies adequately to reduce carbon emissions in combustion doesn’t take 14 billion gallons of corn ethanol, but more like 4.34 billion.In all, the study says, subsidies to corn ethanol production since 2005 amount to more than $50 billion.“Corn needs to be de-emphasized,” Burton English, one of the Tennessee researchers, told Fox News. Indeed, the study argues, the current emphasis on corn-based ethanol is one of the major barriers to the development of other advanced biofuels.“If the goal was to move to cellulosic ethanol from corn,” Burton said, “we are not doing it.”The thrust of the Tennessee study is disputed by Jeremy Martin, the top biofuel expert at the Union of Concerned Scientists’ Clean Vehicles Program. Martin told Fox News that “inputs to their analysis” in the Tennessee report are “dated,” and gave implied support for current levels of corn ethanol production.“The report from Tennessee suggests we should expand production of advanced biofuels at the expense of current biofuels, while keeping the share of gasoline fixed at 10 percent,” he said in an email to Fox News.  “I think we need to keep cutting oil use, but certainly agree we should focus on advanced and cellulosic biofuels rather than further expanding corn ethanol.”“It would be better if the Renewable Fuel Standard were simply repealed,” argues John DeCicco, a research professor at the University of Michigan Energy Institute and a former senior fellow at the Environmental Defense Fund.DeCicco told a subcommittee of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology last week that “the Renewable Fuel Standard has been harmful to the environment since its inception,” adding that “the impacts have been worse since 2007,” when additional biofuel targets were added.Calculations of corn ethanol’s greenhouse case savings were based on “an incorrect notion of carbon neutrality,” DeCicco said, that did not include, for example, the “harvesting of feedstock.”As a result, he said, “The lifecycle models used for public policy to date assume carbon neutrality for biofuels without checking whether the conditions are verified for actual biofuel production.”“The EPA is in a real bind,” DeCicco told Fox News after the hearing. “Congress wrote a law mandating imaginary fuels. These have failed to materialize in any quantity. Congress tried to codify wishful thinking.”Moreover, he said, “the kinds of red flags I am raising are known.” DeCicco told Fox News that “I am one of many scientists” who has shared what he called “facts-on-the-ground” studies “with the administration, EPA and others” about the emissions gap.Noting the administration’s silence about ethanol at the upcoming Paris summit, DeCicco noted, “they have good reason to be more cautious.”So, perhaps, did the EPA. Last month, the agency’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) announced that it would begin “preliminary research” on whether, among other things, EPA had fulfilled its responsibilities to keep Congress updated with changes in findings on the environmental impacts of biofuels.The OIG noted a 2011 EPA report to Congress on the topic, which was supposed to be followed up every three years, and asked for a copy of any such subsequent document. After an initial meeting with EPA officials late last week, OIG was likely to spend 90 days on the preliminary research phase. Any follow-up fieldwork, if required, might take as much as a year.An OIG spokesman declined to tell Fox News the results of the watchdog’s request for documents, including the follow-up to its 2011 impact report.However, when Fox News queried EPA directly for access to documents requested by the Inspector General, and specifically the updated version of the 2011 report, a spokesman emailed back a link to the 2011 report only.George Russell is Editor-at-Large of Fox News.

          Yale is closing its Climate &amp; Energy Institute.
          After years of feeling the heat, Yale’s Climate & Energy Institute is finally facing an inconvenient truth: the program will close at the end of June.The shuttering follows three consecutive years of budget cuts for the program, which was established eight years ago to conduct climate change research. The impending closure was announced Monday afternoon in an email from the institute’s co-directors, geology and geophysics professors David Bercovici and Jay Ague, and reported by the Yale Daily News.“While not all good things have to come to an end, sometimes they just do,” the email said.Despite the institute’s termination, Yale’s Energy Studies program will continue.The institute’s purpose is to analyze how climate change interacts with modern energy use. Students have conducted research on topics such as monitoring groundwater during fracking and how climate change impacts diarrhea rates. Recent lectures have included “climate change and human rights,” “climate change and evolving investment strategies” and “should Yale adopt an internal carbon tax?”Warning signs that the end was near had been on the horizon for years, as budget cuts reportedly gutted the program.“They eventually cut funding so much that it just became buying food,” student James Barile told The Daily News.Several students involved with the institute expressed shock and frustration with the decision.“It can’t be a budget thing. It can’t be,” YCEI New Haven Energy Scholar Intern Matthew Goldkang said. “I don’t want to say that Yale doesn’t support [the YCEI], but…I think it’s the administration’s lack of interest. I had no idea we were going to be completely cut. It’s really sad.”",1

          Dec. 21, 2016: The Exxon logo is displayed agove the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) shortly after the opening bell in New York.
          (Reuters)State Democratic officials are facing mounting accusations they secretly coordinated with climate activists to investigate whether ExxonMobil hid the truth about global warming, as new documents show the collaboration went deeper than previously thought.Emails obtained and released by the Energy & Environment Legal Institute show a number of state attorneys general and their staff received advice and guidance from environmental activists at a March 29 meeting in New York, on the same day as a major press conference.The meeting included a presentation by Peter Frumhoff of the Union of Concerned Scientists on the “imperative of taking action now on climate change.” Matt Pawa, who litigated against Exxon in a global warming case, was also in attendance, giving a presentation regarding climate change litigation to the AGs and their staff.The emails suggest a degree of secrecy surrounding the meeting. One email chain shows Pawa asking Lemuel Srolovic, chief of New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman’s Environmental Protection Bureau, if he can confirm his attendance to a Wall Street Journal reporter. Srolovic requests he not do so.“My ask is if you speak to the reporter, to not confirm you attended or otherwise discuss the event,” Srolovic wrote.Another email chain shows Srolovic and Scott Kline, a Vermont assistant attorney general, even drawing up a Common Interest Agreement, in order to protect as privileged the discussions at the meeting.The meeting occurred the same day as a press conference featuring former Vice President Al Gore where 17 attorneys general announced a coalition to more aggressively target oil companies they claim have deceived the public over the risks of climate change.Massachusetts and the U.S. Virgin Islands, whose AG is an independent, announced probes into the oil giant the same day. California Attorney General Kamala Harris had announced a similar probe in January. The probes follow a related investigation by Schneiderman’s office, who subpoenaed Exxon’s financial records and emails last November.The latest emails are hardly the first sign of a coordinated push against Exxon.According to the Wall Street Journal, a January meeting in Manhattan was a key moment in the plan to unleash a Big Tobacco-style government probe of oil companies. The meeting brought together several veteran environmental activists to discuss how to “establish in [the] public’s mind that Exxon is a corrupt institution that has pushed humanity (and all creation) toward climate chaos and grave harm.”As more emails are released, Exxon is striking back.“These revelations from the meeting in January, and now these emails, show that there is a lot of collaboration, collusion, conspiracy -- pick a word -- that shows these groups and trial lawyers working together to attack a company that has 75,000 employees and millions of shareholders,” Alan Jeffers, media relations manager for ExxonMobil told FoxNews.com. “That’s who these people are attacking, these employees and shareholders who benefit when the company does well.”""In the end, it seems the only parties that may be breaking the law are those colluding AGs in their scheme to silence political opposition, while seeking funds for their preferred policy agenda,” Chris Horner, an attorney who obtained the email records for the E&E Legal Institute and whose own group was targeted with a subpoena, wrote in a FoxNews.com op-ed.A spokesman for the New York Attorney General’s office denied any accusation of collusion.“The office routinely collaborates with other states and receives input from outside organizations. Ultimately, decisions on which cases we pursue are based solely on the merits and the law—and nothing else,"" Matt Mittenthal told FoxNews.com in an email.Schneiderman has indicated ExxonMobil is not the only energy company in his office's crosshairs, vowing to prosecute any that committed fraud to maximize profit at the public's expense “to the fullest extent of the law.”ExxonMobil last week issued a challenge to a subpoena issued by the Virgin Islands, calling it unwarranted and an attack on ExxonMobil’s freedom of speech.FoxNews.com’s Jennifer Hickey contributed to this report.",1
"Environmentalists backing a Big Tobacco-style government probe of oil companies plotted their strategy for targeting companies like ExxonMobil at a closed-door meeting in Manhattan earlier this year, according to a Wall Street Journal report.The report sheds new light on an evolving campaign against the fossil fuel industry that has drawn in several attorneys general who are now investigating ExxonMobil.According to the Journal, the January meeting in Manhattan was a key moment and brought together several veteran environmental activists to discuss how to “establish in [the] public’s mind that Exxon is a corrupt institution that has pushed humanity (and all creation) toward climate chaos and grave harm.”Critics described the meeting as proof of “collusion” in the campaign against ExxonMobil.That push has developed as several AGs -- most recently in Massachusetts and the U.S. Virgin Islands -- have launched their own investigations into claims that oil companies misled the public about the risks of global warming.The company went to court Wednesday to try to block a subpoena by the Virgin Islands attorney general. “The chilling effect of this inquiry, which discriminates based on viewpoint to target one side of an ongoing policy debate, strikes at protected speech at the core of the First Amendment,” the company’s court filing said, according to the Journal.The newspaper reported that environmentalists want to encourage state prosecutors, as well as the Justice Department, to launch investigations.“It’s about helping the larger public understand the urgencies of finding climate solutions,” Lee Wasserman, head of the Rockefeller Family Fund which hosted the January meeting, told the Journal. “It’s not really about Exxon.”While the state investigations utilize different laws, they all aim to replicate the success of the federal government’s 1999 case against Big Tobacco, in which the industry was accused of misleading the public about smoking and nicotine risks.Exxon representatives say the accusations against the oil giant are “laughable” and “not credible.”",1

(Reuters)As fast as the ice shelves melt and the waters continue to rise, there are still those given a platform to keep their head in the sand. In his recent Fox News op-ed for Earth Day, Terry L. Anderson accused the Emmy-winning documentary series, “Years of Living Dangerously,” of being scientifically inaccurate in its stark portrayal of the dangers posed by carbon pollution. As climate change experts and the chief science advisors to the series, not only do we disagree, Terry is just plain wrong.  And we have the science to prove it.The first scientific report on the dangers posed to a livable climate by burning fossil fuels was delivered to President Johnson over 50 years ago. Since then the science has only become more conclusive.  In 2014, the U.S. National Climate Assessment concluded “the observed warming and other climatic changes are triggering wide-ranging impacts in every region of our country and throughout our economy.” Last month, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine released a new report highlighting that climate change is already worsening some extreme weather events.Yet Anderson claims climate change is not occurring fast enough to pose a danger to humans. Unfortunately, many climate change impacts are accelerating. Ice loss by both the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets has sped up sharply in recent years – as has the rate of sea level rise. Anderson’s claim temperatures are rising 1°F per century is simply untrue. NASA reported last year that global temperature is increasing nearly 3 times that rate since 1970, consistent with the models. Since then, 2015 crushed the previous record for hottest year ever (2014), and 2016 is already on pace to smash that record.The “Years of Living Dangerously” series remains committed to telling the unvarnished story of this race – the bad news and the good, the science and the solutions -- so people can make their own informed decisions and understand why leaders like the Pope have been embracing action.In our upcoming season, which premieres on National Geographic in mid-October, we examine the race between the accelerating impacts (like sea level rise and extreme weather) and the accelerating advance of clean energy solutions (like solar, wind, batteries, and electric cars). We also tell stories that highlight the painful realities of what happens when the effects of climate change are ignored—like that of the Ndiamaguene, a remote farming village in Senegal that New York Times columnist and YEARS contributor Tom Friedman recent visited with our team. In Ndiamaguene, there are almost no young or middle-aged men because the farmlands no longer bear enough food to the men to provide for their families. As are result, they’ve all scattered to find work to support their families.With the historic signing of the Paris Climate Agreement on Earth Day, world leaders unanimously reaffirmed their understanding that the threat of irreversible catastrophic climate change is real – and that there are viable solutions. The question is will we adopt them fast enough. Who will win the race? That is the story of the century that “Years of Living Dangerously” tells and will continue to pursue this fall when a second season airs on National Geographic Channel.Heidi Cullen, Ph.D., is Chief Scientist for Climate Central. Joseph Romm, Ph.D. is author, “Climate Change: What Everyone Needs To Know."" The authors are the chief science advisors to ""Years of Living Dangerously,"" which premieres on the National Geographic Channel in October.",1

          (The Associated Press.)Friday, April 22, is “Earth Day” – the date environmental activists have used since 1970 to raise awareness about the “environmental crisis.” But this Earth Day is different. Rather than protesting, environmental activists are celebrating implementation of an all-encompassing global plan that will once and for all end mankind’s despoliation of the planet.I jest, of course. What actually happened is that Secretary of State John Kerry drove in a motorcade to the United Nations headquarters on Manhattan’s Turtle Bay, shutting down parts of midtown and causing enormous amounts of congestion, pollution and frustration for ordinary New Yorkers.During an hour of earnest but boring speeches – this was the U.N. after all – noted climate expert Leonardo di Caprio called for an end to climate change (and the total transformation of the world economy), which he modestly compared to President Lincoln’s call to end slavery. Then Kerry, carrying his grand-daughter, and representatives of 170-odd other nations, who had flown in with their spouses and entourages (at great expense and generating thousands of tons of greenhouse gases) formally signed an agreement that they or other representatives of their nations had already agreed – and which has no hope of ending climate change.Then everyone went shopping.The reality is that the so-called Paris Agreement on climate change will not materially reduce the rate at which the earth warms, which is probably not bad news. For one thing, the world is warming far less quickly than alarmists once thought, and still usually claim. And in fact, a little bit of warming is likely to be beneficial, especially in the U.S., where warmer winters will reduce heating bills—and the burning of carbon-based heating fuel.A little warming will also extend growing seasons, which in combination with the world’s high and still rising levels of carbon dioxide (the basic food for plants) will increase crop production. And the thaw is already opening up the North West passage through the Arctic seas, which will reduce the time and cost of transporting goods between Europe and Asia.So what will signing the Paris agreement do? First and foremost, it could provide cover for all sorts of mischief. According to a briefing by the State Department, the signing will initiate a process by which the administration can formally “join” the agreement through executive action.Usually, new treaties must be ratified by the Senate, which the current Republican majority would never do. The administration’s justification for “joining” the agreement through executive action rests on the presumption that it is not a new treaty but merely is a means of implementing the U.N.’s Framework Convention on Climate Change – a 1992 treaty that the U.S. has already ratified, and whose objective is to “combat dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.”The Obama administration’s unorthodox action is intended not only to help lock in existing climate policies – including the hugely expensive Clean Power Plan, which is currently stayed by the Supreme Court  – but also justify new executive actions that would further restrict carbon emissions and send more taxpayer subsidies to the green cronies who own renewable energy companies.Plans to do this, according to a recent State Department briefing, are already in the works.That’s what the administration wants to happen. But it’s not clear yet that it will come to pass.First, as noted, the Paris Agreement won’t do much if anything to reduce any warming that does occur, or slow down future warming. One big reason: the world’s biggest carbon emitters, including China and India, are not pledged to cut their own climate emissions any time soon. Any hypothetical future U.S. reductions won’t change that.And second, to the extent that the Paris agreement arbitrarily redirects our resources towards low-carbon and renewable energy—its real aim-- it will lower rates of innovation and growth, which will hinder the ability of people to adapt to whatever climate change does occur.In other words, to the extent that it does anything about climate change, the Paris Agreement is mostly counterproductive. And it almost certainly does nothing to achieve the objective of the Framework Convention.The Paris Agreement is largely a ruse concocted by climate alarmists and cronies to justify current and future policies that would benefit them but harm the rest of us. Try to remember that when the big limo caravans carry dignitaries to the ceremony, adding further to the clouds of carbon and confusion that the ritual is intended to reinforce.",1

          (The Associated Press.)Predictions of environmental gloom and doom meet us at every turn. At the entry of the Chicago Field Museum, for example, is a digital clock reporting “the number of species that have gone extinct since 8:00 this morning”—31 by 1 p.m. on March 27, 2016. Discussions of climate change almost always include terms such as catastrophic, irreversible, and irreparable. Documentaries fill the airways with titles such as “Catastrophic Failure” and “Fossil Free” as Leonardo Di Caprio partners with NetFlix to produce a multiyear eco-catastrophe series.The Emmy Award winning series, “Years of Living Dangerously,” hosted by Hollywood’s greenest actors, produced enough apocalyptic storytelling to leave viewers with feelings of guilt, despair, frustration, and helplessness. Is it any surprise, therefore, that the International Journal of Mental Health Systems reported that a survey of Australian children found that a quarter were “so troubled about the [environmental] state of the world that they honestly believe tit will come to an end before they get older.” The result is the feeling that we are locked in a war to save the planet, a war that only can be won with an arsenal of government regulations.The Emmy Award for “Years of Living Dangerously” was in the category of non-fiction, but fiction might have been a more appropriate category because the facts simply do not bear out many of the gloom and doom predictions.Take the Field Museum clock, for example. Ecologists use models—mathematical equations—to predict that “Every day, up to 105 species are lost” for a rate of 10 percent per decade.Fortunately when the model predictions are put up against actual data, they aren’t borne out. In the case of endangered species, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) documents only 800 extinctions over the past 400 years and none were reported in 2015.Now consider the dire prediction regarding global warming and think of climate like golf. It is easy to see where the ball has landed after it has been hit, but difficult to construct a model to predict with much confidence where the next ball will land. There are just too many variables.The actual record of global land-ocean surface temperatures shows that they have been rising at a rate of 0.67°C (1° Fahrenheit) per century (measured in terms of the deviations of annual mean global temperatures from the 1951-80 average). At that rate, it will take more than 500 years for the earth to heat up 4°C (7° Fahrenheit)—the temperature that many scientists claim would be catastrophic. Even by fitting a curve to the data, rather than a straight line, it still would take more than 130 years to reach the danger level. Yes, temperatures are rising, but not at a catastrophic gloom and doom rate.Not only are temperatures not rising as fast as climate models predict, CO2 emissions in the United States are not continuing to rise either. Between 2000 and 2013, CO2 emissions fell from 5.5 billion metric tons to 4.9 billion metric tons, a rate of 0.7 percent per year. During the same period, emissions per capita declined at an average annual rate of 1.4 percent and emissions per unit of GDP declined 2.4 percent.Perhaps even more interesting than declining carbon emissions is evidence that this is not due to government regulations. Hoover research fellow Carson Bruno, hypothesized that California’s aggressive anti-carbon policies would make the “Golden State” shine compared to other states, “especially given the U.S.’s overall lackadaisical approach to climate change.” Using U.S. Energy Information Agency data, he found that California CO2 emissions reductions were about the same as the other 49 states on all measures. In other words California’s ambitious anti-carbon regulations are not reducing CO2 emissions any faster, but they are very costly. Moreover, the main reason why carbon emissions are declining is that entrepreneurs are finding more efficient way to use fossil fuels and new ways of generating energy.The final example of gloom and doom that just isn’t true is forest cover. From an early age children are taught to recycle paper as a way of saving trees. The first reason this is a myth is that paper is produced mainly from plantation forests planted to be harvested and planted again. While those trees are growing, they are sequestering carbon, which, when converted into paper and disposed of in a landfill, sequesters that carbon for a long time.  The same is true for houses made mainly from lumber.The fact is that forest cover in the United States has remained constant despite concerns of urban sprawl thought to “pave paradise and put in a parking lot,” as sung by Joni Mitchell. For the past decade, forest cover has been approximately 33 percent, slightly above the global average of 31 percent.As with carbon emissions, abundant forest cover is not due to the federal government’s forest management policies. Yes, timber production on U.S. Forest Service lands has declined by 83 percent since the spotted owl in the Pacific Northwest and other environmental scare stories stifled logging in the 1990s. However, as unmanaged forests have become denser and older, they have also become more susceptible to drought, fire, disease, and insects. As a result, forest mortality has tripled as harvesting has declined leaving our national forests with a negative growth rate.To be sure, we humans need to be cognizant of the limits to Mother Nature’s bounty, and we need to improve her productivity through human ingenuity. Rather than despair, we can celebrate Earth Day 2016 knowing that the environment is getting better all the time.",1

          FILE -- New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman (AP)
          Emails obtained by the Energy & Environment Legal Institute (E&E Legal) show that the offices of New York Democratic Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and those of other politically aligned AGs, secretly teamed up with anti-fossil fuel activists to launch investigations against groups whose political speech challenged the global warming policy agenda. These emails, obtained under open records laws, shed light on what followed after a January meeting, reported by the Wall Street Journal on April 14, in which groups funded by anti-fossil fuel Rockefeller interests met to urge just this sort of investigation and litigation against political opponents. Recently, after the think tank the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) criticized the AGs’ intimidation campaign, U.S. Virgin Islands Attorney General Claude Earl Walker — one of the AGs  working with Schneiderman — subpoenaed ten years of the non-profit organization’s records relating to climate change.The latest email release strongly suggests a financial incentive for AGs to pursue their political opponents, rather than merely silencing and scaring away support for those who dare disagree with their extreme global warming agenda. The e-mail correspondence between Schneiderman’s staff, the offices of several state attorneys general, and various activists covers the weeks leading up to a March 29 “publicity stunt” press conference with former Vice President Al Gore, to announce the targeting of opponents of the global warming agenda.The correspondence shows government officials actively trying to hide their coordination, by using a “Common Interest Agreement.”  This sought to protect as privileged the discussions about defending President Obama’s controversial global warming rules, and going after political opponents using the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).Most intriguingly, this sought to hide discussions among the AGs, “their staff and certain outside advisors”. These communications and coordination included:Pawa and Frumhoff have been pushing for this investigation for years, at least since a 2012 workshop entitled “Establishing Accountability for Climate Change Denial,” a brainstorming session in California for activists on ways to convince state attorneys general to investigate “deniers” using RICO laws.As the Vermont and New York correspondence show, Pawa and Frumhoff were invited to secretly brief the state attorneys general.  They each received 45 minutes to provide arguments on “climate change litigation” and “the imperative of taking action now” immediately prior to the AGs’ press conference, according to schedules prepared by Schneiderman’s office.The next day, March 30, Pawa wrote to Eric Srolovic of Schneiderman’s office and Vermont’s Scott Kline seeking help. A Wall Street Journal reporter wanted to talk to Pawa, and he asked the two officials: “What should I say if she asks if I attended?”Srolovic replied: “My ask is if you speak to the reporter, to not confirm that you attended or otherwise discuss the event.”The documents obtained by E&E Legal also include responses to a questionnaire sent to the state attorneys general by Schneiderman’s office.  U.S. Virgin Islands AG Walker reveals his interest, having just completed an $800 million settlement from Hess Oil company, in “identifying other potential litigation targets” and ways to “increase our leverage.” The Hess money, Walker wrote, was used to create an “environmental response trust”.Other AGs across the country have criticized these investigations. West Virginia AG Patrick Morrisey has said, “You cannot use the power of the office of the Attorney General to silence your critics.”Oklahoma AG Scott Pruitt and Alabama AG Luther Strange issued a joint press release stating, “It is inappropriate for State Attorneys General to use the power of their office to attempt to silence core political speech on one of the major policy debates of our time.”AG Jeff Landry of Louisiana said, “It is one thing to use the legal system to pursue public policy outcomes; but it is quite another to use prosecutorial weapons to intimidate critics, silence free speech, or chill the robust exchange of ideas.” In the end, it seems the only parties that may be breaking the law are those colluding  AGs in their scheme to silence political opposition, while seeking funds for their preferred policy agenda.  It is they who need to come clean.Chris Horner is an attorney in Washington, D.C. who obtained the email records for the Energy & Environment Legal Institute.  He is also a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute.",1

          FILE - In this Nov. 3, 2015, file photo, provided by Southern California Gas Co., SoCalGas crews and technical experts attempt to safely stop the flow of natural gas leaking from a storage well at the utility’s Aliso Canyon facility near the Northridge section of Los Angeles.
          (Javier Mendoza/SoCalGas via AP, File)California Gov. Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency in a Los Angeles suburb on Wednesday over a massive natural-gas leak that has been spewing methane and several other gases into the air for months, sickening residents and forcing thousands to evacuate.Brown said in a statement he acted based on the requests of people in the community of Porter Ranch and the “prolonged and continuing” nature of the gas blowout at the underground storage facility.The Southern California Gas Co. line has been gushing up to 1,200 tons of climate-changing methane daily, along with other gases, since October. It is going to take months before workers can fix the leak.Brown has urged the gas company to come up with backup plans in case efforts to close the blowout fail and ordered emergency regulations for other gas-storage facilities throughout the state. Brown didn’t suspend state laws, cut any red tape or commit resources or public funds to address the massive leak, according to the Los Angeles Times.The utility is paying thousands to relocate families who complained of nosebleeds, nausea and other ailments from the fumes.The Los Angeles school board already has declared the crisis an emergency and has moved students out of schools near the leak. Los Angeles Councilman Mitchel Englander said the blowout is “one of the most devastating environmental disasters in the history of California.”Englander is one of a growing number of local officials and community members who urged the governor to act. Resident Matt Pakucko is another. He leads a community group that has been pushing for the state declaration and said he cried when he heard about the order.Pakucko, speaking from a hotel where the gas company had moved him and his girlfriend, said he faced doubts from his community about pressing the governor to declare an emergency.""I'm not worried about being validated or vindicated, but that people get what they need,"" he said. ""And that's what we've been pushing for.""The massive leak amounts to about a quarter of the state’s total methane output, a big blow to Brown’s plans to cut carbon emissions. The site is one of the country’s largest underground natural-gas storage facilities and can hold enough natural gas to fuel Southern California for a month.Timothy O’Connor, a director for the California Climate Initiative for the Environmental Defense Fund, told the Los Angeles Times Wednesday that Brown’s actions “not only recognized the immediate need to stop the massive leak, but sets in motion a longer-term effort to protect people and the environment from methane leakage.”Brown also ordered the state Air Resources board to develop a plan to diminish the leak’s emissions.Brown toured the site of the leak for the first time earlier this week and met privately with residents in the area. The governor previously resisted local calls for a state declaration, saying he wanted to make sure the utility, rather than the state, bore the financial cost.In his order, the governor said that California expected the utility to pay expenses related to the leak and that the state would ensure the utility's customers were protected from paying higher rates as a result.Southern California Gas President Dennis Arriola said in a statement Wednesday that the company was focusing on stopping the leak and minimizing the harm to residents. The utility would work with the state to offset the long-term environmental impact of the methane, Arriola said.Brown's order also forbids any additional injection of natural gas into the storage site for the time being. It directs state air officials to update the public regularly on the health risks and to plan a way to offset the huge emissions of methane.The governor also directed a long-term look at the future of gas-storage sites in the state, including whether the fossil-fuel facilities fit Brown's ambitious plans to ramp up the use of solar, wind and other, cleaner energy sources.One of Brown's strongest critics in the leak, Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich, said the crisis is a ""massive failure"" of state oversight. On Wednesday, he called for an independent review of gas-storage sites and wells across California.The Associated Press contributed to this report.Click for more from the Los Angeles Times.",1
"Saying the government should lead by example, President Barack Obama is ordering the federal government to nearly triple its use of renewable sources for electricity by 2020.Obama says the plan to use renewables for 20 percent of electricity needs will help reduce pollution that causes global warming, promote American energy independence and boost domestic energy sources such as solar and wind power that provide thousands of jobs.Obama was set to announce the plan Thursday as part of his wide-ranging, second-term drive to combat climate change and prepare for its effects. A plan announced in June would put first-time limits on carbon pollution from new and existing power plants, boost renewable energy production on federal lands and prepare communities to deal with higher temperatures.The Associated Press obtained an advance copy of the executive order on renewable energy, which applies to all federal agencies, civilian and military. The Defense Department has previously set a goal that 25 percent of its energy needs should be supplied by renewable energy by 2025.Obama said federal agencies have reduced their greenhouse gas emissions by more than 15 percent since he took office in 2009 but said the government can do even better. The government should lead by example, he said.The federal government occupies nearly 500,000 buildings, operates 600,000 vehicles and purchases more than $500 billion per year in goods and services.The government currently has a goal of using 7.5 percent of its electricity from renewable sources, but Obama said recent increases in renewable energy supplies make the new 20 percent goal achievable by 2020.The White House did not provide an estimate for how much money, if any, the proposal would save over the next decade.The order on renewable energy is one of several steps the administration is announcing this week on energy efficiency.On Tuesday, officials announced a plan to cut energy waste at multifamily housing such as apartments and condominiums and released a 2014 fuel economy guide to help motorists choose fuel-efficient vehicles.As part of the administration's push to expand renewable energy, the Pentagon last year committed to deploying 3 gigawatts of renewable energy on Army, Navy and Air Force installations by 2025 -- enough to power 750,000 homes.",1

          Dec. 7, 2015 - A picture of a globe at the COP21, the UN Climate Change Conference in Le Bourget, north of Paris. World governments are meeting to seek a solution to climate change, focusing on reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, primarily by shifting from oil, coal and gas to cleaner energy sources. (AP)
          As negotiators in Paris worked to finalize a global agreement on climate change, the Republican-controlled House on Friday approved a bill that would block trade deals from being used to cut greenhouse gas emissions.Supporters said the wide-ranging bill would beef up enforcement of U.S. trade agreements and help prevent counterfeit goods from entering the country. The bill also would make permanent a moratorium that prevents states from taxing access to the Internet and blocks trade deals from requiring changes to U.S. immigration laws.The bill was approved on a 256-168 vote. Twenty-four Democrats joined with 232 Republicans to support the bill. The bill now goes to the Senate, where a vote is expected next week.Opponents, mostly Democrats, said the bill sends the wrong message as U.S. diplomats meet in Paris with more than 190 nations to finalize an agreement to reduce man-made carbon emissions and adapt to rising seas and increasingly extreme weather.Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich., said the climate provision was inserted by Republicans who oppose action on climate change. Many Republicans in Congress question whether human activities are contributing to global warming.""The Republican Party of the United States may be the only political party anywhere in denial about climate change,"" Levin said. ""That denial is why this provision ... on climate is before us.""Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, said the bill ""will level the playing field for Americans and also make it easier for them to compete in a global marketplace.""The provisions on climate change and immigration ensure greater oversight of executive-branch negotiators who work on international trade agreements, Brady said.""Trade agreements should not include provisions on immigration or greenhouse gas emissions,"" he said, noting that there are other ways for officials to address both immigration policy and global climate change.House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said the bill ensures that U.S. trade laws are enforced, that trade is streamlined and efficient and that trade agreements are not used to make significant changes to other U.S. policies, including expansion of access to visas allowing foreign nationals to enter the country.The provision on Internet taxation helps spur online innovation and ""preserve Internet freedom so it can continue to be an engine for economic growth and human development,"" McCarthy said.Democrats complained that the bill stripped important protections against currency manipulation and eliminated penalties against countries that engage in human trafficking.""We need to get these countries to meet minimum standards on trafficking, certainly well before we enter into a trade and investment relationship with them,"" Levin said. ""Unfortunately, this (legislation) does not get us there.""House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the bill ""turns a blind eye to human trafficking"" and criticized it for refusing to address climate change as part of trade negotiations.""You can't separate climate and commerce,"" she said.The trade enforcement bill follows a series of votes over the summer in which the Republican-controlled Congress passed major legislation to strengthen President Barack Obama's hand in global trade talks.Obama reached a deal in October with 11 Pacific Rim countries that cuts trade barriers, sets labor and environmental standards and protects multinational corporations' intellectual property.Trade unions and liberal groups say the deal will expose American workers to foreign competition and cost jobs. Obama and most GOP leaders say the deal allows U.S. products to reach more markets.Under a law approved this year, Congress can approve or reject the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, but cannot change it.",1
"In the first international test for his climate-change strategy, President Barack Obama pressed world leaders Tuesday to follow the United States' lead on the issue, even as a one-day United Nations summit revealed the many obstacles that still stand in the way of wider agreements to reduce heat-trapping pollution.""The United States has made ambitious investments in clean energy and ambitious reductions in our carbon emissions,"" Obama said. ""Today I call on all countries to join us, not next year or the year after that, but right now. Because no nation can meet this global threat alone.""Obama was the headliner at a marathon session of world leaders who promised to spend billions of dollars to take better care of the planet.Tuesday's one-day meeting at the annual U.N. General Assembly involving more than 100 world leaders was a forum for non-binding pledges. It was designed to lay the groundwork for a new global treaty to tackle climate change in December 2015, but it also revealed the sharp differences that divide countries on matters such as deforestation, carbon pollution and methane leaks from oil and gas production:-- Brazil, a key player in deforestation, said it wouldn't sign a pledge to halt deforestation by 2030.-- The United States decided not to join 73 countries in supporting a price on carbon, which Congress had indicated it would reject.-- And minutes after Obama said ""nobody gets a pass,"" China's Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli insisted the world treat developing nations, including China, differently than developed nations, allowing them release more heat-trapping pollution. China has signed a carbon-pricing agreement.""Today we must set the world on a new course,"" United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon said in opening remarks. ""Climate change is the defining issue of our age. It is defining our present. Our response will define our future.""In some ways, the climate summit answered that call.The European Union said its member nations would cut greenhouse gases so that by 2030 they would be 40 percent below the 1990 level. The vow also calls for using renewable energy for 27 percent of the bloc's power needs and to increase energy efficiency by 30 percent.The United States will not release new emissions targets until early next year.More than 150 countries set the first-ever deadline on Tuesday to end deforestation by 2030, but the feasibility of that goal was eroded when a key player, Brazil, said it would not join. Forests are important because they absorb the main greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide. The United States, Canada and the entire European Union signed onto a declaration to halve forest loss by 2020 and eliminate deforestation entirely by 2030.And world leaders promised in their non-binding remarks to spend a total of at least $5 billion to make the world more sustainable. That often includes turning away from the burning of coal, oil and gas and away from the destruction of the world's carbon-absorbing forests.Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, stressed it could be done without harming the economy. He said over the next seven years, the European Union would provide $3 billion euros (nearly $3.9 billion) to help developing countries become more sustainable.""The European Union is on track to meet our targets and at same time we have seen our economy grow,"" Barroso. ""We prove climate protection and a strong economy must go hand in hand.""France promised $1 billion. Korea pledged $100 million. Others, like Chile, pledged cuts in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020.When it comes to forests, if the goal is met, the U.N. says it would be the equivalent of taking every car off the road in the world. A group of companies, countries, and nonprofits also pledged to restore more than 1 million square miles of forest worldwide by 2030. Norway vowed to spend $350 million to protect forests in Peru and another $100 million in Liberia.Japan, which had relaxed earlier promised targets, vowed to issue new goals early next year and become a model for a low-carbon society. It also said it was launching a satellite to monitor and verify emissions. Canada pledged to make cars and trucks more fuel efficient.Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro used the opportunity to chastise ""polluting powers"" for causing an ""evil of such planetary dimensions"" and then wanting to barter their way out of their responsibilities.Seychelles President James Michel called small island nations like his ""victims of this pollution"" and said it was up to the countries that burn the most coal, oil and gas to do the most.""If they don't do something, the Earth will not survive and that will be the end of us all,"" Michel said in an interview before the start of the summit.Ban, actor Leonardo DiCaprio, former U.S. Vice President Al Gore and Rajendra K. Pachauri, who headed the Nobel Prize-winning panel of scientists that studied the issue, warned that time was short. By 2020, Ban said, the world must reduce greenhouse gases to prevent an escalating level of warming that world leaders five years ago called dangerous. Leaders in 2009 pledged to keep world temperatures from increasing by another 2 degrees Fahrenheit (3.6 degrees Celsius).Pachauri and Ban told world leaders the effects of global warming are already here, pointing to a U.N. building that flooded during the devastating Superstorm Sandy in 2012. Pachauri said it will get worse with droughts, storms, food and water shortages. He foresaw even more violent climate-driven conflicts.And, Pachauri said, ""a steady rise in our death toll, especially among the world's poorest. How on Earth can we leave our children with a world like this?""",1
"Over 90 percent of funding for a diesel reduction program paid for by the stimulus law was misspent, according to a report by the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Office of Inspector General (OIG).An audit analyzing $26.3 million in funding to non-profit organizations and state governments meant to reduce truck emissions and create jobs found that the program had “significant financial management issues.”The OIG reviewed six projects under the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act (DERA) program, finding four “did not meet all the objectives of the award,” or their requirements under the Recovery Act. Five of the six projects “did not have a financial management systems that met federal requirements that applied to the grant award.”“As a result, we questioned a total of $23.8 million of the $26.3 million claimed under the assistance agreements,” the OIG said.The OIG said the entirety of a $9 million grant given to Cascade Sierra Solutions was wasted after the non-profit failed to accomplish any of the project’s goals. The grant was intended for upgrading diesel trucks made before 2007 with emission control technologies.Click for more from The Washington Free Beacon",1

"Shannon Bream reports from WashingtonPresident Obama reportedly plans to do an end-run around Congress to forge an international climate change deal, effectively bypassing the Constitution's requirement to get the Senate's approval for a treaty.The New York Times reported that the agreement is slated to be signed at a United Nations meeting next year in Paris. However, because the U.S. Senate is unlikely to ratify any international climate treaty, Obama’s negotiators reportedly are working toward an alternative agreement – a “politically binding” deal that would serve in lieu of a bona-fide treaty.One expert with the Natural Resources Defense Council told the Times “there’s some legal and political magic to this.”The developments underscore the administration’s dim chances of being able to rally the constitutionally mandated two-thirds majority in the Senate to ratify a new international treaty. But at a time when the House already is suing the president over his alleged abuse of executive power, the move to go around Congress is likely to strike a nerve with lawmakers.""Once again, the president is trying to go around Congress and ignore Americans who cannot afford more expensive, extreme energy regulations,"" Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said in a statement.State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki downplayed the reported developments in a statement on Wednesday.""Not a word of the new climate agreement currently under discussion has been written, so it is entirely premature to say whether it will or won't require Senate approval,"" she said. ""Our goal is to negotiate a successful and effective global climate agreement that can help address this pressing challenge. Anything that is eventually negotiated and that should go to the Senate will go to the Senate. We will continue to consult with Congress on this important issue.""The Times reported that while the agreement would not have the full force of a treaty, it would “name and shame” countries into cutting fossil fuel emissions.The proposal was described as a hybrid – combining the legally binding conditions from an existing 1992 treaty with “new voluntary pledges.”By doing so, negotiators reportedly claim the new agreement would not require a ratification vote.Under the terms, co-signers would have to enact climate change policies but would be on the honor system for cutting to specific emissions levels and sending money to poor countries.House science committee Chairman Lamar Smith, R-Texas, said international agreements require congressional approval as an ""important safeguard.""""This yet another example of a president who is willing to ignore the rule of law to get what he wants,"" he said in a statement.Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., said in a statement Wednesday that the report shows Obama has ""given up on his dream of enacting an internationally binding global warming treaty,"" reiterating that the Senate would not ratify such a treaty.He added: ""We will continue to fight the president's economy crushing domestic greenhouse gas regulations. U.S. economic competitiveness is hanging in the balance, and additional U.S. restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions will only hurt the United States as other nations like Australia either scrap or water down their unsuccessful green dream policies.""",1
"New tax could increase price by almost $1 a gallonCalifornians already pay the nation's second highest gas tax at 68 cents a gallon -- and now it will go up again in January to pay for a first-in-the-nation climate change law.""I didn't know that,"" said Los Angeles motorist Tyler Rich. ""It's ridiculous.""""I think it’s terrible,"" added Lupe Sanchez, pumping $4.09-a-gallon gas at a Chevron near Santa Monica. ""The economy, the way it is right now with jobs and everything, it's just crazy.""When gas prices go up, motorists typically blame oil companies, Arab sheiks and Wall Street speculators. This time they can blame Sacramento and former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger for passing a bill requiring California to reduce carbon emissions to 1990 levels by 2020.The tax on carbon already raised about $1 billion in revenue by requiring manufacturers and utilities to buy credits for each ton of carbon emitted into the atmosphere. At the beginning of next year, the law will also apply to oil and gas. Refiners and distributors say they will pass another $2 billion in costs on - largely to consumers.""Ultimately it hurts the consumer,"" said California Independent Oil and Marketing Association spokesman Mike Rohrer. ""It is going to affect anyone who has a vehicle. Be it a motorist that is commuting back and forth to work or a trucker just moving goods throughout the state of California, the cost is immediately going to increase because whatever we have to pay for in carbon credits ultimately we have to pass through to the consumer.""Estimates of the cost of the tax vary. The California Air Resources Board, the Golden State's premier anti-pollution agency, predicts the new tax will raise gasoline prices from 20 cents to $1.30 per gallon. A prominent state senator who helped author the bill estimated the cost at 40 cents a gallon. Environmental activists downplay the cost, but hail the impact.""We're going to now tackle probably 40 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the state that are emitted mostly through transportation - oil and gas use,"" said Climate Resolve Executive Director Jonathan Parfrey.The cost of the climate change law never was spelled out in the original bill in 2010, which did not even include transportation fuels.But any meaningful climate change law would have to address driving, the state's largest single source of pollution. By raising the price, officials hope to reduce the number of miles driven as consumers are forced to consider options.""We have to effect a transition away from the polluting of fuels that we currently have,"" said Parfrey. ""We have to pay a little extra so that we're making sure that our energy in the future is not going to be spoiled.""Not everyone is sold on the idea. Europe tried a cap and trade program in the last decade and pollution levels still increased dramatically.California is the only state to extend the idea to gasoline. By the end of the decade, the state is expected to collect $5 billion in revenue by charging businesses and consumers for the right to pollute. So far the state collected $833 billion by selling 'carbon credits' to polluters.""They have generated close to a billion dollars in revenue just from the carbon tax credit auctions that have been going on for over a year. Where has that money gone?"" asked Rohrer.""And why do we have to tax the consumer to make this happen for clean air? Everyone is for clean air but let’s not hurt the consumer in the process and not giving them a full explanation of how this exactly works and why.""Last week California sold all of the nearly 22.5 million carbon credits it offered this year. Revenue from the auction is deposited into California's greenhouse gas reduction account. There it is used not just to reduce emissions or the cost of pollution controls for business, but also to build low-income housing near mass-transit hubs and support construction of the state's high-speed rail project.Critics claim the money could be better spent to directly reduce emissions from industrial sources. Instead, some say the fund acts more like a pot of money for state politicians to build projects in their district for residents who may or my not use the transportation alternatives.",1
"Journalist and scientific organizations accused the Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday of attempting to muzzle its independent scientific advisers by directing them to funnel all outside requests for information through agency officials.In a letter Tuesday, groups representing journalists and scientists urged the EPA to allow advisory board members to talk directly to news reporters, Congress and other outside groups without first asking for permission from EPA officials. An April memo from the EPA's chief of staff said that ""unsolicited contacts"" need to be ""appropriately managed"" and that committee members should refrain from directly responding to requests about committees' efforts to advise the agency.The scientific advisory board's office had asked the EPA to clarify the communications policy for board members, who are government employees.""The new policy only reinforces any perception that the agency prioritizes message control over the ability of scientists who advise the agency to share their expertise with the public,"" the groups wrote.The EPA relies on independent advisory boards to weigh complex scientific information and to advise the agency on policy, such as setting new standards for air pollutants. Recently, Republicans in Congress have been critical of the scientific advisory board overseeing the review of the ground-level ozone standard, saying it failed to evaluate the consequences of recommending a tougher limit.For journalists, it's the latest skirmish involving transparency issues and the Obama administration. Last month, more than three dozen groups wrote to the White House about what they described as growing censorship throughout federal agencies. Last year, dozens of leading news organizations protested restrictions that sometimes keep journalists from taking pictures and video of President Barack Obama performing official duties and two press groups urged members to stop using official photos and video handed out by the White House, dismissing them as little more than ""government propaganda.""An EPA spokeswoman said there are no constraints on members fielding requests in a personal or professional capacity. She said the memo was designed to assure transparency.The groups signing the letter include the Society of Professional Journalists, the Society of Environmental Journalists, Investigative Reporters and Editors, Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, Society for Conservation Biology, American Geophysical Union and the Union of Concerned Scientists.",1
"Speaking in New York City last week, Wall Street billionaire Tom Steyer laid clear his vision for penalizing people whose actions may contribute to climate change.“We need to reward people whose behavior reduces climate risk and penalize people who add to it,” said Steyer “If we can get this right, I think there’s no doubt that our economy is going to continue to do very well.”He was joined by several wealthy businessmen — such as Michael Bloomberg and former bankers and government officials Hank Paulson and Robert Reich— to unveil a report from Risky Business, an economic analysis of the financial impact to be caused by climate change.A Wall Street baron, Steyer’s words are not to be taken lightly. Deemed the ‘liberal answer to the Koch Brothers, he’s one of the richest businessman in the United States and played a key part in raising millions of dollars to elect Barack Obama in 2008 once Hillary Clinton lost the Democratic nomination.He met with the president this week to discuss what the White House could do to tackle climate change, and how “insurance industry’s role in helping American communities prepare for extreme weather and other impacts of climate change,” according to Reuters.Click for more from Watchdog.org",1
"The jury's still out on whether Monday's Supreme Court ruling will have any effect on the Environmental Protection Agency's proposed rule to limit carbon emissions from power plants.Both opponents and defenders of the EPA push claimed victory in the 5-4 and 7-2 decisions on a pair of EPA permitting programs for large industrial emissions sources, a reflection of the nuanced case before the high court.The Supreme Court, in a majority opinion written by Justice Antonin Scalia, ruled the EPA could not require companies wishing to expand or modify existing facilities to get a pre-construction permit under the programs in question simply because they emit greenhouse gases.The ruling also said that the EPA had improperly interpreted the Clean Air Act to mean it must regulate greenhouse gas emissions. It noted the agency cannot rewrite the Clean Air Act to work within the framework of directly regulating those emissions from major stationary sources, as it had attempted to do to avoid regulating entities such as schools and churches.Click for more from WashingtonExaminer.com ",1

(AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli,file)
          Two Republican challengers to incumbent California Gov. Jerry Brown say that the state's government failed to properly prepare for what they call a foreseeable drought crisis.The drought emergency Brown declared last month has added to the pressure on the Democratic governor to address longstanding problems with the state's water storage and delivery systems. Brown has proposed a $25 billion plan to build two massive tunnels to ship water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River delta to farms and communities.The two Republican candidates, Assemblyman Tim Donnelly, R-Twin Peaks, and Neel Kashkari, a former U.S. Treasury official, both say the most pressing need is for more water storage, although it would do little to help ease the current shortfall.""Let's get going with the piece of this that everybody agrees on -- the storage. I think we can get support for that,"" Kashkari said.Although Democrats and environmentalists have often resisted building reservoirs and expanding the state's storage capacity, instead favoring water conservation, Kashkari said ""the politics have changed,"" amid the crisis. He said he believes there is now consensus.An $11.1 billion water bond is already slated for the November ballot, but lawmakers believe it is too expensive and too loaded down with special projects to win favor with voters. At least four alternative proposals are circulating, but Brown has declined to say whether he would support any of them. He has said he is unsure whether any package can get voter support.Donnelly said he would support a water bond that is ""strictly water, nothing else, no political payoffs. But it has to address every region of the state.""""Southern California has to become part of it; it has to own up to its own responsibility in water usage. That means major conservation, and it means we need to invest in desalinization,"" Donnelly said.Kashkari said he favors breaking up the bond and pushing a measure solely dedicated to storage.But the bond, a hard-fought, bipartisan deal brokered in the Legislature in 2009, reflects the complexity of sensitive negotiations on water politics. It includes money to move water, store it, protect sensitive environmental areas and ensure clean drinking water.Neither of the Republicans supports the centerpiece of Brown's water proposal, the $25 billion plan to build two 35-foot long tunnels, a 10- to 15-year project that is intended to make it easier to pump water from the Sacramento River to Central Valley farms and Southern California cities. It also includes money for delta habitat restoration.Donnelly wants to ask voters to repeal the contentious high-speed rail project and divert nearly $9 billion in bonds approved for it to water projects. While that proposal is unlikely to win support from Democrats in the Legislature, Donnelly said he believes the crisis brings opportunity.""I don't know that it'll all be reached in the Legislature this year, but I am encouraged to see for the first time in a long time, all of the players coming to the table so they can at least have the conversation,"" Donnelly said. ""And I'm willing to work with anybody who has a better idea so we can get this done.""The Associated Press contributed to this report. ",1

          The Green Climate Fund, (GCF) a United Nations-affiliated piggy-bank  intended to finance climate change projects around the world, is determined to win sweeping U.N.-style immunities from prosecutions for its global operations--even though  the U.S., its biggest contributor, opposes the idea, and the U.N. itself says its own diplomatic immunities can’t cover the outfit.The immunities issue could well spark even deeper opposition from Republican lawmakers in next year’s Congress to the Obama Administration’s aggressive climate change policies--which include a recent $3 billion pledge to the Fund.“We would definitely be opposed to any extension of immunity to the Fund,” said a senior aide to Republican Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma, who will chair the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works starting in January.“What do they need protection from?” he asked. “In essence, they are doing business development projects. If you look at the way millions of people do transactions across national borders, they do it without immunity and very successfully.”Apparently undeterred, fund officials told Fox News that they are now trying to hammer out “bilateral agreement templates” that could be laboriously negotiated with each country where it operates—a total that could eventually reach the great majority of  the U.N.’s 193 members.The Fund has already negotiated one agreement of immunity—with its new host country, South Korea, as a condition of moving its headquarters there last year.If the GCF succeeds in its broader negotiations, not only billions but eventually trillions of dollars in climate funding activities could fall outside the scope of criminal and civilian legal actions, as well as outside examination, as the Fund, which currently holds $10 billion in funding and pledges, expands its ambitions.The shield would cover all documentation as well as the words and actions of officials and consultants involved in the activity documentation—even after they move on to other jobs. As a tasty side-benefit, the “privileges” attached to such “privileges and immunities,” as they are known in diplomatic parlance, mean that employees get their salaries tax-free.Just why the GCF needs the sweeping protections is not exactly clear. In response to questions from Fox News, Michel Smitall, a Fund spokesman, provided mostly opaque answers.“Privileges and immunities are intended to facilitate GCF activities in countries in which it operates and the GCF’s ability to use contributions by donor countries in an effective and efficient manner that serves the objectives agreed by its member countries,” he said.Smitall added that it is “premature” to give out any information on the specific scope of  privileges and immunities, because these “would be negotiated bilaterally with countries in which the GCF operates.”The immunities, however, “are expected to cover a range of issues,” he said,  “such as protecting GCF staff members acting in their official capacity and facilitating their official travel and protecting taxpayer dollars contributed by donor countries.”The GCF, he added, “functions in a transparent manner, with strong oversight by its [24-member] Board. To the extent that there are civil or criminal actions against the GCF, we would work closely with the authorities of the relevant country.”Smitall’s statements, of reassurance however, did not cover the prospect that in many developing countries, those same national authorities may well be direct or indirect partners in the activities the Fund is financing, or the fact that national authorities in many of the developing countries where the Fund hopes to operate are spectacularly corrupt.The assurances apparently have also failed to win over Obama Administration officials (the U.S. is a GCF Board member). ""The Green Climate Fund is an independent institution wiht an independent Board and Secretariat, which is by design separate from the United Nations,"" a U.S. Treasury official told Fox News.Treasury officials did not answer, however,  other emailed Fox News questions about whether other countries supported the U.S. position, and about U.S. views on the GCF's new country-by-country approach.The British government, which has recently given $1.2 billion to the GCF through its Department for International Development (DFID), is staying close-mouthed about the immunities issue.  “The GCF Board will be deliberating the issue of privileges and immunities in 2015 and UK will engage in those discussions,” a DFID spokeswoman told Fox News.The GFC’s determined pursuit of immunity highlights the broad zone of legal ambiguity that is proliferating in the era of international action against climate change, led by organizations operating under the aegis of the United Nations without being explicitly part of it.The GFC, for example, is a by-product of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or UNFCCC, which is the legal home of the Kyoto Protocol and the forum for hammering out a successor treaty that is now expected to be unveiled at a climate summit in Paris late next year.Despite its name, the UNFCCCC is also not an organ of the U.N. that automatically gets and passes on  the same kind of sweeping immunities as direct U.N. subsidiaries, or that are granted by international agreement to major development banks.  That position was underlined in an opinion from the U.N. Office of Legal Affairs in 2006.The GCF, in turn,  is a child of the UNFCCC—via a 2011 decision of UNFCCC parties--with its standing just as fuzzy—a situation that it has been trying to change since at least 2012.The effort to get that status shifted into a higher gear in November 2013, when the Fund’s Board sought another legal opinion from the U.N.’s Office of Legal Affairs on  whether it could obtain a “link” between its own status and that of the U.N., along “hybrid” lines derived from U.N. subsidiary organs.The answer came back to the GCF board at a meeting this May—No.The Board apparently did not want to accept that answer.  A single sentence in a Board report at an October, 20144 meeting in Barbados notes that “a mission toNew York in August also helped prepare the UN Climate Summit and explore how the Fund may acquire privileges and immunities,” presumably with the same people who already  had replied in the negative.(Questioned by Fox News about the August mission, GCF spokesman Smitall replied more circumspectly that “GCF Secretariat staff, including its general counsel, met with U.N. staff to engage in technical discussions to better understand the scope of U.N. immunities and the possibilities of U.N. linkage, given that the GCF is not a U.N. body.”)While the rewards of  immunities are still something that GCF does not wish to discuss in detail, the potential risks they pose—to other people—have been raised by  critics who looked at disasters where U.N. immunities played an important role—such as Haiti.U.N. peacekeepers from Nepal are almost universally believed to have introduced cholera in October 2010  to the earthquake shattered nation that had not seen the disease in a century. About 700,000 cases and 8, 560 deaths have been reported since then.After denying U.N. involvement in the epidemic for many months, U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon invoked U.N. diplomatic immunities in rejecting lawsuits brought against the world organization by relatives of the victims. Lawsuits in U.S. courts are still ongoing, but the State Department has supported the U.N.’s blanket immunity status.“As we are seeing in the wake of the Haiti cholera epidemic, once we have agreed on privileges and immunities to any mission, they offer an extreme amount of protection to activities that could affect populations badly,” notes Brett Schaefer, an expert on the U.N. at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington. ‘’They should be awarded only in circumstances where they are truly necessary and critical to the mission or fulfillment of the mandate of the organization.”“That is not the case,” he added, “with the GCF""—a position that the Fund is working as hard as it can to overcome.George Russell is editor-at-large of Fox News and can be found on Twitter: @GeorgeRussell or on Facebook.com/George Russell",1

          EXCLUSIVE: The Obama administration can expect a knock-down battle with the next Congress over its announced $3 billion contribution to the United Nations-affiliated Green Climate Fund, a centerpiece of talks over a new treaty on greenhouse gas emissions held in Lima, Peru, last week.“If they think they are going to get all that money for the fund, they’re mistaken,” a senior aide to Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., told Fox News. “You’re going to see us being more aggressive about not sending more money to the U.N. and elsewhere for climate change.”Inhofe is the incoming chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee in the Republican-controlled Senate that will be take office in January, and a vocal skeptic about the administration’s drastic climate policies.He is not a member of the powerful Appropriations Committee that actually decides how U.S. taxpayer money is doled out. But aides point out that climate skepticism shared with other Republicans, and a hoped-for end to the cliff-hanger process of  funding the government through catch-all legislation like the $1.1 trillion “Cromnibus” bill that passed late Saturday,  give a real edge to the climate fund threat.Skepticism about climate change funding, the aide indicated, would be a “top priority” of Inhofe.Failure to honor the Green Climate Fund commitment would deal a huge blow to the aggressive climate strategy of an administration that has already announced that it will double down on its own cuts to carbon emissions by 2025, with 26 percent to 28 percent reductions beyond what it has already achieved.[pullquote]Blocking the money also would give a possibly mortal wound  to the increasingly Rube Goldberg business of organizing a global climate deal in the face of economic austerity, resistance from rising industrial powers such as India, and virtually no evidence that global temperatures have risen in the past two decades.The Lima climate session that closed Sunday was already teetering on the edge of failure due to tensions between developing nations that want both drastic carbon cuts from developed nations and mountains of cash to pay for green projects on their own territory.In the end, organizers hailed the nebulous outcome, built on as-yet unrevealed “national commitments” to reduce carbon emissions, as a solid step toward creating a successor to the now defunct Kyoto Protocol. The intention is to make the final deal at a climate summit scheduled for Paris late in 2015.One of the few quantifiable achievements at Lima, however, was the growing size -- at least in terms of pledges -- of the Climate Fund, or GCF. It topped $10 billion, including the U.S. contribution, about $1.5 billion from Japan, and a spate of smaller pledges by other Western nations.The fund is intended to help finance green projects that cut carbon emissions in the developing world; developing countries expect it to grow to enable green investments worth more than $100 billion annually by 2020.But that depends, among other things, on whether the Obama administration’s $3 billion check bounces -- a question that will not be fully answered until early next year, after the White House submits a budget request for fiscal 2016. The Green Climate pledge money will be included in that request.The administration got a foretaste of the likely resistance read in the Cromnibus bill itself. It contained a stopper to prevent money from the catch-all funding from being dedicated to the Green Fund, while acknowledging that the White House had not yet asked for the $3 billion it announced for the Fund in mid-November.“The 2015 budget is not relevant for GCF funding,” a Fund spokesman told Fox News, “since we understand that the U.S. administration will first submit a budget request for the GCF as part of the 2016 budget.”When that happens, the rules of the game for getting a congressional stamp of approval on GCF money are likely to have changed considerably.While the Cromnibus bill wrapped up funding for 11 sections of the government into one massive piece of legislation, Inhofe’s senior aide said that the Republican Senate next year will return to a more regular order of business -- allowing senators to “really get into the weeds at each agency” -- and thus selectively cut and add funds through budget amendments.“For the past eight years, Senate Majority Leader [Harry] Reid prevented lots of amendments from going forward, and limited members’ ability to engage in the process,” the Inhofe aide said.That engagement, he implied, was likely to put a major chill on climate change funding.George Russell is editor-at-large of Fox News and can be found on Twitter: @GeorgeRussell or on Facebook.com/George Russell",1
"President Obama will propose sending $3 billion in aid to help developing nations adapt to the effects of climate change, according to multiple media reports.The anticipated contribution to the Green Climate Fund, an independent trust fund established by the United Nations, is expected to drum up support for donations from other countries ahead of climate talks next year in Paris. It likely won't represent a net increase in U.S. foreign aid, as Republicans would block such a move — rather, the White House will probably attempt to shift money from similar programs.""I think there would be political difficulties if it resulted in a net increase in foreign aid,"" said Alden Meyer, a longtime observer of international climate negotiations and policy director with the Union of Concerned Scientists. ""No doubt I think the administration is going to have to make a case to get the funding for the Green Climate Fund appropriated here.""Nations will meet next week in Berlin in hopes of raising $10 billion for a three-year funding period. The potential U.S. dollars put the Green Climate Fund more than halfway to that goal, bringing the total pot to about $5.4 billion, and could be key for engaging developing nations in the U.N. climate talks.Click for more from WashingtonExaminer.com ",1
"An upcoming Environmental Protection Agency rule cutting greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants could spawn more regional cap-and-trade programs and greater electricity collaboration, according to industry experts.The EPA rule, which is expected to be announced June 2 and is the cornerstone of President Obama's climate change strategy, likely will preserve ways for states to band together to reach emissions cuts sought by the agency, insiders have said about the closely guarded proposal. Interest in joint measures could be high because of the broad scope the EPA is leaning toward for implementing the rule.""There's early conversations among states that regional pooling of their resources would be desirable because of the interconnectedness of their grids,"" Tim Profeta, director of the Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions at Duke University, said on a conference call with reporters.That's because the EPA is looking at using an ""outside the fenceline"" tactic for imposing the rule. That means it would regulate the power sector across the entire spread of the electric grid -- from the coal-fired generators to the transmission lines to the distribution utilities that send electricity to customers -- rather than at individual smokestacks.Click for more from WashingtonExaminer.com ",1

          (AP)Taxpayers paid more than $5 million to create climate change games, including voicemails from the future warning that “neo-luddites” will kill global warming enthusiasts by 2035.Columbia University’s Climate Center has received $5.7 million from the National Science Foundation for the university’s “PoLAR Climate Change Education Partnership,” to “engage adult learners and inform public understanding and response to climate change.”Based on the theory that games “motivate exploration and learning of complex material,” the school created “Future Coast,” a website that features hundreds of made up voicemails painting a dire picture of the future as a result of climate change.“There’s a lot we don’t know about our possible futures, but one thing we do: It’s got a software glitch in it, in the voicemail system, which is sending their voicemails back to our time,” the website explains. “As these futurismo objects we call chronofacts.

Weird.”The messages are “banal, mysterious, and terrifying,” about “possible climate changed futures” in attempts to convince the public to act on climate change now.“Who hasn’t wondered what the future will be like for us and for our planet?

"A new and dire global warming report from the Obama administration warns of a growing link between human activity and extreme weather across the country -- but Republicans charge the findings will be used to muscle through costly emissions regulations.The National Climate Assessment, four years in the making, gave a region-by-region breakdown of how climate change is impacting the United States -- in the form of droughts, heat waves and increasingly intense hurricanes, though it is still uncertain how much of that is due to ""human activity."" The report stopped short of definitively attributing a rash of extreme weather to man-made climate change, concluding ""there is new and stronger evidence that many of these increases are related to human activities.""""Climate change, once considered an issue for a distant future, has moved firmly into the present,"" the 840-page report states. ""Corn producers in Iowa, oyster growers in Washington state and maple syrup producers in Vermont are all observing climate-related changes that are outside of recent experience.""The report predicts that the weather-related repercussions of climate change ""are expected to become increasingly disruptive across the nation throughout this century and beyond.""The report, though, quickly came under fire from Republicans, who said the administration would use it to push job-killing regulations.""Instead of making the environment drastically better, the president's strategy will make the climate for unemployed Americans even worse,"" Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said in a statement. ""The American people have made it clear that they want Washington to focus on the economy and make it easier for them to find good jobs. Once again, President Obama is completely ignoring their concerns -- and doubling down today on extreme regulations that will put more Americans out of work.""In a counterpoint of sorts to the report, Barrasso and other congressional Republicans representing western states released their own findings later Tuesday morning highlighting state efforts to protect the environment. The report highlights local air and water policies, and criticizes ""one-size-fits-all"" regulations it accuses the administration of imposing.Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell said the cost of such federal regulations will be ""borne by the middle class.""The administration's latest report comes as the administration battles congressional Republicans over its climate agenda. White House counselor John Podesta said Tuesday that the report shows there ""is no debate"" about climate change, and said those who deny it are ""working themselves in a froth.""A day earlier, he warned that attempts by congressional lawmakers to block the administration's climate action plan will fail.Podesta told reporters during a briefing at the White House that President Obama is committed to moving forward with controversial Clean Air Act regulations to cut carbon dioxide emissions for all new coal and gas-fired power plants.Republicans have branded the president's climate plan as a ""war on coal"" and have sponsored legislation to roll back planned Environmental Protection Agency greenhouse gas standards they argue will harm the nation's economy.""They'll find various ways, particularly in the House, to try to stop us from using the authority we have under the Clean Air Act. All I would say is that those have zero percent chance of working. We're committed to moving forward with those rules,"" Podesta said.The report also comes as the administration delays a decision on the controversial Canada-to-Texas Keystone pipeline. Environmentalists oppose it, but Republicans and some Democrats are pressuring the administration to approve it.The climate report looked at regional and state-level effects of global warming, compared with recent reports from the United Nations that lumped all of North America together. A draft of the report was released in January 2013, but this version has been reviewed by more scientists, the National Academy of Science and 13 government agencies and had public comment.Even though the nation's average temperature has risen by as much as 1.9 degrees since record keeping began in 1895, it's in the big, wild weather where the average person feels climate change the most, said co-author Katharine Hayhoe, a Texas Tech University climate scientist. Extreme weather like droughts, storms and heat waves hit us in the pocketbooks and can be seen by our own eyes, she said.And it's happening a lot more often lately.Winter storms have increased in frequency and intensity and shifted northward since the 1950s, the report also claims. Also, it says, heavy downpours are increasing -- by 71 percent in the Northeast. Heat waves, such as those in Texas in 2011 and the Midwest in 2012, are projected in the report to intensify nationwide. Droughts in the Southwest are likewise forecast to become stronger. The report claims sea levels have risen 8 inches since 1880, and projects them to rise between one foot and four feet by 2100.Critics of the report, however, contend that its dire projections are more political than scientific. ""The Administration's Climate Assessment suffers from problems similar to those in reports put forward by the IPCC, while intended to be a scientific document it's more of a political one used to justify more government overreach,"" said Sen. David Vitter, R-La., ranking Republican on the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. ""Definitive policy decisions and regional planning based on far too many uncertainties could hurt our nation's economic viability and competitiveness. Look no further than the European nations whose policy decisions led to economic failure.""The Associated Press contributed to this report.",1

          Sept. 1, 2015: President Barack Obama speaks to members of the media while on a hike to the Exit Glacier in Seward, Alaska, which according to National Park Service research, has retreated approximately 1.25 miles over the past 200 years.
          (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)SEWARD, Alaska – President Obama stared down a melting glacier in Alaska on Tuesday in a dramatic use of his presidential pulpit to sound the alarm on climate change.From a distance, Exit Glacier appears as a river of white and blue flowing down through the mountains toward lower terrain. In fact, it's just the opposite. The 2-mile-long chock of solid ice has been retreating at a faster and faster pace in recent years - more than 800 feet since 2008, satellite tracking shows.""This is as good of a signpost of what we're dealing with when it comes to climate change as just about anything,"" Obama said with the iconic glacier at his back.Obama trekked up to the glacier with photographers in tow in a carefully choreographed excursion aimed at calling attention to the ways human activity is degrading cherished natural wonders. The visit to Kenai Fjords National Park, where the glacier is located, formed the apex of Obama's three-day tour of Alaska, his most concerted campaign yet on climate change.The president, dressed for the elements in a rugged coat and sunglasses, observed how signposts along the hike recorded where the glacier once stood and now only dry land remains.""We want to make sure that our grandkids can see this,"" Obama said, describing the glacier as ""spectacular.""Obama is counting on Alaska's exquisite but deteriorating landscape to elicit a sense of urgency for his call to action on climate change. He opened the trip on Monday night with a speech painting a doomsday scenario for the world barring urgent steps to cut emissions: entire nations submerged underwater, cities abandoned and refugees fleeing in droves as conflict breaks out across the globe.Exit Glacier has been receding for decades at an alarming rate of 43 feet a year, according to the National Park Service, which has been monitoring its retreat for decades using photography and, more recently, by satellite.Glaciers ebb and flow due to normal fluctuations in the climate, and even without human activity, Exit Glacier would be retreating. But the pace of its retreat has been sped up thanks to heat-trapping greenhouse gases blamed for global warming, said Deborah Kurtz of the National Park Service.""Climate is the primary driver for the retreat of glaciers and for ice loss,"" Kurtz said.Obama's trip was more about visuals than words, and the White House has put a particular emphasis on trying to get the message across to audiences who don't follow the news through traditional means. To that end, Obama taped an episode of the NBC reality TV show ""Running Wild with Bear Grylls,"" putting his survival skills to the test while in the national park.Obama's first glimpse of a glacier on the trip came as Marine One whisked him about 45 minutes south of Anchorage to tiny Seward. As he flew past snow-capped peaks and sprawling forests, the sheet of ice emerged, snaking its way through mountains toward a teal-tinged lake.His itinerary also includes the first presidential visit to the Alaska Arctic, which comes amid concerns that the U.S. has ceded influence to Russia in strategic Arctic waters. Melting sea ice has been making way for shipping routes that never existed before, but the U.S. only has two working icebreakers, compared to the 40 in Russia's fleet — with another 11 on the way.As he boarded a U.S. Coast Guard vessel to tour Resurrection Bay on Alaska's Kenai Peninsula, Obama said he was asking Congress to speed up construction of new icebreakers. He offered few details about the timeline or costs.""These icebreakers are an example of something that we need to get online now,"" Obama said. ""They can't wait.""Although Obama's trip hasn't entailed new policy prescriptions or federal efforts to slow global warming, Obama has said the U.S. is doing its part by pledging to cut carbon dioxide emissions up to 28 percent over the next decade.Obama set that target as America's commitment to a pending global climate treaty that Obama hopes will be a capstone to his environmental legacy. Obama has urged fellow leaders to make similarly ambitious pledges as the talks near a close.Despite his efforts, the U.S. isn't a shining example when it comes to greenhouse gases. Each American emits more than twice as much carbon dioxide as a Chinese and 10 times that of someone from India, Energy Department figures show. China, the U.S. and India are the world's top three polluters.",1

          The U.S. Court of Appeals is likely to decide soon on a bid by 15 states to slow down the timetable of the Environmental Protection Agency’s sweeping plan to dramatically transform the U.S. electrical power system, which the states claim is intended to squeeze them into starting to commit themselves to vast changes before the rule that embodies the plan can be challenged in court—or has even been published.A panel of the Appeal Court’s DC Circuit has ordered both sides to submit legal arguments before the Labor Day weekend on the lawsuit to stop EPA’s ticking deadline clock on what the states call “the most far-reaching energy regulation in this nation's history,” and which many of them argue could destabilize huge portions of the U.S. electrical power grid.Under the so-called final rule EPA issued informally on Aug. 3 for what the agency calls the Clean Power Plan (CPP), all U.S. states have until Sept. 6, 2016, to submit preliminary strategies on cutting carbon emissions from their electrical power systems by 32 percent on average below 2005 levels—essentially mandating a massive conversion from coal-fired power generation to natural gas and renewable energy sources.If EPA approves the proposals, the states would then get two more years to complete planning for the sweeping changes. If states fail to make the initial submission, EPA says it will offer up its own versions of what they will have to do.By starting the deadline clock before publication in the Federal Register—which the lawsuit claims could take three to four months beyond Aug. 3 - the states charge that EPA at a minimum is forcing them to restructure priorities and prematurely throw thousands of hours of planning time at the rule before they can legally contest the plan and its 2018 final deadline.For its part, EPA says that Federal Register publication is irrelevant, and that the “promulgation” of the rule on Aug. 3 - when EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy signed the rule and posted it on the EPA website - is what matters.In a hint at another reason for EPA’s hurry-up schedule, an EPA statement says the plan “shows the world that the United States is committed to leading global efforts to address climate change”—a tacit reference to a United Nations-backed global climate change summit planned for Paris in December, where supporters hope to endorse a new legally binding treaty on greenhouse gas limits.The dissenting states - they range from Florida and Louisiana to Michigan, Ohio and Indiana - have already condemned the huge plan as an unprecedented extension of EPA authority under a little-used section of the Clean Air Act, and an illegal intrusion on their own power to regulate electrical generation systems.Almost all of them  add that the  mammoth scale of the imposed changes go much further than a proposed version of the rule published a year ago, and require five to 10 years to plan adequately and safely.In many cases, they add, they simply do not have the legal authority to comply with the terms of the rule as they unofficially know it, without getting additional legislative authority that could itself take years to obtain.Some of them point out they are already being greatly overstretched in struggling to comply with a blizzard of other EPA regulations governing ozone, methane, and other substances that are coming at them all more or less simultaneously.The Appeals Court lawsuit, however, claims EPA is additionally cheating with its initial Sept. 26 deadline, which it says is a major departure from regular practice. The huge and complex rule—the text runs to 1,560 pages, with many attendant technical documents—has not yet appeared in the Federal Register, the normal starting point for agency deadlines. Court rulings have established that Register publication is the point when legal challenges to the rule itself can be mounted.EPA told Fox News the Clean Air Act provides that agency is “moving expeditiously to have the final rule published in the Federal Register,” and “contrary to Rehearing Petitioners’ baseless speculations of delay” it will be published “in the normal course” – without defining any time line.An EPA spokesperson said current regulations “governing state plans under this part of the Act, which have been in place since the 1970s, provide states nine months to submit final state plans” and that the time periods allotted in the CPP were deliberately made longer.But those regulations refer to responses to changes under the section of the Clean Air Act that were never on the massive scale of the new rule.“If we were to wait on the EPA to get this rule published, it could be well into 2016 before the States complete arguments and receive a ruling on a request to stay this rule,” argued Patrick Morrisey, Attorney General of West Virginia, which is serving as lead plaintiff in the deadline lawsuit.“By that time, many states will already be in the middle of drafting their compliance plans ahead of the September 2016 deadline. We want to ensure that no more taxpayer money or resources are wastefully spent in an attempt to comply with this unlawful rule that we believe will ultimately be thrown out in court.”Dan Goldblatt, a spokesman for the Indiana Department of Environmental Management, said the carbon emissions goal his state faces by 2030 under the final rule “is nearly twice as stringent” as it was under the proposed version. Moreover, the amount of energy Indiana must generate from renewable sources under the new rule is about 20.5 per cent of the total — “equivalent to the current total generation capacity of nearly one-third of the states in the country.”The need for state lawmakers’ approval of the huge changes makes the process even more convoluted, he noted. “Due to the timing of the [EPA] rule, we will not be able to take anything to our legislature until the 2017 session.  This means that we must commit to a plan in 2016 for which we will not have legislative approval at that time.”“We feel so strongly that EPA has clearly overstepped its legal authority that once courts consider the rule, we maybe would not have to implement it to begin with,” Craig Butler, head of Ohio’s state Environmental Protection Agency, told Fox News.But as matters stand, his agency is still in the process of a 30-day crash marathon--along with the state  public utilities commission, power generation operators, electrical grid operators and other “stakeholders”—to understand what the CPP actually says.As part of the initial lawsuit filing, the protesting states offer a litany of complaints about the harm the fuzzy deadline is forcing on them to confront the hugely complex and interlocking plan—not only in terms of staffing demands, but in terms of over-hurried examination of the risks and multibillion-dollar costs involved in power systems that are already strained by new clean-air requirements.According to a declaration from Kansas air quality authorities, for example, the state has made $3 billion in recent investments in pollution emission reduction equipment that will be wasted, along with six coal-fired generating plants, in any effort to meet the new rule.Ohio’s Butler observes that “we have already seen over 6,000 megawatts of power shut off” due to a recent EPA rule governing mercury emissions from coal-fired plants, and there is a “sheer problem with infrastructure” to meet the new rule. Translation: the gas pipelines, and the gas, aren’t necessarily in the right place to match the new tasks.“It is not as easy to replace coal with natural gas as it is to say it,” he told Fox News—especially without adequate time to study how to go about the challenge.According to a submission by David Bracht, head of the Nebraska Energy Office—the former head of a legal firm’s renewable energy group and private-sector advisor on major wind and ethanol projects—the changes that states must propose “over the next calendar year will be irreversible and will impact the electric grid for decades.”In Nebraska’s case, he declared, they would also disrupt an 80-year tradition of local public control of utilities and likely give unprecedented control instead to multi-state regional power authorities, which in turn would require “legislative and constitutional changes on the state level that may permanently alter the daily operation of utilities.”In addition, he told Fox News by telephone, “it seems notable to me that many of the EPA’s deadlines do not reflect the long-term needs of the energy industry.”Power generating assets “typically have lives of 50 years,” he said, while the planning horizons for transmission facilities can be 3-8 years.”  The switching of power sources envisaged by the EPA’s plan also means the planning, design and creation of “major backbone transmission lines where they do not currently exist.”Nebraska gets about 50 percent of its electrical energy from coal, Bracht said, and under the earlier version of the EPA’s rule, it was supposed to cut 26 per cent of its carbon emissions from 2012 levels. In the final rule that the states are not litigating, the total jumped to 40 per cent.And when it comes to shifting from coal to less carbon-emitting fuels like natural gas, he declared, “the coal-fired plant does not necessarily have a natural gas pipeline next to it for its replacement.”“There are very few people in the United States who don’t expect the lights to work when they turn them on,” he said. “The kind of disruption this shift implies might test that.”George Russell is editor-at-large of Fox News and can be found on Twitter:  @GeorgeRussell or on Facebook.com/GeorgeRussell",1
"Sharp new regulations to fight climate changeFaced with President Obama’s vastly expensive Clean Power Plan to remake the U.S. electrical system and other looming regulatory decisions that dramatically affect energy supplies, Republican lawmakers have renewed their offensive against alleged under-the-table legal collusion between the administration and environmental lobbyists in the cascading anti-carbon agenda.A Senate subcommittee on Tuesday heard witnesses argue that “sue-and-settle” legal arrangements involving the Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and hyper-aggressive environmental organizations have cut energy suppliers and state regulators out of the discussion, speeded up the agenda to force unrealistic environmentalist priorities on the energy market, and are likely to cost consumers and producers billions of dollars in the years ahead.Such charges have been heard before, especially as the Obama Administration faced increased Congressional opposition in its second term. But they are reaching a new crescendo with the arrival of the Clean Power Plan and impending costly new rules governing ozone and methane, to name just two substances, as the Administration heads toward its lame duck year after an unprecedented blizzard of rule-making.The charges are just as vigorously disputed by the federal agencies and environmental groups.“The sue-and-settle model takes policy making away from the public and puts it into the hands of one special interest driving an agenda to ultimately prevent the use of fossil fuels,” declared Katherine Sgamma, vice-president of the Western Energy Alliance, a Colorado-based lobbying organization for small oil and gas producers.Sgamma noted that as of October 2014, there have been 88 sue-and-settle cases since the Obama Administration took power, and that 79 of them had been launched by environmental groups.Moreover, the success of some efforts have led to more.  In lawsuits involving the Endangered Species Act (which can affect not only energy production but land use across millions of acres) Sgamma noted that after the Fish and Wildlife Service made a deal with one environmental organization that involved 404 threatened or endangered species, the same organization came back the next year with demands involving 53 more.In the case of the Clean Power Plan, the “artificial urgency” of the legal effort has been “key to push the regulations out the door, rush an incredibly complex and expensive rule through standard regulatory review processes, steamroll any potential political opposition, and put pressure on the states to begin compliance activities immediately,” argued Andrew Grossman, an adjunct scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute.Calling the Clean Power Plan announced Monday by Obama and EPA chief Gina McCarthy a “naked power grab” that imposes national standards on state regulators, among others, Grossman charged that “at every step of the way, EPA has relied on sue-and-settle tactics to facilitate its outrageous conduct.”“This is not how the regulatory process is supposed to work in a country founded on the principles of the rule of law and federalism.”Sue-and-settle is shorthand for a legal agreement after plaintiffs sue a federal agency for failing to meet a deadline for undertaking a review or filing a regulation, then work with the agency privately to create a plan and new deadlines. The deals often have the effect of imposing a higher priority on the action than the cumbersome regulatory bureaucracy might otherwise give it. How they were arrived at is often sealed by the courts.Proponents argue the tactic does no more than make bureaucracies confirm to existing law.But according to critics, the supposedly adversarial process becomes something different when both sides quietly have the same objective:  it becomes a means of short-circuiting oversight, opposition, and delay that in democracies can lead to broader consensus and accommodation, especially when large and expensive undertakings are involved.Sue-and-settle “overwhelms regulatory agencies, resulting in settlement agreements and consent decrees requiring agencies to promulgate major regulations within an arbitrarily imposed timeline,” said Senator Mike Rounds, R-S.D., who chaired the subcommittee hearing.“These agreements are often negotiated behind closed doors, with little to no transparency or public input. Public comments from the states and industries regarding the feasibility or impact of these regulations are routinely ignored.”Rounds’ argument was backed by testimony from Dallas Baker, a senior official in Mississippi’s Department of Environmental Quality, who said that sue-and-settle “does not afford my state any input into the agreement, yet subjects us to the burden of satisfying the requirements of the agreement.”Baker cited the case of a letter he received last March as the result of a deal between EPA, the Sierra Club and the National Resources Defense Council, both aggressive litigators, on power-plant sulphur-dioxide emissions. The letter suddenly put Baker’s state organization on hurry-up notice to certify the acceptable status of a major power plant by upcoming September 18—a lengthy and expensive exercise—or have the power plant declared a violator, even though that status had not been previously in question. Mississippi is complying, but “the end result of EPA’s sue-and-settle in this case will be the expenditure of already stretched and valuable resources for both the state and [the power plant] with no environmental benefit,” Baker declared.“Even beyond the sue-and-settle,” Baker added, “we see EPA, where given the discretion to establish timing, chooses to be more and more stringent and less flexible.”For its part, the federal environmental agency responded to Fox News queries about the hearing testimony by referring to a February, 2014 blog post by its General Counsel, Avi Garbow, which an EPA spokesman said “still stands.”In the blog post, Garbow declared that “the ‘sue-and-settle’ rhetoric, strategically mislabeled by its proponents, is an often-repeated but a wholly invented accusation that gets no more true with frequent retelling.” EPA, he said, had no control over who decided to sue the agency, and “is not complicit in such lawsuits.”  The Department of Justice is involved in all settlement decisions and when that course is agreed on, “both agencies do so solely with the interest of the United States in hand.”In the same vein, a Fish and Wildlife Service spokesman responded to Fox News questions by referring to agency testimony from September 2014 that said settlement agreements “are often in the public’s best interest because we have no effective legal defense to most deadline cases, and because settlement agreements facilitate issue resolution as a more expeditious and less costly alternative to litigation”—meaning the cost to the agency.EPA’s spokesman also pointed to a December 2014 study by the U.S. Government Accountability Office that examined seven agency settlement agreements over a five-year period and said that none of them “required EPA to take an otherwise discretionary action or prescribed a specific substantive outcome of a final rule.”In other words, whatever else the lawsuit settlements accomplish, they did not dictate the terms of whatever the agency ultimately decided to do.That analysis, however, begs the critical question of whether the agency and its impatient suitors may already be of like mind and want to put the pedal to the metal on achieving the outcome.The same study noted that in cases involving the Clean Air Act, EPA is required to give 30 days’ notice of a settlement and invite public comment. Whether that is sufficient time, given the intimidating complexity of EPA’s often-sweeping rules—the Clean Power Plan involves thousands of pages of often-interlocking aspects—is not discussed.Moreover, the study notes, “EPA generally does not ask for public comments on defensive settlements if the agency is not required to do so by statute.”Six other “key” environmental laws examined by GAO, the document says, “do not have a notice and comment requirement for proposed settlements.”",1

          End global hunger and all forms of malnutrition and poverty by 2030, along with all urban slums around the world.  Halve the number of deaths from road traffic accidents globally (an estimated 1.24 million in 2010, according to the World Health Organization) by the same date—and “reduce levels of violence and halve related death rates everywhere” by then too. Make sure that the income of the bottom 40 percent of the population in all countries grows faster than the national average. Achieve “global resource efficiency,” and try to separate economic growth from “environmental degradation and resource use” everywhere over the next decade and a half.All of those lofty, ambitious –and for critics, improbable and not-very-closely-linked—objectives, as well as  many more, are currently being bundled, massaged and repackaged at the United Nations, to be formally unveiled  in September as the ”sustainable development goals,” the centerpiece of the latest multi-trillion-dollar U.N. bid to reshape the planet along largely socialist or progressive lines.That is the idea, anyway. According to critics of the notion, the exercise amounts to more of a grab-bag of often meaningless and hard to measure social and economic objectives, held together largely through their argued relationship to the concept of “sustainability,” a term that has not yet been very precisely defined.“They are a very big container of verbal fudge,” argues William Easterly, a former World Bank economist and co-director of New York University’s Development Research Institute, who is a longstanding critic of “top-down” government and U.N.-led efforts to lift the world’s billions of poor people out of misery. “It sounds really good, but it’s really a substitute for doing things that actually help poor people.”The main effect of the goal-making exercise, he argues, is “to create a campaign for the U.N. to get more funding and more political power. But it’s hard to imagine people getting very enthusiastic about that.”To the multiple anonymous authors of a six-page current working version of the goals, known as a “zero draft,” the aim is simple, however:  As they put it in the document’s preamble: “we strive for a world that is just, equitable and inclusive, and we commit to work together to promote sustained and inclusive economic growth, social development and environmental protection and thereby to benefit all.”They affirm simultaneously that “poverty eradication is the greatest challenge facing the world today,” and that “climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time,” and present the sustainable development goals, or SDGs, as they are known in U.N. parlance, as a series of slogan-objectives that are supposed to bind solutions to those two challenges together.Whatever else the SDGs prove to be, they are the culmination of one of the largest, bulkiest and most extensive bureaucratic exercises the U.N. has undertaken.The “zero draft” is the most concrete outcome to emerge so far  from an opaque U.N. process of negotiation centered on an “open working group” of 30 governments, including the Obama Administration, that have been huddled over the exercise since January 2013. The group ends  its final scheduled session—the 13th—on Friday July 18.Their efforts were supplemented by inputs from what the U.N. calls “major groups” of civil society, meaning industrial and labor associations, as well as thousands of non-government organizations—that is, activists of all kinds—whose participation in U.N. deliberations has grown enormously in the past decade.Coordinating all of the efforts is a “comprehensive cross-agency Technical Support Team,” which turns out to the representatives of some 40 U.N. agencies, funds, programs, and other institutions, which are helping to orchestrate the effort and will also subsequently help implement it at “global, regional, sub-regional and country levels.”In other words, the U.N. is operating at the center of the exercise as chief cheerleader, referee of the outcomes, custodian of standards for measuring its subsequent success, and, in many countries around the world, chief tutor in the implementation of what the U.N. calls an “integrated, indivisible set of global priorities for sustainable development”—whatever those ultimately turn out to be.This massive winnowing exercise was preceded by another standard U.N. exercise, the year-long deliberations of a “high level panel of eminent persons on the post-2015 development agenda”—a selection of international figures chosen by the U.N. itself—to create guidelines for the goal-making of the SDGs.In the case of the U.S., the high-level panelist was John Podesta, then head of the liberal Washington think tank Center for American Progress, and currently the man at the center of President Barack Obama’s “phone and pen” effort to impose his political agenda through aggressive bureaucratic regulation.Still to come in the SDG process are a variety of options for how to finance the entire groundbreaking planetary change agenda. These are currently being chewed over by an Intergovernmental Committee of Experts on Sustainable Development Financing. These in turn are nominated by governments that make up the 30-member “open working group.”As things now stand, the financial experts include representatives from such countries as Iran,  China, Britain, Germany, Russia, Saudi Arabia and South Africa—not to mention Cuba, Libya, Costa Rica, the Bahamas and Estonia—but there is no expert from the U.S.These documents, and a flock of subsidiary reports, will be bundled together by Ban Ki-moon in a hefty “synthesis report” to be presented as part of the hoopla.Taken together, the goals—so far, there are 17 of them, but in the “zero draft” each contains proposed sub-goals that make the total more like a smorgasbord 145-- are intended as the rallying cry at a climate summit meeting called  by United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon for September 23 in New York City, where the entire exercise will be formally presented, and where the goals will formally be presented for eventual approval by the U.N. General Assembly.The meeting, in turn, is supposed to be followed by a year of international negotiation leading among other things to a new global climate treaty, to be announced in Paris at yet another summit in September 2015, and taking effect in 2020.The sum of the processes would bind all 193 U.N. members, including the U.S., to a “universal sustainable development agenda” with the SDGs as signpost highlights, along with new targets for carbon emissions to replace the now-defunct Kyoto Protocol. Whether—and with what—the Protocol will be replaced is still very much an open issue, as defections from the Protocol, which the U.S. never ratified, had already undermined it severely.The SDGs are further intended to replace the U.N. Millennium Development Goals, or MDGs, an eight-point U.N. program of mostly anti-poverty measures that was endorsed in 2000 and is slated to expire in 2015. The MDGS have had, at best,  spotty success.Most of the gains achieved by the goals so far—such as a 50 percent cut in the number of people around the world living below the extreme-poverty guidepost of $1.25 per day—owe much to the massive improvement in standards of living in India and China over the period since  the MDGs were introduced.Nonetheless, notes NYU’s Easterly, “where the U.N. goals were successful was in raising the profile of the U.N.”The new SDGs are intended to be much more ambitious than their predecessors—and cover a lot more social, economic and environmental ground. Much of it, as the “zero draft” authors make clear in their preamble, is also linked to  a huge and turgid flow of U.N.-directed environmental and economic conferences and their outcome documents, which date back to the first Rio Earth Summit in 1992, and extend through the Rio + 20 summit of 2012, which explicitly called for the new goals.All of that documentation adds further freight to the relatively simple slogans of the SDGs.The plans behind the slogans include such highly detailed programs as the 1992 summit’s Agenda 21 (a document that details a myriad of outcomes for  global environmental management) and a further elaboration on Agenda 21 created five years later; the numbingly named Johannesburg Declaration on Sustainable Development of the World Summit on Sustainable Development (a 2002 event); along with many, many more, including The Future We Want, the concluding manifesto of the Rio + 20 summit.Compared to that flood tide of documents, the current “zero draft” of SDGs is relatively simple—which was the main point. The problem, however, notes Brett Schaefer, an expert on the U.N. and its finances at the conservative Heritage Foundation, is that simplicity and coherence are not the same thing.The SDG roster is, he says, “simply a list of objectives that groups want to achieve,” he told Fox News. “There is nothing here that logically sticks together in an overall strategy. They are a series of arbitrary objectives with no real rhyme or reason behind them.”In some case, he adds, they are also immeasurable, and even in a few cases unknowable.“How do you decide when you have ended ‘all forms of discrimination against women and girls?’” Schaefer asked. “And how do you end by 2030 ‘the epidemics of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases’? We’ve been trying for decades now. Where is the starting point for cutting world levels of violence in half?”The “zero draft” also contains fundamental contradictions, he notes; for example, between ending world hunger by 2030 and “assuring that all people have access to adequate, affordable safe and nutritious food all year round,” and the phasing out of “all forms of agricultural support subsidies”—which will cause food prices to rise.“Ultimately,” Schaefer argues, “this is based on a narcissistic delusion, that by deciding on goals, the U.N. can catalyze achievement.” The same problem held with the previous millennium development goals, he added: “The MDGs did not lead to economic development. Economic development lead to the MDGs.”Such criticism, however, will do nothing to derail the bulky and labyrinthine SDG process that will go public in September—the combined effort of innumerable bureaucrats, planners, special interest groups, governments invested in the process and attendant hangers-on who have been toiling for years to make it happen.Where it goes next will depend on the various governments that take over the subsequent negotiating process  to turn the SDGs into national policy. For Americans, that means it will depend on the very supportive Obama Administration.George Russell is editor-at-large of Fox News and can be found on Twitter @GeorgeRussellClick here for more stories by George Russell",1

Secretary-General Kofi Annan pose as they celebrate the 15th anniversary of Turner's historic $1 billion gift to the U.N. at the Global Leadership Awards dinner hosted by the U.N. Foundation and United Nations Association-USA in New York. (Reuters)
          EXCLUSIVE: The United Nations Foundation created by billionaire Ted Turner, along with a branch of media giant Thomson Reuters, is starting to train a squadron of journalists and subsidize media content in 33 countries—including the U.S. and Britain--in a planned $6 million effort to popularize the bulky and sweeping U.N.-sponsored Sustainable Development Goals, prior to a global U.N. summit this September. where U.N. organizers hope they will be endorsed by world leaders.The unprecedented media push is formally intended to start on May 25 but is already underway. It is intended to help breathe some new life into a sprawling U.N. effort--supported by, among others, the Obama administration--to create a global social and environmental agenda for the next 15 years.It is taking place in parallel with an equally strong but unrelated media cheerleading push by supporters of strong climate change action to help set in stone a new global greenhouse gas emissions treaty at a Paris summit in December.A junior partner in the U.N. Foundation media training and subsidy effort is a not-for-profit organization known as the Jynwel Charitable Foundation Limited, whose co-director is a flamboyant Malaysian financial named Jho Low. Jynwel, a Low family creation, also recently plunked down $25 million to take over a sputtering U.N. humanitarian news agency known as IRIN and sharpen its message.The training and subsidy effort “comes at a time when people want to know what it will take to eradicate extreme poverty and tackle the big questions related to sustainability,” Kathy Calvin, CEO of the U.N. Foundation, told Fox News. “If our work helps encourage the media to dive deeper into these issues, we are achieving something that is core to our mission but also a public good worthy of 2015's moment in history.”“This is an important year or a robust decision on what the world and the U.N. will do in the next 15 years,” added Aaron Sherinian, the Foundation's chief communications and marketing officer. “We thought we would do well to connect as many people to the conversation as possible.”In fact, the media-training-and-subsidy blitz could also be described as extraordinary bid to pump up public interest and editorial support for a vast and wobbly U.N. campaign to create a new social and environmental agenda that is too nebulous to criticize and too ponderous to implement with any coherent effect. Nonetheless, that agenda is intended to drive national social, economic and environmental agendas for the next 15 years.The new goals, known as the SDGs, have been under formal discussion in various U.N. fora for the past year. They consist of 17 major goals and 169 related targets and amount to a broad-based socialist and/or progressive agenda that by 2030 promises to end poverty and all forms of malnutrition everywhere, “attain healthy lives for all,” “reduce income equality within and between countries,” and “promote sustainable production and consumption,” among many other things.The subtargets cover everything from “create and diversify seed and plant banks,” to “end preventable newborn, infant and under-five deaths,” to “achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including young people and persons with disabilities,” along with much, much more.The goals are the centerpiece of what the U.N. calls the “post-2015 development process” They are a grab-bag of environmental and social development measures that are too sprawling in scope and too open-ended to be effective, or apparently even to be widely understood.So far as the new training and subsidy initiative is concerned, however, the problem is seen less in terms of problematic content and more in terms of popularizing the message by refocusing and re-educating the media—as well as helping to pay some of them for delivering the new intellectual freight.“Very often the problem of the UN is that the speeches long, full of acronyms, and the jargon is difficult to understand,” Monique Villa, head of the Thomson Reuters Foundation, told Fox News. “Making the jargon of the U.N. understandable is quite important.”Under the plan, Villa's foundation, Thomson Reuters' non-profit arm, will carry out the training under contract from U.N. Foundation. (The Thomson Reuters Foundation, according to its website, also carries on for-profit training sessions.)Journalists from Australia to Peru, and from Britain to Zimbabwe will be given five-day training programs by instructors drawn largely from the ranks of former Reuters journalists. The material will include encompass among other things how to better understand and explain U.N. opaque concepts of sustainability, with at least one section devoted to “financial and economic concepts,” Villa said.Training sessions for the journalists—whose parent organizations are as yet unnamed—are slated to run through August.U.S. training sessions will take place in New York and Los Angeles, although who will be given instruction—and whose editorial platforms will be subsidized—has not yet announced. Overall subsidies are expected to range between $25,000 and $100,000, with 15 recipients named by the end of May and another 15 by the end of June.“Depending on financing we might be able to add a few more outlets to the list” a U.N. Foundation spokesperson told Fox News.” She emphasized that the subsidies are “grants designed to enhance the capacity of media organizations to partner on these issues. Full editorial control of content remains with the media outlet.”Individual media outlets would announce their participation “once partnership details are finalized,” she said.The subsidy approach, U.N. Foundation's Sherinian said, was “not dissimilar” to the funding that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has provided for sveral years to the left-wing British newspaper The Guardian, to publish what amounts to sponsored news about economic development issues, including the Foundation's campaign to extirpate AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.“We are asking the media to do what they do well,” Sherinian added. “If a media organization has the ability to do what it has done well, and if it could do more innovative work,” then “we are asking them to engage on the issue.”The effort would also include “putting them in touch with people on the ground doing implementation work”--in other words, those who are actually going to put the goals into practice.Not all of the funding for the effort has yet been raised, he added. “We are in both implementing and fundraising mode.”At the same time as the U.N.-supporting foundations are boosting coverage of the “post-2015 development agenda,” an even bigger media coalition has just announced it will start lumping content for collective use in support of a new U.N.-sponsored treaty on greenhouse gases, which is supposed to be agreed upon at a summit meeting in December in Paris.The so-called Climate Publishers Network, a 25-member group that includes The Guardian as well as such high-profile newspaper as Le Monde in France and El Pais in Spain, as well as the China Daily, have agreed to drop their mutual licensing fees to allow all network members to share their coverage on the climate change issue prior to the December 11 summit.The network arrangement is slated to disband immediately afterward.The U.N. Foundation's Sherinian said that the two programs “were not formally affiliated in a specific way,” and said he could not confirm “if or how the outlets involved in the Climate Publishers Network coincide with those involved in our program to date.”But like the Climate Publishers with their self-imposed shut-off date, he said the U.N. Foundation would not commit to maintaining the SDG subsidy effort beyond this year—it was, he said, “too early to say.”The same could be said of the success of either full-court effort to help build a media groundswell for the expansive and expensive U.N.-supported objectives.George Russell is Editor-at-Large of Fox News.

          (AP2013)EXCLUSIVE: The United Nations-administered cap-and-trade system for reducing greenhouse gases is sitting on a cash hoard of close to $200 million, even as it warns of hard times ahead that could impede its mission.The cash cushion for the Geneva-based organization known as the Clean Development Mechanism, or CDM, amounts to more than 400 percent of the $45 million reserve that it considers a normal set-aside for rainy days, according to its recently published business plan for 2014-2015.Given the organization’s projected belt-tightening budget of about $33 million for next year, it also means the CDM’s more than 170 employees could, theoretically, do absolutely nothing for the next six years before they would have to go out of business.The CDM’s intention, of course, is to do the opposite:  it is preparing to suffer through a lean year or two and counting on 194 nations that assembled in Warsaw, Poland, this week, to successfully kick off negotiations intended to lead to a new global climate control treaty for signing in 2015 -- and, the organization hopes, a new and even bigger gusher of cash.[pullquote]That treaty would go into effect in 2020 and, its proponents hope, include the U.S., the biggest hold-out to the Kyoto Protocol, which ended the first phase of its existence last year -- the source of the CDM’s bonanza. It is now tottering with reduced international support through its “second commitment period,” which lasts, not coincidentally, until 2020.If  the new, drawn-out treaty process is a success -- a big question mark, even with  the strong backing of, among others, the Obama administration -- the CDM hopes to do at least as much carbon-trading  business -- and possibly four times as much -- over the five years from 2015 to 2020 as it did after it kicked into high gear in 2004, due to the increased “level of ambition” (translation: steeper mandated cuts in global carbon emissions) that proponents want to see embedded in the new accord.At the moment, however, the CDM is watching sign-ups for its projects plummet, facing reduced numbers of customers for the tradable carbon emission reduction certificates (CERs)  that result, and trying hard to come up with new lines of business, especially for African countries that  were largely left out of the gusher of carbon-reduction investment of the previous decade.According to a couple of sentences in a draft version of a CDM report to the Kyoto treaty parties gathered in Warsaw -- toned down in the final version -- the “serious decline” in the CDM’s momentum is a “grave concern” to the CDM’s supervisory executive board, “and should be a grave concern of [Protocol] parties and all stakeholders that have invested their time and resources to build the CDM.” The CDM, as the final version of the report has it, “is at risk.”The boom-bust cycle of the CDM -- the world’s largest single source of carbon-trading certificates -- is a rough parallel to the history of the Kyoto Protocol itself. The Protocol was signed by virtually every country in the world in 1990 -- the U.S. signed, but never ratified -- but fizzled last year, capped by the withdrawal of Canada. Nearly a dozen other countries have warned that they may follow suit, or at least fail to add to their original commitments to cut carbon emissions.For its part, the U.S., though not a party to the Protocol, has stuck by a commitment to cut national carbon emissions by 17 percent from 2005 levels by 2020, and the Obama administration is intent on expanding that commitment further in outlying years. White House websites still invoke the overall aim of the U.N.-sponsored climate change treaty process of lowering carbon emissions by 80 percent by 2050.For the CDM, those commitments can translate into a hefty cash flow. It essentially acts as a middleman in the process of creating projects in developing countries, paid for by participants in developed countries, that are calculated by its vetted experts -- predominately a host of European and Asians consulting and technical contractors -- to provide certified reductions in carbon emissions. As part of the same middleman role, the CDM sits at the center of a much bigger array of consultancies and other service providers that create and sustain its project inventory.CERs, each representing a metric ton of reduced carbon dioxide equivalent, can be issued once the verification process has been completed. These can be traded, and counted against carbon reduction commitments for Kyoto participants. They can also be used, to some degree, to offset carbon and other taxes in Europe.According to its annual report to the Kyoto treaty parties, the CDM has created 7,293 projects, issued more than 1.38 billion CERs so far, and “stands ready to further contribute through the crediting of a further 1.4 to 6.2 billion emission reductions by 2020.”Less well known is the fact that the CDM takes a fee for every CER that it issues -- worth $0.10 for each of the first 15,000 tons, and $0.20 for every ton thereafter, “to assist with the administrative expenses of the executive board and other bodies involved in the Protocol framework.”To judge from the size of the CDM surplus, the “share of proceeds” has clearly done a lot more than that. But even in 2013 -- when the number of projects registered by the CDM has dropped to about 80 percent from the previous year, fees and “share of proceeds” is expected to bring in $35 million, or just less than the CDM’s $38 million budget. The difference will hardly make a dimple in the organization’s current cash trove.The bigger worry is that the CDM’s reputation has been tarnished in the past, both by its bureaucratic ponderousness, and by some of the questionable greenhouse gas emission strategies it has fostered.A December 2011 report to the European Commission described the CDM as “costly, unpredictable, unreliable, prone to gaming,” and “counter-productive due to perverse incentives.”An analysis of CDM “green” projects at that time revealed that more than 70 percent of the investment had gone to China and India and many of the biggest were devoted to destruction of a potent greenhouse gas known as HFC-23, considered more than 11,000 times more potent than carbon dioxide.Making HFC-23 is relatively cheap, meaning that the rewards for destroying it can create huge incentives to manufacture more of it -- a “perverse incentive” that the European Commission tried to end by banning the acceptance of CERs based on HFC-23 destruction as of 2013.The banning decision, as it happens, coincides to a large degree with the roughly 85 percent decline in newly submitted CDM projects this year. (Part of that huge decline was due to an equally large spike in projects in 2012, aimed at getting them registered before the European Commission deadline took effect.)Faced with these and other criticisms, the CDM claims to have gone far to clean up its act. Only about 53 percent of its most recent projects are in Asia, the organization reports, and long-ignored Africa gets nearly 28 percent. New schemes have been pulled together that allow small-scale projects to be bundled as “programs of activities” into bigger allotments, making them more attractive for investment.But nothing so far has given the CDM relief from its biggest problem, a colossal overhang of CERs that were generated years ago, by the collapse of the moribund, high-polluting post-Communist industries of eastern Europe, and which, along with the European restrictions, have created a huge glut on the CDM carbon market.As a result, CERS are currently trading at about $0.50 each -- which in turn, means that the CDM “share of proceeds” for emitting new ones amounts to a punitive 40 percent.What will truly save the CDM is a huge spurt in demand for its emission reduction certificates --in other words, a new “level of ambition” in greenhouse gas emission cuts as a result of the new round of Kyoto talks.It is far from clear at this stage that those reductions, in the context of a new treaty, will take place. But it is already clear that the Obama administration, for one, intends to have a vigorous hand in trying to make it happen.In a submission to the Warsaw meeting about the forthcoming 2015 treaty negotiation process, the State Department called for a draft version of each nation’s carbon reduction commitments be ready by “early 2015,” in anticipation of a further “consultative process” – negotiations --prior to agreement.“For its part, the United States is working now to analyze its opportunities for reducing emissions post-2020,” the document says.  “We would encourage other parties to do likewise.”In the administration’s vision of the treaty process, each country would be encouraged to put forward its own “ambitious” commitments for the future, and “will need to be prepared to justify its commitment to the world”—a process intended, apparently, to encourage bigger cutbacks.Not all elements of such a package need be percentage reductions; some could be such things as “research and development investments,” or commitment to a -- presumably high -- price for carbon emissions.According to the U.S. submission, “a goal of this process is to encourage what we’ve called a ‘race to the top’ -- that is, a dynamic in which parties are both comfortable with putting their best commitment forward, and uncomfortable about not putting their best effort forward, because they want others to see they are contributing the most they can to solve the climate problem.”Over at the CDM, one imagines, they want to see the parties to the post-Kyoto negotiations do the very same thing.George Russell is editor-at-large of Fox News and can be found on Twitter @GeorgeRussell",1

          The energy giant is suspected of hiding memos that show it knew the dangers of global warming. (AP)
          Free speech has recently been losing its battle with political correctness. Events on campuses including Yale and the University of Missouri are Exhibit A. Less noticed but equally ominous is a campaign by environmental activists and their politician allies to use criminal and civil laws to punish fossil fuel companies for expressing doubts about the inevitability of catastrophic climate change.Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D– R.I., was already calling for RICO charges when New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman upped the ante in November with a subpoena demanding that Exxon Mobil produce decades of records about its approach to climate change. The damage Schneiderman and the rest of the Green Guards are doing to the First Amendment may well come back to haunt them.Ostensibly, Schneiderman is investigating whether Exxon Mobil was aware of but failed to adequately warn investors about the possible risks posed to the oil industry by climate change. The truth, however, is that Exxon has explicitly disclosed those risks in its financial filings and has published more than fifty scientific papers on the evidence for and against extreme climate change. ""[T]he accusation isn’t really that Exxon misled the public,"" notes Holman Jenkins in the Wall Street Journal. ""It’s that Exxon refused to sign up for [the left's] vision of climate doom that would justify large and immediate costs to reduce fossil fuel use.""While Schneiderman is entitled to champion a vision of climate doom, he is not entitled to use the laws against securities fraud to silence those with a different vision. For one thing, securities laws are aimed at the disclosure of facts that would otherwise be unknown to investors, not at societal threats that are part of the public debate. There is little doubt that nuclear war would have a catastrophic effect on corporate profits, but companies are not obligated to discuss those risks in their financial filings.Moreover, debate about matters of public concern, such as climate change, are at the core of the speech protected by the First Amendment. Last year, the U.S Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit warned against exactly what Schneiderman is attempting—allowing the government to ""regulate otherwise protected speech using the guise of securities laws.""Despite the ""corporations aren't people"" mantra, the Supreme Court has consistently said that the speech of corporations—from tobacco companies to the New York Times—is protected by the First Amendment whether it involves commercial information or political issues. Where, as in New York, the government tries to suppress speech because it disagrees with the content, the courts impose the strictest First Amendment scrutiny.Accordingly, any indictment of Exxon would likely be dismissed.  But winning in court is not the point of the New York investigation. Instead, it is akin to a SLAPP suit (a strategic lawsuit against public participation), which by definition, is aimed not at a legal victory but at silencing one's opponents in a public debate through intimidation and the burden of legal costs. Many states have enacted anti-SLAPP suit laws to protect free speech, which is under a heightened threat in Schneiderman's investigation because it is the government rather than a private party doing the intimidating.Sadly, Schneiderman, Whitehouse, and the others behind this campaign are unlikely to be deterred by the law or the facts. But perhaps they can be dissuaded with a reminder that their precedent could well come back to bite them and their sacred cows.Consider, for example, the green lobby's decades-long -- but now discredited -- warning that the world would soon run out of fossil fuels. If any company profiting from the resulting push for alternative energy had an inkling that the scarcity scenario would not pan out but failed to disclose the damage that would do to its bottom line, the company could face charges under Schneiderman's vision of securities law.And what about the groundless claim that building the Keystone Pipeline would increase carbon emissions? Perhaps a red state attorney general should launch an investigation into which green energy companies selfishly encouraged that lie without disclosing that science and logic argued against it.Conservative attorneys general need not limit their investigation of securities violations to misinformation about environmental issues. Consider the corporations advocating for immigration reform while arguing that it won't cost the jobs of American citizens. Let's hope those companies are explicitly warning their investors that business plans predicated on hiring immigrants will be endangered if evidence emerges that immigration reform hurts American workers.Finally, many companies are planning to hire increasing numbers of female science graduates based on the popular theory that, as discrimination abates, half of all science degrees will be earned by women.  What if corporate executives suspect there are real differences in the scientific ability or interests of men and women but hide their doubts from investors? Should these gender-difference deniers go to jail?If Schneiderman and his green comrades succeed, their model for silencing critics will surely be replicated by attorneys general and trial lawyers on the left and right. Progressives who don't want to go down that road should reconsider a tried-and-true approach too often eschewed by today's climate activists and student protestors. They should engage rather than silencing those with whom they disagree, trusting that if their progressive ideas are superior, those ideas will need no investigations, lawsuits or witch hunts to prevail.",1
"On 'Hannity,' presidential candidate questions why the president is 'so unhappy' with the countryPresident Obama’s national security priorities are dangerous. Two weeks after terrorist attacks rocked Paris, he is visiting France, not to focus on fighting global terrorism, but to tackle the global warming ""security imperative."" America needs a commander-in-chief, not a weather-obsessed meteorologist-in-chief.The federal government cannot control the weather. Period. We can control borders, military assets, critical airspace, and American intelligence. We can also kill Islamic terrorists and radical ISIS murderers.  America needs a president focused on what we can control, not fixated on weather patterns which we cannot.Even if we could control the weather, 95 percent of the world lives outside America, and we cannot control the behavior of seven billion people across the globe. Put another way, other countries refuse to tackle simple, dangerous threats like nuclear weapons proliferation. So how does Obama expect to persuade massive polluters like China, Russia and Pakistan to embrace expensive, job-killing global warming regulations?Obama's obsession with global, utopian collaboration and building a personal climate change legacy has made him allergic to common sense. Meanwhile, the real ""security imperative” keeps metastasizing.Now more than ever, America needs a commander-in-chief focused on the global war on terrorism, instead we have a community organizer focused on global warming.ISIS keeps swelling in size and power and Obama still has no strategy. In the Syrian city of Raqqa, which serves as the ISIS capital, Islamic radicals have established a treasury department with an elaborate system of taxes, public services and real estate rental agreements. Between oil production, smuggling, antiquity dealing and kidnapping, ISIS is building a comprehensive infrastructure. What will it take for Obama to wake-up to this menace? Maybe he would take ISIS seriously if he discovered they didn’t recycle.Homegrown terrorists and radicalized immigrants continue to pop-up across Europe. The Department of Homeland Security refuses to reform a dangerous travel program that allows unscreened foreign passengers from 38 countries, including France and Belgium, to enter the U.S. without a visa.Illegal immigrants continue to cross our porous borders and thousands of immigrants overstay their visas each year. America’s cyber-defenses remain incredibly vulnerable and the White House has endless excuses for security breaches, intelligence failures and routine Washington incompetence.Now more than ever, America needs a commander-in-chief focused on the global war on terrorism, instead we have a community organizer focused on global warming. Obama's blindness is beyond baffling, it’s dangerous. It shouldn’t take another Paris attack for this White House to open its eyes: radical Islamic terrorism is a much greater threat than a sunburn.",1

          Aug. 3, 2011: Solar panels are seen in this file photo.
          (AP/The Sentinel, Apolinar Fonseca, File)A Colorado-based solar company that got hundreds of millions of dollars in federal loan guarantees before going belly-up didn't just empty taxpayers' wallets - it left behind a toxic mess of carcinogens, broken glass and contaminated water, according to a new report.The Abound Solar plant, which got $400 million in federal loan guarantees in 2010, when the Obama administration sought to use stimulus funds to promote green energy, filed for bankruptcy two years later. Now its Longmont, Colo., facility sits unoccupied, its 37,000 square feet littered with hazardous waste, broken glass and contaminated water. The Northern Colorado Business Report estimates it will cost up to $3.7 million to clean and repair the building so it can again be leased.“As lawyers, regulators, bankruptcy officials and the landlord spar over the case, the building lies in disrepair, too contaminated to lease,” the report stated.[pullquote]The owner of the property tried to force a bankruptcy trustee to clean the facility, but the report said it would ""place humans at imminent and significant health risk."" One of the hazards is the presence of cadmium, a cancer-causing agent that is used to produce the film on the solar panels, the report said.While the loan guarantees exposed taxpayers to hundreds of millions of dollars, the federal government lost a total of $70 million backing the failed company. Unsold inventory which should have been used to offset those losses, including 2,000 solar panels, mysteriously disappeared, according to the National Legal and Policy Center.""If a coal, oil or gas company pulled something like that the EPA would send out SWAT teams and the U.S. Marshals to track down the offenders, bankrupt or not,"" the center said in a report of its own.President Obama touted Abound in a July 3, 2010 announcement of a $2 billion “investment” in green energy projects.""The second company is Abound Solar Manufacturing, which will manufacture advanced solar panels at two new plants, creating more than 2,000 construction jobs and 1,500 permanent jobs,"" Obama said. ""A Colorado plant is already underway, and an Indiana plant will be built in what’s now an empty Chrysler factory. When fully operational, these plants will produce millions of state-of-the-art solar panels each year.""But less than two years later, the company laid off half of its 400 workers, and then, in the summer of 2012, filed for bankruptcy. It became the third clean-energy company to seek bankruptcy protection after receiving a loan from the Energy Department under the economic stimulus law. California solar panel maker Solyndra and Beacon Power, a Massachusetts energy-storage firm, also declared bankruptcy. Solyndra received a $528 million federal loan, while Beacon Power got a $43 million loan guarantee.While solar energy is touted as clean, The Associated Press reported that many panel makers are grappling with a hazardous waste problem. Fueled partly by billions in government incentives, the industry is creating millions of solar panels each year and, in the process, millions of pounds of toxic sludge and contaminated water.To dispose of the material, the companies must transport it by truck or rail far from their own plants to waste facilities hundreds and, in some cases, thousands of miles away.The fossil fuels used to transport that waste, experts say, is not typically considered in calculating solar's carbon footprint, giving scientists and consumers who use the measurement to gauge a product's impact on global warming the impression that solar is cleaner than it is.After installing a solar panel, ""it would take one to three months of generating electricity to pay off the energy invested in driving those hazardous waste emissions out of state,"" said Dustin Mulvaney, a San Jose State University environmental studies professor who conducts carbon footprint analyses of solar, biofuel and natural gas production.The waste from manufacturing has raised concerns within the industry, which fears that the problem, if left unchecked, could undermine solar's green image at a time when companies are facing stiff competition from each other and from low-cost panel manufacturers from China and elsewhere.The Associated Press contributed to this report ",1
" (AP GraphicsBank)A Cessna plane, making continuous observations of carbon dioxide, flying over an Atmospheric Radiation Measurement tower used by the Energy Department near the town of Lamont, Oklahoma. (AP Photo/Roy Kaltschmidt, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory)WASHINGTON – The United States is spewing 50 percent more methane — a potent heat-trapping gas — than the federal government estimates, a new comprehensive scientific study says. Much of it is coming from just three states: Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas.That means methane may be a bigger global warming issue than thought, scientists say. Methane is 21 times more potent at trapping heat than carbon dioxide, the most abundant global warming gas, although it doesn't stay in the air as long.Much of that extra methane, also called natural gas, seems to be coming from livestock, including manure, belches, and flatulence, as well as leaks from refining and drilling for oil and gas, the study says. It was published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science.The study estimates that in 2008, the U.S. poured 49 million tons of methane into the air. That means U.S. methane emissions trapped about as much heat as all the carbon dioxide pollution coming from cars, trucks, and planes in the country in six months.[pullquote]That's more than the 32 million tons estimated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Administration or the nearly 29 million tons reckoned by the European Commission.""Something is very much off in the inventories,"" said study co-author Anna Michalak, an Earth scientist at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Stanford, Calif. ""The total U.S. impact on the world's energy budget is different than we thought, and it's worse.""EPA spokeswoman Alisha Johnson said her agency hasn't had time to go through the study yet, but hopes it will help ""refine our estimates going forward.""While the world has a good handle on how much carbon dioxide is pumped into the air, scientists have been more baffled by methane emissions. They have had to use computer models to estimate how much methane is going into that air.This study, however, was based on nearly 13,000 measurements from airplane flights and tall towers, the most used in any such research.The information was collected in 2008, right at the beginning of the natural gas boom from hydraulic fracturing. So these measurements, which will be repeated for 2012, don't include much impact from fracking, Michalak said. Studies recently have shown conflicting results about how much methane escapes during fracking and other forms of fossil fuel drilling.Outside experts praised the study. Robert Howarth at Cornell University called ""it very compelling and quite important. This is the most comprehensive study yet.""Michalak said because of the way they measured methane — just looking for it in the air as opposed to tracking it from a source — it is hard to say what is putting more methane into the air. But she said by looking at concentrations — especially within Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas — the scientists have a good idea: Cows, oil and gas.Nearly one-quarter of the U.S. methane emissions came from those three states. Texas is by far and away the No. 1 state for refineries that turn oil into gasoline. Texas and Oklahoma have been big oil and gas drilling states and Kansas is a big cow state.Cows seem to be spewing twice the methane that scientists previously thought, Michalak said.While burps and flatulence are part of the methane emission from cattle, University of California Santa Barbara professor Ira Leifer said a bigger factor is manure.""If you shovel it into an artificial lagoon you are creating the perfect production for methane, but it cuts down on the smell and your neighbors complain less,"" he said.___Online:Journal: http://www.pnas.org___Seth Borenstein can be followed at http://twitter.com/borenbears",1

          FILE -- Nov. 19, 2014: EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy speaks in Washington. (AP)
          When Obama was speaking to environmentalist supporters in 2008 regarding his plans to address “climate change,” he candidly revealed, “Under my plan, electricity costs will necessarily skyrocket.”  Obama’s White House Science Advisor John Holdren later elaborated, “We need to de-develop the United States to bring our economic system into line with the realities of ecology and the global resource situation.”The so-called Clean Power Plan proposed by Obama’s EPA is well-designed to do precisely that -- de-develop the United States.  The skyrocketing costs for energy and electricity will have a “disparate impact” on the poor and low income blacks and Hispanics, as those increased costs will constitute a higher percentage of their lower incomes. Which means that it will hurt most those who can least afford it. A new study from the National Black Chamber of Commerce estimates the regulation will cause job losses reaching 7 million for blacks and 12 million for Hispanics, with the poverty rate increasing by more than 23 percent for blacks and 26 percent for Hispanics.That is because the plan will ultimately more than double the cost of natural gas and electricity, adding over $1 trillion to family and business energy bills, just as Obama promised. That will drain funds that could be used for new jobs and pay increases, and end up destroying millions of jobs in companies and businesses that can no longer compete under the higher costs. The rules and their costs will reduce U.S. economic growth every year, causing $2.3 trillion in losses over the next two decades alone.The skyrocketing costs for energy and electricity will have a “disparate impact” on the poor and low income Blacks and Hispanics, as those increased costs will constitute a higher percentage of their lower incomes. Which means that it will hurt most those who can least afford it. Blacks and Hispanics would consequently be threatened with a new energy poverty. Under the civil rights theories of Obama’s own Justice Department, this means his EPA Clean Power Plan constitutes illegal discrimination.African-American author and Fox News analyst Deneen Borelli comments that the EPA’s new overregulation is “the green movement’s new Jim Crow.”  National Black Chamber of Commerce President Harry Alford calls the EPA’s regulatory overkill “a slap in the face to poor and minority families.” Senator Joe Manchin (D-W.V.) sums it all up by saying, “A lot of people on the lower end of the socioeconomic spectrum are going to die.”But Obama’s regulatory overkill is quietly supported by billionaires, such as California Democrat Tom Steyer, who are heavily invested in the high cost, government subsidized, “alternative” energy.  Steyer funding to the fiancé of former Oregon Democratic Governor John Kitzhaber, guided by the governor’s staffers, forced the wild-eyed, pro-Obama regulation governor to resign earlier this year. Nearly half of the Board of Directors of the Sierra Club are owners, founders and CEOs of “renewable energy” companies that personally profit from this now environmentalist extremist organization’s anti-coal, “climate change” campaign. President Obama and his “progressives” pretend to be addressing “inequality,” by following Robin Hood in robbing from the top 1 percent and giving to the poor. But under the banner of the president’s “Climate Change” policies, the truth is that they are doing just the opposite. That just reflects the shocking truth that inequality has actually increased rather than declined for the entire time President Obama has been in office. As the Ancient Wisdom says, watch what they do, not what they say, and follow the money.",1

          Ninety-seven percent of scientists agree: Climate change is real, man-made and dangerous. President Obama tweeted that, and it has been repeated by countless others. It is tempting for a politician to claim that 97 percent of experts agree with you. But do they?The 97 percent claim was taken from a study paper by Australian John Cook, Climate Communications Fellow for the Global change Institute at the University of Queensland, and his colleagues, published in the journal Environmental Research Letters in May, 2013. The paper says nothing about the would-be dangers of climate change and it counts the number of publications, rather than the number of scientists, in support of human-made climate change. Never let facts get in the way of a good story.The paper is a treasure trove of how-not-to lessons for a graduate class on survey design and analysis: the sample was not representative, statistical tests were ignored, and the results were misinterpreted.What was an incompetent piece of research has become a highly influential study, its many errors covered up.Some of the mistakes in the study should be obvious to all. There are hundreds of papers on the causes of climate change, and thousands of papers on the impacts of climate change and climate policy. Cook focused on the latter. A paper on the impact of a carbon tax on emissions was taken as evidence that the world is warming. A paper on the impact of climate change on the Red Panda was taken as evidence that humans caused this warming. And even a paper on the television coverage of climate change was seen by Cook as proof that carbon dioxide is to blame.Cook and Co. analysed somewhere between 11,944 and 12,876 papers – they can’t get their story straight on the sample size – but only 64 of these explicitly state that humans are the primary cause of recent global warming. A reexamination of their data brought that number down to 41. That is half a per cent or less of the total, rather than 97 percent.The remainder of Cook’s “evidence” is papers that said that humans caused some climate change and, more importantly, papers that Cook’s colleagues thought said as much.There is vigorous debate about how much humans have contributed to climate change, but no one argues the effect is zero. By emitting greenhouse gases, changing the landscape, rerouting rivers, and huddling together in cities, we change the climate – perhaps by a little, perhaps by a lot – but not one expert doubts we do. However, a true consensus – 100 per cent agreement – does not serve to demonize those experts who raise credible concerns with the state of climate research.The trouble does not end there. Cook has been reluctant to share his data for others to scrutinize. He has claimed that some data are protected by confidentiality agreements, even when they are not. He was claimed that some data were not collected, even when they were. The paper claims that each abstract was read by two independent readers, but they freely compared notes. Cook and Co. collected data, inspected the results, collected more data, inspected the results again, changed their data classification, collected yet more data, inspected the results once more, and changed their data classification again, before they found their magic 97 percent. People who express concern about the method have been smeared.We would hope that the president of the United States of America does not spend time checking such trivia. That is the job of the editor of the journal, Dan Kammen of the University of California at Berkeley, who unfortunately has chosen to ignore all issues I and others raised about them. Similarly, the journal’s publisher, the Institute of Physics, and Cook’s employer, the University of Queensland, have turned a deaf ear to my concerns. What was an incompetent piece of research has become a highly influential study, its many errors covered up.And for what? If Cook’s results are to be believed, 97 percent of experts agree that climate change is real and largely human-made. This does not tell us anything about the risks of climate change, let alone how these compare to the risks of climate policy.That is a difficult trade-off, and it should be informed by the best possible science rather than dodgy work like Cook’s.",1

          (AP)Tuesday the U.S. Government’s Global Change Research Program released its latest “National Assessment” report on climate change impacts in the United States.As with previous editions, the new report is an alarmist document designed to scare people and build political support for unpopular policies such as carbon taxes, cap-and-trade, and EPA regulatory mandates.Also in keeping with past practice, the latest report confuses climate risk with climate change risk.Droughts, storms, floods, and heat waves are all part of the natural climate. Our risk of exposure to such extremes has much more to do with where we happen to live than with any gradual climate changes associated with the 1.3F – 1.9F increase in average U.S. temperature since the 1880s.[pullquote]Since even immediate and total shutdown of all carbon dioxide-emitting vehicles, power plants, and factories in the U.S. would decrease global warming by only a hypothetical and undetectable two-tenths of a degree Celsius by 2100, it is misleading to imply, as the report does, that the Obama administration’s climate policies can provide any measurable protection from extreme weather events.The Assessment is flat out wrong that climate change is increasing our vulnerability to heat stress. As hot weather has become more frequent, people and communities have adapted to it, and heat-related mortality in the U.S. has declined.Cities with the most frequent hot weather such as Tampa, Florida and Phoenix, Arizona have practically zero heat-related mortality. That is the most probable future for most U.S. cities if global warming continues!The report also foolishly predicts that climate change “intensify air pollution.” As EPA’s own data show, despite allegedly “unprecedented” warming, U.S. air quality has improved decade-by-decade since 1970 as emissions declined.The report blames climate change for the Midwest drought of 2012. But the government’s own analysis concluded otherwise: “Neither ocean states nor human-induced climate change, factors that can provide long-lead predictability, appeared to play significant roles in causing severe rainfall deficits over the major corn producing regions of central Great Plains.”The Assessment ignores substantial data and research finding no long-term increase in the strength and frequency of tropical cyclones and no trend in extreme weather-related damages once losses are ‘normalized’ (adjusted for changes in population, wealth, and consumer price index).For example, the report says trends in the frequency and intensity of tornados are “uncertain” whereas, in fact, there is no trend, and a new study by University of Colorado Professor Roger Pielke, Jr. finds “with some certainty” that “the number of years with very large tornado losses has actually decreased” during 1993-2013 compared to 1950-1970.Similarly, the U.S. is currently in the longest period on record with no major (category 3-5) hurricane landfalls.This good news is not included in the report.The Assessment gives short shrift to the warming “pause,” which it calls “short-term.” In the Assessment, the “pause” is depicted as running from 1998 through 2012 – 15 years. In fact, the pause is now 17 years and 8 months long.More tellingly, the Assessment does not discuss the growing divergence between climate model predictions and observations.The divergence, now in its 34th year and accelerating due to the pause, raises questions about the climate sensitivity assumptions on which dire climate change scenarios depend. Climate sensitivity is an estimate of how much warming will eventually result from a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations relative to pre-industrial levels.In its discussion of sensitivity, the Assessment basically endorses the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s 2007 “likely” sensitivity range of 3.6°F to 8.1°F and “best estimate” of 5.4°F. It neglects to mention that, partly due to the pause and model overshoot of observed temperatures, the IPCC’s 2013 report lowered the bottom end of the likely range and declined to offer a “best” estimate.More importantly, the Assessment presents the debate over climate sensitivity as a “he said, she said,” as if a single paper by John Fasullo and Kevin Trenberth balances out some 16 recent papers indicating that the IPCC climate sensitivity estimates are too hot.So despite an occasional fig leaf to hide the nakedness of its alarm message – the report does acknowledge that climate change has lengthened growing seasons, helping to make food more abundant and affordable – the Assessment is unrelenting gloom and doom.Its only hopeful message is that it’s not too late to implement Kyoto-style climate policies!Sorry, that’s not good enough even for government work.",1
"Three of the four installments of the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which claims to show the state of the global climate system under stress, are now available.All three show things are seriously amiss – although not necessarily with the climate itself. The final installment, to be published in September will further underline the need to reform the IPCC.The IPCC has three working groups, each producing its own report. Working Group I, focusing on climate change itself, released its findings last September. Compared to the previous report, of 2007, it quietly revised downwards its estimate of eventual global warming.[pullquote]The IPCC became less pessimistic about climate change, although its press release would not tell you so.The report also illustrates just how outmoded the IPCC has become since it was founded in 1988. Its reports are written over a period of three years, and finished months before publication.When preparations started on AR5, the world hadn’t warmed for 13 years. That is a bit odd, if you believe the models, but not odd enough to merit a lot of attention.By the time the report was finished, however, it hadn’t warmed for 17 years. That is decidedly odd, but hard to accommodate in a near-final draft that has been through three rounds of review.After the report was finalized, but before it was published, a number of papers appeared with hypotheses about the pause in warming. AR5 was out of date before it was released.The IPCC model – every six years a big splash of climate analysis – is broken.Working Group 2, published in March, and focusing on the impacts of climate change, had a different problem. It lies at the heart of the previous IPCC controversy. The scientific literature now acknowledges that many of the more worrying impacts of climate change are in fact symptoms of social mismanagement and underdevelopment.The first rule of climate policy should be: do no harm to economic growth. But the IPCC was asked to focus on the risks of climate change alone, and those who volunteered to be its authors eagerly obliged. There is even a groundbreaking section on emerging risks.The first paper on an issue is always dramatic. That is the only way to get something onto the scientific agenda. Follow-up papers then pooh-pooh the initial drama. But the IPCC chose not to wait for those follow-up papers.IPCC reports are often two to three thousand pages long, but there are two or three main findings only.Authors who want to see their long hours of IPCC work recognized should thus present their impact as worse than the next one.It was this inbuilt alarmism that made me step down from the team that drafted the Summary for Policy Makers of Working Group 2. And indeed, the report was greeted by the four horsemen of the apocalypse: famine, pestilence, war, death all made headlines.April’s Working Group 3 had yet another problem. Its focus, climate policy, is a hot political debate in many countries.The Summary for Policy Makers is drafted by academics, but approved line-by-line by government representatives. Every clause that could possibly be used against a government position, either in a domestic debate or in international negotiations, was neutered or removed.But the authors are at fault, too. A little bit of emission reduction costs little. But as targets get more stringent, costs escalate. Not so according to the IPCC: Very ambitious targets are said to be only slightly more expensive than less ambitious targets.This surprising finding is a statistical fluke. Emission reduction is easy according to some studies, which duly explore very ambitious targets.Emission reduction is hard according to other studies; very ambitious targets are prohibitively expensive and results not reported.The surprisingly low cost of meeting very stringent emission reduction targets is the result of selection bias.Oddly, the IPCC made the same mistake in the previous report.The final part of the AR5 report, the Synthesis, will be published in September. It will fail to offer policy makers what they need to know: a systematic comparison of the costs of climate policy to its benefits, the avoided impacts of climate change.Compared to the most famous cost-benefit analysis of them all, the Stern Review, published in 2006, the IPCC finds that the impacts of climate change are lower and the impacts of climate policy higher. But the IPCC will not suggest that the emission reduction targets recommended by Stern – global emissions 25 percent below 2005 levels by 2050; stabilize warming at 2-3˚C – are, perhaps, too stringent.Given its flaws, should the IPCC be disbanded? That would be pointless. Climate change is a problem of the future. Climate policy responds to forecasts of the future rather than measurements of the past.There are large climate bureaucracies around the world, who exist by virtue of climate science. If you abolish the IPCC, the climatocracy will create a new IPCC. The IPCC should therefore be reformed.Here are some suggestions:Away with the infrequent, massive set pieces. Away with alarmism – that has been tried for 25 years, with no discernible impact on emissions. Away with activists posing as scientists. Away with the freshman mistakes.Just good, sober, solid science. Let the chips fall where they may.",1

          FILE -- Sept. 27, 2013: A photograph provided by the University of Maryland shows a red-backed salamander, one of the native Appalachian mountain range salamander species that has gotten significantly smaller. Scientists say salamanders in the mountain range are getting smaller in response to climate change.
          (AP Photo/University of Maryland, Nicholas M. Caruso)I got my first lesson on the subject of climate change more than 10 years ago. My tutor was an internationally famous climate scientist at a major Ivy League university. Unlike most lectures I have heard from professors, this one was brief, to the point and extremely enlightening.At the time I was a columnist for the New York Daily News, recently arrived in the United States after more than 30 years in Israel. I had heard about global warming, of course, but I hadn’t thought much about it. Israel has other, more pressing issues.[pullquote]In May 2001, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published its third report, which got a lot of media attention. I looked through it and realized immediately that I had no chance of understanding the science.I was in good company – I doubt there are half a dozen journalists in captivity who can actually understand the mathematical and chemical formulas and computer projections. That’s what press releases are for.One item got my attention. It said: “Projections based on the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios suggest warming over the 21st Century at a more rapid rate than that experienced for at least the last 10,000 years.”I called the professor, one of the authors of the report, for a clarification (he remains nameless because we were off the record). “If global warming is caused by man-made emissions,” I asked, “what accounts for the world warming to this same level 10,000 years ago?”There was a long silence. Then the professor said, “Are you serious?”I admitted that I was.The professor loudly informed me that my question was stupid. The panel’s conclusion was indisputable science, arrived at after years of research by a conclave of the world’s leading climate scholars. Who was I to dispute it?I told him I wasn’t disputing it, just trying to understand how, you know, the world could have been this hot before without the help of human agency. Maybe this is just a natural climate change like ice ages that once connected continents and warming periods that caused them to drift apart or …At which point I heard a click. The professor hung up on me. At that exact moment I became a climate skeptic. I may not know anything about science, but I have learned over a long career that when an expert hangs up in the middle of a question, it means that he doesn’t know the answer.This isn’t shocking. Experts, even on subjects less complicated than what the world’s temperature will be in 200 years, are often wrong. One tip-off is when they argue by assuring you that everybody smart already knows they are right.I was reminded of this encounter the other day while reading a Time Magazine cover story titled, “Eat Butter: Scientists labeled fat the enemy. Why they were wrong.” The article chronicled the decades-long consensus, backed by official U.S. government policy as well as a militant (and self-interested) scientific establishment, that fat was a killer. According to Time, this was “so embedded in modern medicine and nutrition that it became nearly impossible to challenge the consensus.” Scientific journals refused to publish data challenging this orthodoxy. People who did, like Dr. Robert Atkins, were derided as quacks.Now that consensus has flipped (Time Magazine doesn’t publish articles outside any current consensus). It may flip again someday as we learn even more about nutrition and health. But for now, the danger of eating fat – once an unshakable tenet of settled science – is out of intellectual fashion. People who have virtuously deprived themselves of t-bones, ice cream and cheesecake are now left with egg on their faces. It is a reminder that bad science, backed by a politicized posse of experts, can have distasteful consequences.Another recent article, this one in the New York Times, also caught my eye. It reported that a submerged forest in Wales has suddenly re-emerged, revealing traces that humans had lived there before the sea rose after the last ice age. “About 10,000 years ago, temperatures warmed sharply, by eight to ten degrees Fahrenheit,” said Dr. Martin Bates, a geoarcheologist called in to examine the situation. The footprints found in the sediment belonged to “refugees of prehistoric climate change,” he said (happily, Wales has since been repopulated).Dr. Nicholas Ashton of the British Museum, a participant in the project, was philosophical. “We can reconstruct the climate and climate change nearly one million years ago,” he said. “The big lesson is, we have to adapt. Whether we like it or not the climate will change – it always has.” He quickly added that human beings were now “accelerating that change.” The Times reporter didn’t ask him how much the change was accelerating, or what, besides people, might be causing an eons-old phenomenon. Perhaps she didn’t wonder. Or maybe she didn’t feel like getting hung up on by an expert.",1

          Caribou grazing in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska.
          (AP)The Obama administration’s National Climate Assessment, released with much fanfare in May, warns that we are beginning to experience drastic effects from human-induced global warming. The report depends heavily on “consensus reporting,” the agreement of a large number of scientists that the statements are true or that new information “increases confidence” of the large group of authors.But as someone who has studied climate and its effect on biology for 45 years, I know this way of expressing science is, in fact, deeply unscientific. Consensus reporting is in reality a way of avoiding or obscuring the facts, most especially in science, where the disproval of previously held truths is the central aim. A close examination of the assessment shows that many of the dire forecasted effects that consensus aims to buttress are highly selective, mostly unproven or simply made up.[pullquote]Few things in the climate assessment are more emotionally explosive than its conclusions about various species around the globe—in a word, about life itself. As with many technical reports, the sources of many of the statements that lead us to believe life is profoundly threatened by climate change are buried in the footnotes. But the footnotes often differ greatly from the conclusions published in the main body of the report. Here are some examples, taken from a summary section of the report on “Biological Responses to Climate Change” on pages 203-205 of the climate assessment report:1. The claim: Population fragmentation of wolverines in the northern Cascades and Rocky Mountains is expected to increase as spring snow cover retreats over the coming century.   The idea is that less snow cover means smaller and more fragmented areas where the wolverine lives in winter.  But the paper cited as the source for this (citation 123, page 214) states to the contrary that: “Large (greater than 1000 sq. km.) contiguous areas of wolverine habitat are predicted to persist within the study area throughout the 21st century for all projections.”  And the analysis is based on forecasts of snow cover from climate models, which are acknowledged even by their authors to be weakest in forecasting precipitation.2. The claim: As temperatures got warmer over a 40-year period, songbirds at a bird-banding station in western Pennsylvania were being recorded as measurably smaller in relation to the “mean regional temperatures from the previous year.” But in the study used to produce that statement (citation 85, page 212), the authors do not mention body size change at all, and just make a general statement that there is  “a complex and dynamic annual cycle in songbirds, with responses to climate change differing among species and migration seasons.”3. The claim:  Warmer and drier conditions during the early growing season in high-elevation habitats in Colorado are “disrupting”—a loaded term-- the timing of various flowering patterns, while birds, bees, and other pollinators were not tracking that timing; as a result there are “potential impacts” for flower propagation.   On the contrary, the authors of the underlying study (citation 77, page 211) conclude that such timing changes are “unlikely to threaten population persistence for most species in our study area.” 4. The claim:  Warmer springs in Alaska have caused earlier onset of plant emergence, and decreased the variation in growth and availability of forage to breeding caribou. This ultimately reduced calving success in caribou populations.  The implication is that warming will necessarily have a negative effect on caribou. However, the  paper cited (citation 138, page 215) is much more cautious, stating that such an adverse effect is conceivable but a lot more study is needed. Wildlife populations can and do adjust to changes, but this can take some time.5. The claim:  Variation in the timing and magnitude of precipitation due to climate change was found to decrease the nutritional quality of grasses, and consequently reduce weight gain of bison in the Konza Prairie in Kansas and the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in Oklahoma. In fact, the publication underpinning the statement (citation 124, page 214) says that ""Greater late-summer precipitation increased bison weight gain . . . greater midsummer precipitation decreased weight gain.""  This is neither negative nor positive in terms of global warming, because the climate models are weakest in forecasting rainfall even annually, let alone seasonally.There is no doubt that humanity has put many environments and species on our planet under stress, but global warming is far from the foremost of those pressures. What the assessment ignores, in its bid to bring all of these challenges under one big climate tent, is the real history of life itself:  endlessly changing, highly adaptable, and never subject to the kind of stasis that the climate change consensus imagines, wrongly, to be Nature’s ideal state.",1

          FILE -- July 24, 2013: President Obama speaks about the economy during a visit to Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois.
          (Reuters)Have you ever rushed to avoid missing an offer that will expire in 30 minutes and then regretted it? President Obama’s claim that we must act immediately to prevent climate change deserves the same careful scrutiny that we should give to our personal purchases.Since July 28, the U.S. Senate has held two hearings, and the White House has released a new report and a video spot. The central message is that delay in addressing climate change is dangerous.As they say, caveat emptor—buyer beware.The campaign’s centerpiece is a report from President Obama’s Council of Economic Advisors (CEA) warning that failure to act now would cost upwards of $150 billion annually, just for starters.[pullquote]That is not a very helpful warning, since it tells us nothing about how much damage the White House’s policies would avoid, nor does it tell us what those policies would cost.Contrary to the president’s claims, there is no scientific consensus that climate change has driven recent weather events or that climate change is now causing harm. The United Nation’s own scientific body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), has “low confidence” in any such connection in its latest climate report (see pages 10-11).Indeed, it attributes increasing damage from weather events to society’s greater wealth, which means that more valuable property is exposed to intense storms or fires.The president has laid out his policies in a Climate Action Plan (CEA), released in June 2013, and they are being implemented through Executive Branch regulations and mandates. Contrary to the president’s rush-rush message, there is every reason to slow the program down.For one thing, the CEA imagines a world in which every country adopts an ideal set of policies that reduce their greenhouse gas emissions at the lowest cost possible. Its report cites a large number of studies done by climate modelers along these lines.The catch is that the people who do that computer modelling have been moving toward realization of how unrealistic and unhelpful those studies are.I know because I was an expert reviewer for the latest of the IPCC’s climate status reports. I’ve also published peer-reviewed articles describing the utter lack of political realism in assuming that countries that have refused to cooperate on climate change for over 20 years will suddenly begin to do so.  In fact, modelers are increasingly realizing that the measures being considered in the U.S. and around the world to slow climate change are likely to cost a great deal more and do a great deal less than advertised.As David Montgomery, a leading modeler, discussed at one of the Senate climate hearings, recent studies show that the piecemeal regulatory policies proposed by the White House would cost four times as much as the idealized approach assumed in the CEA report.By 2020, that would put the annual cost of the regulatory policies in the President’s plan to an average U.S. household over $1,000, make electricity prices at least 7% higher, raise gasoline prices by 25 cents per gallon, and lower federal government tax revenues $150 billion in 2020.All this would reduce global warming in the next 40 years by less than one-tenth of a degree Celsius.The benefit to the U.S. from that negligible change would also be much smaller than claimed by the White House. That is because the White House grossly exaggerates potential damage by assuming that the U.S. will suffer a share of global harm from climate change equal to its share of global GDP.Nothing in the analysis of climate effects supports this assumption.In fact, there is a broad consensus among climate models that most of the harm from climate change will occur in tropical regions, in countries that are too poor to protect themselves, and in particular in countries whose failed governments and institutions make climate adaptation impossible.Thus benefits to poor countries are the basis for calculations of benefits that the White House cites to justify U.S. action. The emission reductions in the Climate Action Plan, purchased at a cost of $1,000 per U.S. household, would make no discernible difference to the lives of the world's poor or to damages to the U.S.If we really want to help globally, we could do far more at much lower cost by supporting locally-designed adaptation measures in Africa and poor Asian countries where the real vulnerability exists.  In the meantime, remember what happened the last time you bought something before that great offer expired.",1
"Tucker Carlson breaks down president's plan to bypass CongressPresident Obama will speak Tuesday, as world leaders assemble at the United Nations in New York for “Climate Summit 2014,” “to galvanize and catalyze climate action.” Environmentalists have taken note, organizing “the largest climate march in history,” to pressure governments to regulate “a world safe from the ravages of climate change.”The message is clear: Pernicious global warming is upon us, and the government must act.Bolstering this barrage of alarmism is last week’s finding from the federal government’s National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) that the global average surface temperature for August 2014 was the highest ever recorded for the month.But the anomalous warmth in August still fell short of the all-time record for all months. That record was set nearly 200 months ago in February 1998. And that’s the real news. In this era of human-caused global warming, what is taking so long to set a new global temperature record?[pullquote]During the 1980s and 1990s, new all-time record-high anomalies were occurring about every 3-4 years. But then, we hit the “hiatus.” The rise in the Earth’s average surface temperature basically stopped, “global warming” morphed into “climate change,” and it has been 16.5 years since the last all-time all-month record monthly temperature anomaly was set.Just-published research from University of Guelph’s Ross McKitrick pegs the length of the hiatus, or “pause”—the period of no statistically significant rise in the earth’s average temperature—at about 19 years. Looking back even further, the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) shows that since the mid-20th century, observed global warming has been less than expected.In short, all those computerized climate models that predicted large, accelerating, and generally uninterrupted warming were wrong. And it has the believers in those models scratching their heads.Global warming is not proceeding as planned.  The climate appears less sensitive to our emissions of greenhouse gases than expected. The urgency to grant the government the authority to limit energy choice is not justified.That’s the real news.Nevertheless, the scaremongers doggedly claim the world is still on course for a climate catastrophe of our own making. They point to the record high temperatures in August as proof that global warming remains a viable beast that will eventually strike us. Natural variability, they say, has just been holding the savage back. And its grip is slipping.Climate models, apologists say, can’t possibly be expected to get the precise timing of all natural hiccups correct. Therefore, we shouldn’t get distracted by poor model performance over the short term (a decade or two) but rather rest assured that what the models predict over the long-term will be correct.For this argument to work, natural variability, and not inadequacies in the climate models themselves, must be shown to be completely responsible for the two-decade hiatus. Otherwise, the jig is up and it will be plainly obvious that climate models are unreliable. And in that case, the foundations for climate alarm, for a carbon tax, and for the president’s Climate Action Plan crumble.About five or six years ago, climate modelers and their supporters found it easier to claim the hiatus didn’t exist than to try to explain it. As more and more time passed and earth’s surface temperature failed to rise, the hiatus grew too noticeable to be swept under the rug. A chorus was rising that the length of the hiatus exceeded that foretold by climate models.To combat this growing din of model criticism, a fabulous storyline has been cobbled together from bits and pieces of the dozens of speculative explanations that have been forwarded as a cause for the pause. Climate catastrophists have gone from hiatus deniers to hiatus embracers, even going as far as to perversely claim that the hiatus actually strengthens the case for dangerous global warming.It doesn’t.At the very least, the lack of global temperature rise during the past two decades shows that climate models do not have a good handle on natural processes and the magnitude of their impact on the climate. More probably, it indicates that climate models predict too much warming from greenhouse gas emissions.  Most likely, it is both.A couple of recent warm months do not make up for a failed legacy that extends more than a half century",1

          (AP Photo/Natacha Pisarenko)We can argue till we’re blue in the face over whether it’s due to the excesses of human behavior or just a normal tick in the natural planetary cycle, but we can’t deny the evidence that the earth is getting warmer.So let’s put aside the debate over the why and how and have a serious discussion about climate change. Because it is seriously affecting our health.The magnitude of rising global temperatures, extreme weather, ozone concentrations and declining air quality hasten our need not only to predict and warn of short-term disasters, but also to look at the long-term projections so we can modify events and behaviors that accelerate climate change.Climate change, whatever its cause, affects how we breathe, what we eat and what diseases we’re exposed to. We can’t overlook this. We need to act now.The magnitude of rising global temperatures, extreme weather, ozone concentrations and declining air quality hasten our need not only to predict and warn of short-term disasters, but also to look at the long-term projections so we can modify events and behaviors that accelerate climate change.My father, Dr. P. Krishna Rao, who worked for 45 years at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), was one of the forefathers of measuring climate change. He was one of the first to describe how satellites could be used to predict trends and changes in global weather patterns in order to alert vulnerable populations to impending disasters.That was an early example of how we could use data and technology to predict where changes will occur. But that was then. Now we need to go several steps further.The magnitude of rising global temperatures, extreme weather, ozone concentrations and declining air quality hasten our need not only to predict and warn of short-term disasters, but also to look at the long-term projections so we can modify events and behaviors that accelerate climate change.We further need to look at very specific causes and effects that can be managed, so that we’re not dealing in rhetoric or misleading the public.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists nine cause-and-effect relationships between climate change and health, including:These associations are real, and they cannot be ignored. They require immediate action on several levels:There needs to be a broader collaboration among those who understand how to predict climate change, those who understand how to reduce contributing factors to climate change, those who manage the public health implications of climate change and those who have access to relevant data and have the ability to communicate with at-risk populations.And if we hope to reduce short- and long-term disasters both in the U.S. and abroad, it has to happen now.",1

          President Barack Obama attends the dedication of the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate in Boston, Monday, March 30, 2015. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh)
          On Monday, the Obama administration formally pledged to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 28 percent compared to 2005 levels. This pledge comes despite agreements with China that will allow the country to emit more CO2 in one month than the $479 billion regulation under the Clean Power Plan will reduce in the United States within one year.The Obama administration will struggle to justify the lack of environmental progress achieved from such a deal, especially when American jobs become vulnerable to global competitors who can offer cheap and reliable energy.The 28 percent promise makes it clear that the administration is determined to use every tool it can identify, manipulate, or invent to advance its goal of overhauling our nation’s economy in the name of climate change.  This toolbox most notably includes a dangerous new use for an old instrument, the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA.Initially signed into law on Jan 1, 1970, by President Richard Nixon, NEPA requires federal agencies to consider the impacts of major federal actions on the quality of the human environment. This means that when issuing permits or other approvals, providing federal funding, or carrying out projects themselves, agencies must consider how their actions would impact the environment here in the United States and evaluate alternatives that would avoid those impacts. Unfortunately, NEPA also is a favorite of activists who try to halt projects by bringing lawsuits alleging that an agency failed to look at all possible consequences or all possible alternatives.While NEPA is a bedrock environmental statute that appropriately requires federal agencies to look at the consequences of federal actions, it is very definitely not an appropriate tool to set global climate change policy, as I noted in a letter to the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) back in October 2009.Instead of listening to concerns expressed by myself and others, the Council on Dec. 24, 2014 -- a day when few Americans were paying attention -- published a new draft guidance dictating how federal agencies are supposed to consider the alleged climate change impacts of federal actions.It will have very grave effects on the economic activities of the entire nation.Under this new guidance, projects carried out by federal agencies, projects carried out by states or the private sector that need federal permits or approvals, and projects carried out by states or the private sector that use federal funding are assumed to have a significant impact on climate change.It will have very grave effects on the economic activities of the entire nation.Climate change is global. The impact of projects on the environment is local. The new requirement to assume global climate impacts is a dramatic change in the way that the Administration intends to apply NEPA -- an interpretation that we are certain is not supported by the law but that we are equally certain will bring about more NEPA lawsuits.As chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I, along with a number of other Republican Senators -- John Boozman of Arkansas, John Barrasso of Wyoming, Deb Fischer of Nebraska, Jeff Sessions of Alabama and Dan Sullivan of Alaska – sent a letter to Christy Goldfuss, managing director of CEQ, urging her and the administration to withdraw this draft proposal.Our overarching concern is the way the draft guidance sets up federal agencies to fail.It works this way: NEPA requires analysis only of the impacts of a project on the environment that occur within the boundaries of the United States, that have a reasonably close causal relationship to a project, that are reasonably foreseeable, and over which an agency has regulatory authority or control.Rather than respecting these limits on NEPA analysis, the draft guidance would require agencies to speculate about greenhouse gas emissions from actions that take place both before and after a project is carried out, and assume that these emissions “have a huge impact” on global climate change.Under the new interpretation of NEPA government agencies would then be required to evaluate alternatives that would avoid or mitigate these alleged impacts.This will result in endless analyses of coal, oil, gas, and other leasing proposals on federal and tribal land; federal activities on the Outer Continental Shelf; timber management and grazing on federal lands; and even highway projects. It will completely paralyze agency actions.And, as a result, it will have very grave effects on the economic activities of the entire nation.The draft guidance would adversely affect all Americans by reducing our ability to grow the economy and create jobs while having no impact on the quality of the environment—and least of all on global carbon emissions, where China and other countries will make our impact immediately meaningless.If the administration refuses to withdraw this harmful guidance, I fully expect it to be struck down by courts as yet another example of regulatory overreach in the name of global climate change.But before that happens, it will provide another tool for activists to use to stop important projects, adding to the economic confusion, fear, and pain of uncertainty that such sudden, drastic and unfounded interpretations of law always bring.",1
