"Beltway Republicans, including former Treasury Secretary James Baker, lobby National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn to enact a carbon tax at the White House today. Ivanka Trump, her husband Jared Kushner, and Trump’s Chief of Staff Reince Priebus are also expected to attend.
Other Republican insiders comprise the climate change group. The list includes Hank Paulson, treasury secretary for George W. Bush, Rob Walton former Walmart chairman of the board of directors, and Ted Halstead, founder of the New America Foundation, a Soros related group.
The insiders would impose a $40 per ton tax on carbon, and potentially increase it in the future. Conservatives on Capitol Hill and Pennsylvania Avenue oppose a carbon tax. President Trump has tweeted that he will not support or endorse a carbon tax:
.@thehill  Your story about me & the carbon tax is absolutely incorrect—it is just the opposite. I will not support or endorse a carbon tax!

"TEL AVIV – President Donald Trump’s decision on Thursday to pull out of the Paris climate accord will not sway the Israeli government in a similar direction, Israel’s Environmental Protection Minister indicated, remarking that the country “is not an American colony.”
“We are not an American colony,” Minister Ze’ev Elkin (Likud) said. “The working assumption that Israel needs to change something in its conduct because the U.S. president has decided to withdraw is wrong.”
“The agreement does not affect the Israeli economy — quite the contrary,” he said. “We placed an emphasis on the decreased use of coal and this is reducing air pollution in the state.”
“Just as Trump said that he was elected to represent Detroit rather than Paris, we were elected to represent Jerusalem and not Detroit,” Elkin observed.
“We can contribute our part and act to decrease greenhouse gas emissions, but without American involvement the world will have significantly fewer tools to deal with the issue,” Elkin said.",1,1006
"The weather strikes back in the latest trailer for Warner Bros. climate change disaster epic Geostorm, released by the studio this week.
Gerard Butler plays Jake Lawson, the mastermind behind a series of inter-connected satellites in Earth’s orbit that can control the planet’s weather. When the system malfunctions over Afghanistan and turns the country into an icy wasteland, Lawson must travel to space to repair it; but he soon learns that the whole satellite system is triggering massive disastrous weather events, including destructive tornadoes and tsunamis.
The plan to save the world includes a plot to kidnap the President of the United States (Andy Garcia) and a whole lot of careful maneuvering through scenes of epic climate-related destruction.
Dean Devlin, who wrote and produced Independence Day, makes his directorial debut with Geostorm. Abbie Cornish, Ed Harris, and Jim Sturgess round out the cast.
Geostorm is in theaters October 20.

"A rally in Colorado Springs designed to warn people of the effects of climate change and global warming was postponed this weekend after a snowstorm made it too risky to proceed.
The event, organized by local environmentalist group 350 Colorado Springs, was also a protest against the Trump administration’s policies on climate change.
However, the march was postponed until Sunday after weather forecasters predicted heavy snowfall and possible blizzards.
“Sometimes Mother Nature throws you a curveball! We know we aren’t in the business of risking anyone’s safety. Dangerous conditions and wet heavy snow in the forecast for tomorrow,” the group wrote on their Facebook page.
Meanwhile, another march in Denver went ahead despite a spring snowstorm, as protesters held signs outside Denver City Hall and powered loudspeakers using stationary bikes.

"Actress Cate Blanchett is sore that fellow actors like Leonardo DiCaprio get hammered for their climate change hypocrisy.
DiCaprio, one of the most vocal stars on the climate change bandwagon, is mocked for flying private jets and leading an extravagant lifestyle, the kind that leaves a sizable carbon footprint.
Blanchett, a virtually lock to snare a Best Actress Oscar nomination for her bravura turn in Blue Jasmine, says her fellow celebrity activists make sacrifices for the greater good. For example, DiCaprio could travel more than he actually does, she argued in a first-person interview with The Guardian.
We need to keep switching up the language around climate change. For so long we’ve talked about sacrifice and people get discredited for what they haven’t given up. [Celebrities] get criticised for taking flights, but the truth is someone like Leo [DiCaprio] takes fewer flights than he’s asked to. If we want it to stay on the radar, we need to focus on the fact there’s a lot of opportunity.",1,1012
