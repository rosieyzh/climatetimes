"Scientists are gathering in Iceland Sunday to memorialize Okjökull — the country’s first glacier to be destroyed by global warming.

Okjökull, nicknamed Ok, lost its status as a glacier 2014. The monument being unveiled at the “funeral” is inscribed with an ominous warning, titled “A letter to the future.”

“Ok is the first Icelandic glacier to lose its status as a glacier,” it states in English and Icelandic. “In the next 200 years, all our glaciers are expected to follow the same path. This monument is to acknowledge that we know what is happening and know what needs to be done. Only you know if we did it.”

Only future generations will “know if we did it” — if we melted all of the glaciers, raised sea level tens of feet, destroyed all of our coastal cities, and ruined our livable climate.

But the truth is that human-caused global warming is disintegrating Arctic glaciers and the great ice sheets at such a rapid and accelerating pace that we will all know within a decade whether humanity has acted fast enough to avert catastrophe.",1,1133
"Democratic 2020 presidential candidate Bernie Sanders responded to a student who asked him a question about practicing what he preaches on fossil fuel use during a Thursday town hall in Chico, California, saying he would not stop using fossil fuels.

WATCH:

“So, I’m a senior at CSU Chico, [inaudible] major,” said the student. “So, my question is, you seem adamant about climate change.”

“Of course,” the student continued after Sanders assented. “So what ways would you take to practice what you preach if you were to become president? I know it’s stressful, and you have to travel a lot, and you have to use fossil fuels …”

“No, I’m not going to walk to California,” Sanders said to laughter from the audience. “Look, you know, I understand that. We do the best we can as an example, but I’m not going to sit here and tell you that we’re not going to use fossil fuels …”

During a Thursday speech, Sanders also said that the U.S. “must transition away from fossil fuels, period. End of discussion. There ain’t no middle ground.” (RELATED: ‘He Is The Enemy Of Every Entrepreneur’ — Home Depot Founders Blast Socialism, Issue Dire Warning For Bernie Supporters)

h/t Dr. Willie Soon – Climate crusader Greta Thunberg’s “principled” trip across the Atlantic in a carbon fibre and non recyclable plastic boat is going to require at least four crew members to fly across the Atlantic.

Greta Thunberg’s two-week trip across Atlantic in ‘zero-carbon yacht’ may generate more emissions than it saves as two of the crew have to FLY to New York to bring the boat back to Europe

Greta Thunberg’s trans-Atlantic voyage on a ‘zero-carbon yacht’ has been rocked by revelations that crew will fly to New York in a gas-guzzling plane to bring the boat back to Europe.

It is claimed that this would generate more emissions than the yacht saves and threatens to leave the 16-year-old’s plans to chart an environmentally friendly route to the United States in tatters.

On Wednesday, the Swedish eco-campaigner left Plymouth on the Malizia II for a two-week journey to the United Nations headquarters where she will address a climate change meeting.

But last night, it was confirmed that two crew will have to fly to the US east coast city to man the 60ft yacht on its return.

British Muslims are being urged to take the lead on fighting climate change as a study suggests rising temperatures will make pilgrimages to Mecca dangerous.

The Hajj, one of the five pillars of Muslim faith, takes place in and around the city situated in a desert valley in western Saudi Arabia.

All Muslims are expected to take part at least once in their lifetime, if their health and finances allow.

The timings of the annual religious event shift each year because it is based on the lunar calendar, and it involves spending around 20 to 30 hours outdoors over a period of around five or six days.

The Saudis want to increase the number of pilgrims to 10 million by 2030.

Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in California say rising global temperatures could push up heat and humidity in the region in the hottest summer months to the extent that people face “extreme danger” to their health.

The Hajj is done – but challenges lie ahead for its future A vast army of workers have begun the task of clearing the detritus left on the roads ready for next year.

Elfatih Eltahir, the civil and environmental engineer who led the research, said: “When the Hajj happens in summer, you can imagine, with climate change and increasing heat-stress levels, conditions could be unfavourable for outdoor activity.",1,1619
"Climate Hysteria May Destroy Western Airlines, Quantas Boss Warns

Qantas CEO Alan Joyce has warned that global warming panic could bring the aviation industry to a halt, saying additional airline taxes could take the world back to the 1920s.

While green activists campaign against flying in most Western nations, China is planning to build over 200 new airports by the year 2035, almost doubling its current number.

Speaking at the Centre for Aviation summit in Sydney this week, Mr Joyce hit back at climate change hysteria and ‘flight shaming’.

Mr Joyce referenced an increase in the amount of global warming rallies being held globally and a rise in activists criticising travellers who fly, The Australian reported.

‘We don’t want to go back to the 1920s and not have air ­travel. We need to make sure that we keep the baby, because it is important for the world economy to have connections,’ he said.

He pointed out that the airline industry had made a difference to the world in terms of economic trade and job creation.

‘We know there’s an environmental impact, but the things we’re doing as an industry are fantastic. We have targets by 2050 to reduce our CO2 emissions to half the levels of 2005,’ he said.

Just last month, the French government announced an ‘eco-tax’ on all flights out of airports in France, which would rack up $300 million per year.

Passengers in The Netherlands have are now being slugged a levy of $11.60, amid calls for the European Union to enforce taxes across the whole continent.

Mr Joyce said the aim of the new tariffs is to limit commercial flights by slugging customers and airlines more.",1,1659
