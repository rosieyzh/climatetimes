"The jury's still out on whether Monday's Supreme Court ruling will have any effect on the Environmental Protection Agency's proposed rule to limit carbon emissions from power plants.Both opponents and defenders of the EPA push claimed victory in the 5-4 and 7-2 decisions on a pair of EPA permitting programs for large industrial emissions sources, a reflection of the nuanced case before the high court.The Supreme Court, in a majority opinion written by Justice Antonin Scalia, ruled the EPA could not require companies wishing to expand or modify existing facilities to get a pre-construction permit under the programs in question simply because they emit greenhouse gases.The ruling also said that the EPA had improperly interpreted the Clean Air Act to mean it must regulate greenhouse gas emissions. It noted the agency cannot rewrite the Clean Air Act to work within the framework of directly regulating those emissions from major stationary sources, as it had attempted to do to avoid regulating entities such as schools and churches.Click for more from WashingtonExaminer.com ",1,1085
"Over 90 percent of funding for a diesel reduction program paid for by the stimulus law was misspent, according to a report by the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Office of Inspector General (OIG).An audit analyzing $26.3 million in funding to non-profit organizations and state governments meant to reduce truck emissions and create jobs found that the program had “significant financial management issues.”The OIG reviewed six projects under the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act (DERA) program, finding four “did not meet all the objectives of the award,” or their requirements under the Recovery Act. Five of the six projects “did not have a financial management systems that met federal requirements that applied to the grant award.”“As a result, we questioned a total of $23.8 million of the $26.3 million claimed under the assistance agreements,” the OIG said.The OIG said the entirety of a $9 million grant given to Cascade Sierra Solutions was wasted after the non-profit failed to accomplish any of the project’s goals. The grant was intended for upgrading diesel trucks made before 2007 with emission control technologies.Click for more from The Washington Free Beacon",1,1183
"Former Vice President Al Gore turned up the rhetorical heat during a conference in Atlanta on Thursday, where he warned that climate change could bring about the end of civilization.“What is going on in the public square right now is more important than any time since the Civil War,” Gore said before an audience of nearly 2,000 people. “We are facing an ecological crisis that can bring about the end of civilization.”AL GORE CALLS DONALD TRUMP THE 'FACE OF CLIMATE DENIAL,' SAYS AMERICANS ARE TIRED OF PRESIDENT'S CONSTANT CRAZINESSThe dire warning marked the start of Gore’s three-day Climate Reality Project at Atlanta’s Georgia World Congress Center. Gore shared the stage with church leaders and Saturday Night Live’s Pete Davidson who reportedly likened the “environment” to “a girl you’re in love with who just got engaged to someone else. The situation is dire but there’s still time.”Gore later lavished praise on the controversial Green New Deal, proposed by freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., which he compared to denuclearization talks of the 1980s, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.“It is similar to the nuclear freeze proposals, because it serves as a vehicle,” Gore said.",1,1210
"Speaking in New York City last week, Wall Street billionaire Tom Steyer laid clear his vision for penalizing people whose actions may contribute to climate change.“We need to reward people whose behavior reduces climate risk and penalize people who add to it,” said Steyer “If we can get this right, I think there’s no doubt that our economy is going to continue to do very well.”He was joined by several wealthy businessmen — such as Michael Bloomberg and former bankers and government officials Hank Paulson and Robert Reich— to unveil a report from Risky Business, an economic analysis of the financial impact to be caused by climate change.A Wall Street baron, Steyer’s words are not to be taken lightly. Deemed the ‘liberal answer to the Koch Brothers, he’s one of the richest businessman in the United States and played a key part in raising millions of dollars to elect Barack Obama in 2008 once Hillary Clinton lost the Democratic nomination.He met with the president this week to discuss what the White House could do to tackle climate change, and how “insurance industry’s role in helping American communities prepare for extreme weather and other impacts of climate change,” according to Reuters.Click for more from Watchdog.org",1,1239
"President Obama will propose sending $3 billion in aid to help developing nations adapt to the effects of climate change, according to multiple media reports.The anticipated contribution to the Green Climate Fund, an independent trust fund established by the United Nations, is expected to drum up support for donations from other countries ahead of climate talks next year in Paris. It likely won't represent a net increase in U.S. foreign aid, as Republicans would block such a move — rather, the White House will probably attempt to shift money from similar programs.""I think there would be political difficulties if it resulted in a net increase in foreign aid,"" said Alden Meyer, a longtime observer of international climate negotiations and policy director with the Union of Concerned Scientists. ""No doubt I think the administration is going to have to make a case to get the funding for the Green Climate Fund appropriated here.""Nations will meet next week in Berlin in hopes of raising $10 billion for a three-year funding period. The potential U.S. dollars put the Green Climate Fund more than halfway to that goal, bringing the total pot to about $5.4 billion, and could be key for engaging developing nations in the U.N. climate talks.Click for more from WashingtonExaminer.com ",1,1290
