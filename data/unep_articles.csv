"Around 100 billion items of clothing are delivered out of garment factories around the world every year. Collectively, the world’s population buys 400 per cent more clothes than we did 20 years ago.

The scale and speed at which clothing is produced and consumed now has given us the term “fast fashion”. The long tradition of Spring/Summer and Autumn/Winter collections has been replaced with an almost weekly turn-over of new trends, drawing shoppers into an insatiable addiction to new styles.

Prices are kept artificially low as clothing manufacturers take advantage of minimal wages for workers and poor or ineffective environmental standards in countries in the developing world.

But there are a growing number of environmental campaigners, innovative clothing designers and fashion buyers in Ireland and around the world who want the fashion industry to have its “Blue Planet moment”.

Reducing the volume of clothing produced and sold is key

They are asking us all to wake up to the environmental and human impacts of the fashion industry – one of the most polluting industries in the world - in the same way as people did when David Attenborough showed the turtle dying from too much plastic in its belly in 2017.

The enormous amount of water needed to grow cotton is one environmental cost of the industry. For example, the production of one cotton T-shirt requires the equivalent of about four years of drinking water for the average person.

Then, consider the chemicals sprayed on cotton crops, the electricity (often from dirty sources such as coal and diesel generators) powering the garment factories, the fossil fuel emissions from transportation of clothing across the seas, railway and road networks and by air to high street stores. And that’s before we even consider the polluting effects of clothes once we’ve finished wearing them.

Textiles economy

The equivalent of one rubbish truck of textiles is landfilled or burned every second, while less than one per cent of clothing is recycled into new clothes, according to a groundbreaking 2017 report from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, an environmental advocacy organisation set up by MacArthur, a retired English yachtswoman.

An estimated €443 billion is wasted every year on clothing that is barely worn. If nothing changes, the authors of the report predict that the fashion industry will consume more than a quarter of the world’s annual carbon budget by 2050.

A recent inquiry into the sustainability of the fashion industry by the British parliament recommended a 1p tax on each garment as a way to put pressure on companies to stop over-production, but this was rejected last month.

“Today’s textile industry is built on an outdated linear, take-make-dispose model, and is hugely wasteful and polluting,” the report said, presenting “a vision of a new system based on circular economy principles that offers benefits to the economy, society and the environment”.

The vision for this “new textiles economy” is that clothes will be designed differently, worn longer and rented, resold and reused much more often. Materials will be recycled, either to make new clothes or for use as insulation, mattress stuffing or wipe cloths. The report has since been endorsed by some big fashion brands including Nike, C&A, and H&M.

“We have to think about what will happen at the end of life of materials at the design stage,” says Carrie-Ann Moran, head of Rediscover Fashion at the Rediscovery Centre, now the national hub for the “circular economy” – the term used to describe an economic system which aims to minimise waste – in Ireland.

“The problem with the current system is that 70 per cent of materials are synthetically blended [a mix of synthetic and natural materials], which makes them extremely difficult to be broken down for recycling.”

Carrie-Ann Moran: ‘Ten per cent of textile waste happens before the materials leave the factory.’

Designers need to create new materials that will be less synthetic and that will not leak microfibres into our water systems, says Moran, who is also the national co-ordinator for Fashion Revolution in Ireland. “Ten per cent of textile waste happens before the materials leave the factory, so we have to tackle this pre-consumer textile waste too,” she explains. New zero-waste pattern practices re-blend natural fibre off-cuts from the cutting room floor.

Natural fabrics

Some clothing companies such as Nike are veering towards at more sustainable materials or using recycled materials in their brands. ASOS, Marks and Spencer and Burberry are also using sustainable or organic cotton and recycled materials in their clothing. The owner of Zara announced this week that all its collections will be made from 100 per cent sustainable fabrics by 2025, with its other brands, including Zara Home, Massimo Dutti and Pull&Bear to follow suit.

English fashion designer Stella McCarthy’s new flagship boutique in London’s Old Bond Street has biodegradable mannequins to display her handmade organic cotton collection.

The idea is that clothing will be “made to be made again” or composed of materials which will decompose naturally after use, such as grape leather made from by-products from the wine industry.

Companies such as Patagonia are leading the way in encouraging consumers to invest more in products that will last longer, with a lifetime guarantee on their clothing to encourage people to buy items that could conceivably last a lifetime. Patagonia also now sells a bag which prevents microfibres from being released into waste water streams when synthetic clothes are washed in a machine.

But the focus on natural fabrics are just one small element of the drive to make the industry more sustainable. Reducing the volume of clothing produced and sold is key.

Speaking at the recent Circular Fashion conference at the Rediscovery Centre in Dublin, Dorothy Maxwell, sustainability advisor for Brown Thomas and Arnotts, said it is “about consuming differently, not just buying and owning new clothes, but also having pre-loved and pre-owned fashion. It’s about giving fashion many lives - particularly high quality clothing by renting our wardrobes.”

Brown Thomas recently opened a new vintage clothing section in store, and customers can also bring clothes to both Brown Thomas and Arnotts for redistribution through St Vincent de Paul charity shops.

H&M’s Conscious range.

H&M has been taking back items of old clothing in their stores since 2013 through its Garment Collecting recycling programme. In 2018 alone, they collected 20,649 tonnes of clothing.

Their Conscious range contains at least 50 per cent recycled, organic, or lyocell materials, which are produced by environmentally responsible processes from sustainable sources (the exception is their cotton garments, which are made from 20 per cent recycled material).

In April, the brand announced a partnership with the second-hand online marketplace Sellpy, which will see them selling second-hand clothing on their own website. The project will be trialled on the Swedish website of its subsidiary clothing chain and Other Stories.

H&M’s head of sustainability Anna Gedda said the company was responding to growing consumer demand for sustainable and ethical retail.

“We see this as a growing part of the industry, with great opportunities both for consumers and not least for the environmental impact, and how we can drastically reduce that by extending the life of the products,” she said.

Climate Queens

In their Climate Queens podcast, Clodagh Kelly and Katie Harrington suggest a few simple ways to get more value out of our clothes, making them last longer and thus reducing our need to buy as much: You can take better care of your clothes – and save energy by machine washing at 30 degrees and air-drying them outside rather than using a clothes dryer. Learn how to repair or re-design clothes you no longer wear by following YouTube videos, or by joining a sewing class.

And, you can sort your clothes into four piles – one pile for wearing again, one for swopping or sending to a charity shop, one for items which need fixing or re-sizing, and the last pile for the clothing bank.

Offloading all your unwanted clothes to charity shops and clothing banks may seem like a sensible thing to do, but it is not necessarily the sustainable solution, however. What happens to those clothes when they are dropped off?

“There are about 23,000 tonnes of clothing collected every year by charity shops registered with the Irish Charity Shops Association, ” says Claire Downey, national co-ordinator of the Community Reuse Network of Ireland.

“Between 30-50 per cent is sold as second-hand here, and about 30 per cent is sent to textile recyclers, who send it to Africa and Eastern Europe clothing markets.” The rest is used for industrial rags, or sent to landfill or incineration.

You don’t need 50 dresses, you just need one dress and 50 new friends

But some reports suggest that sending our secondhand clothing to developing countries will result in a glut of clothing in these countries - in the same way as sending our plastics for recycling to Asian countries has resulted in high levels of pollution there.

In his 2015 documentary on the fashion industry, The True Cost, Andrew Morgan estimated that only about 10 per cent of donated clothing in the developed world is sold locally, and that the clothing industry in countries such as Haiti has all but disappeared, because locals buy boxes of imported second hand clothes instead. Markets in some African countries are also closing down because of imported second hand clothing.

Clodagh Kelly, who also runs Swapsies, an initiative that promotes swopping clothes events among groups of friends, says that Ireland should deal with its own textile waste – rather than export it abroad. “We need our own textile recycling facilities in Ireland as well as sending good quality clothing to charity shops,” she says.

Kelly says that the future of sustainable fashion will be about access over ownership. “We only actively use about 20 per cent of our clothes, so we need to look at these new ways of sharing, selling and renting.”

She also recommends people sign up to the Save Your Wardrobe app, which will help you make better purchasing decisions by reminding you what you already have before you buy something new you might not need. The #30wears campaign, which started in the UK, also encourages people to only buy an item of clothing that they plan to wear 30 times or more.

The emergence of sharing and renting clothing websites such as Depop, thredUp, Rent the Runway, Wear the Walk and Nu.Wardrobe is perhaps the most exciting trend in sustainable fashion. Nu.Wardrobe started as a student business idea and is now operating in Ireland and London.

The online platform allows members to share and borrow clothes and return them cleaned to the owner within a specified time. Co-founder Aisling Byrne says the aim is to create a global social network of sharers who can enjoy and circulate fashion. “Young women are already sifting through social media to borrow clothes from people they hardly know. You don’t need 50 dresses, you just need one dress and 50 new friends,” she says.

And the latest craze to satiate young fashionistas is a virtual clothing sites like digitalcollection.carlings.com, where you can pay to download a 3D outfit “tailored” to an image of you, which you can post on Instagram without ever needing to buy the clothes at all.

Rana Plaza collapse

The collapse of the Rana Plaza building in Bangladesh in April 2013, where more than 1,100 people lost their lives and 2,500 more were injured, led to the foundation of Fashion Revolution, a global movement working for a more sustainable fashion industry.

“Every time we buy, wear and dispose of clothes, we create an environmental footprint and an impact on the people who make them - most of whom are women,” says Carry Somers, co-founder of Fashion Revolution. Followers of the Fashion Revolution are encouraged to use the #WhoMadeMyClothes hashtag on social media to encourage big brands to confront issues around the working conditions of garment workers.

Andrew Morgan’s The True Cost documentary, released in 2015, also opened our eyes to the greed, fear, power and poverty associated with the global fashion industry. In that documentary, Morgan juxtaposes glamourous catwalks and seductive clothing advertising with everyday lives of workers who depend on these low wage jobs in often unsafe working conditions.

Ethical fashion designer Safia Minney.

There are around 40 million garment workers in the world. Four million of them work in 5,000 factories in Bangladesh alone. It is these garment workers, primarily in Bangladesh and China, who are paying the price of cheap fashion we buy online and in stores.

Safia Minney, the ethical fashion designer behind the People Tree Fair Trade fashion brand, believes that social justice and environmental justice issues need to be dealt with at the same time.

“Most brands start with the look, but we start with the skills at each producer group and design the collections up. Women’s development and the environment are central to what we do,” she told the first Circular Fashion Conference in Dublin in April. The People Tree brand, which started in Japan more than 20 years ago, sources garments from countries including Zimbabwe, Nepal, Indonesia and Bangladesh.

How to be a sustainable fashionista

1) Look at the clothes you have and separate them into four piles - one pile for wearing again, one for swopping or sending to the charity shop, one for items which need fixing or re-sizing and the last pile for the clothes bank.

2) Organise your wardrobe so you can see what you’ve got - and arrange tops/skirts/trousers that match together so you can select things more easily if you’re in a rush.

3) Only shop when you’re feeling energetic, comfortable with your body shape and crucially when you need something new - consider the #30wears campaign which encourages people to only buy something they plan to wear 30 times. Sign up to the Save Your Wardrobe app to help you make better decisions by reminding you what you already have.

4) When you have a special event coming up, first consider borrowing or renting something first. See Swapsies.ie Nu.wardrobe Depop, thredUp, Rent toe Runway, Wear the Walk for ideas.

5) Look after your clothes well by machine washing at 30 degrees, air drying outside if possible and consider repairing or re-designing clothes you no longer wear.

"ASOS has launched a 'responsible' filter, allowing enviro-friendly customers to choose recycled and sustainably sourced clothes.

The online retailer has been known mainly as a fast fashion brand - producing vast quantities of cheap clothes for the mass market.

However it has become one of the first clothing companies to allow eco-conscious fashion-lovers to pick responsibly-made garments.

Customers can now select recycled or sustainable clothes, in a filter at the top of the page.

Recycled items will be made of reused plastics, textiles and waste.

The online retailer has been known mainly as a fast fashion brand but is now changing tone

Clothes in the sustainable section are made with specially sourced fabrics, that use less water.

It follows a trend for consumers demanding more ethically-sourced clothes.

Figures show the UK chucks away a million tonnes of textiles every year, and sends £140 million worth of clothes to landfill.

An ASOS spokesman explained: 'We wanted to introduce you to our brand new responsible edit, a one-stop home for all the environmentally conscious clothing and accessories available at ASOS.

ASOS has been praised for the move online, one person said ASOS is 'leading from the front'

'At the same time, we're also launching a responsible filter - a new way for customers to shop products made with more sustainable and recycled materials, whatever they're looking for.

'Look out for recycled goods, where waste, plastic and textiles have been recreated as new products, and sustainably sourced fibres and fabrics, which use less water and are better for the environment.

'We know there's so much more for us to do, and we want to make it as easy as possible for our customers to shop responsibly, so we're looking forward to sharing more in future.'

But critics want ASOS to go further.

Besma Whayeb, an ethical fashion blogger and green action ambassador for the Government, believes the online giant could give more information about where the clothes are sourced from.

Critics, however, want ASOS to go further. Besma Whayeb, an ethical fashion blogger and green action ambassador, believes they could give more info about where the clothes source

She said: 'ASOS has dumped all of their own-brand collections into their Responsible Edit, as they're part of the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI).

'Put simply, ASOS sources cotton that is generally made in a more ethical way, but in my opinion that doesn't make their pieces responsible.

'I don't know anything about their labour practices for garment workers, or items made from anything other than cotton.'

Besma blasted: 'Is this how lazy greenwashing is these days?'

She added: 'If you are going to shop on ASOS, I'd recommend shopping from other third-party ethical brands.

The move was questioned by some but widely praised online and branded 'amazing' by some

'Oddly, many of these didn't make it into the edit at all.'

Currently around 1% of the 54,000 clothing items on the website are classed as recycled, and 17% sustainable.

Some sections such as jumpers and tracksuits have no recycled or sustainable clothes in them.

A lot of fashionistas on Twitter praised the move.

Jenni Renshaw wrote: 'Well done ASOS, loving the new 'responsible' filter on your app.'

User Mrs Conway posted: 'What an amazing filter to have ASOS, leading from the front.

'Maybe people who have never thought about these things before, will notice and learn a bit about it.'

The move follows a number of brands that have branched out into making recycled clothes, including Stella McCartney and George at Asda.

There was outrage at the fashion world last year when it emerged Burberry burnt millions of pounds of unsold clothes and perfume to maintain exclusivity."
"Adrian Jones and Graham Ross have pioneered a process that takes blended fabrics and reduces them to raw components

Before and after the catwalk, the fashion industry is inherently ugly.

Textiles account for 10% of global carbon emissions. The industry is the world’s second-biggest industrial polluter, behind oil. In Australia, an estimated 3m tonnes of textiles goes into landfill each year.

The ability to recycle fabric is, say industry veterans Adrian Jones and Graham Ross, a “holy grail ... for the industry and the planet” that will help close the loop between resource-intensive fabric production and fast-growing piles of textile waste.

Workers making clothes for Australian brands can’t afford to eat, Oxfam reports Read more

Jones and Ross have pioneered and trademarked – with input from the CSIRO and the Queensland University of Technology – a small-scale and environmentally friendly process that takes blended fabrics and reduces them to their raw components.

“We often seem to care more about old plastic bottles than we care about our favourite T-shirts,” Jones told Guardian Australia.

The immediate benefit of fabric recycling is to divert increasing amounts of waste from landfill. Trends such as fast fashion and minimalism have the unintended consequences of increasing fabric waste. In Australia, 75% of people throw textiles away each year, a 2017 YouGov survey found; 30% tossed out more than 10 garments.

“The nature of the fashion industry is you start out with the best fibre or the best fabric you and and make it into a garment,” says Jones, who has worked in fashion for big retailers in the UK and Australia for 30 years. “There is such intrinsic value in the fibres. But the way we value them doesn’t reflect that. The retail prices don’t reflect that. In the industry now we spend half the year marking [the prices] down as quickly as we can”

Long-term, recycling can reduce the industry’s reliance on resource-intensive production methods used to make new fabrics. Cotton requires vast quantities of water. Polyester is made from petroleum and takes up to 1,000 years to biodegrade.

Ross, a former endurance athlete who launched a sustainable athletic clothing line, says major apparel companies now have a stake in ending those wasteful production practices. Companies such as Nike now make products from large quantities of recycled waste, while H&M is increasing embracing recycled polyester.

But while textile recycling is not itself new, studies show many existing large-scale processes provide negligible benefits and can be as environmentally harmful as the production of raw fabrics. It also remains uncommon.

“There’s no textile recycling industry in this country,” Ross says. “We’ve got a lot of waste going into landfill and trying to fill that gap. The fashion industry is starting to use more sustainable materials and recycled polyester is on a fast uptake.”

The process pioneered by their company, BlockTexx, is “about the size of a craft brewery” and testing has show it to be efficient and sustainable. The company is in the process of seeking to establish its first facility in south-east Queensland, recycling about 10,000 tonnes a year.

Landfill becomes the latest fashion victim in Australia's throwaway clothes culture Read more

The focus will be on recycling commercial fabrics – old towels and bedsheets from hotels and hospitals, work uniforms and unwanted clothing not given to charities.

The “separation of fabric technology” turns cotton to cellulose and polyester to flake.

“They don’t have to go back into textiles, either,” Ross said. “A company might end up using its old uniforms for new office furniture. You’re not using virgin resources.”

BlockTexx also plans to build a marketplace for recycled textiles.

“The whole process is novel and unique,” Jones said. “We certainly see the fact we can scale this. We see this as being an international solution ... as being a model that can be expanded internationally. This is a global problem, if our technology works and can keep large scales of textiles out of landfill, then we’ll look to scale it up as quickly as we can.

“If it’s ripped or torn or stained then you have to put that into your landfill. We can take those torn, stained and ripped clothes and process them back into a reusable resource.”"
"Fashion Industry Charter on Climate Action launched

The global fashion sector today significantly increased momentum to address climate change by launching the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action. Under the auspices of UN Climate Change, leading fashion brands, retailers, supplier organizations, and others, including a major shipping company, have agreed to collectively address the climate impact of the fashion sector across its entire value chain.

43 leaders, including adidas, Burberry, Esprit, Guess, Gap Inc. Hugo Boss, H&M Group, Inditex, Kering Group, Levi Strauss & Co., Puma SE, PVH Corp.,Target; leading membership organizations, including Business for Social Responsibility, Sustainable Apparel Coalition, China National Textile and Apparel Council, Outdoor Industry Association and Textile Exchange; global logistics company Maersk; and global NGO WWF International have committed to implementing or supporting the 16 principles and targets that underpin the Fashion Climate Charter.

The Charter, which is open for other companies and organizations to join, recognizes the crucial role that fashion plays on both sides of the climate equation; as a contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, and as a sector with multiple opportunities to reduce emissions while contributing to sustainable development.

Aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement, the Charter contains the vision for the industry to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and defines issues that will be addressed by signatories, ranging from decarbonization of the production phase, selection of climate friendly and sustainable materials, low-carbon transport, improved consumer dialogue and awareness, working with the financing community and policymakers to catalyze scalable solutions, and exploring circular business models. To make concrete progress on these commitments, six working groups have been established in which signatories will work to define steps for implementation.

The signatories are not waiting for these issues to be fully elaborated and have set an initial target to reduce their aggregate greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by 2030 and have defined concrete measures, such as phasing out coal-fired boilers or other sources of coal-fired heat and power generation in their own companies and direct suppliers from 2025.

“The fashion industry is always two steps ahead when it comes to defining world culture, so I am pleased to see it now also leading the way in terms of climate action,” said UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa. “I congratulate the signatories of this important charter, which represents a unique commitment and collaboration from an array of fashion leaders. The Charter, like the renowned fashion runways of the world, sets an example that I hope others will follow.”

The Charter is industry-led, and open to a wider group of fashion stakeholders. It is supported by a range of relevant organizations and NGOs that will foster ambition which will be tracked and recognized by UN Climate Change, The Charter aims to drive climate action in the sector, including by complementing and supporting other fashion sector initiatives aimed at increasing climate action.

“We are aware that more than 90 percent of PUMA’s Carbon Footprint is being generated in shared supply chains. If we want to reduce carbon emissions in our supply chains, we need to work together with our industry peers,” said Bjørn Gulden, CEO of PUMA. “The Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action provides a collective industry effort to support the goals of the Paris Agreement. We appreciate that UN Climate Change has set up a global platform and call upon our industry peers to join the initiative.”

“This charter is about getting the fashion industry united in important climate work. Our industry has a global reach and only together can we create the change that is urgently needed,” said Karl-Johan Persson, CEO H&M group. “We are happy to be a signatory of this charter as part of our ambition to become climate positive in our value chain.”

In early 2018, fashion leaders volunteered to shape a climate movement through discussions in working groups chaired by PUMA SE and H&M Group. The launch today, during the critical UN Climate Change Conference in Katowice, Poland (COP24), reflects genuine sectoral buy-in and is a clarion call to the fashion industry globally to sign-up to climate action.

The founding signatories are: adidas, Aquitex, Arcteryx, Burberry Limited, Esprit, Guess, Gap Inc., H&M Group, Hakro Gmbh., Hugo Boss, Inditex, Kering Group, Lenzing AG, Levi Strauss & Co., Mammut Sports Group AG, Mantis World, Maersk, Otto Group, Pidigi S.P.A, PUMA SE, re:newcell, Schoeller Textiles AG, Peak Performance, PVH Corp., Salomon, Skunkfunk, SLN Textil, Stella McCartney, Sympatex Technologies, Target and Tropic Knits Group.

Supporting organizations include: Business for Social Responsibility (BSR), China National Textile and Apparel Council (CNTAC), China Textile Information Center (CTIC), Global Fashion Agenda (GFA), Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS), International Finance Corporation (IFC), Outdoor Industry Association (OIA), Sustainable Apparel Coalition (SAC), Sustainable Fashion Academy (SFA), Textile Exchange, WWF International and ZDHC (Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals Foundation).

By signing on to the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action, CEOs and presidents of these organizations have confirmed their commitment to address climate change and their willingness to step up collaboration within and beyond the fashion sector towards a cleaner, low-carbon future. The fashion industry -- which encompasses textiles, clothing, leather, and footwear industries, from the production of raw materials and manufacturing of garments, accessories and footwear to their distribution and consumption — has long supply chains and energy intensive production.

“Burberry is proud to be a signatory of the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action,” said Marco Gobbetti, Chief Executive Officer, Burberry. “While we have committed to becoming carbon neutral in our own operations, achieving a 30 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions across the entire global fashion industry by 2030 will require innovation and collaboration. By working together with other signatories of the Charter, we believe that we can achieve systemic change and build a more sustainable future.”

“Climate change is undoubtedly one of, if not, the biggest challenge of our lifetime. It is and will affect everyone on this planet and our future,” said designer Stella McCartney. “This is why I am proud to be a signatory of the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action. I want to call on my peers in the business, from other brands to retailers and suppliers, to sign up to this charter now and take the necessary actions to address the reality of the issue of climate change in their business and value chains. Collectively we have a voice and the capacity to make a difference.”

Principles and actions outlined in the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action will be pursued and developed collectively through working groups which will be convened by the UN Climate Change in early 2019. Any company or organization professionally engaged in the fashion sector, regardless of where they are in their environmental journey, and who are committing to the principles of the Charter by signing it, may participate in this work.

In the fickle world of fashion sustainability has finally become a hot topic and for a good reason. There’s no escaping the fact that fashion is often cited as one of the worst offenders because the industries trend cycle promotes consumers to buy more than they will ever have time to wear. And then of course the next bit thing comes along and the clothes no longer deemed ‘on trend’ go to waste, or worse end up as landfill.

But it’s not just the issue of waste that’s the problem, the way clothes are produced are also harmful for the environment so it’s double edged sword.

Stacey Dooley’s brilliant documentary ‘Fashion’s Dirty Secrets” explores the harmful production processes used in cotton farming so it’s not just man made fibres we should be looking at.

But by adopting a more mindful approach and simply changing our shopping we can make a big impact. But before we start lets be clear - this is not simply a lecture about buying less it’s a guide on how to buy smart.

1. Championing sustainable brands is a good place to start

Meghan Markle may have spent £60,000 on her royal tour wardrobe but she did showcase brands that are tying to change the harmful way the fashion industry has done business in past.

Among the brands were Rothy who make shoes from 100% post-consumer water bottles; Outland denim, organic cotton jeans crafted by seamstresses being paid a living wage; Veja fair trade sneakers constructed out of wild rubber and organic cotton; and a linen Reformation sundress that was created with 11.9 lbs less carbon dioxide than a conventional design.

By investing our money in responsible fashion brands we can make a difference.

2. Don't follow the fads

Another way we can help is by prioritising style over fleeting fads and not caving in to the pressure to buy into each and every new trend that comes along. Consumers in the UK have an estimated £46.7 billion worth of unworn clothes in their closets. So before you made that snap decision to order 10 new whimsical items take a moment to ask yourself. Do I really need this?

3. Invest

Instead of buying into every trend, buying one investment piece that will withstand the test of time is a good way to cut down on the amount of clothing we buy. You don’t have to stop shopping, it’s about looking at the way you shop and buying with a long term view.

4. Don't late night shop

Another pitfall to avoid is that late night online shopping fix that often leads to shopping mistakes that quite often don’t get returned. Going into a shop and trying things on is proven to cut down on costly mistakes. It also cuts down on transportation.

5. Vintage clothing

And if we all swapped one new purchase for a vintage piece of clothing we’d make a huge difference. Fashion simple goes in cycles and every era comes round again. Whether it’s the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s or 90s fashion loves a revival. So instead of buying a copy of an original piece why not buy an actual vintage piece instead?

This way you do your bit for the environment whilst also ensuring you’re wearing something no one else will have. It’s a great way to put a unique stamp on your wardrobe and develop your own sense of style.

Celebs like Billie Pipler, Alexa Chung, Jameela Jamil, Fearne Cotton, Sadie Frost, Pearl Lowe and Jenna Coleman are big vintage fans and are often spotted on the red carpet in one off pieces.

These celebs are all fans of Peekaboo Vintage owned by Emily Bothwell who holds a private archive of rare collectable pieces that she loans to celebrities.

Emily also has an extensive vintage collection that’s stocked in Topshop and on ASOS Marketplace. Emily has her own ethical mission #Ilovepreloved to make consumers more aware of the dangers of disposable shopping by bringing the concept of buying vintage back into the public peripheral as a way to update your wardrobe with beautifully made, unique pieces.

Supporting Peekaboo and Emily’s cause Billie Piper reveals:

“I love vintage. For me, not only can I wear unique pieces that no one else will be seen in, but buying vintage plays a huge role in reducing the fashion industry's global footprint. Whether it's reducing, repairing, reusing or recycling, the message is important, and I want to do my bit.

“My favourite piece of vintage clothing is Yellow moss crepe Ozzie Clark Dress. This piece is timeless and always a conversation point and I guarantee that no one else will have it. I adore it. I would rescue it first in a fire! In fact. I would probably enter a burning building to get to it”.

What are retailers doing to help?

The good news is some retailers are slooooowly catching up and doing their bit. For them the dilemma isn’t exactly hard to see. Driven by our demand for affordable clothing and facing turbulent trading conditions they’re under more pressure than ever to cut costs. Sadly this doesn't exactly go hand in hand with saving the environment.

Ultimately all fashion brands need to start investing in eco-friendly production and sadly we’re along way off.

But they're making baby steps.

Sustainability leaders Marks & Spencer’s Plan A sustainability plan outlines 10 key steps that underpin their commitment to making their clothing and home business more sustainable. Key areas are using the best raw materials.

By 2019 100% of the cotton used will be from a more sustainable sources, that’s over 50,000 tonnes of cotton produced using significantly less water, pesticides and fertiliser and providing 100,000s of smallholders with a better income.

They are also working with Prince Charles' International Sustainability Unit and the Textiles Exchange to build a coalition of 50 companies across the world committed to only using sustainable cotton. They’ve banned all cotton sourced from Uzbekistan because of its poor environmental and social record and recently banned cotton from Turkmenistan too.

They’ve also banned the use of angora and mohair, have an industry code of practise regarding the use of pollutants, are tackling the micro-plastics and use 100% sustainable wood. M&S also publish the name of their factories on an online transparency map.

Seven years ago Swedish high street retailer H&M launched their Conscious Exclusive Collection designed to promote the use of recycled materials.

This year alongside organic linen, cotton and silk, as well as Tencel and recycled polyester, H&M has introduced two new materials.

The fresh products are recycled silver, to create jewellery, and Econyl – a 100 per cent regenerated nylon fibre made from fishnets, which will be used to craft intricate pieces of lace. Alongside this they also sell a conscious collection that uses recycled fabrics.

The fashion industry at large has a long, long way to go but by changing our shopping habits we can all do our bit to force change."
"Recently Zara introduced a sustainability pledge. But how can Zara ever be sustainable? As the largest fast-fashion retailer in the world, they produce around 450 million garments a year and release 500 new designs a week, about 20,000 a year. Zara’s fast-fashion model has been so successful it has inspired an entire industry to shift — churning out an unprecedented number of fashion garments year-round.

We live in an era of hyper-consumption in the middle of a climate crisis.

Clothing production doubled from 2000 to 2014. The average consumer bought 60 per cent more clothing in 2014 than in 2000, but kept each garment half as long. Apparel consumption is projected to to rise by 63 per cent in the next 10 years. And less than one per cent of all clothing produced globally is recycled.

With production numbers like these, can any fast-fashion retailer claim sustainability?

Fast fashion is not eco-friendly

The fast-fashion business model itself is the very antithesis to sustainability.

Some ideas that have been presented by fast-fashion companies include recycling. But even if garments are collected in-store, the capabilities to recycle clothing at the scale needed for current production rates do not exist. It’s also typically more energy-intensive to recycle than to produce new products.

Another concept, the one put forth recently by Zara, is to use only sustainable fabrics. But switching to sustainable fabrics while producing fashion clothing under the same model will not make any fast-fashion retailer sustainable.

There is no such thing as a 100 per cent sustainable fabric. Fabrics require a tremendous amount of energy and natural resources to produce. Sustainable fabrics are just less harmful by reducing their environmental impact.

I spend a lot of time reading the corporate social responsibility reports of larger brands and interviewing micro-to-small sized enterprises to see how they approach sustainability. The largest significant difference between the two entities is culture.

Small brands focus on creating a culture of sustainability by producing less from the onset. They use strategies like producing made-to-order, so they are not making more than what is sold. They do this because waste is one of their biggest concerns. They also design clothing to be of the highest quality, ensuring durability and longevity, so clothes last a long time in your wardrobe. They will also repair your clothing so that you may keep it longer.

The most significant difference is that most small brands are opting to work under an “anti-fashion calendar.” They deliberately chose not to follow the intense seasonal calendar that fashion functions under. Instead, they produce as needed. This is the opposite of how large companies function.

Large global corporate retailers are not seeking to change their fundamental business model or create cultures of sustainability. That would require re-working their entire business structure.

Corporate social irresponsibility

The fast-fashion growth model used by all large companies is predicated on limitless growth and disposable consumption.

Corporate brands and retailers provide statistics about their environmental impact reductions within their supply chains. Unlike annual financial reports, corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports are voluntary and not verified externally. Also, the way they measure their improvements is not consistent or standardized. Therefore, consumers can’t compare one company to another without doing some wizard math.

Annual financial reports usually include ambitious goals to grow and expand. For example, H&M opened up 145 new stores this year and has expanded into four new markets: Ukraine, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates (UAE).

Inditex, Zara’s parent company, expects to open 300 new stores this year and launch online sales in Dubai, Egypt, Indonesia, Israel, Lebanon, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Serbia and UAE.

Fast fashion is a “grow or die” business. And fast fashion continues to export this western consumerism into the Global South: this could have disastrous consequences. This is the paradox at the heart of western consumerist culture and one that goes beyond fast-fashion industry. Neoliberal capitalist economies require continuous consumption and define success through growth — concepts at odds with sustainability. Business growth must be decoupled from resource use.

The global population is set to grow by another two billion people in the next 30 years. To make a dent in the climate crisis, we have to cut emissions by more than 55 per cent in the next 10 years.

The current carbon footprint of the fashion industry is over eight per cent of total global greenhouse gas emissions, larger than all international travel. Therefore, to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, including the 2C global temperature target, the fashion industry must play an active role in changing how they operate, source, manufacture, distribute and approach the market.

It’s not as simple switching out current textiles or packaging for more sustainable versions. Solutions to sustainability must include cultural change.

How many wears does your clothing give you?

Even when a garment is produced using all sustainable materials, there are still many problems. Cheap costs and speedy production are why we still have labour issues like sweatshop conditions.

Zara has 1,800 suppliers in its supply-chain but does not disclose how often it audits individual suppliers per year to ensure compliance. If a garment is made to withstand only a couple months of wear — it is a massive waste of resources to produce that garment.

Fast fashion doesn’t nudge consumers towards more responsible consumption behaviours because that would ultimately hurt their bottom line.

I would have more faith in the sustainability initiatives by large fashion companies if they started to introduce alternative sustainable business model practices. One small step could be to offer repair or tailoring services. Tailoring creates clothes that fit impeccably, subsequently increasing their emotional value. I believe that when garments fit well and are flattering to our body, we love them, and we keep them longer.

For the benefit of the earth and humanity, large brands need to look at how to move away from their continuous offerings of weekly new products. If these kind of changes were to occur, I would start to believe Zara and other fashion brands had good intentions to curb climate change.

"Press Release – UNFCCC

The global fashion sector today significantly increased momentum to address climate change by launching the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action. Under the auspices of UN Climate Change, leading fashion brands, retailers, supplier organizations, …The global fashion sector today significantly increased momentum to address climate change by launching the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action. Under the auspices of UN Climate Change, leading fashion brands, retailers, supplier organizations, and others, including a major shipping company, have agreed to collectively address the climate impact of the fashion sector across its entire value chain.

43 leaders, including adidas, Burberry, Esprit, Guess, Gap Inc. Hugo Boss, H&M Group, Inditex, Kering Group, Levi Strauss & Co., Puma SE, PVH Corp.,Target; leading membership organizations, including Business for Social Responsibility, Sustainable Apparel Coalition, China National Textile and Apparel Council, Outdoor Industry Association and Textile Exchange; global logistics company Maersk; and global NGO WWF International have committed to implementing or supporting the 16 principles and targets that underpin the Fashion Climate Charter.

The Charter, which is open for other companies and organizations to join, recognizes the crucial role that fashion plays on both sides of the climate equation; as a contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, and as a sector with multiple opportunities to reduce emissions while contributing to sustainable development.

Aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement, the Charter contains the vision for the industry to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and defines issues that will be addressed by signatories, ranging from decarbonization of the production phase, selection of climate friendly and sustainable materials, low-carbon transport, improved consumer dialogue and awareness, working with the financing community and policymakers to catalyze scalable solutions, and exploring circular business models. To make concrete progress on these commitments, six working groups have been established in which signatories will work to define steps for implementation.

The signatories are not waiting for these issues to be fully elaborated and have set an initial target to reduce their aggregate greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by 2030 and have defined concrete measures, such as phasing out coal-fired boilers or other sources of coal-fired heat and power generation in their own companies and direct suppliers from 2025.

“The fashion industry is always two steps ahead when it comes to defining world culture, so I am pleased to see it now also leading the way in terms of climate action,” said UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa. “I congratulate the signatories of this important charter, which represents a unique commitment and collaboration from an array of fashion leaders. The Charter, like the renowned fashion runways of the world, sets an example that I hope others will follow.”

The Charter is industry-led, and open to a wider group of fashion stakeholders. It is supported by a range of relevant organizations and NGOs that will foster ambition which will be tracked and recognized by UN Climate Change, The Charter aims to drive climate action in the sector, including by complementing and supporting other fashion sector initiatives aimed at increasing climate action.

“We are aware that more than 90 percent of PUMA’s Carbon Footprint is being generated in shared supply chains. If we want to reduce carbon emissions in our supply chains, we need to work together with our industry peers,” said Bjørn Gulden, CEO of PUMA. “The Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action provides a collective industry effort to support the goals of the Paris Agreement. We appreciate that UN Climate Change has set up a global platform and call upon our industry peers to join the initiative.”

“This charter is about getting the fashion industry united in important climate work. Our industry has a global reach and only together can we create the change that is urgently needed,” said Karl-Johan Persson, CEO H&M group. “We are happy to be a signatory of this charter as part of our ambition to become climate positive in our value chain.”

In early 2018, fashion leaders volunteered to shape a climate movement through discussions in working groups chaired by PUMA SE and H&M Group. The launch today, during the critical UN Climate Change Conference in Katowice, Poland (COP24), reflects genuine sectoral buy-in and is a clarion call to the fashion industry globally to sign-up to climate action.

The founding signatories are: adidas, Aquitex, Arcteryx, Burberry Limited, Esprit, Guess, Gap Inc., H&M Group, Hakro Gmbh., Hugo Boss, Inditex, Kering Group, Lenzing AG, Levi Strauss & Co., Mammut Sports Group AG, Mantis World, Maersk, Otto Group, Pidigi S.P.A, PUMA SE, re:newcell, Schoeller Textiles AG, Peak Performance, PVH Corp., Salomon, Skunkfunk, SLN Textil, Stella McCartney, Sympatex Technologies, Target and Tropic Knits Group.

Supporting organizations include: Business for Social Responsibility (BSR), China National Textile and Apparel Council (CNTAC), China Textile Information Center (CTIC), Global Fashion Agenda (GFA), Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS), International Finance Corporation (IFC), Outdoor Industry Association (OIA), Sustainable Apparel Coalition (SAC), Sustainable Fashion Academy (SFA), Textile Exchange, WWF International and ZDHC (Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals Foundation).

By signing on to the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action, CEOs and presidents of these organizations have confirmed their commitment to address climate change and their willingness to step up collaboration within and beyond the fashion sector towards a cleaner, low-carbon future. The fashion industry — which encompasses textiles, clothing, leather, and footwear industries, from the production of raw materials and manufacturing of garments, accessories and footwear to their distribution and consumption — has long supply chains and energy intensive production.

“Burberry is proud to be a signatory of the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action,” said Marco Gobbetti, Chief Executive Officer, Burberry. “While we have committed to becoming carbon neutral in our own operations, achieving a 30 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions across the entire global fashion industry by 2030 will require innovation and collaboration. By working together with other signatories of the Charter, we believe that we can achieve systemic change and build a more sustainable future.”

“Climate change is undoubtedly one of, if not, the biggest challenge of our lifetime. It is and will affect everyone on this planet and our future,” said designer Stella McCartney. “This is why I am proud to be a signatory of the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action. I want to call on my peers in the business, from other brands to retailers and suppliers, to sign up to this charter now and take the necessary actions to address the reality of the issue of climate change in their business and value chains. Collectively we have a voice and the capacity to make a difference.”

Principles and actions outlined in the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action will be pursued and developed collectively through working groups which will be convened by the UN Climate Change in early 2019. Any company or organization professionally engaged in the fashion sector, regardless of where they are in their environmental journey, and who are committing to the principles of the Charter by signing it, may participate in this work.

"Ministers have rejected recommendations from MPs to clean up the huge environmental impact of fast fashion, which sees 300,000 tonnes of clothing burned or buried in the UK every year.

MPs on the Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) said a charge of 1p for each garment was urgently needed to raise £35m a year for better clothing collection and sorting, a move supported by many in the industry. But the government’s response, published on Tuesday, failed to commit to this, stating only that it could be considered by 2025.

The MPs report, Fixing Fashion, was published in February and revealed that UK shoppers buy more new clothes than any other European country, and roughly twice as many as in Germany and Italy. It also said textile production contributes more emissions to the climate crisis than international aviation and shipping combined, consumes lake-sized volumes of fresh water and creates chemical and microplastic pollution.

The cross-party EAC said there should be a ban on incinerating or landfilling unsold clothes that can be reused or recycled. But the government said: “We believe that positive approaches are required to find outlets for waste textiles rather than simply imposing a landfill ban.”

The MPs also recommended mandatory environmental targets for fashion retailers with a turnover above £36m. However, the government said it would only “encourage the wider industry to take part in [the voluntary] Sustainable Clothing Action Plan (Scap)”.

Just 11 fashion retailers have signed up to Scap and the recycling charity that runs it, Wrap, has lost 80% of its government funding since 2010. The EAC also presented evidence from Wrap that the impact of the increasing sales of clothing each year outweighs the efficiency savings being made in carbon emissions and water use.

“Fashion producers should be forced to clear up the mountains of waste they create,” said EAC chair Mary Creagh. “The government has rejected our call, demonstrating that it is content to tolerate practices that trash the environment, having just committed to net zero emission targets. Urgent action must be taken to change the fast-fashion business model which produces cheap clothes that cost the earth.”

Trawling for trash: the brands turning plastic pollution into fashion Read more

The government said in response: “We recognise how crucial it is for the environmental and social impacts to be well managed, particularly in this era of fast fashion … In our response we explain the action already being taken in respect of clothing and outline our [existing] plans for the future.” But none of the EAC recommendations were accepted.

These include a reduced rate of VAT on clothes repair services, as implemented in Sweden, and that fashion companies whose products have lower environmental impacts should be rewarded by government schemes and those that do not should be penalised.

A recent survey for the fashion trade publication Drapers reported that 85% of 370 brands, retailers and suppliers thought the government was not doing enough to help the fashion industry become more sustainable, with 69% supporting the 1p a garment charge. Most (60%) said the main barrier to becoming more sustainable is that it drives up costs, with 36% saying shoppers are unwilling to pay for sustainable fashion.

"Throwaway garments contribute more to climate change than air and sea travel. Now clothing retailers are bracing for a backlash

Fashion shoppers spent about £3.5bn on Christmas party clothing this year – but 8 million of those sparkly items will be on their way to landfill after just one wear.

So-called fast fashion has ushered throwaway culture into the clothing business, with items so cheap they have become single-use purchases.

Last week, the young-fashion brand Boohoo had 486 dresses available online for less than £5. Many – like a black bandeau jersey bodycon number – were just £3.75, meaning the delivery charge cost more than the contents of the package. Rival Asos was offering 257 dresses and 2,141 different tops for less than £10.

Now, however, some fashion experts believe the party could be coming to an end for such disposable clothing and a backlash could be brewing, just as it has against takeaway coffee cups, plastic packaging and meat. Overall, the fashion industry as a whole is contributing more to climate change than the aeronautical and shipping industries combined. If trends continue, the industry could account for a quarter of the world’s carbon budget by 2050.

In the past 15 years, global clothing production has doubled to meet demand. But it has left a trail of cast-offs, with more than half of fast fashion items thrown away in less than a year, according to the consultants McKinsey.

Disposing of clothing and household textiles costs the UK alone about £82m a year, according to a 2014 study by the government-backed recycling charity Wrap.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest A little black dress from the young-fashion brand Boohoo is available for just £3.75.

In 2015, greenhouse gas emissions from textiles production globally totalled 1.2 billion tonnes of CO 2 equivalent, according to a report by the industry-led Circular Fibres Initiative. This is more than the emissions of all international flights and maritime shipping combined.

Less than 1% of the material used to produce clothing globally is recycled into new clothing, with 12% recycled into other products such as insulation or mattress stuffing.

With a parliamentary committee set to produce a report on the issue in February and concerns about plastic pollution spurred by the BBC’s Blue Planet documentary now turning to microfibres from clothing, industry insiders believe a backlash against fast fashion is on the way.

Mike Barry, director of sustainable business at Marks & Spencer, said: “The signals are [fashion is] on the same trajectory as plastics and forests and alternatives to meat. These were all underlying concerns that got through to the mainstream consumer.

“There is not an obvious consumer backlash against fast fashion today, but it would be a very brave business leader who didn’t look into the next 12 to 18 months and say we are not heading there. Every business leader in the fashion industry knows that clothing will have the same level of questioning and challenging that food has had for years.

“It is going from being a business-to-business and risk-management issue behind the scenes to a consumer issue, in the same way as plastics and deforestation linked to palm oil have been in the last 12 months.”

His hunch is backed up by research that suggests shoppers have already begun buying clothing less frequently.

In 2018, a third of consumers bought clothing once a month, down from 37% in 2016, while those buying every two or three months or less rose from 64% to 67%, according to the market research firm Mintel.

Samantha Dover, senior retail analyst at Mintel, says nearly half of consumers say they prefer to buy clothing from companies trying to reduce their impact on the environment, and that rises to 60% among under-24s.

“People are far more interested than before in knowing exactly where products are coming from and how they are being made,” Dover says. She says consumers are still more interested in the price and style of the clothing than where and how it has been made, but that change is coming.

With that in mind, switched-on clothing companies are no longer just setting up a few racks of eco clothing in the corner of a store but considering how to make their entire range more sustainable.

The government-backed sustainable clothing action plan, whose signatories include Next, M&S, Ted Baker, Primark and Asos, has committed nine major retailers to reducing waste being sent to landfill, water use and carbon footprint by 15% by 2020.

The government also wants to introduce extended producer-responsibility schemes for household and commercial textiles and clothing, similar to those currently in place for batteries and electronics, which would force companies to pay for the recovery of waste. But it is a slow process, with consultation promised only by 2025.

Mary Creagh MP, chair of the parliamentary environmental audit committee, which has been investigating fashion industry sustainability, says the timetable is too slow.

“We have only got 12 years to tackle damaging climate change,” she says. “We as consumers have to ask questions of brands. Brands have to make it part of what they do. These are massive companies run by some of the world’s richest men. Someone is doing OK out of it.”

Creagh adds that cheap fashion comes with a social as well as an environmental cost – with low-paid workers overseas unable to provide for their families. “We are not saying to people on a low income you can’t buy cheap clothes. We are saying it is time that the cost should reflect the true cost of the minimum wage and decent working conditions and growing stuff without pesticides. It needs to be sustainable from top to bottom and we don’t think the true cost is a £5 dress. That price is not being paid by us, it is being paid by someone else and the environment.”

Testifying to Creagh in parliament, Boohoo said that its £5 dresses were intended as loss leaders on which the company made no profit. It has also previously said that it takes sustainability seriously: ‘The youthful demographic of our customer means that education is key and we use our huge reach across social channels globally to help share ideas of how a garment can be utilised in their wardrobe again and again. We are also working with reGAIN, a company that allows users to recycle unwanted clothing to prevent them from going to landfill.”

Environmental campaigners say people who want to be more sustainable should choose quality clothes and make them last as long as possible by learning to repair or rework them. Buying secondhand or vintage clothing, considering renting outfits rather than buying, and washing garments less often at lower temperatures in a full machine can all help.

In many ways, younger people are ahead of the game, using trading sites such as Depop and Thredup to resell and upcycle clothing.

Even cleaning and mending services appear to be in vogue. Earlier this month, H&M brought its free mending service to the UK, making it a key part of a store revamp in Hammersmith. The brand is jumping on a bandwagon kickstarted by ethical brands such as Patagonia, which makes 40,000 repairs a year at its service centre in Reno, Nevada.

Meanwhile, the Los Angeles-based sports shoe cleaning specialist Jason Markk opened its first London store in March on Carnaby Street. It claims its “sneaker care technicians” have professionally cleaned more than 50,000 pairs of shoes since opening in the US in 2014.

Recycling is also becoming mainstream, with Primark set to launch a clothing take-back scheme in 2019, joining similar efforts by M&S and H&M that have been in operation for several years. Barry at M&S, which collects about 3 million items a year via its “shwopping” scheme, says it is only part of the answer. “The challenge is not getting clothing back: it’s what to do with it,” he says.

About 1.2 million tonnes of fibre from clothing is sold in the UK every year, about half of which is cotton, a third synthetic and the rest viscose or animal products such as leather. Reprocessing these fibres is tricky, according to Mark Sumner, a lecturer in sustainable fashion at the University of Leeds.

Most fabrics are a mix of different kinds of thread – such as cotton and Tencel for a T-shirt – and there are currently no commercial-scale facilities that can separate and reprocess such fabrics. Strong modern dyes are also extremely difficult to remove so, meaning that recycled threads cannot be recoloured.

Sumner says: “The more you process and play with them the worse they are and the quality reduces. “Recycled fibres through traditional routes are poor quality.”

Sumner and Barry say the government and businesses need to fund research into how good-quality fibres can be reprocessed on a large scale to build a closed-loop industry. “If we can find a way of recycling, we can think about the UK being an exporter of those fabrics or rescuing our textile industry. There is an economic story there,” Sumner says."
"“Fast fashion” has taken the clothing industry by storm. Retailers like H&M and Zara churn out affordable versions of the latest fashions from the runway to the store shelf, and we’re pressured to keep up with the trends.

And while there is an increased awareness of poor labour conditions in some of these fast fashion factories, we’re still not talking seriously about how the industry is harming our planet. Fashion is thought to be one of the worst-polluting industries in the world, falling among the ranks of oil and coal.

Fashion’s Dirty Secrets, a documentary from The Passionate Eye, highlights the environmental impact of what we wear. Host Stacey Dooley travels to Kazakhstan to examine how growing cotton has literally dried up the Aral Sea and visits Indonesia, where textile factories pump out toxic chemicals into what’s been called the world’s most polluted river.

“We are producing over 100 billion new garments from new fibres every single year,” says Lucy Siegle, a journalist investigating fashion’s growing environmental footprint. “And the planet cannot sustain that.”

Although we don’t grow cotton (one of the world’s thirstiest crops) in Canada, nor are we home to the world’s most toxic textile factories, we’re still contributors to the global problem through how much we buy and throw away.

In 2007, Kelly Drennan founded Fashion Takes Action, the only non-profit organization in Canada focused on promoting sustainability in the fashion industry and among consumers. “We started as a fundraiser event to demonstrate the potential that sustainable fabrics can be used in high-end fashion, but we quickly realized that an organization was needed to promote the sustainable fashion movement.”

Working toward sustainable manufacturing

Some of the biggest brand names in fast fashion have received criticism for their lack of sustainability, but Drennan notes there is work being done behind the scenes.

After the Rana Plaza collapse in 2013, it became apparent that companies (including Joe Fresh) had no idea how bad things were that factory where their garments were being made. “In the aftermath, there was a sudden rush to better understand their supply chains, and more pressure is being put on

fashion brands to be more transparent,” says Drennan.

“It might seem like there isn’t a lot of movement by big brands toward sustainability, but that’s because many of them are still trying to figure out how to trace their supply chains,” she says. “They can’t be transparent and ‘show’ us what they’re doing if they don’t first know themselves.”

Today, brands are developing new technologies. Blockchain and RFID (radio frequency identification) tagging systems could be used track materials through a brand’s supply chain so garments can be traced from field to shelf, but these systems are still a work in progress.

Responsible brands and manufacturers are looking to other textiles which are more environmentally friendly than cotton. “We’re heading toward a global fibre gap, where the demand for fibres — especially cotton — in textiles will be too great. Hemp is an attractive alternative as it’s a renewable resource, requires very few pesticides and does not shed microfibres like synthetics do and is much more efficient to grow than cotton.”

In Canada, each household throws away 46kg of clothing per year, with around 8-12 per cent of municipal landfills made up of textiles.

Landfills are overflowing with our fashion waste

We’ve become addicted to low-cost, disposable fashion. Compared to two decades ago, we purchase 400 per cent more clothing per year. And eventually, much of that fast fashion ends up in the trash.

In Canada, each household throws away 46 kilograms of textiles per year on average, making up around eight to 12 per cent of municipal landfills. “Unfortunately, fast fashion is not going away, and if we continue to consume as much clothing as we do today, that means we’ll continue to have fashion waste,” says Drennan.

The Ontario Textile Conversion Collaborative is finding ways to combat waste by creating new uses for old clothing. “We can’t keep sending bales of unwanted clothing to developing countries,” says Drennan, “so we’re consulting with a number of manufacturing sectors like the automotive, carpeting, paper, insulation and building sectors to better understand these potential end markets for discarded textiles.”

Some of the biggest brands have launched campaigns in an attempt to address textile waste, and while the issue can’t be fixed overnight, steps are being made. “Perfection doesn’t exist,” says Drennan, “but progress does!”

Her advice? Donate everything — even those old pairs of underwear and socks can be passed on at thrift stores and donation bins. Even though they won’t be resold, like 60 to 70 per cent of donations, they can be diverted to other industries that might use the fibres for other purposes such as insulation, padding and stuffing. So next time you’re clearing out your closet, donate it all!

We need to shop a lot less

Getting ahead of the waste problem involves changing consumer behaviour, and more responsible consumerism is exactly what inspired writer and illustrator Sarah Lazarovic. After finding herself buying too many fashion items on impulse, only to be worn once or twice, Lazarovic decided to take a year-long shopping sabbatical.

Getting in the way of impulse buys was key to her success. “Stopping to think ‘Do I really need this?’ was the first step to reducing my purchases,” says Lazarovic. “My method was then to paint, instead of purchase, the items that caught my eye.”

Lazarovic published her images in a book called A Bunch of Pretty Things I Did Not Buy. Some of her designs have reached a large audience, like “The Buyerarchy of Needs,” which has been translated into multiple languages. Today, she continues to advocate for changing our consumption behaviour.

Her advice to change shopping habits? “Be methodical about it,” she says. “Take a photo; write it down; say to yourself, ‘It’s an irrational purchase.’ Take a day, a week or more, and research the item. If you still want it after that time, then, by all means, go for it. But you’ve deferred that impulse, more often than not, you won’t be as interested after a period of time.”

Try not to get sucked in by the “limited-time offer” or the literal ticking clock on some online sales. And when it comes to physical retailers, there’s an even simpler solution, says Lazarovic: “Don’t go into the store! Don’t even look!”

Clothing manufacturers are starting to focus on sustainability

Some forward-thinking, and even high fashion companies are getting creative about sustainability. Ann Taylor is developing a clothing rental program, instilling the sense of a sharing economy, while Eileen Fisher is introducing a take-back initiative, cleaning and reselling used clothing at a reduced rate.

Even some of fast fashion’s biggest culprits are making headway. H&M, for instance, has created the Global Change Award through the non-profit H&M Foundation, investing in startups that aim to innovate and make the entire fashion industry more sustainable.

“There will be a huge shift, and we’re just beginning to see the dawn of this change,” says Drennan. “Those brands that don’t get on board with sustainability are going to be left in the dust.”

"There have been few fashion statements over the years at G7 summits (dress code: world leader suit, sensible shoes).

But this year, G7 leaders will be joined by more than 20 fashion retailers and brands, including the owner of Gucci, Kering, H&M and Zara’s parent company, Inditex, for a key fashion moment – a global pact to fight the climate crisis and protect biodiversity and the oceans.

The deal to be concluded in Biarritz at the weekend comes as the global fashion industry faces an unprecedented backlash from young people concerned that it is contributing more to climate change than the aeronautical and shipping industries combined. Without action, the industry could account for a quarter of the world’s carbon budget by 2050.

The issue is soaring up the agenda, with models on the catwalk at London fashion week next month set on a collision course with campaigners from Extinction Rebellion who want the event scrapped in the face of the climate emergency.

Growing numbers of young people are turning away from fast fashion towards reuse and resale sites such as Depop in the UK, Thredup and The RealReal in the US and YCloset in China. The secondhand market is expected to overtake fast fashion in the next few years and be 50% bigger than it by 2028, according to a report by market analysts GlobalData for Thredup.

The surge in environmental concern is forcing brands to accelerate sustainability plans and club together to bring about change not only in stores but with the factories and suppliers they share around the world.

Last month Inditex, the world’s third-largest apparel company, announced that all of its collections would be made from 100% sustainable fabrics before 2025, the first international high street store to make such a commitment. It is switching to renewable energy and pledging to send zero waste to landfill by 2025.

The UK parliament’s environmental audit committee investigation into sustainable fashion has also prompted action, despite the government rejecting a recommendation of a 1p per garment tax to fund better textile recycling schemes.

The committee’s report published in February named and shamed brands such as Boohoo, JD Sports, Sports Direct and TK Maxx, which had been slow to take action: failing to use sustainable cotton, collect used clothing or sign up to the government-backed sustainable clothing action plan (Scap).

Scap, whose nine large retail signatories including Next, M&S, Primark and Asos have committed to reducing their water use, carbon footprint and waste sent to landfill by 15% by 2020, said it had seen a notable increase in inquiries about joining up.

With the spotlight shining on the fashion industry, Primark, one of the flag-bearers for the kind of one-use fast fashion so heavily criticised by environmental activists, is experimenting with clothing recycling bins at its new store in Birmingham and has pledged to introduce a full scheme this year. It has also launched sustainable cotton jeans and eco-friendly glitter.

Giorgina Waltier, sustainability manager for H&M in the UK and Ireland, said: “There has definitely been a significant change in people’s attitudes towards sustainability and fashion in the last 12 to 18 months, with a real sense of urgency around these issues and a definite demand from consumers for more action and greater transparency from brands.”

H&M, the Swedish group that also owns the Cos, & Other Stories, Monki and Weekday brands, is aiming to have 100% recycled or sustainably sourced materials by 2030, up from 57% now. It is also testing out a free mending service.

Marie-Claire Daveu, chief sustainability officer at Kering (whose boss François-Henri Pinault, was asked by French president, Emmanuel Macron to help pull together the G7 fashion-industry deal) said the international fashion pact would enable global retailers to share best practice and ideas and combine their buying power to push for change right back to the agricultural practices involved in supplying raw materials.



“Many companies have taken the initiative but if they do things on their own it has less impact on the ground than if they work together,” said Daveu. She said the group could combine efforts to find solutions to problems such as effective recycling of textiles and fibres for garments that can’t be worn again.

“More and more customers and clients, generation Z and millennials, are expecting brands to act,” she said. “Listed companies also find more and more investors and financial analysts are taking factors like climate change into account on risk management. Chief executives and designers are also citizens of the world and very conscious that they have an important role to play in one of the most important issues of our century.”

“It’s not an option, it’s now a duty of running a global company.”

Feeling green: the brands bringing social consciousness into fashion Read more

But there are fears that the G7 pact will only add complexity and confusion: there are already many groups involved in sustainability, including the Sustainable Apparel Coalition, Global Fashion Agenda and Common Objective, a private enterprise that recently took over the former Ethical Fashion Forum, which was run as a charity.

Several retail and sustainable fashion experts told the Guardian they were concerned that the array of standards and global groups which brands and their suppliers were now expected to sign up to could divert resources from actual action.

“It’s great what Macron is doing,” said one big retailer who has held back from signing up to the G7 pact, referring to the fact that it was the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who asked Kering’s boss, François-Henri Pinault, to help pull together the G7 fashion industry deal. “But our responsibility is not to just sign something and the job is done. It is fine to say stuff but actually doing stuff is what’s important. Resources can be consumed by meetings. Let’s keep the balance on delivering.”

David Moon, of Scap,said global initiatives served to get big company bosses focused on environmental issues but he said “national action like Scap can really drive change. We can [muster] capital investment and ensure people are measuring and managing change.”

The UK government has backed an extension to Scap when it winds up next year and the new deal is expected to involve more retailers and to take steps towards developing industry-wide systems to recycle and reuse textiles and fibres.

Most big retailers now agree they have to adapt to survive. Waltier said: “Our planet doesn’t have the resources available to facilitate the linear production model that the vast majority of the fashion industry operates and therefore systemic change is the only option.”

"Greenpeace activists demonstrated in front of a Zara in Nice, France, to protest against hazardous chemicals in clothing, Nov. 24, 2012. Greenpeace's Detox campaign has exposed links between textile manufacturing and toxic water pollution in China.Fast fashion is a ""grow or die"" business. And fast fashion continues to export this western consumerism into the Global South: this could have disastrous consequences. This is the paradox at the heart of western consumerist culture and one that goes beyond fast-fashion industry. Neoliberal capitalist economies require continuous consumption and define success through growth — concepts at odds with sustainability. Business growth must be decoupled from resource use.The global population is set to grow by another two billion people in the next 30 years. To make a dent in the climate crisis, we have to cut emissions by more than 55 per cent in the next 10 years. The current carbon footprint of the fashion industry is over eight per cent of total global greenhouse gas emissions, larger than all international travel. Therefore, to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, including the 2C global temperature target, the fashion industry must play an active role in changing how they operate, source, manufacture, distribute and approach the market. It's not as simple switching out current textiles or packaging for more sustainable versions. Solutions to sustainability must include cultural change.How many wears does your clothing give you?Even when a garment is produced using all sustainable materials, there are still many problems. Cheap costs and speedy production are why we still have labour issues like sweatshop conditions.Zara has 1,800 suppliers in its supply-chain but does not disclose how often it audits individual suppliers per year to ensure compliance. If a garment is made to withstand only a couple months of wear — it is a massive waste of resources to produce that garment. Fast fashion doesn't nudge consumers towards more responsible consumption behaviours because that would ultimately hurt their bottom line. I would have more faith in the sustainability initiatives by large fashion companies if they started to introduce alternative sustainable business model practices. One small step could be to offer repair or tailoring services. Tailoring creates clothes that fit impeccably, subsequently increasing their emotional value. I believe that when garments fit well and are flattering to our body, we love them, and we keep them longer. For the benefit of the earth and humanity, large brands need to look at how to move away from their continuous offerings of weekly new products. If these kind of changes were to occur, I would start to believe Zara and other fashion brands had good intentions to curb climate change.

"Image caption The Finnish university has found a way to turn birch trees from its forests into material for clothes

If you're struggling for an original Christmas present - how about a wooden dress?

At a recent state gala, Finland's first lady wore a dress made from the country's birch trees.

But there was nothing frivolous about why she chose the dress - she wore it to support a new technology which could reduce the environmental damage caused by the fashion industry.

The dress worn by Jenni Haukio, a poet and wife of the president, was created by academics at Finland's Aalto University using a new sustainable technology called Ioncell.

The academics say the process is more environmentally-friendly than cotton and synthetic fibres and makes use of wood that would otherwise be wasted.

In eastern Finland's forests, there is a thinning process of removing some trees to make room for others to grow - and these smaller birch trees are now becoming the source for clothing.

Off the peg

This process creates textile fibres from materials like wood, recycled newspaper, cardboard and old cotton textiles, which can be turned into dresses, scarves, jackets and even iPad cases.

Image caption The recycled clothes have been designed by students at the university

Prof Pirjo Kaariainen of Aalto University is pleased with the feedback on the dress.

""It was designed by a young fashion and design student here at Aalto who wanted to give respect to Finnish nature and to the country's tradition of strong women.""

Prof Kaariainen says the fibre works well for clothing because it is ""soft to touch, it has a lovely sheen and falls beautifully"".

There are growing calls for the fashion industry to urgently reduce its damaging effects on the environment.

Sustainable fashion

The industry causes 10% of global carbon emissions and uses nearly 70 million barrels of oil each year to make polyester fibres, which can take more than 200 years to decompose.

Plastic microfibres from synthetic clothing are part of the problem of human-made materials that wash up along ocean shores.

Image caption Finland's first lady, Jenni Haukio, has worn a dress made from recycled trees

Campaigners are calling for consumers to buy new clothes less often, but changing consumer behaviour is difficult when fashion companies promote new lines every season.

Making clothes from sustainable materials could be a more realistic alternative.

Although Ioncell was developed by chemists and engineers at Aalto and Helsinki universities, Prof Kaariainen says it was important that the dress was made by designers so that people would want to wear it.

""People want garments that look good and make them feel good, so there is no choice but for the design to be good,"" she says.

""We need to make a systemic change where sustainable materials are embedded in the system and people can easily buy beautiful and comfortable garments which don't cause environmental problems.""

Re-thinking fashion

Finland's first lady is not the first famous wearer of Ioncell - France's President Macron wore a scarf made from recycled blue jeans when he visited Aalto in August.

Image caption President Macron of France wore a scarf made from the recycled material on a visit to Finland

Ana Portela, a fashion designer who promotes sustainable fabrics says consumers will be persuaded to try sustainable fashion if it is worn by influential people.

""This dress is not a high street design but it definitely fulfilled its purpose and it is important that people like the first lady advocate for more sustainable options and push new innovations,"" she says.

She says consumers must ""lead the revolution"" by using their purchasing power to incentivise companies to produce sustainable clothing lines.

""We need to take a different approach to our understanding of what is fashion,"" she says.

""This could be buying second hand-products, products with a certified origin, using more efficient natural fibres like hemp, buying a filter bag for your washing machine to stop microfibres entering the water system or pressuring companies to do better.""

The Aalto team aim to have a pilot production line for the new fibre by 2020 and hope that such clothing, made from recycled birch trees, will be available to buy for Christmas shopping lists in 2025.

"We’d love to hear your thoughts about the environmental and ethical impact of ‘fast fashion’, and how we as individuals and nations can rethink attitudes to shopping

In the next episode of our We Need to Talk About podcast, we’ll be exploring how an individual can rethink their relationship to clothes and make easy choices towards sustainable shopping. We’ll be looking at the psychological cycles of buying, as well as the changes that need to come from government level. We want to gather questions from readers and supporters who are experts in related fields, but also those who have personal experiences or reflections to share. In particular we’re looking for positive solutions-based ideas about how we can improve the situation.

Lucy Siegle, MP Mary Creagh, and others will be discussing this issue in our next recording. To share your questions, reflections and ideas with them, please email us at:

… providing your question along with your name, age, and country of residence.

The fashion industry is big business. In the UK alone, it was worth £32 billion in 2017. According to consultants McKinsey, the global apparel, fashion and luxury industry outperformed all other market indexes in profitability between 2003 - 2013, “outstripping even high-growth sectors like technology and telecommunications”. It is believed one in six people on the planet work in the fashion supply chain, yet it remains one of the most polluting industries on the planet. In our next podcast, we want to ask: How can the fashion industry as a whole be held accountable, and what role can the government, and we as individuals, play in improving this growing issue?

The UN says that given the growth in global population, by 2050 the equivalent of almost three planets could be required to provide the natural resources needed to sustain current lifestyles. Huge numbers of brands still depend on vastly underpaid workers to make clothing meet consumer demand. In 2013’s Rana Plaza tragedy, a Bangladesh textile factory collapsed, killing 1,134 people, despite warnings over the safety of the structure. It transpired that the building housed five garment factories supplying global fashion brands.

In addition to concerns over worker safety, the fashion industry has come under scrutiny for its impact on the environment. During just one washing cycle, a washing machine can leach up to 1000,000 microfibres into our waterways, rivers and oceans, and be consumed by fish, other marine life, and in turn, humans. And clothing is often not recycled – it is believed that Americans dispose of about 12.8m tons of textiles annually. In the UK every year, £140 million worth of used but still wearable clothing (350,000 tonnes) goes to landfill. From an environmental perspective, fast fashion is disastrous.

The Green Carpet Challenge (GCC) is one example of how celebrities are using their influence to affect change. This pioneering organisation was founded by Livia Firth and Lucy Siegle in 2010, when Siegle challenged Firth to attend all her red carpet commitments in sustainable clothing. At first she wore ‘ethical’ designers, to the ceremonies, including Orsola de Castro, who designed a dress made out of textile waste for the 2010 Oscars. Now, the business has expanded and the pair work with some of the world’s most famous design houses to help them implement more environmentally responsible business practices.

Other prototype solutions that are being trialled include: solar textiles, garments made using biological catalysts which are capable of ‘eating’ plastic, 3D printing for clothes, compostable clothes made from materials such as orange fibre and apple leather, and lab-grown leather. But can any of these offer the practical and long-term solution we need? Is it a case of changing our shopping habits, and buying more second-hand clothes? Or should we be aiming for shifts on a bigger scale? How can we put pressure on fashion houses to implement change? And which is the most promising of the scientific innovations in this area?

We look forward to hearing from you!

"Australian fashion week is in full swing in Sydney. Models stomping down the Carriageworks runways in bikinis and tiny dresses, editors in precarious heels rushing between shows while hordes of outrageously-attired influencers vie for attention from photographers. Alongside all the fabulousness, there’s big business being done as part of this $28.5bn industry. Buyers, from the biggest department stores to small boutiques around the world, are in town to see and order. At least that’s the way it’s supposed to work.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‘Customers are looking for products that match their own personal values and don’t compromise on things like the environment or human rights,’ says Jade Sarita Arnott, Arnsdorf designer. Photograph: Arnsdorf

But the fashion industry is tough, particularly in Australia. Once a fashion week darling, Australian designer Kym Ellery closed the local arm of her business last month. She’s not alone: labels like Lover, LifeWithBird, Metalicus and Willow have all disappeared recently. High street brands also struggle: Oroton, Marcs, David Lawrence, Sambag, Espirit and more have all closed their doors.

Clickbait fashion! You won’t believe what brands are doing now Read more

These businesses face big challenges, including the high cost of local manufacturing, international competition, both in the shopping malls and online, and fickle customers. And then there’s the dilemma at the heart of the industry – its business model is based on continuously increasing sales – yet this is neither sustainable or ethical in our world of depleted resources.

So some designers are doing things differently: rethinking the business model and coming up with better ways of doing things.

There was a time when Jade Sarita Arnott fitted the classic mould. Her label Arnsdorf was launched in 2006 and rapidly became a critical and commercial success. But in 2012 she quit, exhausted and out of pocket. In 2017, she returned –but this time she was determined that Arnsdorf would take a different path. She wanted to create “transformative and purposeful clothing”.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‘The reason for our success is our genuine ethical and sustainable values mixed with our design aesthetic,’ says Kowtow designer Gosia Piatek. Photograph: Kowtow

Now the clothes are made in the brand’s own Melbourne factory where Arnott can make sure every part of the process is ethical. Small batches of each design are made to reduce waste, and most are sold online, with all deliveries carbon-neutral. Even better, the label offers free tailoring and repairs to encourage clients to build a lasting wardrobe. This “sustainable luxury” is what clients want, says Arnott. “Customers are looking for products that match their own personal values and don’t compromise on things like the environment or human rights. Customers are also demanding higher quality of goods as the novelty of bingeing on fast fashion wears off.”

Gosia Piatek has long focused on sustainable fashion. The New Zealand designer started Kowtow in 2007, working only with fair trade organic cotton to make the entire production chain, from seed to garment, traceable. Her elegantly designed clothes have a devoted following, and Piatek says there’s a real opportunity now for conscious business. “The reason for our success is our genuine ethical and sustainable values mixed with our design aesthetic. Old school businesses that are not willing to be nimble and change with the times may be struggling, but this does not apply to us.” Kowtow is sold around the world including New York, Stockholm, Tokyo, Paris, Dubai and has a flagship store in Wellington.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Ultimately customers will choose brands with integrity, says designer Jacinta James. Photograph: Jacinta James

Jacinta James didn’t sacrifice luxury in the name of sustainability when she launched her eponymous brand in 2015. Instead she focused on “slow fashion”. Her sophisticated designs are presented as “volumes” of a collection. “Each volume is a building block on the previous, this continuity is to ensure that styles are valued beyond time and trend.”

The designs are also versatile. “Tops and dresses can often be reversed for a variation on a neckline, or knit skirts can also become strapless dresses, etc.” Everything is handmade locally and to order, while the fabrics are natural, including silk, wool and sustainable viscose. The brand also repurposes existing high quality fabrics where possible.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Good Day Girl designers Alexia Spalding and Sophie Toohey. Photograph: Justin Alexander/Good Day Girl

Fashion industry veterans Alexia Spalding and Sophie Toohey also joined the slow fashion movement when they launched Good Day Girl. They design two collections a year - spring/summer and winter - which are presented as trunk shops in their Sydney salon or through digital appointments. Everything is made to order and delivered in around eight weeks, avoiding waste. “We believe that producing less is the most sustainable way to manufacture. We rely on less resources across the supply chain, from the production of the fabric to the making of the garments - we produce as close to zero waste as we can”, says Toohey. And they get to work closely with each customer to understand what they really need and want - something they both enjoy.

The designers behind footwear label Twoobs found their way into the industry in an unusual way but it paid off. Jess and Stef Dadon launched their animal-friendly sandals off the back of their lifestyle site How Two Live. They were very connected to those who visited their site through social media, so they understood what they wanted as customers.

The planet will not be able to handle much more if we continue operating as we are Kowtow designer Gosia Piatek

The popular shoes are now sold internationally. The sisters believe customers want brands they can connect with: “People are no longer interested in just buying products for the sake of it, they want to know what a brand stands for, and that there’s meaning behind what they’re creating.” Maintaining that trust is the key to their success: “If an amazing opportunity came up to collaborate on a leather bag, it would be a no-brainer for us to say no.”

Maggie McGowan and Laura Egan stepped right out of the fashion mainstream with their label Magpie Goose. Launched in 2016, the social enterprise purchases textiles from remote Aboriginal arts centres, which are then made into colourful clothes in Sydney and sold online and in pop-up stores. The label is still small but McGowan sees this as a plus: “The smaller, innovative brands seem to be able to adapt, build a loyal following and lead the way a bit, compared to the bigger, more established brands who are struggling to keep up [for example] with ethical production, inclusive styles [and] sizing, fair wages etc.”

Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‘People are no longer interested in just buying products for the sake of it, they want to know what a brand stands for,’ says Twoobs designers Jess and Stef Dadon. Photograph: Twoobs

It was focused on sustainability from the start. “We encourage people to buy a piece they love – and wear it to death. We use only natural fibres, which means that at the end of the life of the clothing, it decomposes (after being passed down the line for many wears). We make a small run of limited edition prints, and aim to sell them out, ensuring there is no dead or wasted stock.”

Sustainability has become a focus for the fashion industry recently: it is one of the biggest culprits when it comes to pollution and unethical manufacturing practices.

But while there has been some progress, all the designers we spoke to said more must be done. Piatek was critical of some high street brands who are “green washing” because it’s good marketing. “We are at a critical point and the planet will not be able to handle much more if we continue operating as we are, so how can we justify virgin polyester fabrics in production in 2019? The fashion industry should be ashamed of itself for being one of the world’s largest polluters, whilst enslaving the people who work in it.”

Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‘We encourage people to buy a piece they love - and wear it to death,’ says Maggie McGowan, here with Magpie Goose co-founder Laura Egan. Photograph: Sarah Mackie/Magpie Goose

They are hopeful that things could be done differently to build a truly sustainable industry. “Sustainability will become a need-to-have not just a nice-to-have, and we think a big part of this will be driven by consumer demand, which is awesome,” says Dadon.

Ultimately customers will choose brands with integrity, says James: “In a busy, saturated world, it’s crucial that what we offer is of creative value and is meaningful: to help dispel the throwaway culture and re-engage with the true craft of making clothing.”

But Toohey says there needs to be more investment in the industry for it to survive. “Without investment in the manufacturing industry, we will continue to lose makers and skills which will mean it will be harder for independent designers to start-up and flourish. Australia is full of creative wonder – we need to nurture this and create the back end (manufacturing) to allow it to flourish. In an ideal world we would be a hub for fashion tech and manufacturing innovation but without financial backing – that is not going to happen.”"
"Take a look at your clothing tags. The brands may be different, but in all likelihood, they share one unfortunate trait: They're eco-unfriendly.

The problem is that the materials we use the most — cotton and synthetics — are damaging the planet. Growing cotton means heavy use of pesticides, chemicals and water. Even when it is grown organically, cotton still uses a lot of water.

The production of synthetic fibres is also energy intensive and contributes to greenhouses gases, and these items take hundreds of years to biodegrade.

What's more, we consume a lot of it. Researchers from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation report that clothing production almost doubled between 2000 and 2015. Their research also shows that the number of wears an individual item gets is steadily decreasing. They blame fast fashion — quick-turnaround clothes, at lower prices.

Experts say that varying the materials used to make clothes is crucial to changing the fashion industry's impact on the environment.

""We have to introduce other fibres that aren't so reliant on water, that are freer in their growth so we're not robbing our own resources,"" said Rachel Miller, studio head of textiles at Sheridan College in Oakville, Ont. ""Because we can't keep going like this.""

Hemp, flax and nettle, for example, are all low-impact alternatives — they can be grown even in areas with poor soil and are biodegradable. Miller said she is seeing ""a higher dependency"" on such lower-impact fibres from clothing makers.

One such company is Canadian/Australian startup ANARA, which is making hemp-based denim. Co-owner Jamieson McCormack said other brands ""were coming out with their own denim, recycled denim, and Japanese fabrics that are quite sustainable. But nobody had done anything with hemp.""

McCormack said reducing the environmental impact of clothing production is a top priority for ANARA. ""We want to be an example that you don't have to take the easy route,"" she said.

Hemp fabric is more durable than cotton and has antibacterial properties. (ANARA)

'Non-conventional' fibres can be the key

McCormack explained that hemp does not deplete the soil of its nutrients as quickly as cotton. That's partly because of the intense irrigation required to grow cotton. Water carries away nutrients from the soil in runoffs, making it harder to grow future crops.

Hemp also uses less water. A study by the Stockholm Environment Institute shows that one kilogram of cotton — enough to make a T-shirt and a pair of jeans — uses almost 10,000 litres of water. One kilogram of useful hemp fibre requires about 3,000 litres."
"Sustainability is the hottest word in consumer goods right now. From compostable coffee cups to eco-friendly cosmetics, companies are touting their sustainable products, and consumers are feeling good about buying them.

But for the apparel industry, sustainability is doubly important. As Lindsey Tramuta reported in the February issue of Fortune, the fashion industry has more than doubled its production output in the last 15 years as “fast fashion” has boomed in popularity. That’s adding to an already sizable problem with clothing waste: 85% of discarded apparel in the U.S. ends up in landfills even though 95% of it could be recycled, according to the Secondary Materials and Recycled Textiles Association. And then there are issues related to production itself, from the vast amounts of water used to grow and process virgin cotton, to pesticides—the cotton industry uses more than any other crop—to the hazardous chemicals used in dyes.

The human element is another issue in apparel: farmers, textile workers, and those who make the end product often don’t get a fair wage for their efforts. Despite industry efforts to improve their supply chain, much of the world’s fast fashion is made in poor conditions for even poorer pay.

Few mainstream brands are tackling these problems quite as head on as Patagonia—the trendy outdoor brand known for its down jackets. From its founding in 1973, Patagonia has been outspoken on environmental issues, and has practiced what it preaches.

“Our new mission statement is: ‘We’re in business to save our home planet’,” says Cara Chacon, vice president of social and environmental responsibility at Patagonia. “’We work with our design team, at the concept phase, to make clothing that is sustainable. That could mean using recycled polyester instead of virgin polyester. We’re actually getting close to 70% of our product line using recycled or renewable fiber. That’s something we’re really proud of.”

Patagonia says it is on track to be carbon neutral by 2025—including its entire supply chain and company-operated retail. Its eventual goal is to be carbon positive and capture more carbon than it emits. Some of the ways the company plans to do this include sourcing carbon-positive cotton from India, which Chacon says the farmer can use to receive carbon rebates from the Indian government; increasing the amount of recycled materials in its products; and investing in renewable energy.

It’s not just established brands like Patagonia that are trying to shrink their environmental footprint. The ecological impact of the fashion industry has inspired a swath of startups to imagine a better way of doing things.

“I realized I was part of a systemic malaise doing considerable harm,” says Susan Correa, founder of children’s wear brand Art+Eden. Correa spent more than two decades in the fashion industry working for some of the world’s largest retailers. Observing up close how garments are made inspired her to help solve the problem. “I knew I could make a difference and build a business.”

Correa says parents are concerned about the food they are putting in their children’s bodies, and many are getting much more vigilant about the clothes touching their bodies. Art+Eden uses organic cotton—made without pesticides—and dyes. “The skin is the largest organ in the body, and it’s porous,” she says. “It matters what’s touching it.”

Importantly for sustainability to—well—sustain itself, both companies are finding it’s also good business.

“We’re in this to show that business can be a force for good, and that you can run a healthy, profitable business and change the world for the better,” says Patagonia’s Chacon. “We have proven time and time again that you don’t have to see sustainability and making a profit as two separate things. It’s outdated thinking to think otherwise.”

Likewise Correa says it’s vital that her company, which uses some of its revenues to provide school meals in her native India, is profitable business. “My number one focus is making the business successful, that provides the funds to do good. I always say I’m a venture-social, not a social-venture. Business comes first.”"
"Fast fashion and eco-friendly fashion finds are all the rage right now. Fast-fashion retail brands like H&M and Zara manage to get runway looks to its customers in half the time and at half the cost. Consumers can rely on these brands as an one-stop shop for women's and men's apparel to footwear. But economy friendly brands and fashion sustainability is becoming increasingly popular amongst millennials. Do you shop fast fashion or prefer eco-friendly brands?

PERSPECTIVES

Zara has mastered the art of fast-fashion. It may not design its clothing with the economy in mind, but the brand always has a sale or you can count on Zara to be convenient and offer fair price points. Fans of the store say you can't argue with its price to quality ratio, ability to provide seasonal trends or staple pieces. According to Bustle, the store is a dream for frugal shoppers with style:

Both trendy and timeless, Zara is for girls who like fashion but loathe recyclable trends. Don't get me wrong: if metallic is ""in"" Zara will throw a metallic skirt into the seasonal collection. But unlike other High Street brands, Zara's wardrobe is built around hero pieces, and trend items are treated as cheap and transient. It's a formula that works, especially for more frugal customers like myself. So if all the other stores went into liquidation tomorrow (I was going to say burned down, but that's like, way harsh Tai), and stopped doing business, I would just shrug and get on with it. Because all I need in my life is a little Zara.

Eco-friendly, sustainable fashion or even slow fashion as it is sometimes called refers to environmental and labor-friendly brands. Some sustainable fashion brands may not produce as much product or as quickly as fast fashion brands, but the designs consider the environment first and typically don't outsource their labor to other countries. Brands like Allbirds, KITX and Reformation all pride themselves in being sustainable brands.

Ugo Mozie is a fashion activist and helps brands find sustainable solutions to their problems. He spoke to The Tylt and says sustainable fashion is extremely important because it will keep the population here the longest:

""Brands like Allbirds that use hemp products and recycled products to make shoes is extremely important,"" says Mozie. ""We are in a day in age where there is a huge population of people who can't afford to wear leathers and wear furs so why not make something we can all enjoy, are comfortable with and puts something positive back into the environment.""

Brands like Allbirds, KITX and Reformation all pride themselves in being sustainable brands.

Ugo Mozie is a fashion activist and helps brands find sustainable solutions to their problems. He spoke to The Tylt and says sustainable fashion is extremely important because it will keep the population here the longest:

""Brands like Allbirds that use hemp products and recycled products to make shoes is extremely important,"" says Mozie. ""We are in a day in age where there is a huge population of people who can't afford to wear leathers and wear furs so why not make something we can all enjoy, are comfortable with and puts something positive back into the environment.""

"Consumption of new clothing is higher in the UK than any other European country, a House of Commons’s committee has revealed - as it said it had written to chief executives of the UK’s ten leading fashion retailers to find out what steps they are taking to reduce the environmental and social impact of the clothes and shoes they sell.

Westminster’s environmental audit committee said evidence already submitted by the Textiles Recycling Association showed that the UK uses 26.7kg per capita. This compares to a consumption rate in the next-highest countries of 16.7 in Germany and 16 in Denmark - and just 12.6 in Sweden.

The committee said that although there has been a renewed interest in recent years in clothing made in Britain, there are concerns that the demand for fast fashion is fuelling the need for quick turn-arounds in the supply chain, leading to poor working conditions in UK garment factories.

Environmental audit committee chair Mary Creagh MP said: “The way we design, produce and discard our clothes has a huge impact on our planet. Fashion and footwear retailers have a responsibility to minimise their environmental footprint and make sure the workers in their supply chains are paid a living wage. We want to hear what they are doing to make their industry more sustainable.”

The companies the Environmental Audit Committee has written to are: Marks and Spencer Group, Primark Stores, Next Retail, Arcadia Group, Asda, Tk Maxx and HomeSense, Tesco, JD Sports Fashion, Debenhams and Sports Direct International.

Peter Andrews, head of sustainability at the British Retail Consortium said: “As our population grows, more people are buying more clothes, which does impact the environment. However, because of the efforts of leading fashion retailers, many of the clothes that we now buy have lower individual environmental impacts. This has been achieved through sourcing more sustainable materials, designing products that are made to last, and encouraging customers to return unwanted clothes for reuse.

“Looking ahead, we know more needs to be done. Clothing production is a global market place and the best answers to its environmental and social impacts will be achieved with collaborative global actions.”"
"The apparel and footwear industries together account for more than 8 percent of global climate impact, greater than all international airline flights and maritime shipping trips combined.



The challenge to reduce carbon emissions offers the fashion industry an opportunity for its players do what they do best -- be creative.



Eco-friendly fashion pioneers from Stella McCartney to Rent the Runway to the RealReal are creating new reuse and resale models of doing business.



Conspicuous consumption is out -- and circular fashion is in. No, the term doesn't refer to round patterns or silhouettes but to extending the lifecycle of well-made garments and recycling their materials into new items.

This trend is gaining traction as both designers and consumers become increasingly aware of -- and startled by -- the outsize toll linear clothing production takes on the environment. ""Fashion's carbon impact is much larger than the industry's GDP. It's taking up more than its fair share of impact on the planet,"" said Elizabeth L. Cline, author of the forthcoming book ""The Conscious Closet: The Revolutionary Guide to Looking Good While Doing Good.""

One of the problems: fast fashion

The meteoric rise of ""fast fashion"" -- the business of quickly turning around new collections, often at lower prices to encourage consumption -- in particular is proving to be toxic for the environment. Linear systems use large quantities of nonrenewable resources, and more than half of these styles get tossed within a year, according to McKinsey's 2016 report ""Style that's sustainable: A new fast fashion formula.""

The apparel and footwear industries together accounted for more than 8 percent of global climate impacts -- the equivalent of 3,990 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2016, according to a report from Quantis. Total greenhouse gas emissions related to textiles production are equal to 1.2 billion tons annually -- more than those of all international flights and maritime shipping trips combined, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.

These challenges aren't insurmountable. Indeed, the crisis at hand represents an opportunity for industry players do what they do best -- be creative.

Some of the solutions: consignment and resale



Enter businesses like The RealReal, a thriving online and physical luxury consignment store valued at $450 million, according to research database PitchBook. Founded in 2011, its goal is to ""extend the life of luxury goods with the quality and craftmanship that make it possible for them to stay in circulation for longer,"" said Allison Sommer, the company's director of strategic initiatives.

Its clients recognize the value of investing in luxury and consigning their wardrobes as an alternative to constantly turning over their closets. A clientele survey shows that 57 percent of TRR consignors cited environmental impact and sustainability as key motivators to consign, and 32 percent of customers said they shop TRR as an alternative to ""fast fashion,"" the company told CBS MoneyWatch.

Online consignment opens doors for bargain hunters' paradise

""We are raising awareness of resale among shoppers and consignors, and what we see is shoppers understanding that investing in luxury pays off down the line,"" Sommers said. ""So that increases their motivation to spend in a smart way by perhaps spending more on an item originally but then understanding they can recoup that value when they choose to consign.""

It's a winning formula for consumers -- and the environment. The company created a ""sustainability calculator"" to estimate that for every purchase of a consigned item, a third of that item is not newly produced.

It also makes good business sense. ""We have 25 million pounds of clothing thrown out in the U.S. per year, and most of it has not reached its usable life. So these companies are capitalizing on that,"" author Cline said.

Supply chains and recyclability

Designer Stella McCartney, who has been dubbed ""the queen of sustainability"" for her eco-friendly fashion line, is widely considered to be a pioneer of the sustainable fashion movement. The clothing in her collections uses reengineered versus virgin cashmere, viscose fibers from forests, organic cotton and other responsibly sourced and recycled materials. She doesn't use any real fur or leather.

She has also partnered with TRR by offering consigners $100 in credit to her store. ""If every single second there's a truckload of fast fashion being incinerated or landfilled, then I'm a big, big believer in reusing that and [participating in] the circular economy,"" she told Vogue in February. ""It's the biggest compliment for your product to have an afterlife -- to me, that's luxury.""

Womenswear brand Dai, which makes versatile, comfortable workwear and launched its first collection in 2017, has been sustainable from its inception. Founder Joanna Dai designs timeless pieces intended to outlast trends, working with environmentally friendly fabrics and mills.

""Obviously I care about the environment. And I thought if I have a blank canvas to start a supply chain from scratch, I will -- in every way I can -- build it to help the environment or lessen our footprint,"" Dai told CBS MoneyWatch.

Eileen Fisher, Theory and Patagonia are among the brands that accept ""take backs"" of their own clothing in exchange for store credit. ""The single best thing we can do for the planet is keep our gear in use longer and cut down on consumption,"" Patagonia says on its website.

""The world's largest shared closet""

A crop of rental services -- including Rent the Runway -- are capitalizing on the gradual shift toward subscription rather than ownership models of consumption. Offered at a monthly fee, the services provides members with unlimited access to ""the world's largest shared closet.""

""Viewing fashion as a service -- as something we access instead of own -- is going to be a really important part of solving the environmental crisis that is fashion,"" author Cline said. ""Think about a generation of people expecting to be able to turn their closets over and follow fashion trends. Renting lets people kind of have it both ways.""

Rent the Runway CEO on expansion into Neiman Marcus in San Francisco

Fortunately, habits seem to be shifting. The resale market is expected to outpace fast fashion within 10 years, according to the Business of Fashion's 2019 report on The State of Fashion.

Prizing variety, affordability and sustainability, consumers increasingly choose to rent rather than own goods outright, according to the same report. This is true across a variety of categories, including music, TV and vehicles -- think Spotify, Netflix and ZipCar. ""This trend is partly driven by the young generation's hunger for newness, while embracing sustainability,"" the report said.

Cline underscored that no single solution is the answer and that efforts to preserve the environment complement one another. ""We really have to come at it from every direction. Fashion brands have to be looking at their supply chain and how they make clothes and use less water, less energy,"" she said. ""Consumers have to look at the way they're shopping and say, 'how can I shop more sustainably in a way that fulfills my need to look good and feel good about myself?'"""
"A leading fashion retailer website has launched a new feature to help customers shop consciously online.

The Iconic has introduced 'Considered', which is a new environmentally-friendly service that allows shoppers to seamlessly shop ethical sustainable fashion.

The game-changing initiative aims to make shopping easier for customers to make conscious purchasing decisions.

Using The Iconic's five 'Sustainability Credentials' categories, customers can filter and find products, allowing them to shop by their personal sustainability values.

The categories include animal friendly, community engagement, eco-production, fair production and sustainable materials.

The Iconic has introduced 'Considered' (left), which is a new environmentally-friendly service that allows shoppers to seamlessly shop sustainable fashion

The new service being offered by The Iconic is called Considered, which is the first of its kind from a major Australian and New Zealand retailer

The products have been made using at least one material or process that is better for humans, animals or the environment than conventional alternatives, or is from a brand that's making contributions to the community around us.

When customers shop, they will be able to refine their selection of their choice using a filter system, which is situated on the left side of the page where the current filter is located.

The new feature marks an important milestone in the websites sustainability and ethical sourcing journey, and highlights its commitment to helping customers make informed purchasing choices through education and accessibility.

The clothing retailer website has launched with over 6,400 products tagged with 'sustainability credentials' across more than 300 brands.

This game-changing initiative aims to demystify the complex and sometimes confusing world of sustainable fashion

Using The Iconic's five 'Sustainability Credentials' categories, customers can filter and find products holding sustainability credentials, allowing them to seamlessly shop by their personal sustainability values

Why was 'Considered' launched? - There will be more plastic than fish in the sea by 2050 - It will be 1000 years until each piece of not-recycled plastic decomposes - 6000 kilograms of textiles Australians put into landfill every 10 minutes - 60 per cent of species have become extinct since 1970 Source: The Iconic

The range includes products across womenswear, menswear, kidswear, sport, footwear and accessories from brands such as Outland Denim, R.M. Williams, Manning Cartell, Patagonia, Lee Matthews, Nobody Denim and Assembly Label.

'We developed Considered because we felt there was a need to provide our customers with clearer information at the point of sale and a gap in enabling customers to shop consciously with ease,' Head of Sustainability and Ethical Sourcing at The Iconic Jaana Quaintance-James said.

'Sustainability means different things to different people, and for many, understanding this space and its complexities can be overwhelming.

Considered marks an important milestone in the websites sustainability and ethical sourcing journey

The range includes products across womenswear, menswear, kidswear, sport, footwear and accessories from brands such as Outland Denim, R.M. Williams and Manning Cartell

The Iconic expects to grow the Considered assortment to more than 10,000 products in the short-term

'By simplifying sustainability credentials into five easy to understand categories, our customers now have the ability to shop by what's important to them.

'Concerned about climate change? Shop Eco-Production. Animal person? Shop Animal Friendly. Want to have a positive impact on society when you shop? Shop Community Engagement.'

The Iconic expects to grow the Considered assortment to more than 10,000 products in the short-term with new products holding sustainability credentials added daily.

'As a retailer, we have an important role in providing our customers with a wide and accessible assortment that empowers them to make conscious purchasing decisions,' CEO of The Iconic Erica Berchtold said.

'Liberating customers with the ability to shop by their personal sustainability values is a huge step for The Iconic as we design the future of retail through seamless and inspiring experiences.

'Considered is only the beginning of our commitment and we're excited to accelerate for further progress.'"
"Every second, the equivalent of a truckload of fabric is thrown into a landfill or burned, leaching chemicals (such as dye) or non-biodegradable synthetic fabrics (such as polyester) into the ground. Every year, roughly USD500 billion of barely worn clothing is discarded, even though manufacturing these items takes a tremendous toll on the environment – using coal and petroleum to create synthetic fibers and pesticides to grow natural ones, including cotton. At this rate, by 2050 the fashion industry will account for a quarter of the global average consumption of fossil fuels, according to a report published by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation in 2017.

Yet, of the nearly 100 million tonnes of textiles produced worldwide every year, a staggeringly small one percent, or 980,000 tonnes, is all that gets recycled. In 2018, roughly 143,000 tonnes – 15 percent of the global total – were recycled in the Italian city of Prato. This Tuscan city 24 km from Florence is the world's capital of post-consumer textile processing, which makes it very appealing for big brands in search of more sustainable production models.

""Since the mid-19th century, Prato has been recycling rags from all over the world with advanced technologies and investments in the most innovative machinery,"" explains Fabrizio Tesi, who co-owns Comistra with his sister Cinzia. This 100-year-old company in Prato produces fabrics containing 90 percent recycled textiles. Tesi is also president of A.S.T.R.I, the Italian Association of Recycled Textiles, founded two years ago to promote Italian excellence and Prato's nearly two centuries of transforming textile waste, especially wool, into resources. ASTRI came into being thanks to the efforts of entrepreneurs in the sector who were committed to quality regeneration. They have the support of the street vendors, wool mills, raw material traders and other workers who spin, dye and finish clothes in the most important textile district of Europe. Prato counts roughly 7,200 companies, almost 40,000 employees and a turnover of five billion euros (USD 5.6 billion) per year.

""From my grandfather Alfredo to my father Rolando and my mother Giovanna, our family has always had a strong vocation for innovation. This led us to create a factory that is unique in the world, where we regenerate and transform textile by-products and post-consumer materials into a fabric called 'mechanical wool' or 'Prato wool.' It's a recycled wool of very high quality created without new sheepskin, and that boasts the Global Recycled Standard certification,"" says Tesi.

Comistra sells its fabrics to large fashion brands such as Armani, Banana Republic, Zara and H&M, but the company is not alone. There are hundreds of other companies in the district committed to the regeneration of post-consumer materials. These include the Valfilo spinning mill, which produces carded yarn from recycled materials; the Intespra wool mill, which manufactures fabrics; the Manifattura Maiano, which processes textile waste to obtain insulation for sustainable construction; and startups such as Rifò, founded last year by Niccolò Cipriani, producing scarves and hats from recycled wool.

For Tesi and his colleagues, using waste materials was once embarrassing, but now they do it with pride: ""The fashion industry will be saved from an unsustainable production model only if it follows Prato's example,"" Tesi says.

In the age of conscious consumption, all major brands are facing the challenge of recycling and integrating eco-sustainable products into their collections. But they have a long way to go to reverse the wasteful trend caused by unsustainable industrial practices. ""It is necessary to completely revolutionize production systems, and to think about what comes after the end of a garment's life,"" Tesi says.

Last year, he also started making clothes in collaboration with the Brunelleschi Institute of Art, based on the principles of eco-design. These garments are designed to be easily repaired and regenerated, with cotton seams, non-toxic colors and natural fabrics, and without thermoadhesives or synthetic materials, which can compromise recycling. This is the idea behind international movements such as Fashion Revolution or Fashion for Good, platforms dedicated to triggering change in one of the most polluting sectors of manufacturing, starting with technologies and models that are at home in Prato.

Brands can opt for creative methods, like associating the superheroes with the fashion. Turn the favorite hero of your customer into the playful tactic. For instance, offer a superman leather jacket by using organic fabric and do your own kind of celebrity endorsement.



Follow cradle to cradle tactic

Well, this is mainly for consumers who wear clothes that could be harmful to the body. The thought might strike that how one can choose the toxic clothes? But, somehow, you all do unintentionally.

The cradle to cradle is the certification which is arranged to precise products that are usually made from the natural material and can be safely decomposed or re-used. Now, brands can cater to this technique by using the most excellent quality material which has a long-life effect, and customers also make sure to purchase the material which could be used excessively.



Apply zero waste technique

Who knew even zero could be valuable too! The zero-waste technique is highly applicable and useful, specifically in the fashion industry. There are multiple techniques associated with the practice of ""zero waste,"" which brands usually can implicate.

Maybe some of the manufacturers do not know, and for those, we are here suggesting some tips through which this particular strategy could be implemented.

Try using your useless pieces of clothes by creating innovative designs. By this, brands can even save the production cost, and the consumer can produce complete new apparel.

If you have a pile of scrap fabric, then turn it into yarn. Then use it later in knitting the new collection.

There is also one more amazing idea of using the tiny leftover pieces. Guess what it is? The new brand tags! Oh yes, the manufacturers can use in creating new and amazing brand tags with leftover pieces.



Offer recycling programs

This is for both brands and customers. Being a part of a society, we all are equally responsible for maintaining and promoting the ""green environment"" culture. So, for this, work on arranging the recycling programs in which you can play on the ""give and take"" strategy.

The brands can ask consumers, by hitting the sentiment of a loyal customer, ask to bring back the old clothes and in return, give a certain amount of discount. Through this, the brands can recycle the material and can utilize it in the new collection. Also, this can even help in retaining potential customers. Isn’t it sounds like a fantastic idea?

To clear the image, here is the suggestion for brands! Since your customers are a huge fan of DC comics, then why not use this as your marketing strategy? Manufacture a customized captain America civil war leather jacket for your customers and offer it with a particular amount of discount. Enjoy this amazing idea by incorporating it in your ""give and take"" recycling program.

Let’s make the environment-friendly and promote the sustainability of fashion together! We know this combination might look quite weird but, if consider sensibly we actually can make a huge positive impact in our surroundings. Start practicing now! Be sure to mark your contribution and adapting to this new trend."

All of the apparel has been created by combining post-industrial cotton waste with recycled polyester to create fibres.

This manufacturing process saves energy, carbon dioxide, water and chemicals from being wasted.

Mango

Over the years, Spanish label Mango has declared its commitment towards eco-friendly fashion through its Take Action programme.

Its goal is for 50 per cent of the cotton used in its collections to be sourced sustainably by 2022.

“The future of fashion starts here.The views of consumers and sustainability awareness have evolved exponentially in recent years, in the same way that fashion has,"" said Daniel López, vice chairman of the company.

""Mango is committed to making its business model more sustainable.”

Reformation

Los Angeles-based fashion brand Reformation has become a firm favourite among fashion aficionados over the past few years, for both its stylish designs and commitment towards sustainable fashion.

The company states that it sources the ""most beautiful and sustainable fabrics possible"", explaining that it places materials in five categories depending on how much impact they're going to have on the environment.

""We tried to make these standards as holistic as possible, taking into consideration water input, energy input, land use, eco-toxicity, greenhouse gas emissions, human toxicity, availability and price,"" the brand outlines.

These five categories are: ""Allstars"", ""Better than most"", ""Could be better"", ""Don't use unless certified"", and ""Eww, never"".

Reformation's goal is to create at least three quarters of its clothing with materials in the top two categories.

Ksenia Schnaider

Ukrainian fashion label Ksenia Schnaider has been an advocate of sustainable fashion ever since it was founded in 2011 by husband and wife duo Ksenia and Anton Schnaider.

""As a designer, it’s important for me to create clothing not only with organic and vintage materials, but also to make them cutting-edge,"" Ksenia said.

""After all, people, especially from the post Soviet generation, are still not buying something just because it’s good for the planet. They want something that they believe is cool and what makes them look good.""

Boasting celebrity fans including Bella Hadid and Dua Lipa, Ksenia Schnaider has been making waves in the fashion industry over the past few years.

In September 2018, the brand unveiled its SS19 collection, demonstrating its prowess with denim for which it's become well-known.

H&M

Earlier this month, H&M announced that it is well on its way to using 100 per cent sustainable materials in the manufacturing process.

This year, 57 per cent of the fabrics used by H&M group are recycled or sustainably sourced.

This percentage has increased by 22 per cent in just one year.

The fashion label explained it hopes to be 100 per cent sustainable by 2030.

In 2013, the high street brand became the first fashion company to launch a clothing collection initiative across the globe.

From February 2013, customers have been able to hand in secondhand clothes in H&M stores.

Matt and Nat

As a vegan fashion label, Matt & Nat is paving the way for other brands by not using any animal products in its production line.

That's not all, as the company also uses recycled plastic bottles to create its bags.

""In addition to being vegan, sustainable materials are constantly sourced in design such as cork and rubber,"" the label states.

Celebrities who have expressed their support for Matt & Nat include Natalie Portman, Olivia Wilde, Charlize Theron and Tobey Maguire.

The label's SS19 collection uses an array of bold colours and sharp lines for a striking overall statement.

"Some are making that shift. Canadian Sarah Jean Harrison says sustainable clothing is typically more expensive, “but you can use your buying power to make small changes, even if you just reduce how much you buy from a fast-fashion outlet.”

Fashion companies should encourage people to keep their clothes longer and teach them how to properly wash them, some promoters of greener practices say. And that can require a shift in consumer thinking, too, given the way many people simply get tired of what’s hanging in their closet.

These are steps toward sustainability in an industry that, critics say, remains too reliant on a business model of disposability. But the old apparel often ends up merely shipped overseas or used to insulate homes.

Increasingly, sellers of clothing are also taking back clothing – for recycling, that is. Companies like H&M offer discounts on new apparel for drop-offs of used items. The idea is to keep old clothing out of landfills. Fair Harbor goes a step further, using recycled plastic bottles in its swimwear.

When Cayla O’Connell Davis launched Knickey, a subscription service for organic cotton underwear last year, she also started a recycling program for customers’ old underwear, allowing them to trade in worn-out undies for a new pair.

After just six months, Knickey has collected thousands of pairs and gained a steady customer base, and Ms. Davis calls it “a successful driver of business.”

But Ms. Davis, who has a master’s in sustainability from Parsons School of Design, also started the program to educate consumers about the impact their clothing choices have on the environment.

“Brands have a responsibility to not only provide wonderful offerings but to also think about garments beyond the customer’s use and where that ends up in the world,” she says.

That focus on sustainability is on the rise among apparel businesses and customers alike. The idea of recycling fabrics may be at best a partial answer to improving this industry’s often-damaging environmental profile. Yet the success of companies like Knickey is a sign of how consumer attitudes are shifting. And recycling itself can be a foot in the door of consumer consciousness.

“Consumers need to look at the total effect” of their choices, says Jeff Galak, associate professor of marketing for Carnegie Mellon University’s Tepper School of Business. If the goal is sustainability, he says, then rather than returning a product and buying a new one, it would be better to hold on to that shirt for another season.

Knickey, for its part, emphasizes the goal of sustainable materials and supply chains in its business, along with accepting boxes of no-longer-used undies.

Some shoppers show signs of critical rigor in their purchasing habits.

“I would want to see proof that the clothing is actually recycled and that companies aren’t just dumping them,” says Sarah Jean Harrison, a consumer who works as co-founder of the creative agency Peace Flag House in York, Ontario.

Five years ago, Ms. Harrison watched “The True Costs,” a documentary about the fashion industry, and stopped buying clothing. “I was always looking for cheap clothes that looked good and I realized I couldn’t be part of that anymore,” she says. For a long time she didn’t buy anything, then she started to buy vintage and secondhand clothes.

Now Ms. Harrison only buys clothes from sustainable brands. “I research the brand before I buy anything,” she says. She looks at the “about page” for information about where it’s made, who is making it, and where the company sources materials.

Ann Hermes/Staff Serge Lazarev, founder of Green Tree Textiles Recycling, displays recycled fabrics made into insulation at the Stuyvesant Town Greenmarket in New York City on June 9. Green Tree processes about 20,000 pounds of fabric per week for reuse or recycling.

Other resources for assessing sustainability include the Good On You App, which rates different fashion brands, and Remake’s Beginner’s Guide to Sustainable Fashion.

Knickey sends the used underwear to a local New York City nonprofit, Green Tree Textiles, where they’re sorted. Since underwear won’t be reused, it is recycled into insulation. When Green Tree receives clothing that can be worn again, it goes to for-profit and nonprofit partner organizations.

“Our mission is to keep it out of the landfill,” says Serge Lazarev, Green Tree’s director. Some of the clothes will end up overseas, but they’re sent by container ship so the impact on the environment is minimal, he says.

If anything, it’s now becoming the norm for U.S. clothing makers to offer textile recycling programs as an incentive to buy new clothing.

Fair Harbor is both a gatherer and a user of recyclable materials. It uses old plastic bottles to make new swimwear. It also encourages customers to recycle used swimwear by offering a 10% discount for each swimsuit sent back, for up to 30% off their purchase.

Ann Hermes/Staff Customers pass by the pop-up shop for Fair Harbor, an apparel company that produces swimwear made out of plastic bottles, in the Brookfield Place shopping center in New York City on June 9.

“We think it’s important to discard clothing correctly, and we’re happy to offer that service to our customers,” says CEO and co-founder Jake Danehy. Fair Harbor partners with 2ReWear, which is able to use about 45% of collected fiber “as is,” while the rest becomes things like home insulation, carpet padding, or wiping rags. However, most apparel that is reused “as is” is exported and sold in markets around the world.

Apparel firms ranging from J.Jill to H&M offer customer discounts for drop-offs of worn clothing. But experts say it can be difficult to know if collected items are actually recycled or just sent overseas to countries that may or may not want them.

“Giving a discount or coupon to shop is a marketing ploy,” says Ayesha Barenblat, founder of Remake, a nonprofit focused on educating shoppers. “We feel good about it but it doesn’t mean we’re actually recycling.”

The Sustainable Apparel Coalition developed the Higg Index to measure and score a company or product’s sustainability performance. But unlike the term “organic,” there is no government agency defining sustainability or how to measure textile recycling, says Professor Galak. To a large degree each company can decide on its own how it will measure its sustainability efforts.

“That doesn’t mean it’s incorrect or bad,” he says. “It just means there isn’t an easy way to compare.”

Even just the process of collecting and sorting clothing has an impact on the environment. A consumer must ship or bring it to a retailer, and then it’s transported again by truck or ship for processing and reuse.

“The current pace of fast fashion is still outpacing our growth in sustainability,” says Rachel Faller, creative director and founder of Tonlé, which makes clothing from scrap waste sourced from mass clothing manufacturers.

Fashion companies should encourage people to keep their clothes longer and teach them how to properly wash them, she says. Clothes should be washed with cold water and, instead of putting them in the dryer, hang them to dry to increase their lifespan and decrease their carbon footprint, Ms. Faller adds.

The culture of disposability stems partly from low-quality apparel, but it’s also because people get tired of what’s hanging in their closet.

Ultimately, sustainability means a shift in buying habits. For instance, when Ms. Harrison started buying clothing again, she began budgeting and thinking strategically, because sustainable clothing is typically more expensive.

“It isn’t a feasible choice for everyone,” she says. “But you can use your buying power to make small changes, even if you just reduce how much you buy from a fast-fashion outlet.”"
"Online retailers such as Boohoo and Missguided are booming, but critics say there is a hidden price

It comes in red, mustard and black, in sizes 6 up to 16; the bandeau bodycon minidress, is, according to the online retailer Boohoo, “perfect for transitioning from day to play”.

It is not so much the styling and colour, but the price of the £5 dress – reduced this week to just £4 – which attracts thousands of the thriving retailer’s 5 million UK customers to add it to their online shopping bag, click and pay.

Products and prices like these have driven Boohoo’s profits to a record £59.9m, bucking the trend of struggling high street fashion stores across the country.

Made in the UK, at factories in Leicester and Manchester, the £5 dress epitomises a fast fashion industry that pumps hundreds of new collections on to the market in short time at pocket money prices, with social media celebrity endorsement to boost high consumer demand. On average, such dresses and other products are discarded by consumers after five weeks.

Fast fashion is on the rampage, with the UK at the head of the charge Read more

Missguided, an online rival to Boohoo, which also sources products from Leicester, took the low pricing even further this week by promoting a £1 bikini, which proved so popular with customers that the website crashed.

But behind the price tag there is an environmental and social cost not contained on the label of such products. “The hidden price tag is the cost people in the supply chain and the environment itself pays,” said Sass Brown, a lecturer at the Manchester Fashion Institute. “The price is just too good to be true.”

A report by MPs into the fashion industry put it bluntly: in terms of environmental degradation, the textile industry creates 1.2bn tonnes of CO 2 a year, more than international aviation and shipping combined, consumes lake-sized volumes of water, and creates chemical and plastic pollution – as much as 35% of microplastics found in the ocean come from synthetic clothing.

Q&A What is fast fashion? Show Hide 'Fast fashion' is a phrase coined to describe inexpensive clothing produced rapidly by mass-market retailers in response to the latest trends. Critics say that the industry has a large carbon footprint, and creates water and air pollution. Clothes are often manufactured in poor working conditions. Garments are manufactured cheaply, and are expected to have a short life. One in three young women, the biggest segment of consumers, consider garments worn once or twice to be old. UK consumers sent 300,000 tonnes of textiles to be burned or dumped in landfill in 2018. Without rapid reform, the fashion industry - of which fast fashion is the dominant player – could be responsible for a quarter of the Earth’s carbon budget by 2050.

Socially, the booming fast fashion industry is often built on low wages paid to women working in factories abroad but also increasingly in the UK, in cities such as Manchester, Birmingham, London and Leicester. There is no evidence that factories in the Boohoo and Missguided supply chains pay illegal wages. However, some garment workers in Leicester are paid an average of £3 an hour – way under the national minimum wage – MPs heard in evidence.

MPs found that the Modern Slavery Act was not robust enough to stop wage exploitation at UK clothing factories. There was a lack of inspection or enforcement, allowing factories – none of which are unionised – to get away with paying illegal wages.

In the UK, we buy more clothes per person than any other country in Europe – five times what we bought in the 1980s, which creates 1.3m tonnes of waste each year, some 350,000 tonnes of which is dumped in landfill or incinerated.

Yet despite the overwhelming evidence gathered by the environmental audit committee (EAC), ministers this week rejected every recommendation for tackling abuses across the fashion industry, including a ban on incinerating or landfilling stock that can be recycled and a 1p charge on each garment to raise £35m a year for better clothing collection and sorting, a move supported by many in the industry.

Theresa May said in parliament the government already had measures in place, including a multimillion-pound grant scheme to help boost the recycling of textiles and plastic packaging.

But the response of the government was met with anger by many within the industry, where ethical fashion firms come up against others who produce at lower costs on the back of exploitative wage structures and environmentally damaging production models.

Phoebe English, the English fashion designer, said: “It is extremely alarming to see that our government has failed to grasp the true extent of the consequences of the fashion industry carrying on the way it is.

“It is a vastly damaging industry that has been spiralling unchecked for far too long. The Earth and the people on it are exploited and damaged at every single step of the chain, and this culminates with unimaginable mountains of unused excess stock or badly made broken waste clothing with nowhere to go other than landfill or incineration.”

English said it was up to the industry to pull together to regulate itself and urgently put an end to bad practice.

But others are less sure that voluntary measures will tackle what they say is a systemic power imbalance between brands and manufacturers, which leads to worker exploitation, or address the enormous environmental footprint of their trade.

“The knowledge is out there. We know the scale of those impacts and we know what some of the solutions are,” said Dr Mark Sumner, a lecturer in retail and fashion at the University of Leeds. “What we need is the government to come up with some clear policy, whether it’s around legislation, or voluntary initiatives to incentivise a change of behaviour by brands.”

With growing scrutiny of their business model, brands are beginning to promote an ethical face. This week Boohoo promoted its recycled brand For the Future, using fabrics made from synthetic waste saved from landfill.

“They are moving in the right direction, but this is a micro-percentage of their output,” said Brown.

While Boohoo is promoting its “green” credentials, repeated attempts by the trade union Usdaw to talk to workers at its delivery centre in the UK about union rights are being rebuffed by the company.

Mary Creagh, the chair of the EAC, said: “If brands want to be ethical, they should start by allowing a trade union into their premises rather than barring the door.”

Prof Nikolaus Hammer, associate professor in work and employment at Leicester University, carried out research into the fashion industry in Leicester, where he found employees working in appalling conditions, with no employment contracts, earning on average £3 an hour. It was the brands, he said, who held all the power over manufacturers to keep cutting their prices. “They will go to the manufacturer and say that person down the road can do it for 1p less, and they get the job,” he said.

He doubted that any greening measures by brands could make them ethical and sustainable while still fulfilling the model of fast fashion.

“The fundamental problem with much of fast fashion is that its social and environmental costs are not taken into account. The environmental costs of materials and fabric are mostly offshored. The production that takes place in the UK often only pays half the legal minimum wage.

“So who is accountable for water and chemical pollution abroad, precarious work and employment, the undercutting of compliant manufacturers, the pollution from delivery and lack of recycling at home? Brands might find it difficult to make £5 fast fashion dresses and be socially and environmentally sustainable.”

Carol Kane, the co-founder of Boohoo, told MPs the £5 dress was a “loss leader” drawing people to the website. She said the company employed three people in Manchester, three in Leicester, and 10 in China to carry out audits at their producer factories each month to ensure proper working practices.

Ways to take the environmental heat out of your fashion habit

Commit to wearing every piece 30 times. If we doubled the amount of time we kept clothes for, we would cut our fashion emissions by 44%.

Get smart about fibres. Cheap cotton and synthetics come with huge environmental footprints. Cotton uses unsustainable amounts of water and pesticide. Go for hemp blended with organic cotton and silk and lyocel/modal.

Treat cotton as a luxury fibre. Buy products certified as organic to be free of the pesticide burden and plan to keep them for years.

Wash clothes less often. The average laundry cycle releases hundreds of thousands of tiny fragments of plastic from synthetic fibres into waterways. Put jeans in the freezer and remove dirt when frozen. Fleeces have been shown to release the most plastic fibres.

Use a rental service. Peer-to-peer clothes and accessories rental services such as Hurrcollective.com and byrotation.co.uk aim to make use of some of the estimated £30bn worth of clothing left hanging in wardrobes. Other models include rent-the-runway, where membership gives you access to a number of pieces per month.

Delete shopping apps from your phone and swear off insta-shopping for fashion. Go shopping for clothes in a shop. Feel the fibre, interrogate the structure – especially the seams – and make sure it fits.

If dry cleaning is a must, use an eco-friendly process: conventional dry cleaning harms the soil, air and water. Use Johnson’s GreenEarth system or a dedicated eco cleaner such as Blanc.

Clothing brands and retailers should pay a penny on every garment they sell to fund a £35m annual recycling scheme.

That's the view of MPs, who say ""fast fashion"" is a major contributor to greenhouse gases, water pollution, air pollution and over-use of water.

And they urge the government to force clothing manufacturers to pay more towards collecting and recycling the waste they create.

Green campaigners argue the MPs' recommendations are really quite tame.

They're calling for an end to what they regard as the over-consumption of clothes.

Why is it fashionable to fret about fashion?

The fashion industry creates jobs worldwide and is said to be worth £28bn to the UK economy - but it is estimated to produce as many greenhouse gases as all the planes flying in the world.

Libby Peake, from the think-tank Green Alliance, told BBC News: ""One of the areas in which you could make a big difference in terms of your personal climate change impact is by reducing the amount of clothes you buy and keeping them for longer, then donating them to charity shops to keep them in the national wardrobe.""

The clothing trade consumes vast volumes of fresh water and creates chemical and plastic pollution. Manmade fibres are found in the bellies of creatures in the deep ocean.

The Environmental Audit Committee is also concerned about the use of child labour, prison labour, forced labour and bonded labour in the manufacture of clothes.

What is the industry doing to improve?

Some progressive firms now offer vouchers to shoppers taking back used garments. Marks & Spencer is among the leaders with its ""Plan A"" (because there's no Plan B).

The Global Recycling Council commends other firms, including Adidas, which will use only recycled polyester in all shoes and clothing by 2024; and Bottletop, which collaborated with Mulberry to launch a luxury bag made entirely from up-cycled materials (pre-used goods given extra value).

But the MPs say they've received inadequate commitments from JD Sports, Sports Direct, Amazon UK and Boohoo.

Spokespeople for some of these firms say they've taken other positive measures that haven't been properly registered by the MPs.

The MPs' report says it is an open secret that some fast-fashion factories in places such as Leicester are not paying the minimum wage - and the same firms are selling clothes so cheaply that they are being treated as single-use items.

The MPs say in the UK we buy more clothes per person than any other country in Europe - and a glut of second-hand clothing is swamping the market and depressing prices for used textiles.

Less than 1% of material used to produce clothing is recycled into new garments at the end of its life.

What can be done?

The committee chair, Mary Creagh, said: ""Fashion retailers should be forced to pay for the impact of their clothes when they're thrown away.""

She said the government should end throwaway fashion by incentivising companies that offer sustainable designs and repair services.

""Children should be taught the joy of making and mending clothes in school,"" she told us.

""We've got to help teenagers get an emotional attachment to their clothes instead of just wearing them a couple of times, getting photographed for Instagram and then chucking them away.

""All consumers have got to accept they need to buy fewer clothes - then mend them if they're torn, or rent or share them.""

The MPs conclude that a voluntary approach to improving the sustainability of the fashion industry is failing - with just 11 fashion retailers signed up to an agreement to reduce their water, waste and carbon footprints.

The committee says big retailers should be obliged by ministers to comply with high standards on the manufacture and recycling of clothing.

What does industry say?

Peter Andrews, from the British Retail Consortium (BRC), told us a growing number of stores were providing take-back schemes for unwanted clothes, and introducing stock made from recycled materials.

He didn't immediately reject the idea of a penny levy on clothes, and said retailers were willing to discuss how much of a role they should take in dealing with garments where they're thrown away.

He said: ""The sustainability of fashion is a high priority for BRC members - the transparency they have shown and the level of engagement with the inquiry reflects that.""

Sophie Gorton, an associate lecturer in textiles at Chelsea College, is a long-standing proponent of sustainable fashion.

She told us there were signs of hope that the industry was starting to change.

""For years we have asked the people who make textiles and yarn about the sustainability of their products and they just haven't wanted to know,"" she said.

""Now, suddenly, they're interested in what makes sustainable hemp or linen - they really want to think about it. It's a very exciting time.""

Will the MPs' solve the fast fashion problem?

Clare Farrell, a member of the climate group Extinction Rebellion and also a fashion lecturer, says the committee is aiming at the wrong target.

She admits it's better to recycle clothing fibres than throw garments away, but she says the real problem is consumer capitalism: people are putting an intolerable strain on resources simply because they're buying too many clothes in the first place.

""We need a change in mindset,"" she told us. ""Kids buy clothes, wear them a few times and then get rid of them. How do we tackle that? It's the nature of consumer capitalism and it's a very, very big problem for us all.

""Fashion is a big part of the economy, but we can't tackle the problems unless we admit that economy is killing us the way it's currently run.""

As the (Year of the) Dog passes the 2019 baton to the Pig, families from Beijing to Boston are celebrating by consuming everything from dumplings and dresses to digital gadgets. In China, where retailers enjoy a sales boom over the Lunar New Year, we're also witnessing the country's voracious fashion consumption habit: an annual clothing purge followed by a splurge.

Let's take the purge first. In keeping with New Year traditions and superstitions, Chinese homes are often spring-cleaned to within an inch of their existence to rid homes of bad luck that has accumulated over the year. An ""out with the old"" mantra means that many used products will be thrown out.

Then comes the splurge. The Lunar New Year heralds one of China's busiest shopping seasons, as the unmarried receive customary cash gifts from married friends and family via embossed red envelopes (or, increasingly, digitally via WeChat). And clothes are often high on people's wish lists.

With shoppers cashed up and looking to start the year in new attire (it's as inauspicious to wear old clothes as it is to wash your hair on the first day of the year) new Hermes, H&M, Zegna and Zara goods will be flying off the rails as we speak. Red clothes -- and red underwear especially -- will be in peak demand, as the color signifies luck and happiness.

Then there are the novelty luxuries that enjoy a brief spin around the block, before either boredom, or the next zodiac animal, drives them into the trash. Louis Vuitton's pig keychain, Longchamp's piglet-inspired accessories and Gucci's monogrammed pig-shaped purse are among this year's most ostentatious examples.

When China -- the world's fastest-growing consumer market -- goes shopping, it injects valuable spending into the country's slowing economy. But it also sends environmental shockwaves around the planet.

Rampant consumption

A shopping spree in the world's most populous nation is an environmental concern for us all. China is a victim too, however.

As the world's largest exporter of clothing and textiles, the country has, for years, shouldered the weight of our own appetite for fast fashion. Until 2017, when China banned imports of "" foreign waste ,"" including textiles, it dealt with our closet rejects too.

Global statistics on consumption and waste hold an ugly mirror up to our cultures' obsession with clothes. The number of garments produced annually doubled between 2000 and 2016, exceeding 100 billion for the first time in 2014. The average consumer now buys approximately 60% more clothing a year (and keeps it for about half as long) as they did at the turn of the millennium.

It's little surprise that 73% of clothes end up in landfills every year. To put this into context: Every second, the equivalent of one garbage truck of textiles is landfilled or incinerated globally. Fashion accounts for 10% of the world's carbon emissions , while up to 20% of all industrial water pollution comes from dyeing and treating fabrics.

For many in China, the impact is as real as it is deadly. An estimated 37.4% of the country's bodies of water are deemed ""unfit for human contact,"" while the existence of up to 450 so-called ""cancer villages"" -- areas where rates of cancer are abnormally high -- is widely attributed to industrial and agricultural contamination of drinking and irrigation water.

Take arsenic, for instance, which is sometimes used in textile finishing, or chlorine, which is often used to bleach clothing. Both are widely used in China's garment manufacturing industry, and both are believed to cause cancer if they contaminate drinking water.

Put simply, making textiles -- with all of the pesticides and toxic chemicals that goes into them -- is a deadly pursuit.

The fashion world is starting to catch on. From Emma Watson to Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, the West has seen an abundance of stars promoting sustainable clothing. In China meanwhile, President Xi Jinping's wife, Peng Liyuan, famously stepped out wearing items by sustainable designer Ma Ke , while Canto-pop sensations, Sandy Lam and Eason Chan, have both worn upcycled outfits on stage and collaborated with sustainable designers.

These ideas are filtering down to the masses. More than 65% of emerging market consumers actively seek sustainable fashion, versus 32% or less in mature markets, according to a 2017 McKinsey report . Another recent survey found that Chinese consumers are ""more likely than any other shoppers to seek sustainable styles,"" with 69% of respondents claiming that sustainability was ""important"" in their apparel purchases.

Signs of change

So is this apparent demand for sustainable fashion influencing what's on the rails in China? After all, saying something and doing it are different things, and it's not yet clear whether consumers will put their money where their mouths are.

The good news, amid so much bad, is that China's fashion industry is showing signs of an ethical awakening.

At the drawing board, we're seeing a new generation of designers adopting sustainable and circular design principles, including zero-waste production and upcycling. In the mid-market, early pioneers -- brands like Nuomi, Icicle and Exception de Mixmind -- are operating commercially viable businesses, while retail giants like Lane Crawford, one of Asia's leading luxury department stores, are increasingly stocking sustainable brands, many of which use upcycled materials.

Even the world's two largest retailers, Zara and H&M (who are often, rightfully, blamed for fashion's over-consumption and production woes), are offering more sustainable wares, with the latter pledging to only use recycled or responsibly sourced materials by 2030. Both now allow customers to drop off unwanted items in-store, while China's second biggest e-commerce company, JD.com, recently expanded its system for collecting used clothing via its nationwide delivery network.

Elsewhere in China, JNBY Group's new label, Reverb, is using a variety of sustainable raw materials and processes. And because the company is listed on Hong Kong's stock exchange it must -- like publicly-listed companies in many other countries -- report on its environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance.

We've also seen the power of digital to disrupt how fashion is consumed. Clothes rental services, subscription sites and resale businesses are now competing for a slice of China's sharing economy. Fueled by millennial sentiments and supported by new technology (which can both create better resale platforms and use AI to weed out fakes), the growth of the global luxury resale market is expected to outpace that of the overall luxury goods market by 2020.

A tipping point

Given these innovations, you'd be forgiven for assuming that China is already shopping (and manufacturing) its way to a better future. But when you poke your nose beyond a few feel-good-stories, the nasty truth is that the fashion industry still brushes its worst horrors under the carpet.

The textile industry is estimated to be one of the largest sources of industrial wastewater in China, and it's often joked that you can tell fashion's 'it' color by looking the color of the country's rivers.

Watch how a firework is made

Chinese activists are now able to report environmental violations in more transparent and accessible ways, via apps and even WeChat. In a nationwide database that catalogs factories' environmental impact, the textile-producing city of Shaoxing alone clocked up 158 reported violations in 2017 and 2018, including charges of over-emissions of toxic and hazardous pollutants.

But consumers' ethical pulses remain difficult to detect, despite the best efforts of a pocket of (largely middle-class) sustainable consumers.

Yet, change must -- and will -- come. If the global fashion industry continues its current trajectory, we will see a 63% increase in fashion consumption by 2030, according to a report by Global Fashion Agenda and The Boston Consulting Group. The same report says that the sector's CO2 emissions are set to rise by more than 60%, the equivalent of nearly 230 million more passenger vehicles driving on the roads each year.

Fashion has reached a tipping point. Facing growing pressure from NGOs, multilaterals and millennials, brands from China to Canada will be forced to become more transparent (by disclosing information that allows their processes to be thoroughly analyzed) and more traceable (by publishing information on how their products are made).

Then there's top-down pressure from governments. The UK parliament's pioneering Environmental Audit Committee , for instance, is investigating the social and environmental impact of disposable fast fashion, which could lead to landmark legislation. And just last week, French officials announced an initiative to make Paris the world's ""sustainable capital of fashion"" by 2024.

In China, meanwhile, updated environmental laws have contributed to textile factories being temporarily or permanently shut down.

But there is much work to be done. China is neither the sole cause of fashion's environmental footprint nor its only victim. Yet it is, perhaps, the country with the greatest potential to bring about change.

Zara - and other brands like Pull & Bear and Bershka - have promised to only sell sustainable clothes by 2025.

The company that owns these shops says all cotton, linen and polyester they sell will be organic, sustainable or recycled.

Zara has 64 UK stores, and its parent company has 7,490 shops worldwide.

Reacting to the news, Friends of the Earth told Radio 1 Newsbeat it would be ""better for everyone if the industry sold clothes made to last.""

Over the past few years, a lot of what we buy has been criticised for being fast fashion - clothes we barely use.

What will you see in the shops?

From next year, containers will appear in Zara stores to collect your old clothes so they can be reused or recycled into new items.

Some people in the fashion industry have been calling for more clothes recycling in order to protect the environment - while politicians think brands and shops should fund clothes recycling.

People in the UK send 235 million items of clothing to landfill each year, according to the most recent figures.

A 'ridiculous amount of clothes'

Friends of the Earth told Newsbeat that high street chains can do more to tackle the environmental problems caused by fast fashion.

""Part of the problem is there are too many brands, with opaque supply chains, making a completely ridiculous amount of clothes,"" spokeswoman Muna Suleiman said.

""They rely on creating 'trends' so shoppers are pressured to come back to buy more stuff each season.""

Zara is one of the stores not to currently use plastic bags and Inditex, the company that owns the chain, says that by 2020 it will eliminate the use of plastic bags across all of its brands.

Primark and Boots are among the big-name shops that have switched from plastic to paper bags.

By 2023 Inditex promises it will have fully eliminated single use plastic in its stores.

Inditex also has a scheme called Join Life running in its shops, which identifies clothes which are made with more environmentally friendly materials than conventional high street stores.

These are made from things like organic cotton and recycled polyester.

The boss of Inditex revealed the company's plans at its annual general meeting this week.

""Sustainability is a never-ending task in which everyone here at Inditex is involved and in which we are successfully engaging all of our suppliers,"" said Pablo Isla, in front of shareholders and company executives.

A report by MPs has urged the UK government to end the era of throwaway clothes and poor working conditions in the fashion supply chain.

The MPs' proposals are designed to force the fashion industry to clean up its act.

They made 18 recommendations covering environmental and labour practices and want the government to act.

Not only is the fashion industry a source of emissions, but old clothes pile up in landfill.

Fibres also flow into the sea when clothes are washed, polluting the marine environment.

A government spokesperson said it was dealing with the impacts of fast fashion - and many measures were already in place.

Among the proposals from the Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) were:

A 1p charge per garment on producers to fund better recycling of clothes;

Ban on incinerating or landfilling unsold stock that can be reused or recycled instead;

Mandatory environmental targets for fashion retailers with a turnover above £36 million;

Tax changes to reward reuse, repair and recycling - to support responsible fashion companies.

The EAC's chair, Labour MP Mary Creagh, said: ""Fashion producers should be forced to clear up the mountains of waste they create.

Small changes you can make for a greener life

Fast fashion is harming the planet, MPs say

Call for '1p a garment' fast fashion charge

Can we make fashion greener?

""The government is content to tolerate practices that trash the environment and exploit workers despite having just committed to net zero emission targets.

""It is out of step with the public who are shocked by the fact that we are sending 300,000 tonnes of clothes a year to incineration or landfill.""

But ministers cite the Sustainable Clothing Action Plan (SCAP), a voluntary agreement co-ordinated by the waste watchdog WRAP.

This sets targets for the industry to reduce carbon emissions, water and waste.

The government also maintains it's better to find outlets for waste textiles rather than simply imposing a landfill ban.

A government spokesperson said: ""It simply isn't true to say we are not accepting the committee's recommendations.

""In our landmark Resources and Waste Strategy we will take forward measures including developing proposals and consulting on extended producer responsibility (EPR) and higher product standards for textiles.

""This would make producers responsible for the full cost of managing and disposing of their products after they're no longer useful.""

Go vintage: ""Do things like shopping second-hand and vintage, going to your local charity shop. You can also buy on sites like eBay and Depop.""

Buy less: ""If you can, just not shopping at all is a really great way to do it. Embracing what you already own and what's already in your wardrobe. There's a great phrase you hear a lot: 'Loved clothes last'"".

Look for eco-friendly materials: ""Look out for more natural fibres - go for cotton over polyester. Not only do they feel a lot nicer when you wear them, but don't contain things like microfibres that go into our water and into marine life when we wash our clothes.""

Learn to DIY: ""It doesn't take much to learn how to hand-sew and stitch up a hole. Or if you have a pair of ripped jeans that are becoming a bit too ripped, you could always cut them and keep them as shorts.""

Ministers say they're focusing on a tax on single-use plastic in packaging, rather than a tax on cheap fashion items.

They point to Sweden's VAT reduction for repair services, which they say has made little impact.

They say they will consider a levy on clothes alongside their plans for making firms in different sectors more responsible for their waste - but no decisions will be made on this until 2025.

"Like many people, I worry about how my everyday choices affect the planet, from the food I eat to the clothes I wear.

And as someone who likes to dress well — and can't resist the lure of a discount rail — I was horrified to learn that the fashion and textile industry is one of the largest polluters in the world, second only to oil, according to the UN.

Every stage in the life cycle of our clothing causes damage to the natural world, from toxic chemicals used in factories to the carbon footprint of shipping goods globally, which is partly why the clothing industry is responsible for more than 8 per cent of all the world's greenhouse gas emissions.

Fortunately, things are changing. Walk into any High Street shop, or click onto an online store, and you'll find ranges claiming to be 'conscious', 'better' or 'eco'. It all sounds great, but are all sustainable items equally saintly?

British High Street shops are filled with ranges claiming to be 'conscious', 'better' or 'eco' (Pictured, H&M's Conscious fashion collection)

Take Asos's Responsible Edit, described as a 'one-stop home' for environmentally-conscious clothing, accessories and living items from different brands featured on the website. One of the first products to come up is a recycled T-shirt.

The description is promising: 'Made with recycled cotton. Instead of ending up in landfill, clothes and textile waste are reclaimed and turned into new fibres. This saves water and energy. Bonus: it reduces C02 emissions, too.'

It doesn't tell me exactly how much cotton is recycled, but it's the next line that makes me pause before clicking 'add to bag'. It describes the fabric as 50 per cent cotton, 50 per cent polyester.

Can a T-shirt that contains polyester really be considered environmentally-conscious? Admittedly, polyester can be recycled, but not if — as in this case — it's blended with another material, as mixed fibres cannot be recycled.

As the fashion industry has no standard to define sustainability, a garment can be labelled 'sustainable' even if it contains only 1 per cent organic cotton or is combined with a man-made synthetic fabric.

Asos said that, for a product to feature in its Responsible Edit range, it must contain 50 per cent sustainable materials at a minimum; the only exception to this is recycled cotton, which has a lower threshold (20 per cent) due to technical limitations with the fibre.

'If a brand sells an item as sustainable, then usually something on the label says why — but not always,' says Tamsin Lejeune, CEO of Common Objective, a tech platform designed to make it easy for fashion professionals to work sustainably.

It's positive to see big brands taking action, but are they just telling shoppers what they want to hear? Inditex, the world's largest clothes producer and owner of Zara, promises all its clothes will be made from sustainable fabrics by 2025.

Asos's Responsible Edit (pictured) includes a Tommy Jeans recycled logo T-shirt, which is made with recycled cotton. But the product is only 50 per cent cotton, and 50 per cent polyester

H&M vows to use 100 per cent sustain-able cotton by 2020, and ensure all its products are made from sustainably sourced materials by 2030.

Maxine Bedat is the founder of the New Standard Institute (NSI), a scientific organisation focused on improving sustainability in fashion. She is concerned that brands merely pay lip service.

'It almost feels like sustainable fashion is the latest trend,' she says. 'I question whether a lot of brands are truly reducing impact — or just trying to be trendy.'

While she praises the commitments of Zara to stop using hazardous chemicals by 2020 and H&M's promise to ensure workers are paid fairly, she believes their biggest vow — to eventually use 100 per cent sustainable fabrics — is 'so loosely defined as to be meaningless'.

The NSI has recommends a 'measuring stick of sustainability' called the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), which tallies a company's total carbon, water and chemical footprint, and requires them to make these details public.

A number of brands, including Stella McCartney, Patagonia and Kering (the group that owns Gucci) use this system, but the majority of High Street retailers have yet to sign up.

While some use other measures, many keep their figures private. Mango says between 2017 and 2018 it doubled the number of garments produced sustainably and plans to 'increase' the percentage of sustainable fabrics used in all collections, but hasn't yet stated its figures publicly.

H&M launched its Conscious Exclusive collection of sustainable womenswear this year (pictured

An INDITEX spokesman said: 'We produce durable, high-quality fashion which customers can wear again and again. We strive to create products that are not only right for our customers, but right for the people who create them, and work in partnership with suppliers, unions, governments and other brands to do so.

'We know where our garments are made and the social and environmental conditions in which they are produced, and our suppliers must follow our stringent code of conduct which emphasizes workers' rights.

'Sustainability is a neverending goal and we have set very specific commitments and targets, notably that by 2025, we will use only organic, sustainable or recycled cotton, polyester and linen.'

Asos says it transparently and publicly reports its uptake of sustainable fibres each year via the Textile Exchange benchmark. The number of clothes it sells that are made from recycled materials varies over time, so it is not able to give a fixed percentage on this.

'We're working to increase our use of recycled fibres as these are always preferable to virgin fibres. We recognise the importance of designing products with recyclability in mind from the start, which is why we've partnered with the Centre for Sustainable Fashion. We have many varied commitments, of which training our designers on circular design is just one.'

An H&M spokesperson said they display the precise material composition of every single garment they sell online.

'For a material to be labelled as Conscious, at least 50 per cent of the material composition must be recycled or sustainably sourced. This is the minimum requirement, but a lot of our Conscious garments far exceed this.

'One of our goals is to use 100 per cent sustainably sourced or recycled materials by 2030 — currently 57 per cent of the materials we use meet this standard.

'H&M group will never decide for itself whether a material can be considered sustainable. We follow the Textile Exchange's Preferred Fiber & Materials benchmark to establish the sustainability credentials of a material; and for us to class a material as sustainable, it must also meet the independent accreditation requirements of a relevant third-party body.'

Mango did not respond to a request for a comment.

Here's our guide on how to shop sustainably — and whether you can do it on the High Street.

Can polyester be a sustainable fabric?

Polyester is the world's most commonly used fibre, but the chemical process by which it is made from crude oil releases pollutants into the atmosphere, depletes finite resources and does not easily biodegrade. Worse, if it's blended with other fibres, such as cotton, it cannot be recycled.

A more sustainable alternative is said to be recycled polyester, which forms much of H&M's Conscious collection. Mainly made from recycled plastic bottles, it takes between 30 and 50 per cent less energy to make, doesn't use up oil reserves and reduces the amount of polyester disposed in landfill.

But each time plastic is reheated for recycling it degrades, so it cannot be recycled indefinitely.

Then there's the problem of polyester garments releasing plastic microfibres into water when washed. Already, 110kg of micro-fibres enter waterways daily for every 100,000 people — the equivalent of the pollution caused by about 15,000 plastic bags.

Recycled polyester might be even worse at shedding plastic microparticles. 'Reports on water contaminated as a result of synthetic clothes being washed found recycled fabrics are the worst; they degraded more in water,' says Tamsin Lejeune. 'You can't call a recycled polyester collection sustainable.'

TOP TIP: Check labels and avoid all polyester, whether recycled or not.

What cotton labels should I look for?

The term 'sustainable cotton' is used by High Street retailers, but there's no set definition.

It can refer to five different initiatives, from Certified Organic which strictly monitors pesticide and insecticide use, to Fairtrade which guarantees farmers a fair minimum price for their cotton, and the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI) which tries to improve the social, economic and environmental outcomes for farmers.

But BCI, which Zara and Mango grow their cotton in line with, has been criticised for its tolerance of pesticides and GM crops, as well as its lack of clear figures about how much water it aims to reduce in cotton production.

'There's a difference between BCI which is slightly sustainable, and things like organic cotton and Fairtrade cotton which have specifics,' says ethical trade consultant Clare Lissman, who would rather see brands subscribing to Certified Organic and Fairtrade.

'Ticking the lowest denominator and saying 'we're sustainable' makes me uncomfortable.'

TOP TIP: Look for cotton labelled 'Certified Organic' or 'Fairtrade' rather than just 'sustainable'.

Are other fabrics more eco-friendly?

they are a mixed bunch at best. Viscose, a cellulose fibre made from wood pulp, creates more greenhouse emissions than cotton production and the annual logging of more than 70 million trees.

So recent years have seen the rise of sustainable alternatives like Lyocell which use less energy than cotton — and now, in a bid to save the trees, even newer options are being produced using proteins and fibres found in everyday items, such as milk, orange and coffee.

Nylon is favoured for its durability, but it's made using crude oil and emits high levels of C02.

One new brand, Econyl, uses nylon waste from landfills and oceans to create an infinitely recyclable material, used by the likes of Prada, and reduces the global warming impact of nylon by up to 80 per cent. These new options are eco-friendly, but are considerably more costly. They aren't widely seen on the High Street.

TOP TIP: Don't buy viscose or nylon — seek alternatives such as Lyocell and Econyl.

Our buying habits must change

Last year, we in the UK sent 235 million items of clothing to landfill, and this is increasing. A recent study predicted that this summer, Britons will spend £2.7 billion on 50.3 million outfits they will wear once.

'The more research that comes out, the clearer it is that continually buying lots of cheap stuff is inherently in contradiction with sustainability,' says Lejeune.

Fast fashion has been growing rapidly, from High Street brands such as Zara which produces 500 new designs a week, to online retailers like Boohoo and Missguided which sell copies of catwalk clothes for £5. It's the main reason so much clothing goes into landfill.

TOP TIP: Set a challenge to avoid buying clothes and make use of what's in your wardrobe instead.

Why can't we just recycle?

'circular fashion' is the idea that we can use unwanted clothes to create new ones by recycling fabric. Asos has committed to train all its teams in circular design by 2020, while H&M offers customers a £5 voucher in exchange for unwanted clothes, promising they'll be reused, reworn or recycled, with nothing going to landfill.

The company says 50-60 per cent of textiles are sorted for re-wear, about 35-45 per cent are recycled, and 3-7 per cent used as combustibles for energy production.

But Maxine Bedat says it's not always the case with other schemes like this, as typically only 1 per cent of clothing can be recycled into new material. Even then, it is mostly blended fabric with some new raw materials needed.

She advises spending more on clothing that will last: 'But if you do have clothing you want to recycle, give it to charity as they can at least get the proceeds.'

TOP TIP: Buy quality not quantity — and give old clothes to charity instead of recycling.

And what about the workers?

The natural world isn't the only issue. With labour conditions, things are more complicated.

'You've got to benefit people and the planet,' says Lissman. 'The increased interest in sustainability is brilliant, but it's also important to change conditions for workers [many of whom are subcontracted, rather than directly employed] — even if that's harder as it's something brands have less control over.'

This difficulty might be why brands are so happy to focus on sustainability instead.

H&M has been praised for its aim to achieve living wages for staff, but other big companies have yet even to make promises about paying workers better.

TOP TIP: Ethical fashion apps such as Good On You show which brands pay a living wage.

Are we making things worse?

experts say there are negative effects of the 'ethical' High Street ranges. That's because they create the assumption that it's possible to have sustainable clothes that are also dirt cheap.

Lejeune says this is not the case: 'If you factor in the cost of paying people well enough to eat and live, and the environmental cost, the cost of making ethical clothing would be higher than the price these ranges are sold for. That's the bottom line.'

'In my experience, these ranges are often subsidised — sold for around a third less than they cost to produce. It's often with good intent, because brands want to demonstrate the range sells, and don't want to price it higher than everything else in store.'

The problem is when brands produce subsidised sustainable ranges, customers assume it's possible to be green and cheap, so are reluctant to spend more at small businesses doing best practice with sustainability, but — by necessity — charging more.

A H&M spokesperson said the company doesn't disclose pricing information as it is commercially sensitive but said its pricing method is consistent across all ranges as the goal is 'to democratise all fashion'. Asos said it does not subsidise products or sell at cost.

There are positive examples such as Topshop, successfully selling ethical jewellery brand Made at high prices that reflect production costs. Asos believes its size and influence are an advantage, allowing the company to push for lasting, meaningful change at a wider scale.

Lejeune praises UK firms such as Garthenor Organic Ltd, the world's first producer of 100 per cent Certified Organic wool, and Ninety Percent, a womenswear label sharing 80 per cent of distributed profits with charities and 10 per cent with workers.

TOP TIP: Seek out smaller retailers and be prepared to pay more.

Borrow, swap or rent - don't buy

Swap Rebellion (facebook.com/SwapRebellion) encourages people to swap clothes; Higher Studio (higher.studio) loans designer clothes to subscribers from £85 a month.

Other rental options are mywardrobehq.com from £70, and the high end frontrow.uk.com which offers the likes of Versace and Prada for several hundred pounds a day.

TOP TIP: Ethical fashion apps such as Good On You show which brands pay a living wage.

Are we making things worse?

experts say there are negative effects of the 'ethical' High Street ranges. That's because they create the assumption that it's possible to have sustainable clothes that are also dirt cheap.

Lejeune says this is not the case: 'If you factor in the cost of paying people well enough to eat and live, and the environmental cost, the cost of making ethical clothing would be higher than the price these ranges are sold for. That's the bottom line.'

'In my experience, these ranges are often subsidised — sold for around a third less than they cost to produce. It's often with good intent, because brands want to demonstrate the range sells, and don't want to price it higher than everything else in store.'

The problem is when brands produce subsidised sustainable ranges, customers assume it's possible to be green and cheap, so are reluctant to spend more at small businesses doing best practice with sustainability, but — by necessity — charging more.

A H&M spokesperson said the company doesn't disclose pricing information as it is commercially sensitive but said its pricing method is consistent across all ranges as the goal is 'to democratise all fashion'. Asos said it does not subsidise products or sell at cost.

There are positive examples such as Topshop, successfully selling ethical jewellery brand Made at high prices that reflect production costs. Asos believes its size and influence are an advantage, allowing the company to push for lasting, meaningful change at a wider scale.

Lejeune praises UK firms such as Garthenor Organic Ltd, the world's first producer of 100 per cent Certified Organic wool, and Ninety Percent, a womenswear label sharing 80 per cent of distributed profits with charities and 10 per cent with workers.

TOP TIP: Seek out smaller retailers and be prepared to pay more.

Borrow, swap or rent - don't buy

Swap Rebellion (facebook.com/SwapRebellion) encourages people to swap clothes; Higher Studio (higher.studio) loans designer clothes to subscribers from £85 a month.

Other rental options are mywardrobehq.com from £70, and the high end frontrow.uk.com which offers the likes of Versace and Prada for several hundred pounds a day.

"Previously, people would only rent clothes for special occasions, but now environmentally conscious customers are driving a boom in everyday-wear rental. Can it solve our fast fashion problem?

It could be a wedding invitation. Perhaps a job interview is coming up. Or maybe it’s just a big night out. There are many reasons people shop for new clothes. But environmentally conscious and cash savvy consumers are increasingly opting to rent rather than buy when they want a new outfit.

Fashion rental is on the rise and not just for event wear. Where once someone may only have hired a tuxedo or formal wear for a special occasion, today companies are renting customers everyday clothing, handbags, even trainers for one-off fees or via low-cost subscription. Designer labels, children’s clothes and maternity wear are also proving popular with consumers who are reluctant to invest in items they may not need for long or those who want to keep up with fashion without feeding mass consumption.

“The benefits of renting fashion are wide-ranging,” says Samantha Dover, senior retail analyst at research firm Mintel. “Not only can renting clothes be a more environmentally friendly alternative to buying into fast-moving fashion trends, but consumers can also save space in their homes. Fashion rentals can fulfil temporary fashion, such as clothing for women during pregnancy, while some fashion rental companies are tapping into demand for more niche and everyday fashion products such as streetwear.”

Is fast fashion giving way to the sustainable wardrobe? Read more

Evidence suggests people are already shopping less frequently. The percentage of those buying clothes every two to three months declined between 2017 and 2018, according to Mintel, while there was a marked increase in those shopping just once a year. Importantly, there has been a consistent fall in the percentage of shoppers indulging their habit once a month or more.

The US has led the way in fashion rental with market leader Rent the Runway, operating since 2009. It offers users unlimited rentals for a regular monthly subscription of $159 (£127). The UK has been slower to catch on to the rental trend, though several services have emerged in recent years. Girl Meets Dress has a monthly fee of £99, for which subscribers can have unlimited dress hires. Wear the Walk, My Wardrobe HQ and Front Row rent out high end and designer labels for a monthly subscription, plus a rental fee for each item, typically between 10% and 15% of the retail price. Meanwhile, Dutch label Scotch & Soda recently announced plans to launch a men’s clothing rental service this autumn.

Sacha Newall, founder of My Wardrobe HQ, believes that renting clothes will become the norm in future and could address growing concerns about the negative impacts of fast fashion. “I used to work in the car sharing industry, where for every car shared 11 are taken off the road,” she says. “Apply a similar approach to the crisis in the fashion industry and you have the potential to make a real difference.”

Consumers are beginning to wake up to the effect that cheap, throwaway fashion is having. A damning parliamentary committee report recently outlined the contribution of the fashion industry to climate change. The findings were stark: the textile industry creates 1.2bn tonnes of CO2 a year, and is responsible for the consumption of vast quantities of water, while 35% of the microplastics in the ocean come from the synthetic fibres in abandoned clothing.

Newall adds: “Rental can be for fun. It’s a one-night stand. But you can look good with the virtue factor of knowing you haven’t done any damage to the environment.”

While more people are aware of the damage fast-moving, disposable fashion is doing to the planet, social media is encouraging consumption of clothing among some users. One in six young people say they do not feel able to wear an outfit again once it has appeared on social media, a study by charity the Hubbub Foundation found. Almost half of young women polled said they felt the need to wear a different look every time they went out.

Extinction Rebellion: 'Fashion week should be a declaration of emergency' Read more

“The increase in fashion rental should drive the production of clothes that are more durable, which is good in terms of sustainability,” says Heather Poore, Hubbub’s creative director. “But the rental model is new and still being tested. A lot of the focus is on high-end items. The real strength of it will become evident when the big, everyday brands start to trial it. Plus, you have to balance the potential mass scale of rental with sustainable ways to get clothes to people. Online deliveries already have a big environmental impact.”

Urban Outfitters is one of the bigger names to announce a rental offering. Its online rental service, called Nuuly, launches in the US this summer, in part to mitigate the high level of returns the retailer experiences. H&M has said it is looking into the renting model as part of its sustainability agenda. The Westfield Group has run trials of rental services.

The benefits of launching rental services can be considerable for fashion labels and retailers. Individuals who might otherwise feel unable to afford a brand can give it a try through rental, which may lead to future sales. Environmentally and ethically aware consumers are also increasingly seeking evidence of sustainable behaviour on the part of companies they deal with. Plus, rental can be a way for brands to generate extra revenue from excess inventory.

Shika Bodani, founder of rental service Front Row, believes that education is necessary to remove the stigma associated with rental in some brands’ eyes. “A lot of them are still worried that renting will devalue their brand, making their products appear second hand,” she explains. “It’s about changing the brands’ perspective. Educating people is easier. Once they understand the process, they soon see the attraction of the sharing economy. The rise of the conscious consumer is something fashion brands can’t ignore.”"
"Fashion designer Jesse Lee uses recycled fabrics to make his fashion line, including fabric from discarded umbrellas

Despite Hong Kong's reputation for rampant consumerism, a nascent movement against fast fashion is taking root in the city, with clothes-mending workshops and pop-up swaps growing in popularity, and designers parading recycled fabrics on the catwalk.

From broken umbrellas to discarded curtains, no material is too shabby for designer Jesse Lee, who showcased his creations at a recent sustainable fashion show in Hong Kong.

Lee realised that humble household goods could be the springboard for creativity when his family was throwing out an old sofa.

He turned the sofa's leather cover into a jacket and has since made clothes from old curtains and bed linen, as well as a raincoat using umbrella fabric.

Lee also tries to make his designs unisex and adjustable so they can be easily shared.

""If you don't feel like wearing this, you can give it to others and it doesn't matter if it is a boy or a girl,"" Lee told AFP.

Global consumers purchased 60 percent more clothing in 2016 than in 2000 and only kept each item half as long, a report by McKinsey consultancy found.

Hong Kong alone sends 343 tonnes of textiles to the city's overloaded landfills every day and a 2016 report by Greenpeace found a sixth of clothes owned by residents were seldom or never worn after purchase.

A nascent movement against fast fashion is taking place in Hong Kong

But Lee and others like him are hoping to capitalise on rising consumer awareness as shoppers become more conscious of the human and environmental cost of fast fashion after high-profile scandals like the deadly 2013 collapse of a building in Bangladesh that housed several garment factories.

The tragedy, one of the worst industrial accidents in modern history, sparked global outrage and triggered a drive among activists to encourage shoppers to buy from local stores, rather than from large multinational fast fashion brands.

Christina Dean, founder of Redress, says the tide is slowly turning and describes the industry as at a tipping point.

The Hong Kong-based charity works to reduce fashion waste and hosted the recent show where Lee displayed his creations, alongside other designers who transformed vintage kimonos and bridalwear samples and even used silicone and rubber.

""Many people are turning their backs and saying 'I have more clothes than I can possibly wear,"" she told AFP.

- A stitch in time -

Shocked by the volume of clothing and the pollution produced by major brands, Hong Kong designers Kay Wong and Toby Crispy founded ""Fashion Clinic"" to help people mend garments.

Two Hong Kong designers have founded a series of ""Fashion Clinic"" workshops to help people mend their old clothes

They set up pop-up stalls at clothing stores providing repair and reshaping services and also hold workshops teaching basic needlework.

""Fast fashion makes people dispose of their clothes so easily, because clothes are too cheap and it seems to cost nothing to toss out the old ones,"" Wong told AFP.

""After they learn stitching, they can repair many things, like worn-out shirts or socks,"" Wong said.

Jack Lam, 31, was learning to sew patches onto his torn jeans at a recent workshop, as curious shoppers looked on.

""The patches look like new embellishments,"" he told AFP, adding that the jeans were now more valuable to him because he had fixed them himself.

- Spinning yarn -

While repair clinics, clothes swaps and second-hand shops are all doing their bit, some want to address the waste problem on an industrial scale.

A cutting-edge ""upcycling"" spinning mill that turns discarded clothes into new yarns will go into full operation in the city in October, developed by the Hong Kong Research Institute for Textiles and Apparel (HKRITA).

Hong Kong alone sends 343 tonnes of textiles to landill sites, and a Greenpeace report found a sixth of clothes bought by residents were never or seldom worn

The 1,765 square-metre (19,000 square-foot) factory will sterilise, sort and turn used textiles into fresh fibre, processing three tonnes of textile waste each day.

Six workers will remove zips and buttons and categorise the fabrics before machines carry out automated colour sorting and re-spinning.

Mixed-fibre clothing will go through a high-tech treatment to separate the different elements.

Edwin Keh, CEO of HKRITA, said the recycled yarn will be ""as good as virgin materials"", while the selling price will be 30 percent lower.

The factory launch comes as mainland China moves to ban the import of most solid waste, including textile scraps, putting pressure on Hong Kong to find new ways to deal with its trash.

""Whereas China doesn't want to import other people's rubbish, they are very happy with importing yarns and fibres, so that's what we are going to do,"" Keh said.

Keh hopes the new mill will serve as an inspiration for other cities.

""If in a crowded city like Hong Kong we have come up with this solution to deal with our own waste, any city in the world should be able to have that kind of local solution."""
"When it comes to clothes, no doubt about it, Canadians love athleisure. Market research company The NPD Group found that although Canadian apparel sales decreased a bit in 2017, activewear brands were still going strong; with $6.2 billion in sales, these brands made up 23 per cent of the overall apparel and basics industry. At the same time, more mindful buying is on the rise. A full third of respondents in a recent PwC Canadian consumer insights survey said they actively seek out sustainable, environmentally friendly products, while 28 per cent said they opt for brands with sustainable practices when shopping.

With these trends in mind, we've rounded up five yoga brands that prioritize sustainable practices without sacrificing style.

Prana Vida

Prana Vida uses fabric that's mainly a blend of Tencel Lyocell fibre and organic cotton (not to mention, Lyocell makes the leggings feel silky and look sleek). Currently, some spandex is used for stretch, but the brand's creator Amelia Barnes says she is working to source a new fibre, Sorona, to make the leggings fully biodegradable. The material is also OEKO-TEX certified, which means it meets high standards of environmental and human safety. Plus, the brand boasts a range of sizes (from 00 to 24) and a maternity-friendly line.

Seed

Not only do Seed pants look hip as heck, the brand's clothing is comprised of mainly hemp and organic cotton, with just four per cent spandex. Owner Blake Ward says that 80 per cent of Seed pants in stock are dyed using the roots and leaves of plants — no synthetics added (when produced in small quantities, as Seed's clothing is, these dyes can be low-impact). While the clothes are already manufactured in Calgary, Seed's goal is to produce all of its clothing from local hemp crops by 2020 too.

Zen Nomad

Although Zen Nomad's clothing is certainly boho-inspired, the neutral colour palette and simple lines add balance to their aesthetic. The natural fibres the company uses, from organic cotton to Tencel Lyocell to hemp, require minimal or no pesticides to grow, and owner Sonja den Elzen sometimes hand-harvests the plants and dyes the materials herself. She saves and uses the leftover scraps from manufacturing, and also makes a point of buying the overstock fabrics from bigger designers, thereby repurposing what would otherwise have been waste.

Inner Fire

If you've tried on a pair of Inner Fire leggings, you may have noticed their smooth, form-fitting feel, but you may not have realized that they're made from recycled, BPA-free water bottles. According to a 2016 study from the World Economic Forum, at least eight million tonnes of plastic leaks into the ocean every year, so while these leggings aren't biodegradable, repurposing post-consumer water bottles means less plastic in landfills, thus less in our oceans. Passionate about the health of local waterways too, B.C.-based Inner Fire has raised money to support the Standing Rock water protectors.

Respecterre

Each item in Respecterre's down-to-earth yoga collection is made in an ecovillage in Quebec. La Cité Écologique aims to eliminate overstock waste; several pieces of their clothing are made to order, and when you do go to check out, you'll be given the option of plastic-free packaging. For many companies, using fabrics with eco certifications can be out of reach, but many of Respecterre's textiles meet OEKO-TEX standards.

In Hong Kong, more than 340 tonnes of textile waste is dumped each day into the city’s overflowing landfills, according to the city’s Environmental Protection Department.

But a new textile spinning mill – the first to open in this former textile manufacturing powerhouse in half a century – aims to reuse that waste, harnessing pioneering recycling technology to try to make the fashion industry more sustainable.

“These technologies may be the gateway to a fashion industry decoupled from the use of virgin natural resources,” said Erik Bang, who heads innovation efforts for the H&M Foundation, a non-profit funded by the family, founders and main owners of H&M Group.

The clothing retailer has already placed a first order at the mill, as part of its bid to become “fully circular and renewable,” according to Cecilia Brännsten, the group’s environmental sustainability manager.

The Novetex Upcycling Factory in Tai Po Industrial Estate, when it opens this month, will use new technology to separate fabric blends in waste garments and produce yarn.

It comes as clothing companies around the world doubled the amount of garments they made from 2000 to 2014, according to a 2016 report by management consultancy McKinsey & Company.

Over the same period, the number of garments bought each year, per person, jumped 60 per cent, the report said.

That has led to a stream of clothing – purchased and thrown away, left unsold, or tossed as textile plant waste – going into landfills.

CURBING “TAKE-MAKE-DISPOSE”

The government of Hong Kong wants to encourage its 7.3 million people to move away from a “take-make-dispose” model towards a more “circular economy” where waste is reused, according to Kam-sing Wong, the city’s secretary for the environment.

It is also seeking to make the city a leader in sustainable fashion.

To try to achieve the aim, it has since 2006 funded the Hong Kong Research Institute of Textiles and Apparel (HKRITA), which collaborates with industry partners and groups like the H&M Foundation.

Hong Kong’s government also funded a two-day “Fashion Summit” in early September, billed as the largest sustainable fashion event in Asia.

With many people working in textile sourcing and startups, the city is a good place to introduce new technology to a global audience of fashion executives, according to Yan Chan, director for business development at the HKRITA.

Fashion companies “are making decisions here. So once the technology is actually ready, then we can spread out across not only Asia, but all over the world,” said Chan.

The new mill in Tai Po uses two pioneering technologies, developed and patented by HKRITA, to reuse fabric made of mixed fibres.

While it’s possible to recycle garments made from one material, until now no commercially viable method has existed for recycling blends on a big scale, Chan said.

The mill will carry out mechanical recycling, where soiled or damaged fabrics – such as old uniforms or hotel curtains – are sanitized, with buttons and zippers removed, then sorted and stored.

Once an order comes in for a certain colour, the material is UV-sterilised before being cut into pieces and spun into yarn. No water or dye is needed, and only small amounts of virgin material are used, Chan said.

But the mill will also test a system to separate cotton and polyester blends using only heat, water and a small quantities of biodegradable chemicals.

The cotton is turned into cellulose powder while the polyester fibre is used for spinning and making new fabric, Chan said.

If Novetex can show on the factory floor that the technologies work to make high-quality yarn, it could drive demand globally for recycled yarn and wider use of the technology, its backers say.

“As we scale up and make this technology freely available to the industry, we will reduce our dependance on limited natural resources to clothe a growing global population,” Bang said.

“FAST FASHION”

A 2017 report from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a U.K.-based sustainability charity, said the total greenhouse gas emissions from producing textiles, at 1.2 billion tonnes annually, is more than those from all international flights and maritime shipping.

An average of 23 kgs of greenhouse gases are generated to make one kilogram of fabric, according to McKinsey.

Customers are keeping their clothes half as long as they did 15 years ago, the report added, sometimes wearing them only seven or eight times before disposing of them.

This move toward fast fashion – where more clothes are produced but at a lower quality, making them less robust – must be reversed for a sustainable future, researchers from the Mistra Future Fashion program wrote in The Handbook of Sustainable Fashion.

A sustainable fashion survey by auditor KPMG, released at the Fashion Summit this month, showed more buyers are becoming more conscious about the industry’s impact on the planet.

More than three-quarters of 5,000 consumers surveyed in Hong Kong, Shanghai, London, New York and Tokyo said they were concerned about the environment, pollution and waste.

Story continues below advertisement

However, only 13 per cent of consumers in the survey said they were willing to pay a higher price for sustainable fashion.

Sixty percent said they would prefer sustainable fashion if the price was the same as normal fashion. A labelling or scoring system would help, they said.

To help educate consumers and entice them to recycle clothes, HKRITA, Novetex and the H&M Foundation have teamed up with a repurposed former textile mill complex called The Mills in Hong Kong and opened a recycling station and shop in the western New Territories’ neighbourhood of Tsuen Wan.

Here Hong Kongers can bring in old, unwanted clothes and ask them to be remade into another garment, in as little time as four hours.

“Seeing is believing, and when consumers see with their own eyes what a valuable resource garments at end of life can be, they can also believe in recycling,” Bang said."
"Whether it’s how they’re made or what they’re made of, textiles are evolving to meet consumer demand for sustainability.

“There’s a real push for sustainability now, and the home textiles industry is waking up to that consumer call,” says Shannon Maher, chair of Home Products Development at the Fashion Institute of Technology, in New York.

It’s about reducing waste during textile production, she said, and reusing or recycling waste to produce other products.

“Zero Waste has definitely become a watchword,” she said.

Consumers today have a heightened awareness of the harm plastic does to the environment, and “are willing to pay 5 or 10% more for a sustainable product as a way of contributing to the circular economy, and helping the environment,” she says.

Rugs and outdoor fabrics, for instance, are increasingly being made with recycled materials instead of new plastics.

A lot is happening on the fashion-design front, too, to explore new, sustainably sourced and even compostable types of textiles.

“Companies like Adidas and Nike are at the cutting edge of some of these innovations, and their work — and innovations in textiles used for apparel — does trickle down to textiles in other realms,” Maher says.

An exhibit of textile innovations at the Cooper Hewitt Design Museum in New York City, on view through Jan. 20, includes a dress made by a Japanese design team that features naturally glowing silk, made from silkworms injected with a green fluorescent protein derived from jellyfish. There’s a prototype for Adidas sneakers made entirely of ocean plastic; another prototype of sneakers that would be entirely compostable; and a textile made from algae.

“There’s a level of optimism when you look around and see designers really taking on the challenge of all this,” says Andrea Lipps, a curator at the Cooper Hewitt who helped organize the exhibit. “There’s a groundswell of creativity that’s continuing to reverberate.”

At the Fashion Institute of Technology, students have been experimenting with using milkweed and flax to create luxurious “fur” from 100% plant material. That won them the Stella McCartney Prize for Sustainable Fashion at the Biodesign Challenge Summit earlier this summer.

Another student design team there came up with the idea for a Spandex-type elastic fabric using a protein found in oysters.

To help companies get the word out about steps they’re taking, and help consumers identify environmentally responsible companies, the Sustainable Furnishing Council provides an online list.

“We have about 400 member companies, and they each have made their own public and verifiable commitment to sustainability,” says Susan Inglis, executive director of the council.

Look up, say, garden furniture, and see what best practices various manufacturers have put in place.

Another effort to help consumers reliably identify more eco-friendly companies is a new level of Oeko-TEX certification, called “Made in Green,” certifying that no harmful chemicals have been used in the manufacture of a certain product.

“People are talking more these days about ‘the value chain,’ showing that not only are you certified as being environmentally responsible, but all of the factories in your production process are certified. It’s a level of transparency that includes aspects like using clean energy sources,” explains Maher.

“Sustainability is complex,” she says. From a factory standpoint, it’s also a matter of asking whether they’re solar-powered, and how much water they use.

"The Zara sale comes every summer like clockwork, as reliable as tax season. Suddenly the entire store, and website, is on sale. The prices on dresses, blouses and jeans are slashed from already-tempting numbers like $79.90 and $49.90 to $29.90, or even $9.90 and they keep dropping like a countdown. The collective, discount-driven urge to shop is in the air. Inevitably, I cave. My mom and I pick a weekend afternoon and walk over to our nearest Zara. We bond as we reject the sparkly heels and nod approvingly at the linen caftans. The racks are overstuffed with stuff. It feels euphoric and draining all at once. Finally, I unearth it — a skirt. It’s pretty enough, and, yes, cheap enough to warrant the wait to try it on, then to pay. As I walk out of the store, my conscience is a see-saw of new-purchase dopamine and guilt. Along with my new buy, I carry home the kind of stomach-dropping anxiety that comes with paying less for a skirt than a plate of restaurant pasta.

I’ve watched The True Cost, a documentary that doesn’t pull punches, showing footage of overworked seamstresses and rivers stained with toxic waste. Two years ago, I toured denim laundries in Los Angeles, watching the factories overflow with wasted water. So a visit to Zara, or any fast-fashion chain like it, has always left me feeling, well, bad.

So it came as a pleasant surprise when Inditex, Zara’s parent company, announced last week that it would make greater efforts to become sustainable. Was the fashion goliath aware of the growing sustainable fashion movement? Perhaps Zara wasn’t blind to its impact on the world, and our closets, I thought. Zara’s biggest claims: It would transition to 100 per cent sustainable fabrics by 2025, and 80 per cent of the energy consumed in Zara’s headquarters, factories and stores will come from renewable sources. The company vows to eliminate landfill waste. By 2023, Zara’s wood-pulp-derived viscose will not come from endangered forests. Does all this mean we can shop at Zara, guilt-free?

Have your say:

Maybe not. Can a company that churns out an average of 500 new designs each week and 20,000 designs each year really become sustainable? After all, the chain’s profitability hinges on getting shoppers like me hooked on a never-ending stream of fresh clothes. To get some answers, I reached out to Elizabeth L. Cline, author of Overdressed: The Shockingly High Cost of Cheap Fashion and the upcoming The Conscious Closet. Here’s what the sustainable fashion expert had to say about Zara’s eco-friendly claims, how we can all take steps to reduce our impact on the environment and turn our fast-fashion guilt into action.

Zara vowed to use 100 per cent sustainable fabrics by 2025. What does that really mean?

“There is no such thing as a 100 per cent sustainable fabric. All fabric requires a tremendous amount of natural resources and energy to make. Zara is shifting to a mix of fabrics that has a lower environmental profile.”

What types of fabrics should shoppers look out for if they’re interested in more sustainable materials?

“If you’re shopping and you see Tencel, that’s a more sustainably sourced version of viscose rayon that is made from sustainably managed forests and using better, safer chemistry. If you’re shopping for cotton, look for clothing sourced from Better Cotton Initiative cotton or organic cotton. For any fabric, a percentage of recycled materials is always a good thing. For polyester and nylon, look for 100 per cent recycled content. It’s already possible to make synthetics using recycled bottles or even recycled fishing nets. Since synthetics are made using fossil fuels, recycled content is a way to avoid using more finite virgin resources.”

Zara’s business model is based upon creating new clothes, all the time. Can this ever be considered sustainable?

“Fast fashion is a business model built around disposable consumption and limitless growth. Zara is pushing into new markets right now, expanding into India and expanding their online presence globally. Anyone who cares about the environment is right to question how fast fashion would fit into a sustainable future. I think the answer is that it doesn’t. Fast fashion ignores a few realities: The global population is set to grow by another two billion people in the next 30 years, and we have to cut emissions by more than 55 per cent by 2030. So, no matter how much more efficient you make your supply chain, if your business is built on the unending growth of a physical product made from natural resources and energy, you’re out of step with the times.”

As shoppers, have we become more aware of the damage of fast-fashion? And is this consumer awareness behind these sustainability pushes?

“Yes, Zara is absolutely responding to consumers’ growing concern about sustainability and social issues. Consumers are more informed than ever about what’s going on in the world, and they don’t want to feel like they’re harming the Earth when they buy fashion. Sustainability has become a way to differentiate yourself as brand, whether it’s authentic or not.”

Among all of Zara’s announcements — from reducing landfill waste to using renewable energy — are there any that stand out to you as the most helpful?

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

“The switch to lower-impact materials and removing hazardous chemicals from the supply chain is the most significant shift, by far. The bulk of fashion’s environmental impact happens in the manufacturing phase, in making new textiles and materials that become clothing and shoes. The impact comes from making more stuff. So, anything Zara is doing to reduce impact at stores or with packaging or shipping is less urgent. It’s important, but it’s less urgent and shouldn’t be seen as a sign that they’re becoming more sustainable.”

In a perfect world, can a fast-fashion retailer rehabilitate itself into a sustainable brand?

“It depends on how we define sustainability. To me, sustainability means living within the Earth’s boundaries so that future generations have what they need to live well on this planet. There is no evidence that the standard of living we enjoy today can continue. North Americans in particular have a huge carbon footprint. And there’s no evidence that the way we live can be replicated in developing economies without disastrous consequences. That’s the paradox at the heart of how we’re living and one that goes beyond fast fashion.”

Some shoppers might read these Zara claims and think they can soon shop there guilt-free. Is this the case?

“It’s easy to heap all the blame for fashion’s sustainability woes on fast fashion chains, because they encourage a type of wasteful consumption that is out of line with sustainability itself. But most of our apparel is made by huge corporations that churn out gobs of product every year. The whole industry is running on a fast-fashion model. As consumers, we have to channel our guilt into action. We have to make sure we’re pressuring the entire fashion industry.”

What steps can the average clothing buyer take to reduce their impact?

“It’s pretty simple. If you’re more of a minimalist, simply buy less clothing and take care of what you wear. Donate clothes you no longer wear in the best possible condition, so they have a second life. If they’re worn out, find a place in town that will accept those items for recycling. If you’re a fashion lover and want a lot of change and novelty in your wardrobe, try renting anything you’re only going to wear once, buy designer goods on resale websites or try holding a clothing swap with your most fashionable friends. And last but not least, use your voice as a citizen. Lobby your elected leaders and fashion brands themselves to enact mores sustainable business practices.”

“Dad” fashion has been named one of the most influential trends of the year in Lyst’s annual Year in Fashion report, which uses global search data and social media mentions to identify everything that’s been trending in the industry over the last 12 months.

According to the report, this somewhat domestic trend can be defined by chunky sneakers, slouchy cardigans and “ugly” shirts, all of which have surged in online searches by 439 per cent since the beginning of the year.

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.

It’s not entirely clear how “dad” fashion became so trendy, though it’s a look that has been increasing in popularity in recent years, with Vogue dubbing it “dadcore” in 2017, when Balenciaga sent baggy blazers and stone-wash jeans down the runway for its men’s spring 2018 collection.

In June, the New York Times said “dads are now at the center of the style universe”, while the Wall Street Journal concurred, praising “dad style” for its retro appeal that prioritises comfort by way of orthopaedic-looking shoes and cosy knitwear.

Its stratospheric ascent from a heavily mocked aesthetic to a bona fide trend could also have something to do with the rise in Nineties fashion, given that the two are somewhat similar, which is also named as one of Lyst’s most powerful fashion trends of 2018.

Sport luxe, western cowboy and neon feature on the list too, alongside plastic, pre-Raphaelite prairie and sustainable, in light of many brands putting an emphasis on producing clothing that is environmentally-friendly.

The shift towards more sustainable clothing was also reflected by the trending brands of the year, with the top two – Veja and Reformation – both renowned for their eco-friendly and stylish designs.

As for which celebrities have been the most influential in the style stakes, Lyst names Kylie Jenner, Kim Kardashian and Meghan Markle as the top three, followed by Cardi B, Beyoncé and Serena Williams, whose Off-White x Nike ensemble caused a surge in demand for black tennis outfits.

Lyst tracks more than 100 million internet searches for its annual report, looking at page views, sales data, social media mentions and queries across five million fashion products from 12,000 designers and stores."
"Ms Berchtold said the move, six months in the planning, followed feedback from customers searching for alternatives to mass-produced, disposable fashion.

""We could see this was something they were looking for, we could see what search terms they would put into our site, whether they were looking for ethical or vegan,"" the former Rebel Sports managing director said.

Erica Berchtold wants to make fashion more sustainable. supplied

""It just made sense for us to take a leadership role from an Australian fashion retail perspective.

""I want to get to a point where sustainable is not abnormal. It doesn't need to be in a different area – let's make it part of mainstream fashion.""

The move comes amid growing consumer awareness of the environmental damage caused by the mass production of cheap clothing. The fashion industry is widely considered the second largest polluter after the oil industry, accounting for 20 per cent of industrial water pollution and 1.2 billion tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions.

The Iconic's ""Considered"" initiative was spearheaded by head of sustainability and ethical sourcing Jaana Quaintance-James, who joined the online retailer 18 months ago after three years as ethical sourcing manager at David Jones and more than 10 years working with non-government organisations such as Impactt, a labour standards consultancy that specialises in ethical trade and improving working conditions in the supply chain for workers.

The range kicks off with about 6500 products with sustainability attributes such as sustainable materials, environmentally or animaly friendly production, fair production and community engagement.

Boody, for example, uses organically grown bamboo to make underwear, Dr Martens and Birkenstock now make vegan boots and sandals, Australian fashion label Manning Cartell's clothes are made in accredited Ethical Clothing Australia facilities and Outland Denim provides employment and training to women rescued from human trafficking and the sex trade in Cambodia.

A lot of confusion

""There's still a lot of confusion amongst consumers and we were trying to make it a lot more straightforward to navigate,"" Ms Quaintance-James said.

""So rather than including carte blanche whole brands [the filters] apply at the SKU [stock keeping unit] level and whether or not this item has specific [sustainability] credentials.""

Ms Quaintance-James said The Iconic is aiming to lift the sustainability range from 6.5 per cent of its assortment to 10 per cent by next year.

""Tonnes of brands have said 'we don't have any of these [products] now but we're working on this for next season',"" she said.

""When we have the customer data, we'll be able to understand more about how this customer shops and we'll be able to use it to help inform brands as well."""
"Trending It's time for mindful shopping

Do you find yourself falling for clothing sales and buying on a whim? Do you have tons of items you don’t wear and throw out bags of clothes each season? It’s time to think more carefully about what we’re buying, writes Rhodé Marshall.

Modern society has to develop in more sustainable ways, which includes the rate at which we produce and buy clothing, shoes and accessories.



Sustainable fashion is when an item is made considering all the environmental and socioeconomic factors of its production. This means that constant work has to be put into improving all stages of the product’s life cycle – from design, raw material production, manufacturing, transport, storage, marketing and final sale; to use, reuse, repair, remake and recycling of the product and its components.

The ever-changing nature of trends means we all fall victim to “fast fashion”, where we buy an item that is in one season and out the next. The faster the changeover in trends, the more clothes we end up buying and ultimately throwing out again.

Creating clothing is an intensive process with a huge impact on the environment.

Highlighted in an article in The Guardian is the impact of textile production on our rivers, lakes and oceans. According to that article, microfibres from synthetic fabrics are released into our waterways and, from there, into our rivers, lakes and oceans every time they are washed in domestic washing machines.

The small size of the microfibres means they are easily consumed by fish and other wildlife.

How we shop and care for our clothing is one of many ways we can reduce our carbon footprint and protect our water sources, the Earth and public health.

Here are eight tips to green your wardrobe:

1. Shop locally: There’s an Earth-friendly benefit to this because you’ll reduce carbon emissions. The bonus is that you’ll be supporting your local economy.

2. Support sustainable brands: The benefit is that you’ll be taking business away from polluting companies in favour of ones that care about people and the planet.

3. Invest in “slow fashion”: Instead of dozens of inexpensive, “on-trend” items, invest your money in a few items of clothing that are well made, locally sourced and will stay in style forever. A closet with 10 to 12 classic, quality pieces is a long-term investment and is ultimately kinder on the environment.

4. One person’s trash is another’s treasure: Donate unwanted clothing to thrift stores or local shelters instead of throwing it out. You can also host a clothing swap with friends and family. Another idea is to sell your clothing on Bidorbuy or other online resale shops.Old T-shirts and other worn items can be reused as rags or you can grab a pair of scissors, a needle and thread, and give new life to something old. Your contribution will be that you’ll divert potential waste from landfills.

5. Save water when washing: Washing clothing only when necessary (many items can be worn multiple times before they need to be washed) means that you save water and energy.

6. Use earth-friendly detergents: Use laundry detergent without harmful, petrochemicals (petroleum-derived). This way you will play a small part in reducing toxins from entering our water and environment and reduce your carbon footprint.

7. Drip dry: Hang clothes to dry outdoors on a clothing line or a drying rack (or on a drying rack in the bathtub). Not only will you save energy, but there’s less wear-and-tear on your clothing.

8. Shop second-hand first: Buy pre-owned clothing from thrift shops, consignment shops, vintage sources and online resale shops.

ECOBRANDS THAT ARE WORTH YOUR SUPPORT

Fundudzi

Fundudzi by Craig Jacobs is a sustainable fashion brand that creates clothing with a conscience. The brand sources local organic fabrics such as cashmere, bamboo, soy and corn, as well as organic cotton from Lesotho. All items are made in Africa, employing communities in South Africa, Mozambique and Kenya.

Protect Paradise Project

South African international surfing champion Rosy Hodge’s partnership with Corona, Parley and World Surf League, the #ProtectParadise project, led the charge on the ban of single-use plastic in Indonesia. The mission was to engage audiences in more than 23 countries and resulted in 537 clean-ups, 25 000 volunteers and more than 3 million square metres of beaches cleaned. As part of this initiative, the project has produced limited edition reusable bags designed by world-renowned surfers and artists. The bags are available for pre-order and proceeds from each bag will go towards the removal of plastic from the oceans.

Spirit Girl

Born from the bubbling spirits of two Capetonians, Spirit Girl is a sustainable activewear brand that has a “passion for design, nurture for nature and love of the active lifestyle”. Custom-designed yoga pants made from recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET), such as plastic bottles, and recycled plastic (with a similar performance to virgin polyester fabrics) are woven with spandex to create a coolmax performance fabric, creating activewear that is comfy, breathable, moisture wicking and quick-drying."
"With thousands of people taking to the streets to protest climate change and hundreds arrested over it, conversations around the impact we’re having on the environment have reached fever pitch.

And few meaningful dialogues about tackling the environmental issues facing the planet would be complete without mentioning fashion. It is one of the top polluting industries – so much so that earlier this month Extinction Rebellion staged a mock fashion show on Oxford Circus in London to protest the impact of fast fashion.

This week is Fashion Revolution Week, organised by the non-profit organisation Fashion Revolution which works for a more sustainable industry. As part of the week, it has released the fourth annual Fashion Transparency Index, where 200 brands are ranked not just in terms of environmental transparency, but also with human rights issues. The fashion industry is leaving behind huge amounts of waste (Fashion Revolution/PA)

It’s also six years since the Rana Plaza tragedy in Bangladesh which killed 1,135 people working in unsafe conditions in garment factories supplying cheap clothing to some UK high street brands. So what does the index teach us about what’s changed and what should consumers and brands be doing to help create a more transparent fashion industry?

The Fashion Transparency Index

The Fashion Transparency Index isn’t about listing which brands are the most eco-friendly or who is doing the most for human rights. It’s all about how much information is publicly available regarding these topics: policy and commitments, governance, traceability, supplier assessment and remediation and spotlight issues (which focus on the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals).

Fashion Revolution has chosen 200 of the world’s largest brands and retailers across luxury and fast fashion, and has evaluated how open they are about these key issues, giving an overall transparency percentage. Sports and outdoor brands lead the charge with Adidas, Reebok and Patagonia coming in first with 64% transparency – it’s the first year ever that brands have scored more than 60%. ASOS, Puma, Nike, The North Face and Marks & Spencer were all in the 51-60% range, but depressingly the average score was just 21%.

Although the index might not immediately improve the state of the industry, it will hopefully drive change by showing brands where they can do better and making them accountable for their actions.

Founder of Fashion Revolution Carry Somers says: “We believe transparency leads to a greater accountability”, which will in turn lead to positive change in the industry.

Fashion Revolution wants the industry to adopt more concrete and measurable goals, both in terms of the environment and human rights. There has been an improvement in transparency of many of the brands listed on the index – particularly with luxury labels like Gucci and Bottega Veneta – but there is still a lot to be done. “Much of the fashion industry still operates in an opaque manner,” says Somers.

What brands need to be doing

Despite improvements from last year’s index, there’s still lots fashion labels could be doing. One particular issue which has come out of the report is a lack of information around how brands are working for gender equality, which is troubling as women make up the majority of the fashion industry, from the factories to the shop floors.

What the fashion industry does with excess stock is still a relatively murky area, which is surprising considering the uproar around the news of Burberry burning its unsold stock last year. Only 26.5% of the brands on the index are open about what they do with defective or surplus stock, the rest choosing not to disclose any details.

Fashion Revolution hopes to push more brands to publish their supply chains and make them easily accessible for anyone who wants to hold them accountable.

Some brands are taking these issues seriously. Adil Rehman, senior ethical trade manager at ASOS, says: “Without transparency there is no accountability, and without accountability there is no change.” He adds that brands have a responsibility to meet the social conscience of the customer, and transparency is the main way to build trust between the two – saying: “There is no hiding any more”.

What consumers need to be doing

The index arms consumers with more information, which can help us make more clearer choices about where we shop.

Fashion Revolution has created the hashtag #WhoMadeMyClothes – it has over 400,000 hits on Instagram and is a way for consumers to push brands into being open about their supply chains. Somers describes how an industry insider told her that every person who uses the hashtag is considered to represent 10,000 more people who want to know the same, but haven’t registered this publicly on social media.

Sarah Ditty, policy director at Fashion Revolution and author of the report, says really “the most powerful thing” consumers can do is contact brands directly, asking questions about their policies and practices as well as raising any concerns they might have about the business.

Consumers could lobby governments to do more as well – Ditty particularly mentions a need for increased pressure to make sure the Modern Slavery Act is properly enforced in the UK.

This pressure from consumers will hopefully push brands into being more open about their environmental and human rights practices across the business.

Unfortunately, it’s going to take a lot of work. Rehman from ASOS describes how consumers want a simple message, but it’s a complex topic and it’s not really as simple as being told which brands are ethical and which aren’t.

Hopefully as brands become more transparent, it will become easier to make make more informed choices about where and how we shop.

"From Meghan and Harry’s wedding to the Dolce & Gabbana debacle in Shanghai, 2018 was a big year for fashion. But it may also be remembered as the year people finally took notice of the negative environmental and social effects of an industry that’s been allowed to get out of control. And it’s hard to do this without recalling what happened in June, when we learned that Burberry had been burning £28m worth of its clothes, accessories and beauty products to safeguard its brand.

Insiders already knew that H&M was burning excess stock, but to discover that the luxury sector was at it too made many question the industry as a whole. The same month, Mary Creagh, who chairs the Commons environmental audit committee, announced she would be investigating the sustainability of the fashion industry.

She said alarm bells were ringing about the fast-growing online-only retail sector against a backdrop of the global ecological emergency. “Low-quality £5 dresses aimed at young people are said to be made by workers on illegally low wages and are discarded almost instantly, causing mountains of non-recycled waste to pile up,” she said. According to a report for the committee, UK shoppers each buy an average of 26.7kg of new clothes every year – more than any other country in Europe.

With her panel of cross-party MPs, Creagh questioned experts from brands including Marks & Spencer, Burberry and Primark, as well as the online retailers Arcadia, Boohoo, Asos and Missguided. The key issues were labour rights, flouting of the minimum wage – in factories in the UK as well as abroad – issues around waste and recycling, overproduction (in March, H&M had a stockpile of £3.4bn of unsold goods) and the urgent need to slow down and make clothes that are designed to endure. Creagh accused the industry of “chasing the cheap needle around the world”.

So it’s been a year of reckoning for the fashion industry, one in which to take stock of a wasteful, polluting, exploitative business that has been responsible for the doubling of garment production in the past 15 years, to between 80-100bn pieces of clothing a year.

However, for brands that are putting social and environmental impact at the heart of their business, 2018 has been a good year. The original organic cotton campaigner Katharine Hamnett relaunched her business in 2017, and in May she said she was fundraising for future expansion, to create a hub for sustainable manufacture in Italy. “The world has caught up with us on the sustainability aspect,” she told the Financial Times. “People have changed their tune – it’s just taken 30 years to happen.”

Elsewhere, new business models sprang up that put profit second to ethics. The London-based label Ninety Percent, which launched in February promising to distribute 90% of profits between charitable causes and its own garment-makers in Bangladesh and Turkey, was rewarded with a prime slot with the online retailer Net-a-Porter in September.

The Californian shoe brand Allbirds launched in the UK in October using a range of low-carbon options including renewable sugar cane soles. And when the Duchess of Sussex wore the Australian zero-exploitation denim brand Outland Denim on her tour in October, the company experienced a rise in sales and interest.

While social media has propelled businesses such as Boohoo and Missguided (whose CEO Nitin Passi refused to appear before Creagh’s panel) into the wardrobes of the nation’s teens and 20-somethings, it has also given individuals the opportunity to demand more from their brands. This April was the fifth anniversary of the Rana Plaza disaster, in which more than 1,100 garment workers died when the building they were working in collapsed. The Fashion Revolution campaign for a more transparent industry, which was started as a reaction to Rana Plaza, saw its hashtags, including #WhoMadeMyClothes, reach 720m impressions during April 2018 – an increase in 35% on the previous year. Citizens are asking brands to be more accountable, and brands are having to take notice.

Closing the loop has been a big buzz phrase in the sustainable fashion world since the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s report on redesigning fashion’s future in November 2017. H&M and Marks & Spencer have well-established take-back schemes to encourage customers to recycle their old clothes, and Primark has announced its own scheme for 2019. But there is still a long way to go in creating clean systems to turn these unwanted clothes back into fibre to make new clothes. Only 1% of old clothing is recycled to make new garments.

Clothing apps such as Depop continue to offer an alternative second-hand fashion economy. In the UK, the main demographic for this social shopping site is 15- to 18-year-olds, which means an entire generation is discovering that if they look after their clothes, they can sell them on and buy fresh fashion fixes secondhand. So too, rental agencies are continuing to grow in popularity. Companies such as Girl Meets Dress offer a service to women who don’t want to be seen in the same outfit twice, particularly on their social media feeds. The wardrobe rental industry is growing by 10% year on year, and is expected to reach almost £1.5bn by 2026.

Increasingly, the focus seems to be shifting to making new textiles from agricultural waste. One of the winners of this year’s Global Change awards in March was an idea called Crop-A-Porter, which takes the leftovers from the harvest of oil-seed flax, hemp, sugarcane, bananas and pineapples and turns it into a bio-fibre that could be a viable alternative to cotton and provides additional income to farmers. Similarly, Frumat leather, made from apple peel, won the Green Carpet Challenge awards in Milan in September.

Which brings us to one of the biggest changes in consumer behaviour in 2018: the rise in veganism. After Gucci announced the death of fur in October 2017, many other labels followed, most recently Chanel, which has also banned exotic skins. London fashion week went fur-free for September (although the anti-fur protesters didn’t seem to have got the memo), while Helsinki fashion week has gone further and banned animal-based leather from 2019.

Certainly, Stella McCartney, who launched “vegan Stan Smith trainers” with Adidas in September and has been leading the animal-free fashion charge for more than two decades, will be delighted at the news. In December, the designer was in Poland at COP24 to launch the United Nations fashion industry charter for climate action, with 16 commitments to promote sustainable sourcing, design, and manufacturing.

She told the Business of Fashion Voices conference in November: “It’s really about bringing everyone together as an industry, and instead of having a few people talk about it, it’s having everyone talk about it and the leaders ... actually taking responsibility, putting our money where our mouth is and making an amazing change together.” She added: “Everything is at stake.”"
"As Nicola Tabb puts it, the world is ""drowning in textiles.""

""The world is fairly out of balance in terms of everybody believing that it's OK to spend $4 on a brand new T-shirt that came from China,"" said the owner of the Better Off Duds vintage store in Saskatoon.

""That is just not feasible in any way at all.""

As mountains of used synthetic clothing are added to landfills around the world, shoppers are being urged to think more about how their buying decisions affect the planet.

In Saskatchewan, vintage store owners say shoppers are becoming increasingly aware of their buying choices.

""I saw something on Facebook the other day — when you throw something away, remember there is no 'away,'"" Tabb said.

""We've got to start taking care of our planet better and I think that this is a really important part of that.""

A responsible alternative to 'fast fashion'

According to Fashion Revolution, an advocacy group working to reduce the environmental and human impact of the fashion industry, Americans throw away about 14 million tonnes of garments every year.

A parliamentary committee has been set up in the U.K. to investigate the impact of what's called ""fast fashion"" — cheaply produced and largely disposable clothing — on the environment. No such committee has been announced in Canada and data on the amount of textiles entering landfills here is limited.

Water pollution, exploitation and poor working conditions are some of the issues associated with the fashion industry globally.

Choosing second-hand over fast fashion is one way consumers are being encouraged to shop more responsibly.

Many vintage-lovers originally chose to buy used clothing because they enjoyed the thrill of the hunt, or wanted to wear something unique that stands out in a crowd.

""I grew up in a small place — not a lot of shopping options there — and I was always very different and kind of wanted something to stand out,"" said Sarah Gaudry, who owns The Knick vintage store in Saskatoon.

""So I would make my own clothes and go to Salvation Army or Value Village and buy stuff, and take it apart and put those things back together, and that's kind of where it all really started for me.""

Over time, Gaudry has become more aware of the role of second-hand clothing in sustainability.

She said her customers have become more interested in making ethical purchases since she opened her shop three years ago.

Sustainability advocates hope more people will choose second-hand clothing and help reduce demand for fast fashion. (Alicia Bridges/CBC)

""I see a lot of people, especially in my industry, that want to know where their clothing comes from, or anything that they're buying,"" she said.

'We really need to open our eyes'

Promoting sustainability has become a passion for Saskatoon fashion blogger Tiara Jackle, who has a degree in renewable resource management from the University of Saskatchewan.

Jackle has been working to transition her wardrobe to one made up entirely of vintage and natural fabrics. She writes about ways to make better purchasing choices on the Raw Fashion blog.

Tiara Jackle is working to educate people about ways to shop more sustainably but says she comes across some resistance. (Amy Thorp Photography)

She said she is seeing readers who are more aware of their buying choices, but her efforts to offer sustainability advice are not always well-received.

""I am seeing a slow movement in people who are open-minded to the research. I am also seeing a lot of resistance,"" said Jackle.

""I think it's past the time of being able to be attracted to this whole fast fashion movement and this whole Instagram influencers movement, and I think we really need to open our eyes to how incredibly important it is that we start changing our decisions.""

Jackle said buyers who want to make more ethical purchases should be aware of ""greenwashing"" — businesses that offer false claims of sustainability.

She became an advocate for sustainability after learning about the impact of synthetic microfibres that pollute the ocean.

Washing textiles in a washing machine releases tiny strands which can make their way into the sea to be swallowed by aquatic life.

""If it's from a natural clothing fibre, such as linen and cotton, hemp, then those microfibres are not going to have any negative impact on the environment,"" she said.

""However, if synthetic or plastic microfibres are released from a synthetic garment then they have devastating impacts on the environment.""

'There is a treasure hunting aspect'

Jackle said she knows there are shoppers who don't like the idea of sifting through racks to find used clothing that is stylish, fits and is made of natural fabrics.

For those who are not enamoured by the thrill of the hunt, she suggests making a list of items that are missing from their wardrobe so they can go directly to the right part of the store for what they need.

Curated vintage stores do some of the work by choosing the best items of the bunch, although the cost may be higher than buying from a charity in some cases.

Tim and Amy Weisgarber co-own and operate T&A Vinyl and Fashion in Regina. (Emily Pasiuk/CBC)

Amy Weisgarber of T&A Vinyl and Fashion in Regina said price is part of the appeal for her customers.

""I actually think one huge part of vintage shopping is usually it is cheaper,"" said Weisgarber.

""You're competing at the same price point as those fast fashion brands. So you could buy something that's second-hand and original and better made at the same price or cheaper.""

T&A Vinyl and Fashion co-owner Tim Weisgarber says shopping for vintage clothing is more interesting because there is more variety. (Emily Pasiuk/CBC)

She believes shoppers are also choosing vintage because it lasts longer than fast fashion.

For all the ethical reasons to buy vintage clothing, shoppers also do it for fun, and because it suits their personal style, Weisgarber said.

She and T&A co-owner Tim Weisgarber said they focus a lot on the experience of their store.

""There is a treasure hunting aspect to what we're doing. The pieces are one of a kind. You're not walking up to a rack of, like, 10 of the same. So it's just more interesting.""

Vintage shop owners in Saskatoon and Regina say there is still room for more vintage stores in their respective cities.

""Most of us know each other and really enjoy chatting, and [we] help foster each other's businesses and the scene overall,"" Tim said.

""There's a lot of vintage out there and a lot of people like showing off their vintage finds — not just necessarily retailers."""
"The Australian retail industry is in crisis with four major Aussie brands closing so far in 2019.

An Instagram post from an international fast fashion retailer has been slammed for being “tone-deaf” and naive to the growing debate raising issues about the environmental and socially responsible sourcing of clothing.

Forever21’s Indian social media account re-posted a photo of an item’s label saying, “I probably won’t wear this dress again because it’s already been on my Instagram”.

The label also said the dress was “made in China” and was “100% fast fashion”.

Accompanying the post from the verified account was the comment, “now let’s be honest here”.

The sentiment infuriated many on the social media site, who said the company was promoting an irresponsible approach to the international clothing industry.

The post has also caused confusion among advocates from the sustainable fashion community because the image was initially created as a protest against fast fashion by Elizabeth Illing from advocacy group Project Stopshop.

The picture is typically and widely shared by the “sorts of people who want to address the pace of today’s fast fashion culture,” says Vogue’s sustainability editor Clare Press.

Therefore, the intention of Forever21’s Instagram was unclear.

“The post was tone-deaf, and presumably created by someone who is unaware of the changing nature of the debate around fast fashion,” Ms Press told news.com.au.

“The Instagram post uses the ‘what’s-with-that?’ emoji of the girl with her hands up, like it’s something cute, with the caption ‘let’s be honest here’.

“The suggestion is that it’s aspirational to be able to buy clothes to wear once — and let’s face it, for many people, it still is.”

Ms Press, who is the author of the Wardrobe Crisis and How we went from Sunday best to fast fashion, said global garment production has doubled in 15 years.

“At the same time, clothing use (how long we hold onto our clothes) has dived,” she said.

“According to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, clothing utilisation has fallen by 36 per cent.

“What does that mean? Basically, we’re buying fashion to throw away. Mountains of clothing end up in landfill or incinerated each year.”

“What’s more,” she says, “there’s plenty of evidence that Instagram is making it worse. Young women live in fear of being seen on Instagram wearing the same dress twice. This image is a comment on that. It’s calling out our unsustainable fashion culture. So no wonder sustainable fashionistas are calling out a fast fashion brand for posting it.”

Forever21’s Instagram post was liked 5500 times at the point of publishing, but many jumped in the comments section to share their disgust at the idea it seemed to celebrate.

“How can you promote such a post? Stop misguiding your target audience in the wrong direction just to increase your sales and profits. Reuse clothes,” one user said.

Many others said they would boycott the fast fashion company.

“I can’t follow a company that is blatantly careless with their creation of waste and effects on the environment,” one user said.

Another: “Do the people posting this actually live in India? Aren’t there countless people suffering because of the exploitation of the fashion industry? This is utterly disrespectful.”

Ms Press said it was worth noting the Instagram account in question is the Indian division of the company, which only has 106,000 followers, as opposed to the United States account where the company was founded, which has 1.6 million followers.

“Relatively speaking, these clothes are not so cheap in India, as they are, for example, in Australia and America,” she said.

“In emerging economies, brands like Zara and Forever21 can be seen as luxurious.”

Ms Press told news.com.au education and awareness of the ethical and environmental issues related to fast fashion is vital.

“Human rights, our carbon footprint, water pollution waste — these are all very serious issues,” she said.

“We need to raise awareness and offer solutions that are practical, but also enjoyable.

“If we lose fact of the sight that fashion is meant to be fun for the people who buy it, I’m pretty sure they’ll stop listening.”

"Fashion giant Zara will sell only sustainable clothes by 2025.

Parent company Inditex, which also owns labels Pull&Bear and Massimo Dutti, said all the linen, polyester and cotton sold by its brands will be organic, recycled or sustainable within six years. Those materials, alongside viscose, make up 90 per cent of the raw materials used by its brands.

Last month, online fashion retailer ASOS launched a sustainable products option for eco-conscious shoppers. It allows users to select ethically-sourced products from a range of high-profile brands.

Parent company Inditex, which also owns labels Pull&Bear and Massimo Dutti, said all the linen, polyester and cotton sold by its brands will be organic, recycled or sustainable within six years

Luxury clothing brand Net-a-Porter also launched a sustainable brand in June, called Net Sustain, which aims to promote locally made or sustainable items for customers wary of their environmental footprint.

Containers to collect old clothes for recycling will also appear in Zara stores from next year. Britons send 235million items of clothing to landfill every year, according to the most recent statistics – driven in part by fast-fashion brands selling huge quantities of cheaply made clothes.

Zara is one of the few high street labels to not use plastic bags, and Inditex said all of its brands will stop using plastic bags by 2020. The Spanish company has also committed to eliminating single-use plastic from its outlets by 2023.

The firm also runs a scheme called Join Life to identify clothes that have been made with more eco-friendly materials and processes than ordinary clothes.

Join Life-labelled clothes will make up around one quarter of the items made by Inditex brands this year, adding up to 136million garments.

Inditex chief executive Pablo Isla said: ‘Sustainability is a never-ending task in which everyone here is involved and in which we are successfully engaging all of our suppliers.’"
"Fashion giant Zara will sell only sustainable clothes by 2025.

Parent company Inditex, which also owns labels Pull&Bear and Massimo Dutti, said all the linen, polyester and cotton sold by its brands will be organic, recycled or sustainable within six years. Those materials, alongside viscose, make up 90 per cent of the raw materials used by its brands.

Last month, online fashion retailer ASOS launched a sustainable products option for eco-conscious shoppers. It allows users to select ethically-sourced products from a range of high-profile brands.

Luxury clothing brand Net-a-Porter also launched a sustainable brand in June, called Net Sustain, which aims to promote locally made or sustainable items for customers wary of their environmental footprint.

Containers to collect old clothes for recycling will also appear in Zara stores from next year. Britons send 235million items of clothing to landfill every year, according to the most recent statistics – driven in part by fast-fashion brands selling huge quantities of cheaply made clothes.

Zara is one of the few high street labels to not use plastic bags, and Inditex said all of its brands will stop using plastic bags by 2020. The Spanish company has also committed to eliminating single-use plastic from its outlets by 2023.

"Whether it’s how they’re made or what they’re made of, textiles are evolving to meet consumer demand for sustainability.

“There’s a real push for sustainability now, and the home textiles industry is waking up to that consumer call,” says Shannon Maher, chair of Home Products Development at the Fashion Institute of Technology, in New York.

It’s about reducing waste during textile production, she said, and reusing or recycling waste to produce other products.

“Zero Waste has definitely become a watchword,” she said.

Consumers today have a heightened awareness of the harm plastic does to the environment, and “are willing to pay 5 or 10% more for a sustainable product as a way of contributing to the circular economy, and helping the environment,” she says.

Rugs and outdoor fabrics, for instance, are increasingly being made with recycled materials instead of new plastics.

A lot is happening on the fashion-design front, too, to explore new, sustainably sourced and even compostable types of textiles.

“Companies like Adidas and Nike are at the cutting edge of some of these innovations, and their work - and innovations in textiles used for apparel - does trickle down to textiles in other realms,” Maher says.

An exhibit of textile innovations at the Cooper Hewitt Design Museum in New York City, on view through Jan. 20, includes a dress made by a Japanese design team that features naturally glowing silk, made from silkworms injected with a green fluorescent protein derived from jellyfish. There’s a prototype for Adidas sneakers made entirely of ocean plastic; another prototype of sneakers that would be entirely compostable; and a textile made from algae.

“There’s a level of optimism when you look around and see designers really taking on the challenge of all this,” says Andrea Lipps, a curator at the Cooper Hewitt who helped organize the exhibit. “There’s a groundswell of creativity that’s continuing to reverberate.”

At the Fashion Institute of Technology, students have been experimenting with using milkweed and flax to create luxurious “fur” from 100% plant material. That won them the Stella McCartney Prize for Sustainable Fashion at the Biodesign Challenge Summit earlier this summer.

Another student design team there came up with the idea for a Spandex-type elastic fabric using a protein found in oysters.

To help companies get the word out about steps they’re taking, and help consumers identify environmentally responsible companies, the Sustainable Furnishing Council provides an online list.

“We have about 400 member companies, and they each have made their own public and verifiable commitment to sustainability,” says Susan Inglis, executive director of the council.

Look up, say, garden furniture, and see what best practices various manufacturers have put in place.

Another effort to help consumers reliably identify more eco-friendly companies is a new level of Oeko-TEX certification, called “Made in Green,” certifying that no harmful chemicals have been used in the manufacture of a certain product.

“People are talking more these days about ‘the value chain,’ showing that not only are you certified as being environmentally responsible, but all of the factories in your production process are certified. It’s a level of transparency that includes aspects like using clean energy sources,” explains Maher.

“Sustainability is complex,” she says. From a factory standpoint, it’s also a matter of asking whether they’re solar-powered, and how much water they use.

"Like millions of viewers, I’m hopelessly addicted to Love Island in a way I never thought I would be. But my biggest problem is not so much with the show per se, it’s with fast fashion.

Q&A What is fast fashion? Show Hide 'Fast fashion' is a phrase coined to describe inexpensive clothing produced rapidly by mass-market retailers in response to the latest trends. Critics say that the industry has a large carbon footprint, and creates water and air pollution. Clothes are often manufactured in poor working conditions. Garments are manufactured cheaply, and are expected to have a short life. One in three young women, the biggest segment of consumers, consider garments worn once or twice to be old. UK consumers sent 300,000 tonnes of textiles to be burned or dumped in landfill in 2018. Without rapid reform, the fashion industry - of which fast fashion is the dominant player – could be responsible for a quarter of the Earth’s carbon budget by 2050.

Through omnipresent product placements and advertising, Love Island has turned into fast fashion’s biggest advocate. Every day, girls in the villa wear a new outfit, promoting the insidious idea that you cannot be seen in the same clothes twice. You can even shop for what the islanders wear in real time through the show’s app or via its partner I Saw It First, encouraging impulsive purchases. When Britons are already expected to buy 50m single-use outfits this summer, the show only adds fuel to the fire, or rather to the truckload of clothes that ends up in the landfill every second.

The problem is our planet cannot take more £1 bikinis. When clothes are so cheap, they are usually made out of materials derived from plastic, such as polyester or nylon. These materials can take hundreds of years to decompose in a landfill, and release thousands of microfibres during each wash, which end up in our oceans.

To keep costs down, the fast fashion industry has also been known for manufacturing in some of the lowest-wage countries, where labour and safety standards are particularly poor. Despite pledges for better working conditions in supply chains following the Rana Plaza collapse in Bangladesh in 2013, this model remains prevalent today.

Love Island has an incredible platform and the potential to influence millions of people. I wish the show used it to be a force for good, starting with fashion. The good news is there are a number of opportunities to get on the sustainable fashion path.

Reducing our consumption of virgin fibres by reusing garments is essential to tackle the throwaway culture fast fashion promotes. More and more influencers are embracing the slow fashion movement, turning to what’s already in their wardrobe rather than buying new. If Emma Watson and Livia Firth proudly re-wear outfits on the most coveted red carpets, surely islanders could do the same in the villa.

Far from the stigma it was once associated with, thrifting and upcycling are also becoming fashion statements. With the comeback of crafting, doing new with old is no longer seen as an odd thing to do. Wearing clothes that have had a previous life is an opportunity to look fashionable with one-of-a-kind pieces while reducing the need for new resources. Rather than a hundredth kissing challenge, what about harnessing the creative potential of our islanders behind a sewing machine?

After taxis and hotels, the sharing economy is on its way to disrupt the fashion industry. New business models have arisen in the past 10 years making it possible to rent, borrow or swap clothes. Their success in the market shows that clothes do not need to be brand new to feel new to consumers.

Fast fashion is eating up the planet – and this feeble government enables it | Gaby Hinsliff Read more

When new is the only option, alternatives to fast fashion do exist. A number of ethical and sustainable fashion brands have emerged, shedding a new light on the importance of better materials and fair working conditions in the supply chain. Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, has subtly turned into a sustainable fashion champion. It only takes one wear from her to make the sales of brands such as Veja or Reformation skyrocket. Could you imagine what would happen if Love Island did the same?

It’s no secret that brand partnerships generate significant revenue for reality TV. But the climate crisis we are facing is very real too, and we know for a fact that fashion plays a key role in it. So now may be a good time for Love Island to embrace its corporate social responsibility, and rethink its partnership strategy in the light of the emergency."
"A French-based online retailer of second-hand clothing is encouraging Scots to shop in a more sustainable and ethical way as it enters the UK marketplace.

Patatam, an e-retailer aiming to “bring secondhand clothing to the mainstream”, is targeting Scotland as part of its push across the Channel after officially launching the UK version of its website.

The platform, which has been operating in France since 2013, allows consumers to buy and sell “preloved” goods from high street brands including Topshop, Zara and River Island, at up to 70 per cent less than their original market prices.

The e-retailer contributes to the circular economy by selling on clothes sourced from charity shops, housing clearance centres and the public, reducing the amount of textiles sent to landfill and recycling pre-used goods.

Patatam said it differs from other online fashion marketplaces, as customers are able to send the site details of their unwanted clothing to generate a quote, before shipping the items to its warehouse free of charge by using its Patabag service. Once the clothing has passed quality control checks, the company will send payment to the seller and market the items online.

Co-founder Eric Gagnaire said: “At Patatam, we support those shoppers who want to be fashionable, but do so more ethically, by searching for or selling their pre-loved quality clothing from their favourite high street brands.

“Our mission at Patatam is to reduce the high levels of clothing waste in landfills in the UK. This can be done through purchasing the pre-loved quality clothes from the site or using our new, revolutionary Patabag, which removes the inconvenience of selling on their quality second hand clothes.

“We want to bring second hand clothing to the mainstream and make fashion shopping ethical for all involved.”"
"One in three young women in Britain consider a garment worn once or twice to be old

Fast fashion – the rapid system of trend-driven, low-cost clothing manufacture beloved by UK consumers – is on the rampage. We crossed a worrying line in 2014, scaling up garment production to 100bn pieces of new clothing a year. These are clothes, made from virgin resources, increasingly plastic, pushed out into the world with little thought as to where they will end up. Without rapid reform, the fashion industry – of which fast fashion is the dominant player – could be responsible for a quarter of the Earth’s carbon budget by 2050. This threat to the planet has, not surprisingly, attracted the attention of climate protesters. Extinction Rebellion picketed London fashion week for the first time in February.

The UK’s contribution is enormous. Not only did we invent fast fashion, but our fashion consumers are among the most voracious in the world. One in three young women, the biggest segment of consumers, consider garments worn once or twice to be old. UK consumers sent 300,000 tonnes of textiles to be burned or dumped in landfill in 2018.

Fast fashion is eating up the planet – and this feeble government enables it | Gaby Hinsliff Read more

The drive to fast fashion began from the moment Hargreaves of Oswaldtwistle built the first spinning jenny to spin cotton faster. By the 1770s the mill owner Richard Arkwright’s version could spin 20 to 30 warp threads at once. With faster material production came more ready to wear clothes. By the early 1800s the well-heeled were writing to newspapers complaining that their housemaids were asking for higher wages to fund dress purchases. The poor maids were likely to have been trying to fill the same void in their lives that we do today, but we have fallen hook, line and sinker.

To take the heat out of dressing we’re often told to think of our grandparents and the make-do-and-mend spirit of the 1940s. In reality though this period, when the purchase of civilian clothing was restricted to free up materials and shipping space for the war effort, is an anomaly. These forebears were perhaps the only ones who had a truly sustainable approach to fashion.

Ultimately fashion sped up not just the fibre production but also garment making. By the 1990s the UK’s industry had been almost entirely exported to some of the lowest wage economies on earth.

If there is one point where we should have stopped the madness it was the aftermath of the morning of 23 April 2013, when the Rana Plaza complex in Bangladesh collapsed. More than 1,300 people, mostly young female garment workers making for western brands, died in the disaster, which exposed the true cost of our fast fashion habit. The industry, however, was allowed to mark its own homework, taking control of a limited programme of reform that would retrofit factories to bring them up to minimum safety requirements. Not one brand moved to change the system.

Instead, fast fashion pushed onwards and upwards. Brands sought cheaper more compliant manufacturers in new territories, exporting the same system for production that had led to Rana Plaza to Ethiopia, the lowest-wage economy on Earth. A recent study by NYU Stern into fast fashion production at the Hawassa industrial park found workers barely covering the cost of food and transport.

This week the Manchester-based Missguided.com launched a £1 plastic polymer bikini. It serves as a reminder that the new crop of online retailers make high street fast fashion look as slow as a diplodocus. These brands are social media and Snapchat tacticians with a direct line to very young people. Digital natives “swipe up” and instantly purchase an outfit worn by someone they follow.

Consuming at this speed removes any possible moment for pause and reflection. The online fashion retailers have stripped out every barrier to purchase, even the one of not actually having the money. At Missguided.com even your £1 bikini can be purchased in instalments over four weeks using Klarna, a Swedish version of an increasing number of buy-now-pay-later platforms that do not require credit checks.

This business model might seem one that cares little for the planet, but Boohoo.com launched a sustainable collection this week. They might want to be careful overselling their commitment. H&M, one of the biggest producers of fast fashion and generator of an extraordinary number of sustainability initiatives, has run slap bang into the Norwegian Consumer Authority. Set up to police Norway’s Marketing Control Act, the NCA has concluded that H&M’s conscious collection gives consumers the impression that their clothes are more sustainable than they actually are.

This is a welcome intervention but it does not compensate for the government’s failure to help fix fashion here. The point is that we are in a fashion industry emergency, at risk of having to explain to future generations that we missed the climate change targets because we couldn’t resist a £1 bikini advertised during Love Island."
"Luxury fashion brand Burberry announced this week it will stop burning its unsold inventory.

The company burned more than $34.6 million worth of its clothing and other goods in the fiscal year that ended in June. The year before, Burberry burned almost as much. Companies sometimes destroy unsold products to maintain their exclusivity, but environmental groups have long taken issue with the practice. (The company also announced it will stop using real fur on its products.)

Clothing waste has recently become part of a larger conversation about how to make consumer products better for the environment. The amount of textiles that become waste is projected to grow to over 35 billion pounds in 2019 from 25 billion pounds in 2009, according to the Council for Textile Recycling, a nonprofit organization based in Abingdon, Md.

Of the 82 pounds of textiles, the US produces per resident per year, only 15 percent is donated or recycled and 85 percent ends up in landfills, according to the Council for Textile Recycling has found. Rubber, leather and textiles make up about 9 percent of the total municipal solid waste that has to be discarded in the US each year, even after efforts to recycle or compost it, the Environmental Protection Agency said.

Environmental groups often blame inexpensive “fast fashion” clothing brands. Some of these retailers have also taken action to help prevent waste. H&M has started its own recycling program, in which consumers can drop off unwanted clothes (H&M clothes, or not) at their stores year-round. Once H&M collects the clothes, it sends them to sorting plants which determine how they can be used or recycled.

Madewell, a women’s clothing brand owned by J.Crew, accepts used jeans from any brand and gives consumers who bring them in $20 off a jeans purchase from Madewell."
"IT is the latest form in convenience shopping - clothes so cheap they can be worn only once and then discarded without impacting on household budgets.

Fast fashion has become a byword in the industry for sparkly dresses, smart shirts and t-shirts which sell for buttons up and down the high street.

Yet now there is a growing weight of evidence the prevalence of clothing so cheap it can be easily disposed of is harming the environment - and adding to the dangers of global warming.

And experts and campaigners are warning shoppers not to add to the pile as Scotland gets into the swing of the party season and the rush of last-minute Christmas gift-giving.

Recent research on the textile industry has found that it accounts for 8 per cent - 1.2bn tonnes - of global greenhouse gas emissions.

READ MORE: Fast-fashion can be just as durable as designer brands, says academic

The UK play a large part in this, consuming almost 27kg of new clothing per head per year compared to only 9 kg in France.

Global clothing production has doubled since 2000, and it takes 700 gallons of water to make 1 t shirt, the equivalent of 3 years’ drinking water for your average person.

Politicians are now urging people to think of more sustainable options for their wardrobes, to help cut down on waste.

Labour's Environment spokesperson Claudia Beamish said: “The festive season is the time to get your glad rags on and you may look to fashion for presents for loved ones.

“Many of us are used to being mindful about recycling Christmas cards and wrapping paper – but we are more blasé about fast fashion and textile waste. But we should all consider more sustainable options when planning partywear and gifts this winter.

“Scottish Labour has set the ambitious target for Scotland of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and a shift to a more circular economy will be an important step.""

She said that around 95 per cent of the clothes that are thrown away could be recycled or reused and highlighted the work of the ‘Miixer’ Zero Waste Hub in Dunbar, East Lothian, which diverts more than 30 tonnes of material from landfill every month to reuse for community benefit through donations to charities and its shop.

Susan Guy, a Director of Miixer CIC, said: “Miixer CIC’s ‘Big Pick’ initiatives aim to alleviate local clothing poverty, create jobs and significantly reduce CO2 emissions by keeping textile waste local. Our waste is our resource.”

Last month, U.K. lawmakers wrote to the heads of online retailers including Amazon.com Inc. and Asos to seek evidence about the environmental and social impacts of selling cheap clothes.

Stella McCartney

Fashion designer Stella McCartney has also criticised the trend, saying that people needed to be more aware of the impact the clothing industry has on the planet.

She said: “People wear, on average, fast fashion about three times before it’s thrown away. We need to educate.

“Big industry leaders have a much bigger impact than I do. Business leaders have to man-up.”

At Westminster the Commons environmental audit committee (EAC) has been examining the impact of clothes production, especially those items produced cheaply and quickly.

Last month Labour MP Mary Creagh, chair of the committee, grilled representatives at fashion retailers, asking Primark's head of ethical trade and environmental sustainability Paul Lister on how the firm can justify selling T-shirts for as little as £2 or £3.

Mr Lister said: ""Primark has never done any significant advertising at all, and that can save us in any year £100m to £150m, compared to some of our larger rivals. That goes straight into price. That keeps our pricing low.""

""It's our business model that takes us to a £2 T-shirt.""

Carol Kane, joint CEO of online fashion house Boohoo, said a small number of dresses intentionally sold at a loss, to drive more traffic to the site.

Ms Kane, asked if consumers were now too accustomed to cheap, disposable clothes, said: ""I believe this all comes back to consumer demand. I've been in the industry for 32 years, and in that time I've seen prices decline.""

Jamie Beck, from the Arcadia group, which includes Topshop, Dorothy Perkins and Burton, said that people should not throw away clothes which can still be used, adding: ""These garments aren't designed to be a disposable item, to be bought for [just] a holiday. They're designed to be long-lasting."""
"There’s a powerful message resounding from such big brands as Eileen Fisher and Patagonia, along with a growing cadre of smaller thrift and resale shops: Let’s make do, reuse, recycle.

It’s back-to-school time, which means the advertisements are everywhere: Buy! Buy! Buy! Pencils and gadgets. Backpacks and sneakers. And, yes, heaps and piles of brand-new clothes.

But this year, those ads are running up against another powerful message, resounding from such big brands as Eileen Fisher and Patagonia, along with a growing cadre of smaller thrift and resale shops: Let’s make do, reuse, recycle.

Fast-fashion trends, driven by consumer taste and innovations in textile manufacturing, have overstuffed American closets. Clothes shopping has emerged as a weekly habit, and people are constantly clearing out and buying new.

35 billion Pounds of textiles Americans will throw away in 2019, according to the Council of Textile Recycling. 98 million Estimated tons of resources the global textile industry uses per year, chiefly water and energy.

It’s a big problem. In 2019, Americans will throw away more than 35 billion pounds of textiles, according to the Council for Textile Recycling. That’s nearly double the number from 1999.

It’s more important than ever, environmental advocates say, to keep that clothing out of landfills.

“We’re trying to take responsibility,” said Eileen Fisher, whose eponymous fashion brand buys back its garments from customers at $5 each and reworks the material into new merchandise, under its Renew brand, at factories in Irvington, New York and Seattle. It bought back its millionth garment in May.

Fisher lives near the former printing warehouse in Irvington that the company converted into its Renew sewing factory. She walked through its clothing-intake center, wearing a gray and white kimono coat made from patches of Eileen Fisher clothing scraps that were turned into felt.

At an early stage in her 34-year-old company, Fisher said she and her co-workers grew alarmed at the environmental toll of clothing manufacturing — from depleted farm fields to dye pollution in rivers. Her company’s reuse efforts have expanded into its Circular by Design mission, in which today’s clothes become tomorrow’s raw materials.

“We need to move from a use-and-discard economy to a reuse economy,” she said. Its remade clothes are specially tagged and sold in Eileen Fisher stores, in pop-up shops and in several Nord­strom locations. A $250 jacket gets a second life at $90. “As manufacturers, we want to treasure the resources we’re using, to make clothing that lasts and can be repurposed. We want customers to value our clothes.”

Patagonia, the Ventura, California-based outdoor clothier, has for decades been a worldwide leader in this closed-loop system of manufacturing and reuse.

“As individuals, the best thing we can do for the planet is to buy less and keep our stuff in use longer,” said Rose Marcario, Patagonia’s president and CEO. “The simple act of extending the life of our garments through proper care and repair reduces the need to buy more over time.”

98 million tons

It’s estimated that the global textile industry uses 98 million tons of resources a year, chiefly water and energy. Fabric dyes have polluted major rivers in India, Bangladesh, China and other countries.

The plight of underpaid workers producing fast fashion in unsafe factories has sparked outrage expressed in documentaries and books.

The large and ambitious buyback, repair and repurpose operations signal a fundamental shift in consumers’ relationship with clothing.

One vision of the future works like this: Brands manage the products they make after consumers use them. Consumers buy garments with the idea of keeping them as long as possible, and then the brand repairs and resells them.

If garments are too damaged to be donated or resold, they will be “upcycled” into new clothing or recycled into fibers. So, for instance, a favorite shirt may one day provide the fiber that insulates a home. Or the fabric of a sofa. A garment might have six or seven life cycles.

Repurposing “can be made into a business that’s profitable,” Fisher said, noting that her company’s Renew operation brings in $3 million of the company’s $450 million in annual sales.

To amplify the philosophy that resource stewardship can be profitable, the Eileen Fisher company is an active member of Business for Innovative Climate and Energy Policy and the American Sustainable Business Council, joining like-minded ventures such as Nike, Seventh Generation and Starbucks. “We don’t want sustainability to be our edge,” Fisher said. “We want it to be universal.”

Patagonia facility

At its huge service center in Reno, Nevada, Patagonia houses a repair facility where 70 full-time employees replace zippers, patch rips and renew and return items that customers may have bought decades before.

The company’s Worn Wear program, begun in 2005, includes cute clapboarded rigs that make regular tours to U.S. college campuses and ski resorts and to international locations, teaching customers how to repair items. Shoppers can sell used Patagonia items in good condition back to the company and buy “certified, pre-owned” Patagonia gear at discounted prices online.

To further the cause, Cynthia Power, facilities manager for Eileen Fisher’s Renew, is kept busy showing other clothing manufacturers how its 40 employees mend, overdye, resew or felt (a way of processing fabric) buyback silk, wool, cashmere and cotton.

“This is where our industry is going,” Powers said, watching as head designer Carmen Gama pinned a jumpsuit for Renew’s fall 2019 line using fabric from five pairs of used black jeans. The recycled textiles also are turned into wall hangings, pillows, coats, vests and kimono jackets.

“Waste can be art,” Eileen Fisher designing artist Sigi Ahl said.

The pillows are sold at ABC Home stores, and a Paris gallery sells the wall art. Both types of product were displayed in June at the American Institute of Architects’ sustainable exhibit at the Javits Center in New York.

Fiber studied

The Renew program also studies fiber wear and clothing-construction techniques to generate performance data — such as how well a particular material held up — that it puts on Excel spreadsheets, Fisher said. The information “inspires the main fashion line” to do better, she said.

Todd Copeland, Patagonia’s environmental-responsibility manager, said the company, a founding member of the Sustainable Apparel Coalition, has long turned yarns made from plastic bottles into fleece, for example, and made fabric from plant fibers such as eucalyptus.

He said Patagonia has relationships with at least 85 finished goods factories in 17 countries, at least 150 material suppliers in 25 countries and at least 200 farms, and the company examines them all for business capability, quality, environmental impact and social impact.

He said the efforts help the company: “Customers are looking for a brand with values that resonate with them.”

It’s back-to-school time, and Kidding Around, a children’s resale shop in Clive, Iowa, has been hopping for weeks. July, August and September are the store’s busiest months, and there is brisk turnover of the 18,000 secondhand clothing items for sale.

The 4,000-square-foot store, outside Des Moines, is open seven days a week. A staff of nine keeps up with the flow of garments coming in and going out. Parents drop off lightly worn clothing and never-worn garments — “new with tags” in resale parlance — and receive cash or store credit.

The appeal of resale?

“People have so much stuff it’s unbelievable,” owner Diane Fitzgerald said. “And they like the concept that they can reuse and recycle their items.”

The number of thrift, consignment and resale businesses has exploded in recent years, growing by 7 percent annually, according to trade association figures.

Online, a new crop of resale shops such as ThredUp and Vinted has emerged, as well as internet-only sales platforms sponsored by traditional thrifts such as Goodwill and the Salvation Army.

These time-honored nonprofits face increased competition because of the nationwide expansion of for-profit chains such as Clothes Mentor, Buffalo Exchange and Plato’s Closet.

Clothing-rental companies such as Rent the Runway, another form of recycling, have also been booming.

Now, one out of six Americans shops for resale clothing. But only about 15 percent of clothing in America is recycled.

At a textiles summit in New York in October, Ben Rose, representing the city’s Sanitation Department, disclosed a stunning figure. Each year, on the day of the New York City Marathon, runners shed as much as 100 tons of clothing. His department places collection bins inside apartment buildings. Most of the textile waste it collects goes to salvage and is turned into such products as wiping cloths, auto insulation and carpet padding.

Industries stepping up

Worldwide, less than 1 percent of the material used to produce clothes is eventually recycled, according to an Ellen MacArthur Foundation report. The waste causes major environmental damage and the annual loss of about $100 billion of potentially useful textiles that are burned or buried in landfills.

Some industries are stepping up. Airlines such as Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta and KLM are recycling uniforms, blankets and cushion fabrics, which are turned into totes, luggage tags and stuffed animals.

Unlike recent changes in the food industry, where restaurants and corporations responded to consumer demands for more healthful food, much of the initiative on combating textile waste is coming from forward-thinking clothing companies and industry associations.

The summit in New York on innovations in textile manufacturing, waste reduction and reuse brought together a large roster of groups working on the problem, including the Product Stewardship Institute, Textile Recovery, the New York state Pollution Prevention Institute and the New York Product Stewardship Council.

College students have been early adopters of the waste-reduction issue. A campus-based nonprofit, the Post-Landfill Action Network, has chapters at about 100 universities across North America.

The group promotes plastic-free campuses, food recovery and composing programs, efforts to salvage items students discard when they move out at the end of the year and campus thrift stores.

“It’s a young people’s movement,” said Ahl, the designing artist at Eileen Fisher. “They’re rethinking consumerism. Just like in fast food, things must change.”"
"Press Release – Blocktexx

Australian Fashtech Company Blocktexx Joins Forces with New Zealands the Formary to Develop Textile Recycling And Waste SolutionsAustralian Fashtech Company Blocktexx Joins Forces with New Zealand’s the Formary to Develop Textile Recycling And Waste Solutions

On the eve of New Zealand’s first circular economy conference, Australian fashion technology company BlockTexx announces a working partnership with New Zealand textile research company The Formary to develop strategies and workflow models for recycling and repurposing the world’s tsunami of textile waste.

BlockTexx founders, Adrian Jones and Graham Ross are in Auckland this week to attend the Circular Economy Summit, a collaboration between the Sustainable Business Network’s Circular Economy Accelerator and WasteMINZ.

“Australia and New Zealand, like the rest of the world, face enormous challenges to address the textile waste created by fast fashion,” says Mr Ross. “The Formary is a leader in this space and we believe our focus at BlockTexx on using technology to unlock the immense value in textile waste along the entire supply chain strongly complements The Formary’s expertise.”

Graham Ross will join a line-up of world-leading experts and practitioners presenting at the summit on Wednesday 29 August, and will demonstrate the value the blockchain technology can bring to the circular economy.

Bernadette Casey, Creative Director The Formary says “On 1st August the world had consumed a year’s worth of resources in just 7 months (www.overshootday.org). It is now crucial that we move away from the current linear clothing model that churns out 100 billion units a year, to a system where we draw fewer natural resources and capture far greater value from the clothing we currently discard.”

Peter Thompson, CEO The Formary, Sustainable Business Network Board member on the SBN Circular Economy Advisory Group believes “the summit offers a real opportunity to accelerate the growing movement towards circularity in the NZ economy unlocking billions of dollars of value that is currently lost. The only way we can solve the massive challenges of global warming and resource scarcity is through collaboration and we are excited to be joining forces with the team at BlockTexx, combining textile, technology and market place expertise to advance the clothing industry to a resource respectful, financially valuable circular system.”

Textile waste is an enormous and rapidly worsening worldwide problem with fast fashion and high consumption driving the creation of one hundred billion garments each year. Less than one percent of global textile waste is recycled, most is shipped to developing countries where the vast majority ends up in landfill. As part of the 2020 Circular Fashion System Commitment, 94 global fashion brands including H&M and Adidas have committed to addressing the ‘take, make and dispose’ approach to textile manufacturing, including increasing the use of recycled textiles across their product range.

On the eve of New Zealand’s first circular economy conference, Australian fashion technology company BlockTexx announces a working partnership with New Zealand textile research company The Formary to develop strategies and workflow models for recycling and repurposing the world’s tsunami of textile waste.

BlockTexx founders, Adrian Jones and Graham Ross are in Auckland this week to attend the Circular Economy Summit, a collaboration between the Sustainable Business Network’s Circular Economy Accelerator and WasteMINZ.

“Australia and New Zealand, like the rest of the world, face enormous challenges to address the textile waste created by fast fashion,” says Mr Ross. “The Formary is a leader in this space and we believe our focus at BlockTexx on using technology to unlock the immense value in textile waste along the entire supply chain strongly complements The Formary’s expertise.”

Graham Ross will join a line-up of world-leading experts and practitioners presenting at the summit on Wednesday 29 August, and will demonstrate the value the blockchain technology can bring to the circular economy.

Bernadette Casey, Creative Director The Formary says “On 1st August the world had consumed a year's worth of resources in just 7 months (www.overshootday.org). It is now crucial that we move away from the current linear clothing model that churns out 100 billion units a year, to a system where we draw fewer natural resources and capture far greater value from the clothing we currently discard.”

Peter Thompson, CEO The Formary, Sustainable Business Network Board member on the SBN Circular Economy Advisory Group believes “the summit offers a real opportunity to accelerate the growing movement towards circularity in the NZ economy unlocking billions of dollars of value that is currently lost. The only way we can solve the massive challenges of global warming and resource scarcity is through collaboration and we are excited to be joining forces with the team at BlockTexx, combining textile, technology and market place expertise to advance the clothing industry to a resource respectful, financially valuable circular system.”

Textile waste is an enormous and rapidly worsening worldwide problem with fast fashion and high consumption driving the creation of one hundred billion garments each year. Less than one percent of global textile waste is recycled, most is shipped to developing countries where the vast majority ends up in landfill. As part of the 2020 Circular Fashion System Commitment, 94 global fashion brands including H&M and Adidas have committed to addressing the ‘take, make and dispose’ approach to textile manufacturing, including increasing the use of recycled textiles across their product range.

"Global fast-fashion giant Hennes & Mauritz's use of the word sustainable to describe one of its summer collections is being questioned by a Norway consumer agency.

According to Ecotextile, the company has run afoul of the Norwegian Consumer Authority, which claims the brand's Conscious collection misrepresents its ""sustainability credentials"" with ""symbols, statements and colors.""

H&M describes the collection, including t-shirts, knit blouses, and shoulder-baring frocks, as ""sustainable fashion pieces that make you both look and feel good.""

In Norway, companies must comply with the Marketing Control Act, which includes language to prevent them from making vague or false claims. It states that brands should be able to provide documentation ""to substantiate factual claims made in marketing, including as to the properties or effect of products."" (A garment's claims of eco-friendliness or sustainability are considered technical properties.)

Norway's marketing act also bans misleading omissions. A marketing claim is considered misleading if it omits or hides information consumers need to make informed decisions, or the information is presented ""in an unclear, unintelligible, ambiguous or unsuitable manner."" In other words, companies selling products in Norway can't say their products are eco-friendly or sustainable without explaining how they're eco-friendly or sustainable.

“Our opinion is that H&M [is] not being clear or specific enough in explaining how the clothes in the Conscious collection and their Conscious shop are more sustainable than other products they sell,” Bente Øverli, deputy director general at Norway’s Forbrukertilsynet, or Consumer Authority, told Quartz. “Since H&M [is] not giving the consumer precise information about why these clothes are labelled Conscious, we conclude that consumers are being given the impression that these products are more sustainable than they actually are.”

Contacted by Fortune for comment, H&M emphasized: ""What the Norwegian Consumer Authority is looking into is whether the information we’re providing connected to our Conscious products is precise enough. They’re not looking into whether our products are sustainable or not.""

The Swedish company said it's ""pleased"" the Norwegian agency wants ""to work with us and help us provide correct and clear information to consumers.""

H&M's sustainable marketing

While H&M doesn't specify why its Conscious collection is sustainable, it does use marketing to describe the company's sustainability goals.

On H&M's U.S. website, a white, smocked camisole from its Conscious collection contains 99% polyester and 1% elastane. Under the ""sustainability"" tab on the product page, H&M describes a company-wide mission to use 100% recycled or ""other sustainably sourced materials"" by 2030. For""elastane,"" a statement reads: ""The fiber is made from oil which is a fossil resource. We are exploring the development of sustainable alternatives to conventional elastane, such as recycled elastane and bio-based elastane.""

Describing ""polyester,"" H&M advises: ""Conventional polyester is a commonly used artificial fibre made from fossil resources (crude oil). We are constantly striving to increase our use of recycled polyester; a more sustainable option made from waste such as plastic (PET) bottles."" (There are no details whether the specific product, a white shirt, was made from recycled polyester or alternative elastane.)

Sustainable fashion facts

Fast-fashion companies such as H&M sell budget clothing and accessories on-trend. The environmental impact of cheap clothes, with customers buying more and with increased frequency, is huge.

According to Elizabeth Reichart and Deborah Drew at World Resources Institute, a global environmental think tank, ""the average consumer bought 60% more clothes in 2014 than in 2000, but kept each garment for half as long."" It takes 2,700 gallons of water to make a single shirt, and making a pair of jeans"" produces as much greenhouse gases as driving a car more than 80 miles.""

The WRI report also noted that because world economies are growing, there is increased demand for clothing, and clothing production has doubled in the past 15 years. The world GDP is expected to increase by 400% by 2050, which means demand for clothing will increase.

A New York University report showed that sustainability-marketed products accounted for 16.6% share of the consumer goods market in 2018, but delivered more than half of its growth. According to the 2019 Pulse of the Fashion Industry Report, 75% of consumers view sustainability as very or extremely important. Half of consumers said they would switch brands if another brand acts more environmentally and socially friendly than their preferred one.

But what does it mean for a company or product to be sustainable? There's no simple answer.

""I don't think for the sector there is a clear definition,"" said Cynthia Cummis, director of Private Sector Climate Mitigation at WRI.

""There are lots of things a company could be doing, but I don't think there's a clear definition of what actions a company would need to take that, collectively, would make their products or company considered sustainable,"" she said.

Among steps fashion companies can take toward sustainability: ""They would need to be very transparent about what raw materials they use, and how efficient their processes are, and what kind of recycling practices they have in place for their materials,"" Cummis said. ""There's lots of questions they would need to answer.""

"HONOURED: Dr Precious Moloi-Motsepe is chief executive of African Fashion International.

JOHANNESBURG - Synthetically -produced fast fashion has proven to be harmful to our environment, and the exploitation of garment workers has become a condemned practice. Natural, sustainable and quality fibres are the new clothing trend, driven primarily by consumers in luxury markets. The local wool industry offers avenues for investments in manufacturing because of its increasing export demand. Imported clothing has made it difficult to assess the conditions under which the garments were produced and the materials were sourced.

Trendy fast fashion has resulted in frequent discarding of clothing, filling landfills with unnatural waste, and controversial competition between producing factories to supply the cheapest labour.

The demand for ethical supply chains is spreading with the rise of conscious consumerism, forcing designers to find moral selling points that appeal to the changing market.

South Africa’s rural farming population provides a reputable solution that aligns with sustainable living.

South Africa is the world’s largest mohair producer, and fifth largest producer of wool. This direct access to raw materials, combined with growing African design talent, can create a “Made in South Africa” brand that is synonymous with uplifting communities toward independence. African designers are known for incorporating meaning, inclusive of material significance, into their designs.

Renowned South African designer Laduma Ngxolo has an instinct for designing knitwear inspired by his Xhosa culture. His winter collections comprise solely locally sourced pure-bred merino wool and mohair. Laduma’s brand MaXhosa demonstrates an inspiring case for developing local clothing manufacturing.

BKB, an agricultural authority in South Africa, reported that South Africa contributed only 1percent to global wool production in the 2016/17 season. Of this, 92percent of locally sourced wool was exported and only 6percent was sold locally for manufacturing.

South Africa is missing out on accruing benefits from a crucial link in the clothing value chain. The exported wool is being transformed into knitwear with greater economic value in countries such as Scotland, where luxury brand Chanel sources their artisanal skilled labour. This recognition of wool manufacturers goes as far as the 13th century, when wool guilds in Florence - where masters taught their apprentices manufacturing skills - evolved into the wealthiest people in society.

Developing local specialised skills for knitwear production can generate substantially more returns through value-added exports. During the 2017/18 season, almost 50million kilograms of wool was sold at a value of almost R5billion in South Africa. Yet, the market is capable of more than double that. It is estimated that South Africa has 15 million merino sheep, with as many as 9000 commercial producers and 50000 small-scale farmers. Wool, a sustainable textile for high-quality clothing, opens up the opportunity for local farmers and manufacturers who are capable to satisfy the demand.

Cape Wool reports that Hewu, a semi-rural town in the Eastern Cape, is rebuilding a culture of wool farming.

Through partnerships between the Zulukama Trust, local government and key participants in the wool industry more young people and women are being absorbed.

The traditional transference of knowledge, between elders and the youth, are recreated within these collaborative efforts. Adding to this is the labour-intensiveness of the industry. Investing in clothing and textile manufacturing hubs creates employment within each province, and reduces the number of young people migrating to cities to find work. The provision of opportunities for the youth, in their home town, empowers them and their families directly.

Ivili Loboya, a wool manufacturing factory located in Butterworth, positioned themselves to harvest from more than 3million communal sheep farmers, the majority of whom are women in the Eastern Cape.

Ivili Loboya also sources mohair, silk and cotton from local farmers and is the first manufacturer of wool in the country who works with farming co-operatives. Their factory consists of a group of women who hand spin yarns for high-end customers, and another group of women who produce machine-knitted garments and other fashion and homeware items.

These specialised skills are outsourced to local and international fashion and interior designers.

South Africa could provide the solution to fast fashion, with designers selling individuality and garments that are inclusive of storytelling and culture. The fashion industry’s circular economy emphasises: redesigning to reduce pollution and improve durability; recycling materials for re-use; and the use of renewable resources in production.

African Fashion International (AFI) recently partnered with Fashion 4 Development in New York enabling six African designers to collaborate with international luxury brands, using only sustainable fabrics in their garments. Many of the designers chose to incorporate wool. While growing international demand for wool impacts the lives of farming communities, investment in manufacturing offers impact on a national scale.

Artisan training and incubation programmes such as AFI’s Fastrack can produce skills that boost related industries as a catalyst for processing local raw materials like wool. South Africa’s unemployment rate largely affects black women and the youth, who are not in school. Ethical and luxury clothing manufacturing can provide living wages that break the cycle of poverty and inequality for notable social transformation.

"Sustainable eco friendly and biodegradable clothing

Burnham, United Kingdom - February 22, 2019 /PressCable/ —

Sustainable fashion or eco friendly fashion is on the rise. With clothing today costing as little as less than £5, it is possible that fashion / clothing can becoming single use items / clothing. Fast fashion can generally be low cost clothing that is manufactured very quickly to meet the demands for the latest trends.

Because the clothing is so cheap, one can afford to throw away clothes that have been worn just once or few times and as a result this most definitely impacts the environment and climate change.

There has been a rise in popularity of sustainable clothing. Body4Real Organic Cotton clothing is a range that uses organic cotton that follows the ‘cradle to cradle’ philosophy: born from the Earth and returned to the Earth.

Body4Real Organic Cotton Clothing is pure certified Organic Fair-Trade cotton that essentially uses not only 100% pure certified, undyed-cotton, but it also strives to ensure every step in the production process is ethical and pure. Because the fabric has not been dyed, range comes in cotton’s natural colours Brown, Ecru and Green. Ecru is a light beige or fawn. The word comes from French écru, ‘raw’ or ‘unbleached’

Ethically produced, pure untreated organic cotton clothing can be beneficial to those who suffer with extreme allergies or MCS (Multiple Chemical Sensitivity).

This is a completely pure and biodegradable textile. The cotton from this range can be left on the ground and will end up completely decomposing.

"One of the most popular online “haul” videos was made by the YouTube star and “influencer” Zoella. A haul video, for those who find their own shopping tedious let alone thinking about other people’s shopping, is where a young woman (usually) unpacks the bounty from a shopping trip. They are strangely watchable and they are certainly popular.

Zoella’s most watched video – entitled Huge Spring Primark Haul, in which she talks the viewer through 24 purchases from the cheap high street store – has had more than 4.25 million views; she says things such as “You can never have too many pyjama bottoms, especially from Primark because they are such good value for money and you get a lot. A lot.”

You don’t have to be even a vaguely committed environmentalist to feel dismayed at our addiction to cheap, fast fashion and the amount that is produced each year – 100 billion garments. In March, it was reported that the high street chain H&M had $4.3bn of unsold clothes. Meanwhile, Amazon is pushing its way into fashion retail.

The industry is – thanks to the boom in fast fashion boom that has been growing since the 2000s – one of the most polluting. A BBC documentary, Fashion’s Dirty Secret, to be screened on Monday night, highlights many of the horrors and also shows how the public underestimates its environmental impact.

Presenter Stacey Dooley travels to the Aral sea – more of a puddle now, thanks to the water being diverted to irrigate Uzbekistan’s cotton fields. Communities have been destroyed, disease is rife because of carcinogenic dust, and even the weather has been affected. “Did I know cotton was capable of this? Course I didn’t. I had no idea,” says Dooley in the film.

She also goes to Indonesia, where people are washing in, and cooking with, water polluted with toxic chemicals from clothing factories. The big brands, such as Primark and Asos, refused to talk to her, and a government statement was pitiful, so she turned her attention to the so-called fashion influencers on social media, “to confront another part of the problem” – the constant hunger for new things and the normalisation of disposable clothing. Could influencers, she asks, be one way of getting us to change the way we shop?

It seems optimistic, but possible. “They don’t just use their platforms to sell aesthetics, they’re also using their platforms for a positive change,” says the style blogger and writer Susie Lau, who appears in the documentary. “They have a sway over many issues. A lot of influencers will be very aware of their voices.”

In the film, the influencers Dooley meets seem horrified by her footage. “We don’t want to be promoting certain brands or fast fashion knowing this is going on… we’re not doing that on purpose,” says the lifestyle blogger Niomi Smart, who has 1.6 million Instagram followers.

“It’s all about allowing people to know they can wear the same outfit more than once, or swap clothes. Let’s talk about this. What can we do to make more of an effort towards being more conscious of the environment?”

The YouTube haul video is one of the most conspicuous manifestations of consumer fashion culture, but it is Instagram which is the most powerful platform for fashion influencers, such as Chiara Ferragni, Julia Engel and Danielle Bernstein and the brands clamouring to work with them. Figures from InfluencerDB, a marketing analysis company, estimated that the top 20 fashion brands received more than $650m of “earned media value” (what they would have spent on traditional advertising) from exposure on Instagram by influencers paid to promote their products.

“There is so much fashion in the marketplace that it’s hard to make a choice, so the influencer provides a shortcut,” says Patsy Perry, senior lecturer in fashion marketing at the University of Manchester. Fashion brands increasingly work on getting products to consumers as fast as possible, sometimes in as little as two weeks. “The cycle is speeded up – we buy more stuff, not keep it as long, and then we’re on to the next trend,” says Perry.

There has been a bit of a backlash against hauls, says Orsola de Castro, founder and creative director of the Fashion Revolution movement, which has worked with “haulers” to encourage a more sustainable approach. The response so far has been mixed, she says. “I’m afraid many go back to what they were doing.”

For every influential Instagrammer who decides to champion more sustainable fashion, there must be tens more eager to focus on the fast fashion gap. De Castro laughs. “I think more like thousands. This is a new business model and it’s at its peak so it is difficult to turn it around and make it more sustainable because ultimately we’re talking about slowing down, and for social media and the influencers it’s the opposite – they’re running at maximum speed.”

Kate Nightingale, a consumer and fashion psychologist, cautions against the idea that influencers can change the industry alone. “It depends how much the industry will be listening,” she says. “I work with brands and some listen to consumers, some pretend that they do and some don’t care about it at all.” But the power doesn’t only reside with the influencer and consumer, she says. “It’s the investors, the structure of the company, all of those things have to change for the brands to start changing the whole industry.”

Brands are listening – she points to Primark stocking sustainable cotton as one small example – but changing the industry will not be easy. People are used to cheap fashion, and new collections every few weeks when it used to be “just two or four maximum a year”. Perry adds that it’s hard to imagine the huge fashion brands switching to a business model “that is not based on selling more stuff. It’s not really on the agenda of companies.”

Is it unfair to blame influencers for the rise of disposable fashion?

Lau thinks so. “I think fashion as a whole, we’re all in the business of selling new things to consumers, it’s not influencers alone,” she says. “The only difference is that[But] influencers operate through social media and it can feel like you’re seeing new clothes, constantly. The speed of it has changed, and the platforms have changed, but the industry as a whole has a lot to answer for. If you look at fashion magazines, how much is dedicated to sustainable fashion? Or how many of their advertisers are supportive of sustainable fashion? So I think this is an issue that the whole of the industry needs to tackle.”

It would be wrong to overstate the singular power of influencers, she says. “If American Vogue suddenly decided not to shoot any collection that didn’t [use] materials that were sustainably sourced, that would have a much bigger sway than if influencers suddenly decided to boycott fast fashion.”

She adds “I don’t necessarily believe [that] all fast fashion is evil, I think companies can change their processes and they have the scale and financial clout to do it.”

De Castro thinks people are waking up to the environmental impact of their clothing choices, and she hopes fast fashion will become demonised in the same way plastic recently has. “I think it’s going to go that way with clothes,” she says. “Within a few years, we will be so aware of this mass of stuff that we’re buying and getting rid of that it’s not going to be so cool for a hauler to say ‘I bought all this’. [This] won’t look fashionable once we’ve got issues with water, for instance. When it becomes visible, there will be a reaction against it.”"

Fashion designer Katharine Hamnett has described proposals by MPs to impose a 1p-per-garment fashion tax on the industry as ""stupid"".

The suggestion was made by a Commons committee in an effort to fund better recycling of clothes.

It came amid growing fears that the industry is increasingly dominated by throwaway ""fast fashion"".

But Ms Hamnett said she feared the garment industry would just end up paying workers less to absorb the tax.

Instead, she is in favour of EU legislation making it mandatory for goods from outside Europe to meet the same standards required by the region.

She told the BBC that taxing retailers would be ""like putting a plaster on a septic wound"".

""The reason we say legislation is that the brands are not going to do it willingly - we've seen that, we've been talking about this for too long and nothing's changed. They have to be forced by law,"" the designer, who is known for her political slogan T-shirts and ethical fashion activism, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

""Wouldn't it be better to force brands to pay their workers properly, and not discharge toxic chemicals into the environment, rather than making them pay for the privilege to do that?""

Ending 'throwaway clothes'

Over the last two years, concerns have been increasingly raised about the environmental impacts of ""fast fashion"".

According to Stella Claxton of Nottingham Trent University's clothing sustainability research group, falling prices, social media marketing and the convenience of online shopping have led to British shoppers buying twice as many items of clothing as they did a decade ago.

And because clothes are so much cheaper, consumers have fewer qualms about throwing away good clothes when they have too many.

The UK now throws away a million tonnes of clothes a year, 20% of which end up being dumped. Discarded clothes are piling up in landfill sites and synthetic fibre fragments are flowing into the sea when clothes are washed, where they are ingested by fish.

The fashion industry is said to be worth £28bn to the UK economy, but it is estimated to produce as many greenhouse gases as all the planes flying in the world.

In June, MPs on the House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) put forward 18 recommendations aimed at forcing the fashion industry to reform environmental and labour practices in its supply chain.

The proposals include:

Clothing makers to pay 1p per item to fund recycling schemes

Tax changes to reward re-use, repair and recycling - to support responsible fashion companies

A ban on incinerating or landfilling unsold stock that can be re-used or recycled instead

Mandatory environmental targets for fashion retailers with a turnover above £36m.

Prof Dilys Williams, director of the Centre for Sustainable Fashion at London College of Fashion, is in favour of taxes being imposed on new clothing.

""[The price listed] isn't actually the full price of the garment, so the tax would help. Also, people need to realise they're being duped,"" she told the BBC.

""We're spending more on clothes than we used to.""

Amber Kim, a BA graduate of London College of Fashion, is making clothes out of discarded tents, because she was appalled by the waste generated at music festivals.

She is fundamentally opposed to the fast fashion trend: ""I don't really want to own any denims because... it uses a lot of water to make one pair of jeans.

""You can't just keep buying new things and have that shopping habit."""
"I’ve always thought of myself as someone who cares about the environment. I’ve recycled for as long as I can remember, I’m on my way to having a plastic-free kitchen and I always try to take public transport instead of driving. But until last year I was guilty of unknowingly contributing to 1m tonnes of waste a year, more carbon emissions than the shipping and aviation industries combined, and microplastics ending up in the ocean – just by buying new clothes.

A cross-party report has found that people today buy and discard clothes faster than ever, and it means we get rid of more than 1m tonnes of clothes a year, with £140m worth going to landfill every year. The implications of this are so bad that there have been recent claims that the fashion industry can be listed alongside the oil industry as one of the five most polluting industries in the world.

MPs are desperately trying to change this and have announced a number of recommendations, from tax incentives for companies that offer repair services for clothes, to adding a 1p tax on every clothing item sold in the UK to help pay for better clothing collection and recycling. They are simple recommendations but they could have a huge impact on sustainable fashion and our environment. Few of us would notice a single penny added to a purchase – yet it could raise millions to improve recycling.

The problem is that these measures aren’t enough. Raising taxes will not suddenly reduce the 1.2bn tonnes of carbon dioxide produced each year by the clothing industry, let alone the water shortage caused by the 10-20,000 litres of water used in the production of a shirt and a pair of jeans. It has to be a conscious and deliberate change made by clothing brands, and consumers who are addicted to “fast fashion”.

On average, Britons buy 26.7kg of fashion items each year, compared with 16.7kg in Germany, 14.5kg in Italy and 12.6kg in Sweden. It has become part of our culture, especially for people like me who grew up with shops such as Primark, where we could buy an entire outfit for under £20.

It’s no wonder that teens and university students now save up to buy new wardrobe-fulls for less money than it costs to buy an M&S jumper. Why would they pay £50 for one dress when they could buy five tops on websites such as Missguided and Boohoo (both sites that the MPs’ report cited for failing to prioritise sustainability)?

These clothes will fall apart quickly. The government has suggested teaching kids to sew at school to counter this, but the issue isn’t that they don’t know how to – it’s that they don’t want to. The idea isn’t to buy an item of clothing for life, it’s to get another hit of instant gratification. With social media, outfits are remembered for ever, and you only have to look at tabloid headlines to see how much we judge women for rewearing clothes.

High street brands are also to blame. While they used to just update stock for every season, a number of chains now release a new range every fortnight, or even week; Zara was found to restock its clothes twice a week. When shoppers see a new range on display in their favourite shops, it creates a fear of missing out and temptation to buy more. After all, if paisley is everywhere, and the H&M shirt is only £19.99, then why not treat yourself and update your February wardrobe?

'Don't feed the monster!' The people who have stopped buying new clothes Read more

For many of us, this thought process is unconscious, and it’s hard to break. When I realised the environmental impact of fast fashion towards the end of 2017, I vowed to not buy a single item of clothing throughout 2018. It was harder than I expected. Even though I have a wardrobe full of wearable clothes, I felt pressure to come up with new outfits for events and weddings – especially if I’d already posted one on Instagram.

New trends were the hardest. Last October I was so desperate to get involved in the leopard-print obsession that I almost broke my commitment. And in January when I allowed myself to buy clothes again, all the leopard-print clothes were on sale – out of fashion. If I’d bought the shirt I craved just three months earlier, it would now be at the back of my wardrobe, destined for a charity shop or a landfill site.

Consumer attitudes need to shift. But the change needs to be led by brands that are constantly producing fast fashion and persuading shoppers to buy it. There needs to be more government pressure on fast fashion brands, and rigorous checks, to ensure they have no choice but to slow down their production. Only then will the term “fast fashion” begin to hold the same associations as “plastic bags” – and consumption will gradually decrease, with sustainable alternatives quickly becoming the more fashionable choice.

"The enduring appeal of fashion is that it can be whatever consumers want it to be—a means of self-expression, a celebration of originality and fine craftsmanship, or a temporary pleasure. But today, there’s no escaping that it comes with the burden of knowing it’s among the world’s most polluting and wasteful industries.

According to recent reports by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, global textile production has more than doubled in the past 15 years, while the average shopper holds on to clothing for half that long. Over 85% of discarded clothing in the U.S. ends up in landfills, and this cycle of make/use/waste comes at a considerable cost—the industry generates more greenhouse gas emissions than do international maritime shipping and aviation combined, says the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. And that’s saying nothing of the unethical labor practices that have plagued many of the world’s fast-fashion and luxury brands.

It’s partly this colossal irresponsibility that sparked the idea for Veja, the footwear industry’s Parisian darling that has been at the vanguard of the sustainable fashion sphere long before “sustainable” was even a buzz- word. In 2005, while other brands were being born online, François-Ghislain Morillion and Sébastien Kopp saw opportunity with a physical emblem of their generation: the sneaker. Unlike the big names in the category that spend 70% on advertising and 30% on raw materials and production, they devoted all their resources to a sustainably manufactured product (that costs five to seven times as much to make as other sneakers cost) and the people who make it. This happens in Brazil, where they have access to fair-trade cotton and wild rubber from Amazonia, and factories that pay their workers fair wages. Today, they also use upcycled tilapia hides; recycled plastic bottles; and flannel, silk, and other eco-friendly materials for their shoes—that are as good-looking as they are well made.

Thirteen years later, with nearly 2 million pairs sold around the world, the founders continue to push the message that sustainable business is ultimately good business.

This works for Veja because it was built as a sustainable brand at its onset. But legacy brands, with embedded supply chains and manufacturing facilities, face a bigger challenge.

Few in the industry are rising to the task quite like Kering, for whom sustainability has become a moral lodestar. In 2017, just before being named the top sustainable textile, apparel, and luxury goods corporation by the Corporate Knights Global 100 Index, the conglomerate publicly announced its quantitative objectives in sustainability through 2025. Chief among them: reducing its environmental footprint overall by 40%. The rest of its actions, which touch every step of the supply chain, as well as manufacturing, distribution, and R&D, are explicitly outlined online, suggesting transparency is no longer an enemy to luxury’s aura of exclusivity.

“We are sharing the knowledge we gain and open-sourcing the innovations we develop,” explains Marie-Claire Daveu, Kering’s chief sustainability officer.

And as unlikely as change may once have been in the rarefied world of high-end jewelry, disruption has also found its way to Place Vendôme, the Parisian mecca of the world’s most prestigious watch and jewelry brands. Courbet launched in May as the scene’s first 100% ethical and sustainable line, using recycled, traceable gold and lab-grown diamonds of the highest color grade. These are 30% less expensive than mined diamonds—the latter producing 15,000 times the pollution of lab-grown ones, which are made with solar- powered machines. Department stores world-wide have already started calling to place orders, and local interest was instantaneous. Ethics are a big part of it, says cofounder Manuel Mallen, but aesthetics matter equally—which is why so many eco-only brands have failed to win over consumers. “For good to triumph, the product has to be beautiful,” he says.

A version of this article appears in the January 2019 issue of Fortune with the headline “Beautiful and Sustainable.”"
"A fashion collection inspired by Mary Queen of Scots is to travel to London Fashion Week.

Catwalk show ‘Women of the Crown’ pays tribute to the Scots monarch, co-ordinated between Historic Environment Scotland (HES) and award-winning American fashion designer, Jeff Garner.

Highlights include dramatic accents of lace and tartan, and every look mirrored the style of the Royal - with a contemporary touch.

The show was first seen in the Great Hall of Edinburgh Castle on the eve of the anniversary of the monarch's execution last week.

"The fashion industry is surprisingly bad for the environment. As fashion icon Eileen Fisher famously said, “The clothing industry is the second-largest polluter in the world, second only to the oil industry.”

The main cause is the clothing industry’s water-heavy production cycle, but responsibility lies with the consumer as well: More than one-third of women wear an item less than five times before tossing it, according to thredUP’s 2018 Resale Report, which indicates that buying a used clothing item extends its life by an average of 2.2 years and reduces its environmental impact by 73%.

This company, the world’s largest online thrift store, is now aiming to do even more in an effort to reduce fashion-related waste.

On Tuesday, thredUP launched a new program, UPcycle, inviting outside retailers to get involved with the circular fashion industry. The idea is when customers send their used clothes to thredUP for resale, they’ll have the option to get paid with a gift card to a partnered brand. All the brand has to do is drive traffic to thredUP, then receive the income of returning customers.

“We’re living in somewhat of a throwaway culture, and textile waste is accelerating,” Karen Clark, thredUP’s vice president of communications and partnerships told Fortune. “We’re all, as consumers, buying more and discarding faster than we ever have before.”

The program only includes sustainable woman’s brand Reformation at the moment. Customers can order a “thredUP x Reformation UPcycle kit” in which to send their clothes, then they get a Reformation gift card worth the value of their clothes, plus an extra 15%—a bonus encouraging participation in the UPcycle program.

“There’s a lot of retailers that want to get on board, want to participate in a circular economy, but they potentially lack the operational infrastructure to do so,” says Clark.

With UPcycle, thredUP handles all the resale responsibilities: the intake of clothes, pricing, photographing, and marketing. The brand just has to distribute the “Clean Out Kits” consumers use to send clothes to thredUP.

“Retailers are realizing that those two things—the good for the planet and the good for the business—don’t actually have to be mutually exclusive,” says Clark. “They can, through a program like this—an apparel recycling program that’s essentially a sustainable loyalty program for their customers—accomplish both.”

According to thredUP, consumers are becoming more environmentally conscious, and thus are more likely to return to stores they know participate in this “circular economy.”

“The modern consumer is changing in a lot of ways. She’s more environmentally conscious,” says Clark, stating that 75% of consumers say they’re more likely to buy from an environmentally conscious brand.

Reformation, UPcycle’s first participating brand, definitely fits that mold, but Clark says they’ll be partnering with more than just sustainable brands—as long as quality isn’t sacrificed. thredUp will announce a second partner on Black Friday, and it plans to establish 10 new partnerships next year.

Eventually, thredUP plans to move the partnerships offline as well, including its branded used products in stores.

“I think that one thing you’ll start to see in 2019 from us is not just an apparel recycling program with retailers,” says Clark, “but also a shopping experience where used products and new products live alongside each other.”

All these efforts will encourage customers to consume outside the primary market, reducing textile waste and increasing the already-booming resale industry."
"LONDON — On June 5, France published preliminary plans to outlaw the destruction of unsold consumer goods, including clothes and beauty products, by 2023. Weeks later, across the English Channel, the British government took a very different approach to tackling fashion’s role in the global climate crisis, when ministers rejected recommendations made by a cross-political party committee to regulate the supply chain.

The rejection came in response to a report, titled “Fixing Fashion,” that was published in February by the Environmental Audit Committee. The report called on the British government to increase pressure on brands and retailers to take more responsibility for poor working conditions and the global epidemic of throwaway clothes. “Fixing Fashion” found that British consumers buy more new clothes annually then any other European country, and send approximately 300,000 tons of clothes a year to incineration or landfills.

Globally, the fashion industry is responsible for around 10 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions, according to the United Nations, and consumes more energy than the international aviation and shipping industries combined.

The 18 suggestions in the British report included charging fast fashion producers one penny for each garment, a ban on incinerating unsold stock, mandatory environmental targets for fashion retailers with a turnover of more than 36 million pounds ($45.1 million), and use of the British tax system to shift the balance of incentives in favor of reuse, repair and recycling to support responsible fashion companies."
"Head along the High Street and it’s hard to miss the biggest trend of the year. From Greggs’ sausage-less sausage rolls to McDonald’s meat-free Happy Meals, veganism is going mainstream.

But it’s not just confined to what we eat. According to the Vegan Society, veganism is a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals — not just for food but for clothing and any other purpose as well. Tapping into that market, earlier this month, Marks & Spencer announced it was launching a range of vegan shoes featuring 350 styles for men, women and children.

Billed as ‘guilt-free’ purchases, they include everything from tasselled loafers to stilettos.

And the company is far from being alone in responding to the growing demand for animal-friendly fashion.

Tom Rawstorne investigated the growing market for vegan fashion as critics claim the trend may have harmful consequences for the environment

Fashion giant ASOS has banned suppliers from using animal-derived materials including mohair, silk and fur. Next month will see the first ever Vegan Fashion Week in Los Angeles — and even the Duchess of Sussex, has spoken of her penchant for vegan ‘leather’ trousers.

All well and good in theory, but how ‘guilt free’ are the vegan materials being used in place of traditional, animal-sourced ones?

Take fake fur, for example. Last month, the head of a parliamentary inquiry into the fashion industry called for it to be relabelled ‘plastic fur’ to make consumers aware of what they are buying.

‘A lot of big retailers and brands have removed animal fur from their products but simply replaced it with plastics,’ said Mary Creagh, chairwoman of the Commons environmental audit committee.

Made from fossil fuels, not only will fake fur never biodegrade, but it is made of polyester, a plastic-based fabric also commonly used to make fleeces.

Washing the material loosens plastic microfibres, which end up in the world’s oceans.

The tiny fibres — thinner than a human hair — are then eaten by plankton and shellfish and can ultimately be consumed by humans.

And what about those vegan shoes? Sure, they may contain no leather, but a spokesperson for M&S reveals they are made from a mixture of ‘synthetic materials’ including polyurethane and polyester. In other words, more plastic.

The company says ‘all M&S shoes are designed to last’ and points out that its vegan range contains a ‘proportion’ of recycled materials.

The company added: ‘We encourage our customers to give their footwear a second life through our recycling scheme, Shwopping, which has seen us recycle 30 million items to date.’

There are similar issues with materials used to replace wool. Most of the mainstream replacements are plastic-based, such as acrylic and polyester.

Campaigners say the allegedly ‘abusive’ process sheep experience for their wool makes the material not suitable for vegans (file image)

As for silk — a no-go fabric for vegans because it involves killing silk worms — the cocktail of chemicals used to manufacture rayon, a common alternative, is so toxic it has been blamed for poisoning workers and wiping out waterways globally.

All of which is why some experts are warning consumers not to assume they are saving the planet simply by buying a vegan item of clothing.

‘While vegan shoes, clothing and fabrics sound great we mustn’t confuse vegan with always being environmentally-friendly or even people-friendly,’ says Rachelle Strauss, environmental campaigner and founder of the annual awareness campaign Zero Waste Week.

‘The danger comes if “vegan” is used as a way to sell more fast, cheap fashion. If that happens then there will be a cost further down the line, whether it’s cheap labour or the use of cheap plastics that are likely, at some point in the manufacturing process, to use toxic chemicals.

‘The way these items are made, and what they are made from, is crucial. If it’s wrong to kill animals for leather, then we have to look at the wider picture.

‘Isn’t it also wrong to kill fish, birds and other creatures with the pollution caused in the manufacture of these synthetic materials, and the fact that once worn and discarded they will never biodegrade?’

An estimated £140 million-worth (around 350,000 tonnes) of used clothing goes to landfill in the UK every year, with more than half of it made from plastic-based fabrics.

Vegans don't wear fur because they believe often times animals are treated cruelly and exploited, however alternative fabrics used for faux fur never biodegrade

The scourge of plastic pollution prompted the Daily Mail’s Turn the Tide on Plastic campaign, which has been instrumental in dramatically cutting the use of plastic shopping bags.

This year, we have joined forces with Keep Britain Tidy to launch The Great British Spring Clean, urging voluntary litter picks. Discarded, non-biodegradable clothing is sure to be among the detritus recovered.

Proponents of vegan alternatives insist that while some of these materials may have shortcomings, they are ‘less bad’ than animal-derived items.

‘There are consequences to all actions that can cause harm to the environment or to animals,’ says Dominika Piasecka, spokesperson for The Vegan Society.

‘However, we are trying to minimise the harm to both and choosing to buy vegan things often results in the least harm caused. We acknowledge that there will be some environmental consequences of buying things like plastic but we encourage people in their purchases to go for the least harmful option.’

So are fur and leather really worse for the environment?

The Sustainable Apparel Coalition — a global collective of environmentally minded fashion brands — uses a measure called the Higg Materials Sustainability Index. It scores textiles based on the amounts of energy, water and chemicals that go into their production, and the pollution and greenhouse gases that result. A higher score, means the material is worse for the environment.

The Higg Materials Sustainability Index which measures the pollution involved in producing various textiles claims cow leather is worse than synthetic leather (file image)

According to the index, cow leather, for example, is worse than synthetic polyurethane leather, since it scores 161 versus 59. This is because leather comes from an animal which requires large amounts of energy to produce the feed it eats, while emitting climate-warming methane gases and polluting effluents. By contrast, petroleum-based products such as polyester, acrylic, nylon and polyurethane fare much better.

However, critics say the index doesn’t consider how consumers use clothes, or what happens to them when they are discarded.

A woollen coat, for example, is likely to be worn for longer than a synthetic one and, during its lifetime, will not leach plastic microfibres into the ocean.

The hope is that future materials will solve these problems. Already, innovations are seeing ‘leathers’ made from pineapple leaves and mushrooms, and artificial silk grown in the laboratory. Here, Tom Rawstorne investigates how green vegan materials really are ...

PRETTY WOMAN’S DAMNING LEGACY

Vegans don’t wear leather because it comes from animals, primarily cows. While leather is often a by-product of the meat industry, it’s argued that buying it financially supports factory farms and abattoirs — and the cruelty campaigning groups such as The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) say that involves.

Cattle farming is also seen as one of the most polluting forms of agriculture, and the process of turning skins into leather involves large amounts of energy and a toxic brew of chemicals.

Vegan leather is often made by combining a fabric backing with a plastic coating. The plastic used is either polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or polyurethane (PU).

Greenpeace describes PVC such as that used for Julia Roberts's boots in Pretty Woman (pictured) as the ‘single most environmentally damaging type of plastic’

PVC — think Julia Roberts’s shiny black thigh-high boots in Pretty Woman — is described by Greenpeace as the ‘single most environmentally damaging type of plastic’, contaminating humans and the environment throughout its life cycle.

Fortunately, it is becoming less common with polyurethane now more widely used. While less toxic to produce, this is still an oil-based, plastic product and its production can result in the emission of dangerous gases. It is less likely to last as long as leather, and once thrown away will not biodegrade.

Retail manufacturers that use it say that they are trying to provide sustainable alternatives.

The manufacturer of the bag featured on our cover said: ‘I do my best to create designs that are ethically made and sustainable. I’ve used one of our bags for two years.

‘It is important to give people who are vegan, or who have decided to avoid animal products, an option. I hope my products never end up in a landfill.’

One alternative to polyurethane leather is Piñatex, a leather-like textile woven from the long fibres in the discarded leaves of the pineapple plant.

Since its commercial launch in 2015, Piñatex has been used by about 500 manufacturers, including for vegan sneakers sold by Hugo Boss. According to its website it is 100pc biodegradable — other than the petroleum-based resins currently used for its coatings.

MICROFIBRES THAT POLLUTE OCEANS

Just because sheep aren’t killed in the production of wool does not make the yarn vegan. This is because the animals are, vegan campaigners say, ‘exploited’ in an allegedly ‘abusive’ process, as they sometimes have their tails cut off and may be castrated or mishandled during shearing. Once their wool production declines, they will be sent to slaughter.

The production of cotton has been proven to damage the environment as it uses large quantities of pesticides and water (file image)

Popular materials used to make fabrics instead of wool include cotton, polyester and acrylic.

The term ‘polyester’ describes a type of polymer derived from petroleum, while acrylic is a similar synthetic material.

While polyester has a lesser environmental impact during production, unlike wool it does not biodegrade.

Since 1990, consumption of polyester has grown at a rate of nearly seven per cent per year globally, and it now represents half of the total market in man-made and natural fibres. When clothes made from it are washed, plastic microfibres are released, polluting rivers and oceans and contaminating the food-chain.

Cotton production is also damaging to the environment, using huge quantities of pesticides and water. Greener alternatives include organic cotton and Tencel, made from trees grown in sustainably managed forests.

FAUX FUR OFTEN ENDS UP IN LANDFILL

For obvious reasons vegans won’t wear fur, claiming the industry is cruel and exploits animals to profit from their skins. It is also damaging to the environment. Raising animals for their pelts is energy intensive, and their waste potentially polluting.

Turning the skins into wearable garments involves yet more energy as well as a cocktail of toxic chemicals including formaldehyde and chromium. These can leach into the environment and pose serious health risks to workers in fur-processing plants. The most common alternative to fur is faux fur. Although its production has a lesser environmental impact than the real thing, it is a plastic and will not biodegrade.

As faux fur is historically cheaper than real fur it has been largely embraced by fast fashion outlets, efforts to make the fabric eco-friendly include creating products made entirely from recycled plastic bottles (file image)

Also, because it has been historically cheaper than real fur it has been used by fast-fashion outlets, enabling consumers to afford multiple garments made from it.

As a result, there is little second-hand market for faux fur, meaning it will often end up in landfill. ‘The use of real fur is, of course, deplorable, but faux fur is not the answer,’ says Orsola de Castro of Fashion Revolution, a campaign for ethics in the fashion industry.

‘If you decide to switch to an alternative, you should ensure that alternative is just as friendly to all life — and we know plastic isn’t.’

Efforts to make faux fur more eco-friendly include the creation of a product made entirely from recycled plastic bottles.

TOXIC GLOOP OF CHEMICALS

Silk is a fibre that silkworms and other insects weave to make their webs and cocoons — outer casings that protect them during the pupal stage. But, according to PETA, most of the insects used by the silk industry don’t live past this stage — ‘because they are boiled or gassed alive inside their cocoons, which causes the cocoons to begin unravelling so that workers can obtain the silk threads’.

For every kilogram of silk, some 6,600 silkworms are killed.

Vegans are advised to use nylon, polyester and rayon instead of silk, however workers exposed to fumes during the process of making rayon often suffer from health problems (file image)

The industry is not eco-friendly either. After cow leather, silk is the second worst performer on the Higg Materials Sustainability Index. Producing even a small amount of silk is highly labour intensive and the process uses large amounts of chemicals.

Instead vegans are recommended to switch to ‘humane alternatives’ including nylon, polyester, and rayon. As global silk consumption has fallen, that of rayon has risen.

But, warns journalist Alden Wicker, an expert on sustainable fashion, just because rayon is made of plant materials does not make it eco-friendly.

‘To make rayon, you have to harvest a large number of trees or bamboo, shred and churn them into tiny pieces, dissolve the wood bits in a soup of carbon disulfide, then send these vats of viscous gloop to a factory to be spun into semi-synthetic fibres,’ she says.

‘Workers exposed to the fumes emitted during this process can suffer a range of health problems.’

Another, greener, alternative is soysilk, made from waste soy residue from the processing of soybeans for food products such as tofu — allowing vegans to both eat and wear their favourite food.

A synthetic, laboratory-grown spider silk is also being developed by a Californian company and has been showcased in a number of designs by Stella McCartney.

PILLOWS THAT NEVER BIODEGRADE

Many vegans are opting for items filled with polyester instead of goose or duck down, however the plastic-based fabric won't biodegrade (file image)

Goose and duck down — the soft layer of feathers closest to a bird’s skin — is used in the linings of winter garments and in other household products, such as duvets and pillows.

The down may be a by-product of the meat industry, with the environmental problems related to that, or obtained by live plucking — removed from the birds when they are still alive. While reputable manufacturers avoid feathers produced in this way, the majority of down is produced in China making it difficult to trace where it comes from.

A popular vegan alternative is polyester filling, which is plastic-based and won’t biodegrade.

A greener alternative is kapok, which comes from the kapok tree that produces seeds protected by a soft wool-like fibre. Due to the fact it is buoyant and water-resistant, this fibre was previously used in life-jackets — and is now being used to fill pillows and in place of down in other garments

...and why you should never trust fake fur

by India Sturgis

Chloe Salvi was having difficulty finding the perfect winter hat on the High Street, so typed in ‘faux-fur bobble hat’ into eBay and up popped just what she wanted: red with a fluffy bobble.

An animal lover, she double-checked it was faux fur, sent off £4.99 and thought no more about it until the hat arrived a few days later.

‘I could tell it was not faux fur,’ says Chloe, 38, a lighting designer from Edinburgh. ‘It was soft and fluffy and the fur floated about when it moved.

‘I parted the fur and it looked like there was skin at the bottom. The hairs were uneven too — both signs it might be real. Faux fur looks mechanically cut and a plastic-y. This was not like that.’

Chloe Salvi, 38, contacted BBC Watchdog Live to investigate the material used on her £4.99 ‘faux-fur bobble hat’ (pictured) from eBay, they discovered it was raccoon dog fur

Concerned, she emailed the seller, who reassured her it was fake. But unconvinced, Salvi contacted BBC Watchdog Live, which sent the fur to a laboratory and found it was raccoon dog fur. ‘I was really upset,’ she says of her October purchase. ‘I don’t trust eBay any longer.’

Ebay does not have a no-fur policy but expects products to be described accurately. The seller has removed the listing and eBay apologised to Chloe.

Real fur falsely labelled faux is a widespread problem in the UK. This month the Advertising Standards Agency, warned clothing stores to carry out checks or face sanctions.

It has given firms a February 11 deadline to ensure garments listed as fake fur are not made from animals — or face legal action.

I parted the fur and it looked like there was skin at the bottom - Chloe Salvi

Parliament has named some well-known retailers guilty of unintentionally selling real fur. MPs said in most cases the retailers had no-fur policies but their internal procedures were not robust enough. Sometimes suppliers had misled them.

This month fashion retailer Boohoo became the latest to be caught out.

The Advertising Standards Agency (ASA) has criticised two retailers for ‘misleading’ buyers by advertising fashion items made from animal fur as fake or faux.

The ASA upheld a complaint about a pom-pom jumper sold by Boohoo, which has a no-fur policy. The garment contained real fur, most likely rabbit.

After its exposure by animal charity Humane Society International, Boohoo removed the item from sale and claimed internal testing had showed no real fur.

In a separate ruling, the ASA said Zacharia Jewellers in London, an Amazon seller, was found selling faux-fur pompom headbands with real fur and had broken rules set by the Committee of Advertising Practice. Partner Dipesh Shah, was ‘devastated’ and had 1,500 of them destroyed.

Executive director of Humane Society International Claire Bass, revealed online wholesalers can buy real fur trim for as little as 30p for a raccoon dog fur pompom (file image)

Amazon, TK Maxx, Tesco Direct, Fatface and Boots have also been caught misleading consumers, MPs noted. Experts believe it is just the tip of the iceberg. ‘The problem is particularly acute online and in independent boutiques and markets,’ says Claire Bass UK executive director of Humane Society International, whose report was referred to by MPs in the parliamentary inquiry. ‘But we’ve caught out High-Street stores too.’

The fur we are buying, without our knowledge, is often produced on foreign farms where welfare regulation can be scant and conditions appalling. Tales abound of animals being cruelly killed.

The sale of animal fur is legal in the UK —apart from domestic cat and dog fur and from commercial seal hunts, under EU regulations — if it is correctly labelled. Fur farming has been banned here since 2000 so pelts are imported from countries such as Poland, Russia and China.

The farms can now produce fur in such large volumes that real fur can be sold cheaply — sometimes for less than faux.

Claire Bass says online wholesalers can bulk-buy real fur trim for as little as £3 for a 70cm raccoon dog fur hood trim, or 30p for a raccoon dog fur pompom.

People are trying to dump low-cost real fur as fake to capitalise on faux’s popularity - Arnaud Brunois

Meanwhile, the price of faux is climbing. Arnaud Brunois, Faux Fur Institute founder, explains: ‘Faux fur is more expensive as it requires high-tech machines. People are trying to dump low-cost real fur as fake to capitalise on faux’s popularity.’

Dr Andrew Knight, animal welfare and ethics professor at University of Winchester, says: ‘Clearly the mechanisms retailers have in place for inspecting suppliers are not working.’

He says it’s this that is driving unscrupulous suppliers to mislead retailers. Under the EU Textile Products Regulation (2011) in order to sell clothing containing animal fur such as chinchilla, mink or fox in Britain it must be clearly marked ‘contains non-textile parts of animal origin’. But shoes and accessories such as handbags and key chains are exempt.

‘Most people would be shocked to learn that there’s no legal requirement for an item with real animal fur to tell you on the label that it is real animal fur,’ says Claire Bass.

Humane Society International recommends three tests for concerned consumers to check if faux fur is what it is claims to be.

First, look at the ends of the fur which tend to taper at the end if real.

Second, look at the fur’s base which, if real, will be an animal skin.

Last, burn a few hairs. Animal hair singes like human hair whereas fake fur melts and smells more like plastic."
"Protesters from the environmental action group Extinction Rebellion disrupted the third day of London fashion week, forming human blockades on roads around event venues to highlight the spiralling throwaway culture in the UK’s clothing market and to urge the British Fashion Council (BFC) to declare a climate emergency.

Groups made up of scores of demonstrators wearing black to mourn those whose lives have been devastated by environmental destruction caused traffic standstills for seven-minute intervals, unfurling banners saying “Rebel for life” and holding placards inscribed “Climate change = mass murder”.

Models and protesters mingled outside the main venue at 180 Strand in central London throughout Sunday, with lighthearted impromptu catwalks staged while leaflets were passed to motorists and bystanders warning of the catastrophic consequences of unsustainable growth and inaction over climate change.

Attendees outside the events said that ethical considerations had become fashionable, even mainstream, though campaigners contended they had always been trendy. “Minds in fashion are changing right now,” said Jonas Aucher, a French fashion student. “Fast-fashion brands like Zara have a huge impact, and the protesters are right that the industry has to change.” However, he added: “Recycled products are too expensive.”

Roxanne Murray, a stylist on her way in to an event, emphasised that most people were sympathetic to the need to be more environmentally conscious and that fast fashion needed to slow down. “We don’t have to buy new, cheaply made clothes,” she said. Shop at secondhand stores and wear vintage. Fashion isn’t just about you, it’s about all of us. If we all change together, it will have a great impact.”

Some fashionistas dismissed the protesters’ concerns, while others questioned whether climate change was indeed a man-made phenomenon. “We are in a diabolical situation and it’s too late to convince climate deniers,” said Caroline Vincent, a scientist. “We do need to engage, but we really don’t have the time: we must convince the people who already recognise there is a problem to do something about it.”

The afternoon of civil disobedience by about 150 people passed peacefully with no arrests, as organisers stayed in constant contact with police on the ground and allowed emergency vehicles to pass when required.

Following one of the constructive conversations between protesters and drivers halted by the traffic, a liaison officer said the action had been a pleasure to police, adding: “You are getting the point across.”

Shortly after, one motorist who refused to turn off his engine during the stoppage shouted, “Fuck off back to Richmond. Can’t you move these soapy bastards?”

However, most people waited patiently and read the leaflets, and the sound of horns swiftly subsided as chants of “What do we want? Climate justice. When do we want it? Now!” echoed down the street.

Extinction Rebellion met the BFC on Tuesday to discuss the action it planned to take. The group also discussed how the industry body could use its influence to transform fashion into a force for cultural change that would stop the trend for excessive consumption and respond to the “urgent and existential threat of climate change”.

Clare Farrell, a fashion designer and co-founder of Extinction Rebellion, said: “We need to hold thought leaders and creators of culture to account. The fashion industry’s influence permeates deep within culture and radiates globally.

“While the fashion industry is not responsible for the unsustainable system it exists within, it is a key driver of global trends and a significant source of ecological devastation.”

She said global clothing consumption had doubled in the past 15 years, while utilisation – how often clothes are worn – had decreased by 36%, with total greenhouse gas emissions from textiles production, at 1.2bn tonnes annually, exceeding those of all international flights and maritime shipping combined.

“There are no signs that this is slowing, and events such as London fashion week contribute to and encourage this continued unsustainable growth,” Farrell added, saying that the fashion industry was the most influential on earth.

The BFC said it showcased British businesses engaging in sustainable practices and that it believed shifts within London-based brands could spearhead changes within the wider industry.

“We are committed to supporting businesses to do more to develop through green growth and our hope is that London fashion week becomes synonymous with responsible business in the years to come,” a spokesperson said. “We believe that more than any other capital, London has an opportunity to be a part of a cultural change around sustainable business practices that put creative product at their core.”"
"Of all the things you might expect to see on the London fashion week catwalk, cow parsley is probably not one of them. But that’s exactly what designer duo Vin + Omi delivered as they opened the six-day event with their spring/summer 2019 collection.

More commonly seen decorating a bowl of soup, cow parsley had been blended with flax and woven into an eco-fabric, called Flaxley, by attendees of a Gloucestershire employment programme to create the clothes seen on the catwalk. On Thursday night, it starred alongside hybrid metal fabrics, manufactured from cans collected by homeless people on a support programme in Birmingham, and bags made from fabric derived from plastic bottles discarded from the menswear shows in July and collected, recycled and woven by London College of Fashion students.

It’s all to do with the designers’ drive to pioneer sustainable approaches to the business of fashion and to challenge the conscience of the masses. They started developing eco fabrics in 2004 with a focus on the environment and supporting local communities. Two of their big successes have been creating an eco latex from a rubber plantation they fund in Malaysia and vegan “leather” made from the skins of chestnuts.

The momentum is increasing. Thursday’s event, featuring only clothes crafted from eco-sustainable textiles and processes, was their largest. Held on the Grand Terrace of St Pancras International to mark the re-opening of its public water fountain, aimed at cutting the use of plastic bottles, the designers arrived on a Routemaster party bus with their models – including Jo Wood – wearing ruffled and embellished neon babydoll dresses, multi-layered latex jackets, overalls and wide-legged trousers and sack-like sustainable creations. Messages appeared on T-shirts saying “Everything is everyone”, “Queen Biodegrade”, “Fake News” and “Burst Him” – the latter above a print of the Trump Baby balloon that floated over London this summer – and letter necklaces spelled out “Think”.

“We called it ‘Thought is the new religion’ because it’s about doing it in a different way, concerning everything you do, see and buy,” said Vin before the show, explaining that the collection’s subtitle, “Poodles and Pentagrams”, referred to using the emblem to depict the new wave of “eco-religion”. It was printed, alongside poodles, on nearly every look. “We’re not mass market designers and we’re not subject to the retailers and the buyers – we do what we want to do.”

The event coincided with the release of a YouGov report commissioned by Friends of the Earth that found only 45% of the public know that new clothing can often be made from or contain plastic. “The fashion industry is a major contributor to plastic pollution, shedding tonnes of plastic microfibres into our oceans via our washing machines every year,” said campaigner Emma Priestland. “These fibres are so small that they pass through water treatment facilities and end up in the food chain when they are swallowed by small creatures in our seas.”

Vin + Omi’s eco projects have helped their profile in the fashion industry, with its increasing focus on sustainability. In May, at a British Fashion Council event to promote its Positive Fashion initiative, Prince Charles admitted that he would prefer to discuss how the designers re-constituted nettles grown in their Cotswolds garden into fabrics rather than the imminent royal wedding. High-profile figures such as Michelle Obama and Beyoncé have worn their clothes and they designed the wardrobes for Jane Horrocks’s character, Bubble, in Absolutely Fabulous, and the tour costumes for Debbie Harry’s 2016 Blondie tour. Last September, Harry took part in their London Fashion Week show and accompanied the designers – who wore hoodies reading “Stop Fucking The Planet” – as they took their post-show bow.

But for all their publicity stunts and attention-grabbing statements, the pair personally prefer a lower profile and are publicly known only as Vin and Omi. They frequently adopt a disguise, which leads to comparisons with other anonymous artists such as Banksy and Daft Punk. On Thursday, they wore poodle masks.

“At the beginning, we were cynical of the celebrity designers – we wanted to disguise ourselves to make a statement on the catwalk – it’s not about us. It’s about the process,” said Vin."
"We all know the fashion industry is one of the world’s biggest polluters, but did you know that fashion contributes more to the global carbon footprint than aviation? Textile production uses vast amounts of resources, but there are ways to lower your fashion footprint. Here’s how to buy less, choose carefully, and close the loop on fast fashion. Carolyn Moore reports.

Buy Less

The most sustainable garment is the one already in your wardrobe. Extending the lifespan of clothes from one year to two reduces emissions by 24% annually, so buy what you love and wear it longer. Carbon compensated dress by Ganni, €309, Brown Thomas.

Buy Better

A bargain is only a bargain if you actually wear it. Resist throwaway fashion and impulse sale buys and become a conscious consumer, buying what you love in the best fabrics you can afford. Sustainable cotton tee, €59, theoandgeorge.com

Shop Local

Cut the air miles and look for locally-made, locally-sourced alternatives to imported fashion. Waterford- based brand Bebhinn makes-to-order for less waste, using Irish linen and wool for lower-impact and offering a lifetime guarantee to close the loop.

Shop Sustainable

The ‘buyerarchy of needs’ puts buying new at the bottom of the sustainable shopping list, but if you must buy new, buy sustainable. Supporting high street brands in their shift to sustainable fabrics will lead to lasting change. Wrap dress, €29.99, H&M.

Wash Well

A 2018 report showed the UK’s carbon emissions reduced by 700k tonnes through low temperature washing alone. Lower your temperature and leave more time between washes. Machine washable sustainable silk top by Eileen Fisher, €329, Brown Thomas

Close the Loop

A circular economy means minimising waste and maximising resources; the opposite of a fast fashion ethos! But change is coming with recycled fabrics and circular models. The Nomad (€29.90, Accessorize) is made from recycled plastic bottles.

Go Natural

34% of global microplastics come from textiles, as polyesters and acrylics send half a million tonnes of microfibers from our washing machines to our oceans every year. Choose natural fibres. Redene organic cotton SKFK skirt €89.95, Skunkfunk, Dublin.

Carbon Count

Switching synthetics for recyclable substitutes would reduce energy use by 60 percent and half the emissions from textile production. Look for Lyocell - a low-impact, biodegradable, sustainable alternative. Sustainable Lyocell trousers, €59, Arket.com.

Leave it Out

One truck of textiles hits landfills eve second. Our clothes are barely worn and rarely recycled. Reduce, reuse, shop second hand, or look for companies with a circular model. Weekday Remade is recycled dead stock made new. Skirt, €40, weekday.com."
"Lisa Gorman is celebrating a milestone few Australian fashion designers get to enjoy – the 20th anniversary of her label. “The fact that we’re still here is a good thing in this volatile industry,” says the Gorman founder and creative director.

Hanboks, saris and coat dresses: inside Fashions of Multicultural Australia – a picture essay Read more

Gorman is one of Australia’s most successful womenswear labels, but there’s more to it than brisk sales. Dedicated fans, aka Gormies, gather in Facebook clothes-swap groups 8,000-strong. Non-fashion people have opinions on the brand and can drop a casual “is that Gorman?” as if a peck on the cheek when greeting a brightly attired acquaintance. In certain inner-city areas of Australia, Gorman products seem more ubiquitous than Nike and with more enviable brand recognition, relying on nothing so obvious as a logo.

The label is known for its fun take on women’s clothing, unconfined by the expectation to be sexy or even conventionally flattering. Brooke Babington, assistant curator at Victoria’s Museum of Modern Art Heide which has launched the new exhibition Gorman: Ten Years of Collaborating, says the brand has become known for its “playful and inventive approaches to colour, pattern and form”.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Gorman donated this delicately embroidered dress to the museum as a tribute to artist Mirka Mora, who collaborated with the label. Photograph: Ben Glezer/Heide Museum of Modern Art

“Geometric and botanical imagery, bold juxtapositions in colour and imaginative treatments of traditional materials are all part of Gorman’s distinct and recognisable design aesthetic,” she says.

The label began in 1999 with eight unisex pieces that Gorman made in between nursing shifts at the Royal Melbourne Hospital, and sold through her friend’s store, Fat. Aided by its 2010 part sell-off to fashion conglomerate Factory X, Gorman has grown to 40 eponymous boutiques scattered through the shopping centres and cafe strips of Australia and New Zealand.



But success has been a double-edged sword. The low point for the company came in 2016, when Baptist World Aid Australia’s Ethical Fashion Report gave it a failing grade . Gormies were gutted. They had not paid $300 a lobster-print dress for this.

Speaking on the record about the incident for the first time, Gorman is careful to acknowledge the good work done by charities in the sector but describes their case as “extraordinarily unfair”. The label’s grade was awarded not on the basis of the company’s policies or practices but for non-participation. She feels they were made an example of because of their passionate fanbase.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Gorman has collaborated with a number of artists through the years including close friend Rhys Lee, whose work is seen in the background. Photograph: Ben Glezer/Heide Museum of Modern Art

“It was personally kind of harrowing because I knew that we worked with good factories, I knew that we weren’t using children,” she says. “We were accused of all sorts of things.”



Gorman takes all this to heart – it’s her name on the product, and she still sees the company, even under Factory X, as a small “family business”. Remote factories are also trusted collaborators – the company prides itself on working consistently with the same manufacturers (64% for more than five years, 31% more than 10).

But consumers need more than the word of a company’s creative director, and in the years since, Gorman has worked to enable NGOs’ systematic auditing. It publishes factory and suppliers details, communicates more with watchdogs, and has been trending ever upward in subsequent reports, scoring above average.

Fair or not, Gorman’s shaming had an impact. Not only has the company improved its practices, so have many in the industry. Gorman says other brands ring her for advice now, wanting to avoid the same mistakes. In tangible terms, Baptist World Aid reports that when it started auditing in 2013, only one-sixth of companies were publishing supplier lists. Now it is double that. For organisations in the field, this is what matters.

“The key starting point for ethical fashion is transparency,” says Gordon Renouf, co-founder and chief executive of independent ethical fashion aggregator Good On You. “Consumers have a right to access relevant and accurate information about how brands impact on the issues that matter to them, such as workers and the environment.”

Facebook Twitter Pinterest A Gorman outfit on display at the Heide Museum of Modern Art Photograph: Ben Glezer/Heide Museum of Modern Art

For now, Gorman is focused on celebrating ten years of the brand’s artist collaborations – the subject of the Heide exhibition as well as a new 50-piece collection. Guest artists, typically one per season, have provided a vital injection of fresh ideas for Gorman. These have included 1950s legend Mirka Mora, large-scale muralist Rhys Lee and the Melbourne Museum, who turned over their gem collection for a rare 3D starting point. Gorman hopes to feature Indigenous artists one day, but to avoid appropriation, she says it will likely happen with a different, more careful process.

Sustainability remains another priority for the brand, which has been a long time champion of sustainable fabrics. 25% of its clothing has come from certified organic textiles, although that’s on track to double to 50% this year.

The jump is substantial, although it might not win back the hearts and minds of Gorman’s drifting fans, who see new brands entering the market with a wholly green proposition. Everyone has different expectations now. “If I was starting a business today, I would say to myself, ‘100%[organic] every product. It’s got to meet very high sustainable standards,” says Gorman. “Often it’s harder to shift a business into an environmentally sustainable model than it is to start one with a sustainable model.” For now, she’s working on making things better for the next 20 years.

Gorman: Ten years of collaborating is on at the Heide Museum of Modern Art in Victoria until 17 March

For the third year, Kowtow was audited by Tearfund New Zealand for the 2019 Ethical Fashion Report. The annual industry report tracks the efforts of fashion companies to ensure the rights of workers: fair wages, no child labor, safe workplaces, gender equality and grower community.

Kowtow is proud to announce they received an A+, the highest overall grade, which cements the label as leaders in ethical and sustainable fashion.

“As designers, we’re responsible for the entire lifetime of a garment, and that starts with the conditions of how it was made. The report asks brands to look into their manufacturing and ensure best practices are followed, and we believe that by only positive change can come from that.” – Gosia Piatek, Founder & Creative Director

Kowtow collections are made from organic, renewable, biodegradable and regenerated fibres. All Kowtow garments are certified by non-profit internationally recognised organisations. Independent audits and accreditation bodies ensure the label remains true to their values.

“We’re [Kowtow] known for our wardrobe staples such as classic tees, crisp white shirts, denim and knitwear. Our entire collection is made without putting worker safety or the environment at risk, which goes to show the future of fashion is ethical and sustainable.” – Gosia Piatek, Founder & Creative Director

"It was probably the only time a 93-year-old has stolen the show at Glastonbury’s Pyramid stage. Sir David Attenborough had important things to say when he warmed up for Kylie Minogue last month. After showing scenes from Blue Planet 2, the wildlife series credited with inspiring a sea change in attitudes towards plastics pollution, the broadcaster thanked festival goers and organisers for banning single-use water bottles. “This great festival has gone plastic-free,” he said to cheers. “Thank you! Thank you!”

Kylie’s crowd was right to feel virtuous – single-use plastic is an oil-derived menace to marine life – but how many paused to look down at the elastic in their waistbands, the polyester in their T-shirts and the nylon in their shoes? Plastic in what we wear may be less visible than it is in bottles or straws, but it is no less toxic. Yet somehow we have woven it so tightly into our throwaway society that we barely notice it, even when it is on our own backs. Now there are moves – at the top and bottom of a complex global supply chain – to do something about it.

“When I started doing this five years ago, suppliers wouldn’t even show me their recycled fabrics or they wouldn’t even have them in their bag,” says Kimberley Smith, head of production at a US clothing company Everlane. Since her company committed to eradicating all non-recycled, or virgin, plastic from its supply chain, stores and offices by 2021, her job has become a mission to demand more of them. “Now, recycled is the first thing they show us,” she adds.

But that mission is also about fighting apathy and ignorance among shoppers. “There’s a lot more pressure now to be more educated about issues like water and air pollution, but I think people aren’t as clear that, ‘Oh, by the way, your know your fleece or your Puffa jacket is made of virgin oil?’ I don’t think people understand,” says Smith, who has previously worked at Gap and Levi’s.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest ReNew by Everlane: a collection of outerwear and fleece made entirely from recycled plastic bottles.

Perhaps the development of synthetic fibres as a way to mimic natural fabrics – and add clever functionality – helped obscure the plastic in so much of what we now wear. You don’t have to check a label on a bottle of water, for instance, to know what it’s made of. With textiles, change started slowly. First came plant-derived synthetic fibres such as rayon, which used wood pulp. Truly synthetic fibres arrived with nylons in the late 1930s (courtesy of DuPont, the American chemicals giant that also developed rayon), while polyester was a 1940s British invention.

A process called polymerisation had given us plastics with innumerable potential uses, from hosepipes to dental floss. Melted down, plastic chips could be spun into a strong, light, fast-drying plastic yarn. When it was launched in stockings in a storm of publicity, nylon was more expensive than silk. New technology carried a premium. War swiftly diverted production to parachutes and tents, and synthetic stockings, or “nylons”, became a currency on the black markets of Europe, but mass production geared up thereafter and synthetic fibres wove their way across the world.

Plastic goods of all kinds were celebrated for their utility and diminishing cost – but also their very disposability. In a 1955 edition of Life magazine, a family was photographed throwing dozens of everyday household goods into the air, including some made of plastic. “Throwaway Living” was the headline. The objects in the picture “would take 40 hours to clean – except that no housewife need bother”, the magazine said. “They are all meant to be thrown away after use.”

Throwaway culture might not be as celebrated today, but the same globalising forces on commerce and trade means it has spread into clothing. How often do you wear a T-shirt bought for £4? And what do you do with yours once it has lost its shape or fallen apart (if it hasn’t already disappeared at the bottom of a drawer of similarly priced clothing)? A return to using more cotton would alleviate the plastics problem, but no fast fashion is truly green; it can take up to 22,500 litres of water to grow a kilo of cotton in parts of India that are already water-deprived. Moreover, there are things that cotton can’t do, such as keep the rain out or repel sweat.

Production of polyester alone has multiplied 10 times since 1980, to 53.7 million tonnes in 2017, according to data collated by the Textile Exchange, a US nonprofit industry body. Polyester now accounts for 51% of all fibre production, twice that of cotton (synthetic fibre production overtook cotton in the mid-1990s). That’s a lot of oil, energy and air miles. Yet we throw away an estimated 48 million tonnes of clothing of all types each year, 75% of which ends up in landfill or is incinerated. Less than 1% of clothing was recycled into new clothing in 2017.

And plastic clothing can be uniquely toxic, even while it is still in use or after it has been recycled. A 2016 study by the University of California at Santa Barbara found that, on average, polyester fleece jackets release 1.7 grams of plastic microfibres each time they go into the wash. Older jackets shed more and almost half the barely visible fibres made it through water-treatment plants into rivers and seas. Microbeads of the sort used in cosmetics were banned in the UK last year, but microfibres may be just as destructive – and prevalent. A Plymouth University study estimated in 2016 that a single six-kilo load of synthetic laundry could release 700,000 tiny bits of fibre. Their toxic effects have been observed concentrating as they pass up the food chain, devastating marine life and, in an unappetising case of unwanted recycling, ending up on our dinner plates.

The basic technology needed to dress a growing global population more sustainably has existed for decades. “We launched our first recycled polyester fleece in 1993,” says Matt Dwyer, director of materials innovation at the US-based outdoor-clothing giant Patagonia. The fleece now lives in the company’s archives and is still a faded pale green – it was made of discarded plastic bottles before green and clear bottles were separated. “I’ve handled it and it’s a bit crispy now and the quality wasn’t quite there, but that’s not the story now,” Dwyer adds. More than 80% of the synthetic material Patagonia uses is now recycled and that proportion should hit 90% in the next year.

By sorting and processing old plastic into shreds and then turning them into chips, recycled-fibre producers such as the US-based Unifi, which makes Repreve, a recycled fibre, can spin the chips back into yarn. Unifi alone has processed more than 16bn bottles since 2008, and hopes to hit 30bn by 2022. The company supplies Patagonia as well as brands including Ford, for which it makes seat coverings.

Dwyer says myths that remain about recycled materials often become excuses. There is an assumption that there isn’t enough of it (“There’s plenty of waste that needs picking up,” he says), that it’s still low-quality and that – crucially, in an industry of tight margins – it’s too expensive. “Any business of reasonable size can buy enough recycled material to defer costs,” Dwyer adds. Perhaps more tellingly, there has not been a sense of demand from the bottom. “That’s the other big excuse: ‘My customer doesn’t care so why should I?’”

Patagonia is now an industry poster child for sustainable fashion and Dwyer receives regular calls from other companies starting from zero. They all ask the same question: “Where do we start?” Dwyer advises them first simply to ask suppliers where their stuff comes from. “The other thing I tell them is that making supply chains traceable and using recycled materials is future-proofing, because at some point your customer will care or – worse – it will get legislated and you’ll have to change anyway,” Dwyer says.

Companies are waking up to this future with varying degrees of commitment. Stella McCartney wants to phase out virgin nylon by 2020 and polyester by 2025. In the mass market, Adidas has committed to using recycled polyester in all viable applications by 2024. Meanwhile, brands such as Asos and Boohoo, which are synonymous with the excesses of fast fashion, have set out their stalls – or, at least, stalls within their stores. Asos has grown its Eco Edit since its launch in 2010. To qualify, clothing must contain at least 50% “sustainable” fibres, including recycled plastics. Last month, Boohoo launched For the Future, the brand’s first recycled range (“Dress well and do your bit for the planet? We’re totally here for it.”).

But is there not a risk of greenwashing when brands whose business models rely on cheap fashion position themselves as environmental crusaders? “You’ve got to make a big statement and put it out there,” says Smith at Everlane. “Saying, ‘We’re going to start a little baby eco line,’ is better than nothing but by setting a real target and telling everyone about it, you’re like: ‘OK, now we’ve really got to do it.’”

On Boohoo’s homepage at the time of writing, the link to the recycled range, which includes a T-shirt for £5.40, comes some distance below a “50% off absolutely everything” banner, a link to the summer and swimwear range with the slogan “catch flights not feelings” and right next to a link to non-recycled plastic swimsuits on sale for £5. There is nothing on Asos’s homepage to indicate it has an “eco” range (now called the Responsible Edit) – I have to click through to find it. Boohoo says its new range was more prominent on its site at launch and that it is only “the latest in a line of initiatives designed to make it easier for our customers to do the right thing”. Asos says it promotes its ethical range through several channels beyond its homepage and has added “responsible” filters to all its ranges rather than confining the clothes to one page.

Beyond recycled ranges, campaigners are asking whether fast fashion can ever be green. “The big issue I struggle with is that, yes, we can push for brands to become more sustainable, but as long as they’re churning out millions of garments a year, we’re not going to change anything,” says Tolmeia Gregory, a 19-year-old sustainable-fashion blogger and environmental activist. She has changed the way she dresses to include more secondhand clothes and sustainable brands, and is spending more on higher quality items that last longer.

Legislation may be part of the solution, but the government was accused of complacency last month after rejecting recommendations from MPs to improve fashion’s wider impact on the environment. In its report, Fixing Fashion, published in February, the Environmental Audit Committee said a 1p levy on each garment would raise £35m a year to improve infrastructure for the collection and sorting of clothes that otherwise go to landfill. It proposed a VAT cut on clothing repair and better rewards and penalties. The committee also recommended mandatory environmental targets for bigger retailers.

“There’s a spectrum of engagement in the industry, including those paying lip service to this new landscape, and we need regulation to set a level playing field,” says Mary Creagh, the chair of the committee. Creagh compares the forthcoming ban on plastic straws, stirrers and cotton buds with the government’s response to the report. “Straws was EU regulation but [the environment secretary] Michael Gove did a very good job of making it his own for a Brexiter,” she tells me. “The government likes to talk green but it’s not very good at walking the walk.” In its response, the government said it recognised the importance of tackling fast fashion and said it was already taking action, but it accepted none of the committee’s recommendations.

In the meantime, brands with an eye on the clock are making inroads. Those that rely less on synthetic materials are using new technology to recycle cotton, for example. On the Isle of Wight, Rapanui now offers customers £5 in credit if they return clothing to it for recycling rather than throw it away. Mart Drake-Knight, the co-founder of the company, says it has flourished because it has invested in sustainability. “We’re not hippies … we’re doubling in size each year – the economy has rewarded us for this.”

Sometimes it’s the little details that pose the biggest challenges for those trying to eliminate virgin plastic. Patagonia tried for years to find a supplier to make its logo labels with recycled plastic. At Everlane, plastic zips and buttons give Smith a headache. “The next big challenge is elastic,” she adds. “Everyone wants stretch now and that’s all made from virgin petroleum and there isn’t really recycled elastane out there yet.” She is hopeful a solution may yet show itself. Another effect of loudly self-imposing targets is that innovating suppliers hear the cry. “There are more and more people doing really cool things we didn’t even know about,” she adds. “The more people doing it and the more influence we have the better so we can make change together.”"
"A 2016 report by McKinsey consultants found that nearly three-fifths of all clothing ends up in incinerators or landfills within a year of being made.

""This doesn't just affect people who are really into fashion, it affects every single person who wears clothes,"" says Taz Kelleher, co-founder of events collective Sustainable Fashion Dublin, which hosts swap shops, charity shop crawls and upcycling workshops around the city.

Small changes in how we shop, care for and dispose of our clothes can make a big difference. Here are 10 ways that even the laziest among us can green our wardrobes.

1 Buy secondhand

Long before 'sustainable fashion' became a buzzword, charity shops and vintage clothes offered an eco-friendly alternative to the high street. Geraldine Carton, co-founder of Sustainable Fashion Dublin, notes that it's also more wallet-friendly.

""A lot of people say, 'Sustainable fashion is so expensive, I can't afford these organic cotton trousers' and that's fair enough, but secondhand shopping is accessible to everyone,"" she explains.

Hazel O'Malley, who opened Hazel's Nuts About Vintage in Killarney in 2016, said she discovered sustainability after becoming disillusioned with ""fast fashion"", the rapid production of cheap clothes by mass-market retailers in response to catwalk or celebrity trends.

""I was a complete shopaholic,"" she recalls. ""I wanted something different, and I found vintage that way and got to see that it's better for the environment.""

Hazel adds: ""These shops are great to have in small towns. When I go buying, I have regular customers in the back of my mind, 'That'll suit so and so'. It's almost like a personal shopper.""

Unlike today's fast fashion pieces, vintage clothes, she points out, tend to be built to last. ""It's a good way to shop if you want to be individual."" It can be frustrating, as you won't instantly find something you like or in your size, yet Hazel urges patience. ""You could go in 10 times and not see anything, and then one time you'll see something amazing that nobody else will have.""

2 Swap til' you drop

Swap shops provide that new clothes thrill without having to spend a cent. Last month, Hazel held one as part of Fashion Revolution Week, a campaign to improve conditions in clothing factories. Now, she's planning to make it a regular event, with the next one scheduled to take place in June.

""A woman told me that she brought in five items and just went away with one, but she was absolutely delighted because she needed something for a wedding and that saved her so much money and stress,"" she says.

3 Buy less

Our wardrobes are bulging yet we feel like we have nothing to wear. It can be tempting to give into fast fashion - at time of print, Boohoo.com listed 366 dresses for sale at €10 or less - but Hazel emphasises caution.

""Think: do you need it? How many other things in your wardrobe will it go with? How many wears will you get out of it?"" she asks.

""We've really gotten into a throwaway culture. Even mentally, it sort of leaves you empty: we're buying stuff, we're getting the high for the day, then that subsides and you're left feeling guilty because you're after spending money you shouldn't have spent. And the high street shops bring out something new every week, so you're never going to be on trend, you'll always be behind the curve.""

Instead, use your spending habits to send a message. ""The way we spend our money will definitely make brands sit up and notice. They won't keep producing in the way they are if we're not buying it,"" says Hazel.

4 Wash green

It's not as simple as turning the knob down to 30°C and using an eco-friendly detergent. ""Everybody is washing their clothes way too much,"" Taz explains. ""You should wash a pair of jeans once or twice a year. So much of the time, we can freshen up our clothing just by airing it. Try and cut back by air drying your clothes, avoid ironing if you can and fold your clothes as soon as they come off the line.""

Geraldine adds that we should be aware of microfibres in synthetic clothing, which can seep into the ocean during laundry. ""One way you can overcome that is with a Cora Ball,"" she suggests, which can be purchased for €35 from Reuzi.ie. ""You put it in with your washing and the microfibres cling to it, which stops them from going into our water systems.""

5 Make do and mend

""Right now, people see clothing as disposable as a cup of coffee, because it can be as cheap as that,"" says Geraldine. ""You need to value your clothes the way people did in the past."" She recommends learning how to sew on a button, fix a torn seam or patch a hole rather than simply tossing out damaged clothes. ""Previous generations would mend a rip or tear without even blinking, but we don't have that skill anymore.""

6 Discard responsibly

""The worst thing you can do is throw them in the bin,"" says Geraldine, pointing out that Ireland produces thousands of tonnes of textile waste each year. Look up your nearest textile recycling bank, where clothes will be shredded and used as furniture stuffing, insulation and cleaning rags. However, this should be your last resort - unless clothing is very heavily worn or soiled, donate it to a charity shop or drop your items at a clothes bank.

7 Learn the art of upcycling

Breathe new life into your forgotten clothes with a shorter hemline, added embroidery or stylish side stripe. At Sustainable Fashion Dublin's DIY denim and DIY clothing workshops, Taz explains: ""We show people how to paint, embroider, stitch, take up, take in, to fall in love with their clothes again.""

8 Shop sustainable brands

Celebs from Emma Watson to Meghan Markle have embraced ethical designers such as Stella McCartney and Ali Hawson's Edun. If you don't have an A-lister's budget, look to affordable labels such as eco-friendly Veja trainers (available from Brown Thomas), vegan leather bags by Matt and Nat (available from Avoca), or T-shirts and leggings from Dublin shop Fresh Cuts.

9 Sharing is caring

US company Rent the Runway and Irish offerings such as The Nu Wardrobe and Borrower Boutique allow users to 'rent' clothes for a fraction of the retail price. Taz suggests a return to our adolescent habits and shopping your friends' wardrobes. ""When I was a teenager and you went to discos, you'd borrow each others' clothes,"" she says. ""For big events like weddings and graduations, we encourage people to borrow - you shouldn't be buying an item of clothing to wear one time.""

10 Change your mindset

Make a promise to yourself not to shell out a few hundred euro on a dress for Ladies' Day or a wedding that you know you won't wear again. ""We'll spend huge amounts of money on once-off outfits,"" says Taz, who urges reassessing your priorities and spending to ""build up your basics, like jeans and white T-shirts"".

"Fishing nets and discarded plastic are finding their way into wardrobes around the world thanks to a rise in the number of fashion designers using materials made from recycled ocean waste.

Brands including Gucci, Stella McCartney and Adidas are increasingly partnering with organisations such as Parley for the Oceans – which raises awareness of the destructive effect of ocean plastics – and sourcing materials regenerated from companies such as Aquafil, the textile manufacturer that transforms ocean waste into sustainable materials such as Econyl.

Last month, 4,000kg of discarded fishing nets were recovered from waters off the coast of Sicily by Healthy Seas, a joint-venture by non-governmental businesses, before being sent to a recycling plant in Slovenia. It is there that Aquafil spins it into sustainable material for use by the fashion industry.

Richard Malone, a former Central Saint Martins fashion student and now rising star in the designer world, is a leading adopter of Aquafil’s materials. His most recent collection for London fashion week, available early next year, featured outfits made from Econyl and was praised by Vogue as “changing all the conversations about who buys and why”.

“The fishing nets were extremely exciting,” Malone said. “Tonnes are discarded in our oceans every year and [Aquafil’s process] create an eco-nylon yarn that can be broken back to yarn again and again and reused, as well as create really beautiful, functional fabrics like sportswear and washable jerseys.”

The growing trend for recycling ocean waste and turning it into fashion is, according to the Future Laboratory researcher Rachael Stott, “a definite Blue Planet effect”.

“The series reached and impacted millions of people and highlighted how our everyday habits as consumers were causing horrific damage to wildlife and the ocean, and in particular our resilience of single-use plastics.”

At Moshi Moshi Mind, the Danish fashion brand that opened its first UK store last month, the star of the season is a £255 winter coat that looks and feels like a traditional down padded coat yet is made entirely from plastic bottles retrieved from the sea. “The fabric is very fine and that has its own [design] challenges, but the idea is to learn and get better with time as we believe this is a long-term strategy,” said the label’s owner, Jenny Egsten-Ericson.

The newly launched RiLEY Studio uses Econyl to create its exercise wear. “The idea that sustainable fashion must be of lower quality, made from less durable materials, or is generally less attractive is an outdated concept,” its founder, Riley Uggla, said.

Previously a niche area of the fashion industry, advances in technology have enabled the production of recycled fashion at scale, said Eco-Age’s Harriet Vocking. “It now makes business sense to use the more sustainable option.”

Despite these advances, Greenpeace warns that the plastic mountain problem is unlikely to be diminished in the near future.

The Greenpeace campaigner Louise Edge said: “We’re grateful to anyone removing plastic waste from our oceans or beaches. However, it’s not possible for us to remove the truckload of plastic waste we’re currently adding to the ocean every minute, just as it is not possible for us to recycle the volume of plastic we are currently producing.

“The only real way to prevent ocean plastic from becoming a massive ecological catastrophe is to massively reduce plastic production, which, unless we act, is set to quadruple over the next few decades.”

While Stott also worries that some corporations “won’t act responsibly if they know their waste can be reused [making them] less inclined to work on developing plastic alternatives”, it is a big step in the right direction.

“The demand for environmentally conscious clothing is there, with 72% of Generation Z women stating that it is imperative to buy brands that are environmentally friendly,” Stott said. “Brands need to recognise that by changing their supply chains to integrate recycling, they are future proofing their customer base.”"

"Stella McCartney has debuted the world’s first fully recyclable hoodie, one of two prototype products for her adidas collection.

The ""Infinite Hoodie"" is composed of 60 per cent NuCycl™ fibre, a material made using the threads from old garments, and 40 per cent organic cotton that has been diverted from landfills.

Made in partnership with textile innovations company Evrnu, the hoodie is designed to be reused and remade in the future.

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.

In a statement, Stella McCartney says: “Fashion is one of the most harmful industries to the environment. We can’t wait any longer to search for answers and alternatives.

“By creating a truly open approach to solving the problem of textile waste, we can help empower the industry at large to bring more sustainable practices into reality.

“With adidas by Stella McCartney we’re creating high performance products that also safeguard the future of the planet.”

Fans of the company may struggle to get their hands on the design given that only 50 Infinite Hoodies have been manufactured to date.

The second design to have been recently unveiled was a prototype of the ""Biofabric Tennis Dress"".

Created in conjunction with Bolt Threads – a company specialising in bioengineered sustainable materials and fibres – the dress is made from cellulose blended yearn and Microsilk, a protein-based material made using renewable ingredients such as sugar, water and yeast, and has the ability to fully biodegrade at the end of its life.

The garments represent a giant step forward for environmentally sustainable clothing and the brand.

Sustainability has been integral to the McCartney brand, which refuses to use materials like leather, fur and PVC - something she described as “cancerous to the people who work with it, and then the residue runs into the rivers because the factories are built on rivers”.

In a recent interview with The Guardian, the vegetarian activist, acknowledged that her ethical and environmental stance could make the design process harder.

Despite this, she insisted that it was her choice “and I believe very much in my reasons for working in that way”.

In May, the designer announced a collaboration with Google to help reduce the environmental footprint of the fashion industry.

The intention of the partnership is to give brands ""a more comprehensive view into their supply chain"" and estimate the environmental impact of specific items of clothing at the sourcing and design stage.

Speaking about the initiative, McCartney said: “At Stella McCartney, we have been continuously focusing on looking at responsible and sustainable ways to conduct ourselves in fashion, it is at the heart of what we do."""
"Singled out £5 dress that even 'charity shops would snub' due to its quality

'Meal deal' offer previously just for students, has been extended to all shoppers

Boohoo offers a 'starter' of shoes, 'main' of a dress' and a 'dessert' bag for £30

Fashion e-tailer Boohoo has announced it's to extend a student 'meal deal' offer of an entire outfit for £30 to all customers - just days after it was named and shamed in Parliament for fuelling a throwaway clothes culture.

The online giant is offering shoppers the chance to snap up a pair of shoes as a 'starter', a dress for their 'main', and a handbag for 'dessert' - all for £30.

It comes after an expert singled out a £5 Boohoo dress that even 'charity shops would snub' while telling MPs about the negative impact of cheap, fast fashion on the environment.

Boohoo told FEMAIL that it 'acknowledges its responsibility to be a sustainable business', but added: 'We do not apologise for offering our customers great prices.'

Describing the deal [pictured] Booohoo said: 'For starter the customer can choose from heels, flats and trainers while the main course is a dressy or casual boohoo dress.'

Known for its sales and cheap and cheerful prices, Boohoo originally released the 'meal deal' for students but have since brought it back to extend it to all customers.

The budget collection features a 'starter', 'main' and 'desert', which are shoes, dresses and bags - with a mix of dressy and casual pieces.

A dress from the collection averages for around £15, shoes can retail for £12 and bags £8 - making a full outfit £35, giving shoppers the chance to save up to £5 by buying more clothes.

Describing the deal Booohoo said: 'For starter the customer can choose from heels, flats and trainers while the main course is a dressy or casual boohoo dress.'

'And who can resist dessert? We’ve got a selection of bags to finish off the look.'

On Tuesday Stella Claxton, senior lecturer with the Clothing Sustainability Research Group, Nottingham Trent University told the the environmental audit select committee on Tuesday that 'fast fashion' retailers like Boohoo and ASOS are fuelling a culture in which an eye-watering 400,000 tonnes end up in UK landfill sites.

'It is very much the kind of low value end, particularly the success of the online retailers such as Asos and Boohoo who are competing on low prices and fast turnaround,' she said at the time.

‘I saw a dress on Boohoo retailed for full price at £5 at the weekend.

‘So we have a market – these garments are mainly aimed at young women who are...getting pleasure from what they wear and getting pleasure through their clothing.

‘The actual value of the item is very low in real terms and in quality terms and in emotional terms to them,' she said.

The criticism is not slowing down Boohoo, who saw sales soar this year to a whopping £560 million despite selling things at a very cheap price

Boohoo was named and shamed in Parliament for producing £5 dresses which one expert warned would be of such low quality charity shops would snub them

A Boohoo spokeswoman told FEMAIL: 'We do not apologise for offering our customers great prices. The Meal Deal is a promotion that allows a customer to put an outfit together from a limited number of styles to create a killer outfit.

'The boohoo Group acknowledges its responsibility to be a sustainable business continuously working towards improvement.

She continued: 'We are proud to cater for a wide variety of customers with something for everyone, from value to premium collections.

'We look at other ways in which we can contribute to a sustainable future. We pride ourselves on our global supply base and a significant portion of our products are manufactured in the UK, which dramatically reduces the carbon footprint of our garments to our customers.

'We recognise our responsibilities and sustainability sits at the heart and in the DNA of the boohoo brands.'"
"Jodie Kidd modelled a dress made from dozens of plastic bottles picked up by litter-collecting canoeists at London Fashion Week last month

For an industry which doesn’t always see eye to eye with environmentalists, here is an outfit which makes real fashion sense.

Jodie Kidd models a dress made from dozens of plastic bottles picked up by litter-collecting canoeists and recycled into fabrics.

The paddling campaigners patrol Britain’s rivers, canals and lakes on the lookout for discarded rubbish.

They hit upon the idea of recycling plastic waste into clothing and approached eco fashion designers Vin & Omi.

The duo, major figures in sustainable clothing, created a unique range with all the decorative flowers made from salvaged bottles which were processed into pellets then textiles.

They tempted supermodel Jodie Kidd out of retirement to launch the collection at London Fashion Week.

Canoeing activist Clare Osborn said: ‘We arranged for the PET1 plastic bottles to be sent to fashion designers Vin & Omi.

‘They make rubbish look beautiful while highlighting the problems with our over-consumerist society and high street fast fashion.

‘Our plastic bottle collection was combined with other groups to produce the applique flowers that went on to several looks on the catwalk at London Fashion Week.

The salvaged bottles (above) were processed into pellets then textiles. The canoeists’ initiative comes as an incredible 554,729 people have committed to taking part in the Great British Spring Clean

‘It is really important to get the message out to people about the damage litter can do, especially plastics, and what better way to do it than get Jodie Kidd to show how they can be recycled.’

Miss Osborn, who founded #PaddleCleanup, wants more people to get out on the waterways and pick up litter.

Litter pick: Canoeist Lucy Ashley is pictured above on canoe trip on the Shropshire Canal to collect litter and plastic bottles

She said: ‘I have given the Sea Scouts some tools to lead the way and I’m now working with other paddle communities.’

The canoeists’ initiative comes as an incredible 554,729 people have committed to taking part in the Great British Spring Clean.

The campaign organised by Keep Britain Tidy and backed by the Daily Mail has made history as both the largest ever national clean-up and Britain’s biggest volunteer drive.

There have been more than 17,000 events nationwide, with volunteers collecting 957,377 bags of litter. That is the equivalent of filling almost 240,000 wheelie bins.

The Rivers Trust, which contributed more than 600 volunteers, recovered hundreds of tyres, trolleys, a scooter and even the side of a caravan from a waterway.

Spokesman Alistair Maltby said: ‘Most worrying to us was the amount of sewage-related items. The debris collected has shown just how far we still have to go.’"
"France is taking aim at fashion’s heavy environmental footprint with a global industry sustainability initiative.

French President Emmanuel Macron has tapped Kering SA Chief Executive Officer Francois-Henri Pinault to lead the effort. Paris-based Kering is the parent company of several luxury fashion brands, including Gucci, Saint Laurent, Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta, and Alexander McQueen.

France, where luxury fashion is a lucrative sector, wants brands from around the world to commit to progress on issues including ocean health, biodiversity and climate change during this summer’s Group of Seven summit in Biarritz. Specific targets could include eliminating disposable plastics within three years or converting to renewable energy sources by 2030, Pinault said in an interview at a conference in Copenhagen.

“All of the major actors are working on these issues,” said Pinault. “The problem is that doing everything separately we don’t have the impact that we should.”

As governments and consumers have become increasingly concerned with the fashion industry’s harmful impact on the environment, some brands have banned the use of controversial materials like fur or deployed new materials like mushroom leather for handbags.

LVMH, which owns Louis Vuitton and Dior, this week announced a partnership with Unesco on protecting key ecosystems for supporting the luxury industry, like the habitat of black bees whose honey is used in its Guerlain skincare products.

Still, progress on improving fashion’s environmental and social impact isn’t moving fast enough to counteract the rapid growth in production, according to a report by consultancy BCG and sustainable-fashion groups last week. The worldwide apparel and footwear market’s expected growth, pegged at around 5% a year through 2030 by Euromonitor analysts, risks “exerting an unprecedented strain on planetary resources” by raising annual production of fashion to more than 100 million tons, the report said.

Banning Destruction of Unsold Fashion

Eliminating the practice of destroying unsold fashion is a central part of reforms in the fashion industry. In France, a ban on the practice is being considered.

While mass-market apparel brands often mark down goods until their shelves are cleared, luxury labels have long preferred to burn some unsold items or bury them in landfills rather than risk damage to their image that might come from having them spotted in discount bins.

“Too many companies feel okay with just throwing away or destroying the shoes or the clothing that haven’t been sold,” French Deputy Ecology Minister Brune Poirson said at a conference on fashion and sustainability in Copenhagen. “You can’t do this anymore. It’s shocking.”

Poirson called on brands to tackle the matter at the industry level but said the government would pursue a ban. The pledge comes after Burberry Group Plc said last year that it would end the practice after the disclosure that the U.K. trenchcoat maker destroyed almost 29 million pounds ($37 million) worth of unsold goods in 2017.

Finding other ways to dispose of $2,500 jackets or $1,000 shoes will be challenging for luxury brands that don’t want to give away unsold items, since the array of materials in them could make recycling difficult."
"Sustainability matters to Glasgow fashion designer Siobhan McKenna.

So much so, that the 27-year-old who hails from the Southside has launched her own ethical fashion business, ReJean Denim.

Using defective second-hand denim she sources from charity shops, vintage sellers, recycling centres and online hauls, Siobhan creates stylish workwear jackets for men and women of all sizes and ages.

As well as making the jackets, after unpicking every pair of jeans by hand, Siobhan has plans to offer workshops that will teach other crafty types how to remake their own leftover clothing.

""I'd like to teach them how to repair their own ReJean jackets rather than just tossing them into landfills.

""Overall, it's about education as well as just being sustainable and trying to make something that's cool and wearable and high-end.""

According to research carried out by Zero Waste Scotland, an estimated £140 million worth (350,000 tonnes) of used clothing goes to landfill in the UK every year - a figure that Siobhan hopes to have even the tiniest impact on.

Siobhan studied fashion and textiles at Cardonald College before taking up a fashion degree in Manchester, graduating in 2012.

Her love of vintage was furthered when she started working at London vintage store, Rokit, a haunt of fashion conscious celebrities including Kate Moss, and working as a tailor for major denim retailer, Levi's.

She said: ""I kind of had a bit of an obsession with denim. I was constantly repairing jeans and altering them.""

Moving back to Glasgow in 2016 and inspired by the flourishing creative community in her home town, Siobhan set about realising her ambition of starting her own fashion enterprise.

Launching two weeks ago with a 'stock drop' - where she showcased every item available to sell - on Instagram, Siobhan sold half of her designs and sent some jackets packing to as far away as Australia and the Netherlands.

She sells her stock from Colab Scotland, a creative hub based in the city centre, where buyers can buy off-the-rack or be measured for a bespoke creation.

If she's being ""super productive"" Siobhan can make two pieces a day if she's unpicked a few pairs the night before. She has mastered the art of deconstructing the denims and can get it down to under an hour per pair.

Siobhan's designs have been well received and she's ""loving"" what she's doing.

She said: ""I've had a really nice response from people which is just lovely to hear. I'm just excited to see where I can go with it.""

As part of an online community of female makers, Siobhan is able to reach a wider audience when her work is shared by others. And she reciprocates, promoting their work to her own followers.

She said: ""It's so nice, people are just championing each other. I think it's if you're handmaking stuff and you've got a sustainable ethos it's just about sharing and getting other people involved.""

With plans for a website and an expansion into making other items of clothing, including made-to-measure jeans, ReJean Denim is gaining momentum. But it's not only Siobhan's design and making skills that shine through in her range but her genuine appreciation for the materials she works with.

She said: ""Most of the jeans I use are re-sellable but have small defects. Some of them already have old repairs on them from a past life and I'll always try to feature that in the jacket.

""I just want to focus on celebrating the original details of an old pair of jeans."""
"Sustainability matters to Glasgow fashion designer Siobhan McKenna.

So much so, that the 27-year-old who hails from the Southside has launched her own ethical fashion business, ReJean Denim.

Using defective second-hand denim she sources from charity shops, vintage sellers, recycling centres and online hauls, Siobhan creates stylish workwear jackets for men and women of all sizes and ages.

As well as making the jackets, after unpicking every pair of jeans by hand, Siobhan has plans to offer workshops that will teach other crafty types how to remake their own leftover clothing.

"News from Press Worthy Media

Former Police officer and award-winning fashion designer Fiona Pohlen has launched New Zealand’s first fashionable high-visibility clothing brand “Lumen Clothing” in celebration of the 30th anniversary of the World of Wearable Art (WOW).

Inspired by her work as a police officer, the Wellington designer is creating sophisticated reflective wear to keep people safe and stylish on the streets of the capital.

“My aim is to create a city where pedestrians are all visible in low-light conditions, and still look fabulous, wearing sophisticated, locally made clothing,” she says.

Lumen Clothing uses 3M Scotchlite© highlights on their garments, which is the same product used on high-visibility safety workwear.

The illuminated designs are on show in the window of the iconic Wellington store Cranfields as part of the WOW Window Dressing Competition.

Ms Pohlen says, “We have created a whimsical ‘Alice in Wellington’ theme, with flying candelabras, spoons and forks, along with showcasing a Lumen coat in the blue reflective theme of WoW this year.”

Aware of the negative impact that fashion brands can have on the environment, Ms Pohlen has created an ethical and sustainable clothing brand.

She says, “We are about reducing the negative impact our clothing brand has on the environment, and if we can keep people safe in low-light conditions whilst doing it; even better.”

Ms Pohlen was the winner of the Lux Luminance Award in Project Glow Wear 2016."

The fashion industry is one of the biggest polluters in the world and a major contributor of greenhouse gases.

Parts of the industry have also been accused of breaching human rights and not paying workers enough.

But the latest Fashion Transparency Index has revealed some brands are beginning to show signs of improvement.

Campaign group Fashion Revolution looked at 200 labels' social and environmental policies.

It found the most transparent brands were Adidas, Reebok and Patagonia - they each scored 64% of the total points possible - followed by Esprit and H&M.

""We know anecdotally, that there's a sense of competition between brands to do better than their competitors, particularly between sports or luxury brands,"" Carry Somers, founder of Fashion Revolution told Radio 1 Newsbeat.

""But we do really have a long way to go, the average score is only 21%.""

In a statement on its website, H&M said: ""We believe being transparent - clear and open - about how and where our products are made, is an important part of helping us become more sustainable.

""The more we share, the more we learn, and the more we can identify the areas to focus on.""

While Fashion Revolution says it's good news that more brands are becoming more open by publishing their policies, it doesn't mean they're the most ethical or sustainable.

""What we need to see the brands doing is to disclose more about the outcomes of their polices and the tangible impacts they're having on the lives of their producers and environment,"" Carry Somers says.

""We have the right to know that the money we're spending with the brand isn't supporting human rights abuses and environmental degradation - transparency is the first step in making sure this takes place"".

The Index also looked at fashion's environmental impact.

It found that more than half (55%) of the 200 brands are publishing their annual carbon footprint on the company's own sites, but only 19.5% reveal carbon emissions in the supply chain - which is where more than half of the industry's emissions occur.

Exposing flaws

The Fashion Transparency Index started after the Rana Plaza factory collapsed in Bangladesh in 2013.

More than 1,100 garment workers died and hundreds more were injured.

Image copyright European Photopress Agency Image caption More than 1,100 workers were killed after the Rana Plaza factory collapsed

The disaster exposed poor safety standards and regulation, and raised questions over the responsibilities of the big retail brands given their push to keep prices as low as possible in an era of fast fashion.

'Fashion brands need to do better'

Not all brands are telling the public about their human rights and environmental policies, practices and impacts - five scored zero on the Index.

They included Eli Tahari, Jessica Simpson, Mexx, Tom Ford and Chinese menswear brand Youngor.

Another 10 brands revealed almost nothing (less than 2%), including Longchamp, Max Mara and New Yorker.

""There are still far too many big brands lagging behind,"" Fashion Revolution policy director and report author Sarah Ditty says.

""Major brands are disclosing very little information and data about their purchasing practices, which means that we still don't have visibility into what brands are doing to be responsible business partners to their suppliers.""

"New York (CNN Business) The notoriously boom-or-bust fashion industry is turning to a surprising source to woo shoppers: secondhand clothes and handbags.

The resale clothing marketplace in the United States is exploding. Over the past three years, the secondhand clothing market has grown 21 times faster than the overall industry, according to a GlobalData Retail research report prepared by resale site ThredUp. The resale clothing industry is expected to nearly double from $28 billion today to $51 billion by 2023.

Neiman Marcus, H&M and online luxury sitehave all recently entered the resale industry to adapt to Americans' love of secondhand heels, handbags and dresses. They are looking for younger, environmentally conscious and aspirational luxury shoppers who want bargain prices on premium brands.

In April, Neiman Marcus took a minority stake in Fashionphile, a resale site that hawks pre-owned luxury handbags and accessories for up to 80% below their original price. In the future, shoppers will be able to drop off their used shoes and bags at Neiman Marcus stores to ship back to Fashionphile.

Neiman Marcus invested in Fashionphile to achieve ""long-term and sustainable growth,"" Neiman CEO Geoffroy van Raemdonck said in a statement. He believes the partnership will help ""introduce Neiman Marcus to younger and aspirational shoppers.""

Big retailers are responding to the rapid growth of online resale fashion startups, such as ThredUp, The RealReal, Poshmark, Fashionphile and others. Resale companies compete directly with high-end retailers, department stores and fast-fashion for customers and they threaten luxury brands' pricing power and exclusivity.

Neiman Marcus is investing in the booming resale fashion industry.

Resale sites have ""effectively built small communities,"" pairing sellers looking to unload their old clothes for cash with buyers eager to score deals, Cowen analyst Oliver Chen said in a recent report to clients.

'Conscious consumer'

Millennials and Gen Z shoppers are buoying the resale clothing industry. More than one in three Gen Z shoppers will buy secondhand clothes this year, compared to just 19% of Boomers, according to GlobalData research.

Environmental and economic conditions are converging to push younger shoppers to secondary markets.

In the last 15 years, clothing production around the world has doubled, even as the average number of times people wear their outfits has fallen, according to the conservation organization Ellen MacArthur Foundation. The global fashion industry is on track to account for a quarter of the world's annual carbon budget by 2050, the group estimates.

However, waste in the clothing and textile industries is becoming a top concern for younger shoppers. Nearly three-quarters of 18 to 29-year-old shoppers say they prefer to buy from sustainability-conscious brands, according to GlobalData.

""This was really a sustainability angle,"" Farfetch CEO Jose Neves told analysts earlier this month of his company's move into the resale market.

Resale platforms offer shoppers a way to recycle their old clothes and buy new styles in environmentally friendly ways.

Hunt for bargains

Resale clothing sites also appeal to younger shoppers who want to dress to fleeting fashion trends and cycle through different outfits, analysts say.

ThredUp, for example, says it adds 15,000 new items to its site every day as more sellers put up their old styles online.

Resale fits into the broader pattern of explosive growth in discount retail, too. Resale players offer prices 30% to 90% below traditional retailers, according to Chen.

TJMaxx TJX Macy's M Nordstrom JWN , Marshalls and other discount chains are growing , while department stores like, Saks andhave opened discount arms such as Macy's Backstage and Saks Off Fifth.

Despite a stronger economy in recent years, Americans across age groups and income levels are looking for bargains. Eighty-nine percent of all US consumers say they shop at discount retailers, according to a survey last year by the National Retail Federation, an industry trade group. The rate is even higher among Millennials and Gen Z shoppers.

Younger shoppers, often carrying high levels of student debt, are ""more cost conscious,"" said Ari Ginsberg, professor of entrepreneurship and management at NYU's Stern School of Business. The combination of top brands at affordable prices on resale and rental sites is ""particularly potent for Millennials and Gen Z,"" he added.

'Pre-loved pieces'

Traditional retailers can't ignore the growth in the resale industry, so they're finding ways to play in it.

Neiman Marcus says that more than half of its customers already use the resale market. It wants to keep those customers when they shop for secondhand goods while branching out to reach Fashionphile's younger audience.

At select Neiman Marcus stores, customers will be able to receive a price for their items from Fashionphile on the spot and get cash back. Neiman hopes those shoppers will then go spend that extra cash on new products in its stores.

Other retailers are trying out the resale market, too. H&M said in April that it will test a resale program in Sweden for ""pre-loved pieces"" from its & Other Stories brand.

""We're exploring different ideas on how our long-lasting designs can find their way to new owners,"" said Sanna Lindberg, who oversees the brand at H&M.

Online luxury retailer Farfetch began piloting Farfetch Second Life in May, a buyback program that enables customers to trade their designer handbags in for credit on future Fartetch purchases.

Expect to see more retailers make acquisitions, strike partnerships and test models to enter the resale industry, analysts predict.

""This is an old story of when you see industry disruption,"" said Ginsberg. ""If you don't develop those capabilities or go into those markets, you might be extinct pretty soon."""
"Dozens of major fashion labels including Adidas, Gucci, Zara, and H&M have pledged to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions 30 per cent by 2030 with the guidance of the United Nations.

At the UN's big COP24 climate summit in Poland this week, the brands and other stakeholders from across the industry launched the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action.

The charter includes the 30 per cent emissions cut as well as 15 other goals. These include a commitment to analysing and setting a ""decarbonisation pathway"" - basically a way of reducing emissions - and signatory companies phasing out coal-fired power generation from 2025.

Many of the other goals are pretty fuzzy, though. They include ""supporting the goals of the Paris Agreement"", ""pursuing energy efficiency measures"", partnering with banks to ""catalyse scalable solutions"", and ""establishing a closer dialogue"" with consumers and governments.

UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Patricia Epinosa described the charter as ""important"" and ""a unique commitment"".

""The fashion industry is always two steps ahead when it comes to defining world culture,"" she said.

The charter, like the renowned fashion runways of the world, sets an example that I hope others will follow.

'Change is urgently needed' as fashion demand booms

The global fashion business is a massive industrial source of greenhouse gases. Textile production released 1.2 billion tons of CO2 equivalent in 2015 - equal to the emissions of about 300 coal-fired power plants in one year, or more than double Australia's annual emissions.

The figure is going up fast. In March, the UN described the practice of churning out large volumes of cheap, disposable clothing ('fast fashion'), as an ""environmental and social emergency"".

It said this is only going to get worse as growing middle classes in countries such as China and India begin buying more clothes.

The industry-led charter does not suggest reducing consumption of clothes.

The UN will ""facilitate and coordinate"" the climate work of the fashion industry, including arranging workshops and setting annual goals. The first working groups will convene early next year.

Aside from major brands, the signatories include global logistics companies such as Maersk and Otto Group. Chinese textile industry bodies have also signed on as ""supporting organisations"".

In a statement, the CEO of Puma, Bjorn Gulden, said more than 90 per cent of the company's carbon footprint was generated in shared supply chains. ""If we want to reduce carbon emissions in our supply chains, we need to work together with our industry peers,"" he said.

Karl-Johan Persson, CEO of H&M, one of the largest fast fashion brands, said the charter was about getting the fashion industry united. ""Our industry has a global reach and only together can we create the change that is urgently needed,"" he said.

Designer Stella McCartney called on others in the industry to sign the charter and take the necessary actions to reduce emissions.

The founding signatories are: Adidas, Aquitex, Arcteryx, Burberry Limited, Esprit, Guess, Gap Inc., H&M Group, Hakro Gmbh., Hugo Boss, Inditex (owner of Zara), Kering Group (owner of Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent, among other brands), Lenzing AG, Levi Strauss & Co., Mammut Sports Group AG, Mantis World, Maersk, Otto Group, Pidigi S.P.A, PUMA SE, re:newcell, Schoeller Textiles AG, Peak Performance, PVH Corp., Salomon, Skunkfunk, SLN Textil, Stella McCartney, Sympatex Technologies, Target and Tropic Knits Group."
"(Bloomberg) -- On a full moon at high tide each spring, schools of grunion fish flop out of California’s coastal waters to spawn in the sand.

The beaches had a different set of attendees on one misty June evening: an army of spindly young men wearing Saint Laurent’s latest collection, including gauzy button-ups, crystal-studded blazers and pointy leather mules. The models paraded just a few feet from the breaking waves of Malibu’s Paradise Cove as journalists, stylists and celebrity guests flashed their smartphones in appreciation.

The grunion were nowhere to be seen, an absence that generated angry complaints and letters from Malibu townspeople and officials. In their sight lines: Kering SA, owner of the Saint Laurent brand. The company has positioned itself at the forefront of a movement to clean up fashion’s environmental impact but flew in participants from around the world, releasing thousands of pounds of carbon dioxide.

The luxury-goods business is walking a high wire. Fierce competition for consumer dollars and for social media attention is pushing brands to produce ever-flashier events. Surging demand from China has lifted production to unprecedented levels—meaning the manufacturers are using up more natural resources, such as metal hardware, leather skins, and cashmere, than ever before. At the same time, the industry is facing more pressure from consumers and regulators to curb the environmental impact of its rapid growth, heavily polluting supply chain and loose control of suppliers.

“You have regulators, consumers, and more and more the investors who are making environmental and social criteria an important red flag,” said Mario Ortelli, a London-based luxury consultant.

The industry is starting to wake up. Apparel makers including Giorgio Armani SpA and Versace have discontinued the use of controversial materials, like fur. Burberry Group Plc vowed recently to stop destroying unsold stock, a widespread practice in the fashion industry to avoid unwanted products being spotted in bargain bins. Industry giant LVMH, the owner of Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Dom Perignon Champagne, in July bought a stake in Stella McCartney’s fashion label, known for working with sustainable materials such as biodegradable shoe soles. Prada SpA has said it wants to source all of its iconic nylon accessories from recycled materials including ocean waste by the end of 2021.

Leading the way is Kering, Saint Laurent’s owner, whose other brands include Gucci and Balenciaga. Chairman Francois-Henri Pinault is working to rally global fashion companies around a new sustainability pact. French President Emmanuel Macron has put the issue on the agenda of the Group of Seven summit he's hosting this month in Biarritz, tapping Pinault to spearhead the initiative. The Kering boss is trying to get companies to sign on to targets that could include eliminating single-use plastics and accelerating their transition to renewable energy.

While Pinault’s brands spin a dream of luxury, he’s also made sure that more and more of the looks on display are produced from organic cotton, traceable leather skins or recycled plastic.

Kering says it’s also pressuring its networks of suppliers and sub-suppliers to open up about where exactly their raw materials come from, and imposing higher standards on energy efficiency and animal welfare. In an industry where leather goods drive profits, Pinault is pushing tanneries to invest in new processes for turning animal hides into supple handbags without employing chromium, a pollutant whose use remains widespread. Executives at Kering have even seen their bonuses tied to environmental performance since 2010.

“We shouldn’t wait for people to require us to use different materials before figuring out how,” Pinault said in an interview. “It’s up to us to come up with products that are respectful of the environment.”

Consumers may associate pollution and waste in the apparel industry with fast-fashion retailers or sneaker makers, whose supply chains often lead to massive factories in loosely regulated countries where labor is cheap. But now the spotlight is widening to fall on luxury companies, too, as a new cohort of young, wealthy clients looks to avoid glamorous products that come with an unsavory backstory.

Millennials and Generation Z will account for four-fifths of the luxury industry's growth in the coming years, Jefferies analyst Flavio Cereda said in a July report. Three-quarters of millennials said they’d alter their buying habits on environmental concerns; the comparable figure for baby boomers was 34%.

As in the aftermath of Saint Laurent’s Malibu show, social media and smartphones have made it easier for criticism of the industry’s environmental sins to spread. Previous triggers included videos of suffering crocodiles or cashmere goats at sites that supplied leather or wool for luxury brands. Burberry’s burning of millions of dollars worth of unsold merchandise prompted some shareholders to demand change.

More than any other company, Kering illustrates the luxury industry’s tension between needing to sell a dream of excess and indulgence while assuring consumers it can be done without hurting the planet. The French luxury group’s blockbuster turnarounds at Gucci as well as Saint Laurent and Balenciaga have seen earnings more than double since 2014, but Kering is still viewed as a scrappy upstart in comparison to stalwarts such as Hermes International or the much larger LVMH. Investors in the Gucci owner have learned to expect rapid quarterly growth—so improvements to environmental impact are easily offset by the rising volumes.

While LVMH has been tackling the same environmental challenges behind closed doors, Kering and Pinault have opted to speak about them openly. The company’s “environmental profit and loss” accounting allows anyone to view where and how its supply chain is affecting the environment, whether it’s intensive land use at cashmere farms in Mongolia or water pollution from Bolivian mountain mines, where silver is extracted for jewelry. This allows the Gucci owner to convert its environmental impact to a dollar amount—just over 500 million euros ($554.8 million) last year, Kering estimates. The goal is to reduce the environmental impact relative to sales by 40%.

Half of that would come from implementing better practices throughout supply chains, as well as boosting the use of more sustainable materials like organic cotton. The other half would need to come from yet-unidentified innovations.

Even if Kering were to reach its target, the frenetic growth rate of the fashion industry, particularly for successful brands such as Gucci, means that it would still be a long way from reducing the impact in absolute terms.

A report in May by the Global Fashion Agenda, a group that’s campaigning for a more sustainable industry, found that efforts to lessen the environmental impact aren’t keeping up with growth. Annual production of clothing and footwear, on track to reach more than 100 million tons by 2030, will exert “an unprecedented strain on planetary resources,” the report said.

“Fashion is an industry that knows it’s unsustainable, and luxury is at the top of that value chain,” said Michael Stanley-Jones, co-secretary of the UN Alliance for Sustainable Fashion. The textile industry is the second-biggest polluter of water, and fashion accounts for 8% of carbon emissions worldwide, a share that’s rising. “You’re seeing runaway growth that’s pretty aggressive. It’s alarming.”

The steps most crucial to progress in sustainability are often the most difficult to control. Brands as prestigious as Gucci still struggle to figure out where their raw materials actually come from. “Made in Italy” and made “in-house” are two different things, and even top-end brands have had to fight an uphill battle to gain visibility into the vast network of contractors and subcontractors involved in making every look.

Verifying that cows are being raised humanely and that breeders used land responsibly would require being able to trace a leather hide back to the farm. Currently, Kering can only trace it to the slaughterhouse.

“One particularity of the fashion industry is that we’re not vertically integrated,” Pinault said. “I don’t own the cotton fields. We aren’t spinning thread.”

If Kering is willing to speak openly about its environmental challenges at the corporate level, its brands are often less eager to do so with consumers. Gucci has raised the share of metal-free tanning in its handbags from 0.2% to 13%. That leaves a majority of the brand’s leather still made with potentially toxic chromium—not a great marketing pitch.

At a Gucci boutique next to Paris’s Place de la Concorde, products made with more eco-friendly materials have been quietly mixed in with the items on display. Best-selling products like a cardinal-red Dionysus handbag—a 1,980 euro model recognizable for its serpent clasp—are prominently displayed but bear no tags telling shoppers that they’re now tanned without the use of potentially toxic chromium. Nor will you find any indication that the palladium hardware on the new Zumi handbag line is sourced from recycled medical equipment.

Slowly, however, brands are starting to respond more openly to sustainable fashion demand. Gucci, for example, publishes its environmental policy on its website. Kering’s Bottega Veneta, known for its expertise in high-quality leathers, is introducing alternatives under its new designer, Daniel Lee. An upcoming collection includes pouches and cross-body bags made out of pressed cork and fennel. At Kering’s Materials Innovation Lab, one executive has spent years building a library of sustainable materials, lobbying brands to implement them in their collections as well as pushing the suppliers to adapt them to better suit their needs. One recent initiative by the lab involves working with U.S. cotton trade group Supima to roll out cotton with a documented “chemical fingerprint.” That allows a swatch from a poplin shirt to be traced all the way back to the farm.

Sustainability and traceability initiatives that started as “risk management” for the fashion industry will eventually become drivers of value and a competitive advantage, consultant Ortelli said—even if most consumers aren’t paying attention yet. Companies that don’t invest in reining in their environmental footprint deeper in the supply chain will likely struggle to compete in the future, he said.

“Today there is a lot of talk about the issue of sustainability,” said Luca Solca, luxury analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. Meanwhile there’s “not much of a way to tell” which brands are actually investing in turning that talk into action.

Kering declined to comment on the environmental impact of its destination fashion show in Malibu, other than to point out that it recently formed a working group on reducing the environmental impact of fashion shows with LVMH, which also flew guests as far as Marrakesh and New York for destination shows this year.

As for the Malibu event a city spokesman said Kering cleaned up plastic sandbags and water bottles afterward.

Soon Pinault and other fashion leaders are headed for another beach—Biarritz—for the G-7 summit. At the behest of Macron, they’ll present new commitments for improving their impact on climate change, biodiversity, and oceans.

Turning around the fashion industry’s growing environmental costs in absolute terms is still far from sight, though. That means the tough decisions are still to come.

“You shouldn’t underestimate the work that’s being done at different companies,” Pinault said. “The problem is that we’re all working in our little corners, so despite our efforts everything we do is completely offset by the growth.”

"It started with a vision: to raise up Canadian fashion designers and help them succeed at home and internationally. For nine years, the trio behind The Collections agency— Mel Ashcroft, Brian A. Richards and Dwayne Kennedy—produced runway shows for more than 200 designers, conceptualized shoots and campaigns, worked closely with Toronto Fashion Week and, last year, collaborated with Hudson’s Bay to launch 12 homegrown designer brands in stores across the country.

Their impact on Canadian fashion can’t be overstated. They’re the cool kids of the fashion scene, the ones who believed in the possibilities for the industry and who were never afraid to dream big.

Now, the trio is disbanding to pursue other opportunities, but they still call each other family. We chatted with them about their legacy and how they hope to see Canadian fashion move forward.

What was the Canadian fashion landscape like in 2010 when you started The Collections?

Dwayne Kennedy: “Big brand and traditional. We wanted to highlight the youthful designers, and there wasn’t much of a platform to do so. So we created one and collaborated with Robin Kay and the FDCC [Fashion Design Council of Canada].”

Brian A. Richards: “It was kind of like how it is now: fragmented. A cacophony of opinions, no focus. Meanwhile, more amazing designers and creatives and innovators than we knew what to do with.”

Mel Ashcroft: “Back in 2010, it seemed like anything was possible. Perhaps this had more to do with youth than reality. There was a constant excitement in the air and momentum from a new wave of talent that included names like Sid Neigum, Beaufille, Laura Siegel, Thomas Balint and MICHI — to name a few — who were establishing themselves in the market.”

How is the Canadian fashion scene different now than when you first got together?

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Mel Ashcroft: “The global fashion industry has changed substantially. Social media has shifted the power to the consumer. More emerging designers have changed their sales strategy to direct-to-consumer by selling through their own e-commerce site — at least initially to grow their business and better understand their clients before investing in trade shows or attempting to sell direct-to-retailer.”

Dwayne Kennedy: “When we started, emerging designers really struggled with finding the right balance of commercial and editorial. Today with the rise of social media we can better predict and understand what the consumer wants, which makes it easier to become sellable if you use these tools properly.”

Brian A. Richards: “The traditional methods of promotion and presentation have changed. A designer does not need to do a presentation in order to maintain presence, make sales. This is radical.”

How would you define Canadian fashion now?

Brian A. Richards: “Resilient despite being underfunded, fragmented and confused.”

Mel Ashcroft: “Fragmented, evolving and I’m curious to see how technology will continue to disrupt and innovate our industry. The fashion industry is complex, and there are a lot of efficiencies that need to be improved for fashion to be more sustainable to our environment and the people working in this sector.”

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Dwayne Kennedy: “I don’t really believe in defining designers by the country of their origin anymore. In order to be a successful designer you have to be international and labels such as “Canadian/emerging” can have a negative impact on the brand’s growth as it stereotypes them. That being said, there are so many incredible designers based in Canada. The fashion industry in Canada needs a lot more support and direction for it to be truly beneficial for designers and to become recognized internationally.”

What do you think are the biggest challenges facing Canadian fashion now?

Mel Ashcroft: “Canada needs a governing body to unify the industry and establish access to government grants. We also need programs for designers to provide them with an international platform in key markets to drive sales and brand awareness to consumers locally and abroad.”

Dwayne Kennedy: “All-around support. The government, retailers, philanthropists and key industry players have to think globally when it comes to designers and artists here at home. We need to create an international Canadian voice abroad that bridges the gap that has plagued our industry since it started. Today's consumer wants to be branded as global, so we have to provide our designers with a platform that speaks to that so they can thrive both locally and internationally. Successful designers have been doing this on their own for years, and it's time for the industry to unite and make this their top priority.”

Brian A. Richards: “Canadian fashion's problem is that it seems terribly difficult for the various factions to work together. The Collections was indiscriminate and encouraged outreach and collaboration. I hope the industry continues to search for ways to present a unified message to consumers, investors, creatives, professionals, anyone really.”

What are you most proud of from your time as The Collections?

Mel Ashcroft: “Our dedication and contribution to the creative community and an incredible portfolio of work we’ve produced over the last 10 years. I’m also proud to call my former business partners family. We have done so much together, and they will continue to be important on a personal level as we redefine who we are individually.”

Dwayne Kennedy: “Our partnership with Hudson’s Bay was a highlight for me. To be able to build a platform with a retailer that supports designers both through orders and marketing was a very exciting moment.”

Brian A. Richards: “I'm proud that over 10 years we've had the pleasure of working with young fashion dreamers who went on to be successful fashion professionals. I'm proud that we introduced designers into the industry, insisting on the inclusion of these young contemporary talents who went on to international success, because we believed, and still do on good days, that Toronto is comparable to other respected fashion cities.”

What are you most excited about in the Canadian fashion space now and why?

Dwayne Kennedy: “I’m most excited about technology and how it’s disrupting content production and distribution.”

Mel Ashcroft: “There is tremendous growth potential for more technology and sustainability practices to be integrated into today's fashion industry. I’m excited about how we can minimize fashion waste and become more responsible and efficient within our culture.”

Brian A. Richards: “I’m excited about places like Ryerson Fashion Zone, which incubate innovative businesses in tech and functional design with a fashion common denominator. The future of fashion is in sustainable practices and fabrics, smart textiles, AI and collecting data. I’m extraordinarily eager to see what Toronto produces in these spaces.”"

JOHANNESBURG - Conscious Durbanites remember that “Local is Lekker,” as South Africa heads for Black Friday next month.



A recent survey conducted by South African online marketplace, bidorbuy, says Durbanites like movies, music CDs and LPs more than other online shoppers. Electronics and fashion are top buying items in South Africa.





In a constrained economy, there is a huge temptation to buy cheap imports or discounted store-made goods rather than local brands.





But buying local also boost jobs and manufacturing.





Proudly South African chief executive Eustace Mashimbye says: “Simply rejecting Proudly South African goods based on the belief that they cost more is a lazy response to our call to buy local to save and create job… Of course, “fong kong” items are cheaper, but it is important to compare apples with apples and not compare cheap, poor quality goods with well made, local items of excellent quality. “





Mashimbye says Proudly SA is working hard to effect a fundamental change in attitude towards home grown, manufactured and produced goods.





“Our art, artefacts and designer clothes have been bought by international celebrities. A local chandelier from a Karoo based company made it into the Obama’s White House.





Beyoncé has given a nod to Maxhosa by Laduma designs, which have also been worn by Alicia Keys,” Mashimbye says.





File image IOL.







“Laduma is someone who is not afraid to put a high price tag on his beautiful woollen range of designer clothes. We know that he could produce them cheaper with imported wool, but he is keeping it local, giving jobs to spinners and dyers by buying local. His clothes stand up to quality and value for money scrutiny against any international fashion house.""





Dr Precious Moloi Motsepe, the founder and chief executive of African Fashion International, says the manufacturing industry has the highest multiplier effect, significantly affecting job creation and social impact.





Motsepe says the Department of Trade and Industry considers clothing, textiles, leather and footwear (CTLF) to be a key labour-intensive industry in their Industrial Policy Action Plan. In 2017, CTLF production accounted for 3.3 percent of South Africa’s gross domestic product, up from 1� percent in 2013.





“Yet, policy is not enough to boost the market. CottonSA calculated in the early 2000�s, more than 120 000 people were employed in the local clothing industry. In 2016 employment declined by more than half, to less than 60 000 people employed.”





Motsepe says growing the opportunities for African designers was tightly linked to investing in manufacturing and the entire supply chain.





University of KwaZulu-Natal small business development expert Lindiwe Kunene says there is a great fashion talent in the province.





However, local entrepreneurs need to be careful to protect their brands.





Proudly South African recently came out in defence of Laduma Ngxokolo in his case against retailer Zara, when a range of socks that bore a striking resemblance to his Khanyisa cardigan design appeared in their stores. Zara subsequently discontinued the sale of the socks.





Quiteria Kekana and George Malelu, the co-founders and managers at Quiteria & George, says that counterfeiting threatened many local and international luxury brands.





“In addition to reduced profitability, fashion counterfeiting gnaws at the brand uniqueness of small fashion designers. The influx of cheap clothing imports coupled with clothing counterfeits are crippling small and large luxury clothing brands.”





Kekana and Malel advise the following measures that small designers can put in place to counter the risk of fashion counterfeits:

Setting up online stores:





Online marketplaces provide an alternative for local designers who want to minimise the risk of their designs being copied. Online stores thrive on exclusivity as the clothing items and accessories being sold are not easily accessible to counterfeiters.





Pop-up stores:





The concept of pop-up stores enables small designers to build their brands at a low cost. Upcoming designers who have no physical premises can sell their clothing items at places where their target customers shop.





Pop-up stores, like online stores have an element of exclusivity, which is a crucial differentiator for luxury brands. Designers engage with customers and promote their brand, while making sales when they utilise pop-up stores.





Join forces with the government and e-commerce stores:





The South African government has in recent years, improved Intellectual Property (IP) protection to handle the growing number of infringement cases.





Upcoming designers can enhance their anti-counterfeit strategies by making use of the channels that the government provides.





Register design trademarks:





Although this option is more costly, especially for start-up designers who need to cut operating costs, it provides a workable anti-counterfeit solution.





South African law protects intellectual property, but only if a trademark is officially registered. Once your trademark is officially registered in South Africa, a designer can take legal action against counterfeits.

"life-style, life,

In 2019 fashion is more disposable than ever. Big brands have new clothing lines introduced on a weekly basis, while materials become increasingly synthetic, and Australians are throwing away clothes at alarming rates. ""A third of clothing is wasted,"" says sustainability consultant Jane Milburn. ""While there's no definitive figure on this, my own research on available information shows that Australians are buying an average of 27kg of clothing and textiles each year. We're the second largest in the world after North America."" Of that 27kg of textiles, ABS figures show Australians are sending, on average, 23kg to landfill each year. ""We are buying a lot, but throwing a lot away and we've become complacent."" There are several factors contributing to this extreme turnover according to Ms Milburn. ""Around 90 per cent of clothing comes in from overseas. A lot of this is produced cheaply in factories using exploitative conditions,"" she said. ""We also know two thirds of it is made from synthetic fibres made from petroleum. ""When you combine these changes - cheaply made clothes and changing fibres, it has led to a two-to-four times increase in consumption. As a consequence we've got more waste happening and we are also losing the skills and knowledge associated with making and caring for clothes."" Because we now have so many clothes and they are of such poor quality, Ms Milburn says its normal for people to have very little attachment to them. ""We've got to go back to seeking value,"" she says. ""Clothing made of natural fibres, in simple styles that suit us, they aren't just transient with the season. So if we buy better quality we'll look after it. This was the old way, and many would argue it's the better way in the long term."" However she's not advocating we all rush out and buy new sustainable and ethical items. ""The most sustainable garment you own, is the one already hanging in your wardrobe,"" Ms Milburn says. ""Most people already have a lot of clothes and it's about re-looking at what you've already got, why you aren't wearing it and what you can do to wear it. ""Does it need to be shortened so it's better for your body shape? We're all differed heights, with bumps in different places, so we need things to work for us because then we are more likely to value and hold onto them."" Ms Milburn is an advocate for people learning to repair and modify their own clothing themselves and she'd love to see more people honing these skills. ""Then we can have autonomy and change things ourselves,"" she says. ""These are every day life skills we think we don't need anymore, because we can just go buy a new one if a button's missing. But that's not very satisfying - it's wasteful and leaves us feeling a bit empty. We're not working with our hands in the way nature intended."" However she does acknowledge not everyone has the time or the inclination, and in that case Ms Milburn says looking around your local community for someone with the skills is the way to go. ""That might be your grandma, or it might be someone who is a seamstress or a tailor,"" she says. ""You might even find someone who can teach you to sew. It's a return to localism. We've done globalism, and there are some efficiencies there, but we are recognising we need to really value our local communities and connections. ""Often places like your local dry-cleaners will offer a making and mending service, and some of the better quality clothing stories will have someone who can make alterations to a garment."" And if alterations aren't going to salvage the item, Ms Milburn suggests engaging in clothes swaps, with family or friends. ""It's another aspect of taking community action."" When it comes to caring for your clothing, Ms Milburn says it's hard to go past the simplicity and effectiveness of gentle hand washing in cold water. ""Washing by hand shouldn't be underrated, if you really want to care for your clothes."" She also cautions against overwashing. ""Really clothes should only be washed when they look dirty or smell dirty. We really overdo the washing. It wears clothes out quicker and it's also shedding fibres."" This of course isn't a huge issue if the fibres are natural, but more often than not they are synthetic. These fibres, which are essentially tiny pieces of plastic, are then entering the ecosystem and failing to break down. But the solution isn't to simply replace all synthetic fibres with natural ones - we don't have the land space for all those crops. ""Really we can't keep up with this endless consumption business,"" Ms Milburn says. ""In a finite world, it just doesn't add up."" Jane Milburn started noticing fashion waste around 2011, and set up Textile Beat in 2013 to begin a conversation about clothes. She's particularly interested in natural fibres, which links back to her education in agriculture, and also in upcycling - how to reuse existing resources.

"If the United States does impose tariffs on another $300 billion worth of Chinese goods, it would cost U.S. consumers $12.2 billion more for apparel, footwear, toys and household appliances each year, the National Retail Federation (NRF) said on Friday.

The tariffs would result in consumers paying another $4.4 billion on apparel, $2.5 billion on footwear, $3.7 billion for toys and $1.6 billion for household appliances, the retail trade group said, based on a study it had commissioned.

“It would be impossible for all market participants in our industry to simultaneously move sourcing to other countries. The capacity does not exist,” David French, NRF’s senior vice president of government relations, said in a statement. “In the short term, retailers would be forced to continue to use Chinese suppliers and pass on higher costs to their customers.”

Many retailers including J.C. Penney Co and Macy’s Inc have opposed more tariffs on Chinese goods and warned of higher prices for domestic consumers.

Separately, on Friday, the United States Fashion Industry Association (USFIA), which represents brands, retailers, importers and wholesalers based in the United States, estimated that additional tariffs on clothing and home textiles would cost American consumers $4.9 billion per year.

“We can conservatively estimate an increase in retail prices for products still made in China…That means a family of four would pay an additional $60 per year just on clothing,” USFIA said http://bit.ly/2KvIO50.

“The fact remains that for many (fashion brands and retailers), China remains the No. 1 supplier in the world, with no realistic options for other sourcing destinations that could replace China,” it added

President Donald Trump has threatened to extend tariffs on another $300 billion worth of goods imported from China. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are to meet on the sidelines of the Group of 20 meeting in Japan at the end of next week to discuss the trade issues.

"Adelaide Fashion Festival showcase aims to redesign perception of Islamic fashion

Posted

Students from Indonesia and Australia have collaborated on a unique showcase for the Adelaide Fashion Festival — a collection of modest garments they hope will redesign the industry's perception of Islamic fashion.

Key points: Indonesian and Adelaide students collaborate for collection at Adelaide Fashion Festival

Move to create more modern but modest fashion for Muslim women

Bid to get more women into Indonesian fashion industry

Anita Yuni is one of six students from the Islamic Fashion Institute in Bandung, Indonesia, who has travelled to Adelaide this week to showcase the collection with fashion students from TAFE SA.

She said it could be challenging for Muslim women around the world to find stylish but culturally appropriate clothing.

She hoped the students' collection of garments gracing the festival's runway this weekend, alongside the likes of Paolo Sebastian, could help make Muslim fashion more appealing to a wider audience.

""I think this is a new life journey for me,"" she said.

""The scarf here is very thick and cannot be bent, you cannot mould it easily.

""I think we can add on some sophisticated detail on our brand-new Muslim fashion designs.

""I think modest wear can also be worn by a woman not wearing a hijab; I think for winter or autumn, they can wear that design also.""

TAFE SA design student Jade Barker said the fashion world was starting to take notice of modest clothing — and was keen to be part of the movement.

""It's [currently] very oversized tunics and it's a bit cliche and it hasn't really evolved that much,"" Jade said.

""So this is great that up and coming designers are designing for that market.

""Internationally, it's a really big thing and it's slowly happening here in Australia.""

Cashing in on 'modest fashion' boom

TAFE SA fashion and costume lecturer Jane Hardacre said it made business and fashion sense for the Australian fashion industry to make modest clothing that was also cutting edge.

""Kids from an Islamic background, they're young, they want to look trendy, they want to have something that they can wear too,"" she said.

""We don't want to fit people into a mould and say, 'This is what you must wear'.

""The world we live in is pluralistic, it's multicultural, we want to respond to people's different needs and aspirations.

""The economics suggest that it's a growing population — there's a growing demand for modest fashion and we're responding to that.

""We want to put Australia, particularly South Australia, on the world map for fashion.""

Over the past two years, the two fashion institutions have learnt from each other — Australian students have travelled to Indonesia to learn about textiles and production, while the Indonesian students have gained a better understanding of the latest technology and Western fashion through exchanges to Adelaide.

Hope to grow partnership

What started as an informal partnership between the two schools but has now led to a memorandum of understanding being drawn up, and dreams of starting a combined online retail space.

Islamic Fashion Institute adviser Euis Saedah said it was a partnership she hoped would continue to grow.

""We have the experience to go global and that's why we have to come to rich countries considered to be more advanced than Indonesia,"" she said.

""We have to come here to learn so younger generations know how to do things relating to every single detail of fashion work — like cutting, sewing, technology of drawing, information technology.

""This has economic value and this can attract people, especially women, to do more — making accessories, making dresses.

""I can see their enthusiasm after only two days here — some of them have ideas.""

The Adelaide Fashion Festival runs until Sunday and features prominent and emerging local designers and puts the spotlight on sustainable and innovative styles in the industry.

"By Kane Wu and Pei Li

HONG KONG/BEIJING, Nov 12 (Reuters) - China's acquisitive apparel firm Shandong Ruyi is targeting more global deals involving ""affordable luxury"" brands, under a push to establish the first high-end Chinese fashion empire to eventually challenge behemoth LVMH.

Its chairman, Qiu Yafu, who has led a spate of deals buying tailors Gieves & Hawkes to Swiss luxury brand Bally, told Reuters on Monday the company would focus on affordable luxury, where he sees growth even amid broader economic slowdown.

Qiu, a little-known billionaire with a low-profile even in China, has big ambitions in the world of fashion, where his growing empire is leading the race in China to rival established fashion houses in the traditionally European dominated industry.

The magnate, who started as an apprentice at the age of 17 at one of Ruyi's textile mills, has built up control of a range of European luxury brands through aggressive acquisitions worth billions of dollars, including French fashion house SMCP and Britain's Aquascutum.

Qiu, tall and wearing a dark fitted suit and red tie, said the broader Ruyi group wanted to become as big as LVMH, though added that wouldn't happen overnight.

""LV is a world renowned god-like enterprise. It is our role model. We are still a far cry from it but that's our vision,"" Qiu, who was born in 1958, told Reuters during an interview in Hong Kong on the sidelines of a luxury industry conference.

""Would it take five years, 10 years, even longer, or for the next generation or a better team to achieve? It is a very important project and challenge. It may even be impossible. But it doesn't mean we shouldn't learn, imitate or borrow ideas.""

Qiu added the firm would ""pursue"" deals for quality ""trend-setter"" brands with sustainable development prospects, though he was less interested in brands he likened to ""pop music, only catering to people's tastes for a short while but not lasting"".

""Ruyi has firm and specific requirements and strategic positioning for fashion brands. We are always studying and watching brands that fit the positioning of high quality, high growth and high pricing,"" he said.

Ruyi and Qiu are looking to help brands target China's huge but slowing domestic apparel market, which research firm Euromonitor expects will hit 2.2 trillion yuan ($316.05 billion) by 2022, up around 10 percent from its current size. To that end, he said the firm would look to leverage big data and online stores to reach more shoppers.

The firm's pivot into fashion is part of a wider drive by Chinese firms that also includes conglomerates Fosun, which could lead to an increase in fashion sector deal-making.

Once a state-owned textiles firm, Ruyi was privatised two decades ago as part of a government reform. Its deal-making spree started in 2010 and has stretched from Japanese brand Renown to Hong Kong-based Trinity Group and textile brands such as Lycra.

With presence in 84 countries, Ruyi's annual sales revenue has exceeded 20 billion yuan, Qiu said. ($1 = 6.9609 Chinese yuan renminbi) (Reporting by Kane Wu, Pei Li and Adam Jourdan; Editing by Christopher Cushing)"
"Fake fur has soared in popularity in recent years as shoppers become more ethically-conscious, but this is having an adverse effect on the planet, says MP Mary Creagh, who is currently leading a parliamentary inquiry into sustainability in the fashion industry.

While major fashion brands such as Burberry and Gucci have been praised for recently eschewing animal fur from their collections, the faux alternative might not be much better because these materials are made from synthetic fibres derived from fossil fuels that are contributing to greenhouse gas emissions.

Speaking to The Independent, the Labour politician explained how fake fur garments are also “almost impossible to recycle” and often end up in landfill as a result of a fast fashion culture that means clothes are worn and then discarded to make room for the next trend.

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.

“Fashion tells us we can have anything we want, that we don’t want to kill animals to have our fur, but what they’re not telling us about is the carbon consequences of extracting the material for faux alternatives,” she said.

“These garments are made entirely out of artificial fibres like polyester that are a by-product of the petroleum industry.”

The Wakefield MP added that the often-cited sustainable method of taking these clothes to charity shops after use is also problematic, given that four out of 10 items donated don’t get sold due to an inundation of items.

“They’ve become a dumping ground,” she said.

The advent of brands specialising in faux fur, such as Shrimps and Charlotte Simone, has meant that the material is now highly sought after by mainstream shoppers and celebrities, with Kate Moss and Alexa Chung seen sporting the trend and inspiring others to do so.

While Creagh clarified she isn’t calling for a ban on fake fur, she said that shoppers need to be educated on the environmental consequences of their purchasing habits.

“Fake fur is one thing, but its problems are symptomatic of an entire industry that is rooted in overconsumption and aims to sell us something new every week,” she continued, adding that decreasing prices in high street shops (where some items are priced as low as £5) have fostered a culture of disposability in fashion, leading items to be worn just once or twice before being discarded.

Since the environmental audit committee’s inquiry began, Creagh noted how some fashion publications have been making efforts to promote vintage clothing and offer tips on sourcing old items.

“There has been some progress,” she said, “with magazines encouraging readers to rework old clothes and seek out second-hand items, such as cashmere.”

But faux fur and other unsustainable items are still heavily promoted, she added, meaning we have a long way to go if we’re to see real tangible change in the industry in regard to the environment."

LONDON, Oct 30 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Britain should pressurise fashion brands to design clothes that pollute less and are easier to recycle to reduce fast fashion's environmental impact, experts told lawmakers on Tuesday.

Demand for cheap garments is also leading to poor working conditions and exploitation in global supply chains, the Environmental Audit Committee was told at the first hearing of its inquiry into the sustainability of the fashion industry.

""Consumers in the UK are getting pleasure and enjoyment from fashion and that is coming at a cost to workers and the environment,"" said Mark Sumner, a lecturer in fashion and sustainability at the University of Leeds.

Businesses face growing pressure to ensure their supply chains are environmentally-friendly and pay their workers fair wages, as campaigners estimate some 25 million people globally were estimated to be trapped in forced labour in 2016.

Global clothing sales have boomed in the last two decades, driven by fast-changing fashion trends, but this has resulted in people wearing each item far fewer times before throwing it away, a 2017 report by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation found.

Textile production emits 1.2 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases annually, more than all international flights and maritime shipping combined, it said, with less than 1 percent of unwanted clothes being recycled.

Alan Wheeler, head of Britain's Textile Recycling Association, a trade group, said incentives like taxes should be used to push companies to design clothing that is easier to recycle and disassemble.

""I would like to see producers, retailers, being made in some way to take more responsibility for the clothing that they are putting on the market,"" he told lawmakers in London.

Companies should also try to cut the amount of plastic fibres that clothes shed during washing, said Richard Thompson, a professor of marine biology at the University of Plymouth.

Clothes release half a million tonnes of plastic microfibres into the ocean every year, equivalent to more than 50 billion plastic bottles, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.

""We are finding synthetic materials - plastics but particularly fibres - in the deep sea, in Arctic sea ice, in fishing shellfish,"" said Thompson.

"Big issue: Liz Bonnin Amy Powney

How sustainable shopping can cut environmental cost of fast fashion BelfastTelegraph.co.uk There's no denying the fashion industry has a problem with sustainability and considering the popularity of fast fashion, it can be easy to feel, as a consumer, somewhat detached from the environmental issues.

There's no denying the fashion industry has a problem with sustainability and considering the popularity of fast fashion, it can be easy to feel, as a consumer, somewhat detached from the environmental issues. After all, you're just buying another T-shirt, right?

Liz Bonnin, Science and natural history presenter at BBC Planet, has teamed up with sustainable fashion brand Mother of Pearl to tackle these issues head on. To raise awareness of the issues, they've created a capsule collection using eco-friendly methods, and will unveil a short film (which will be available to watch across BBC Earth social platforms), narrated by Bonnin, that delves into fashion's impact on the planet.

We spoke to Bonnin and Mother of Pearl creative director Amy Powney to find out more about the fashion industry's eco record, and what we can all do to help.

The fashion industry has a major impact on the environment

Bonnin is no stranger to discussing environmental issues facing the planet - last year she made BBC One documentary Drowning In Plastic. However, she is still shocked by the fashion industry's impact - even if she's not totally surprised.

""The facts and figures are harrowing with this particular industry,"" she says. ""But they're harrowing with a lot of other industries contributing to our environmental crises too.""

Both Bonnin and Powney agree the culture of fast fashion is a big contributor. ""It's a huge problem and it's just a matter of time before social media leaks the truth and for people to really start taking note,"" says Powney.

According to a report from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, if nothing changes, the fashion industry could use up more than a quarter of the world's carbon budget by 2050. Every year, it releases half a million tonnes of microfibres into the ocean - the equivalent of more than 50 billion plastic bottles.

It can be easy to feel detached from the fate of our clothes

When buying a new top online or picking up some trousers in your local shopping centre, thoughts of environmental sustainability are probably far from your mind.

For Bonnin, one of the most startling things she learned in making this documentary is how little clothing features recycled material. ""Less than 1% of the materials used to produce clothing are recycled - I always thought we were more responsible than that,"" she says. ""You'd think we'd be able to recycle more natural materials, like cotton - so how is it that less than 1% is recycled?""

It's a good point, and makes you think: what do you actually know about what happens to your clothes after you throw them out?

""We don't think enough about how we take from the natural world and then how we dispose of it,"" says Bonnin. ""It's so easy to think things are different and to throw away things we use, thinking they go somewhere to be taken care of responsibly.""

Powney has been considering issues of sustainability and fashion since producing her graduate collection more than a decade ago. When asked why it's taken so long for the industry to catch up with her, she pauses, then says: ""The kindest answer is, a lot of people don't know how complex it is and how bad it is. From a consumer point of view, people don't relate fashion as having an environmental impact - they haven't put the two together, and quite frankly, a lot of people in the industry don't know either.""

It's a case of being more mindful of how you shop

""There's something incredibly empowering and joyful about taking responsibility for how you shop,"" says Bonnin. ""Whether you're giving back to nature by wearing a garment and not dumping it, or buying less, there's a feelgood factor which encourages us to act more responsibly.""

Helping the environment, even in your own small way, can make you feel great - but what can you actually do to contribute?

""It is a bit of a minefield,"" notes Powney. ""It's still a bit complicated knowing exactly what to buy."" However, ""shopping consciously is something that's really important"", she explains.

""Before you buy something, ask yourself: do you really want that piece? Do you feel emotionally engaged with it so you want to wear it again and again? If the answer's 'no' you should maybe put it back on the rail.

""It's finding that love again for your garment. I remember being a child and begging my mum for a party dress - you loved it, you stared at it, you couldn't wait to wear it, and I think we need that back.""

It's not always easy to shop ethically - the information on factors like supply chains are often quite hard to obtain, but you can still make an effort to shop consciously. Perhaps adopt the Marie Kondo method - if it doesn't spark joy, is it really worth spending money on?

""If you do fall out of love with something or grow out of it, think about reselling, repurposing or repairing,"" Powney advises, ""even if throwing something in the bin is the easiest thing to do.""

This will have a knock-on effect on the industry

Powney believes we're in a moment of real change. ""Sustainability in fashion wasn't a widely discussed topic - until now,"" she says. ""Consumers are waking up and asking where their products are coming from. There's a movement towards that in general across the world, so fashion's next.

""I do think there's a really positive possibility for consumers to drive that demand, which fundamentally will make a lot of brands change their ways.""

""To turn something around of this scale - how we consume and how we produce - does take time,"" says Bonnin, but there's hope. However, it's clear we all need to act now - before it's too late.

Mother of Pearl's eco capsule collection, created alongside BBC Planet, will be available from June

"Fighting climate change is a growing priority for fashion companies, with British luxury house Burberry the latest to announce a strategy to slash emissions across its supply chain.

But while the fashion industry wants to help the planet—the apparel business creates around 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions—companies are also responding to consumer demand for products with more sustainable origins.

According to the Sustainable Apparel Coalition's 2019 Pulse of the Fashion Industry Report, 75% of consumers view sustainability as very or extremely important. Half of shoppers said they would switch brands if a competitor is more environmentally and socially directed. Yet, ""companies are not implementing sustainable solutions fast enough to counterbalance the negative environmental and social impacts,"" the report said.

Establishing its sustainable bona fides, Burberry is aiming to reduce climate-changing greenhouse gas emissions at its stores, offices, internal manufacturing, and distribution sites 95% by 2022, and by 2030 cut these pollutants 30% throughout its extended supply chain.

The latter goal is especially significant, taking into account the global reach of an apparel, accessory, and footwear label's supply chain, and how difficult it can be to regulate carbon emissions of every manufacturer, as well as throughout transportation, distribution, and retail channels.

Equally noteworthy is how Burberry has joined a broader effort among businesses, and a growing cadre of fashion names across the industry, as members of the Science-Based Targets initiative, started in 2015.

Science-based targets

The initiative is a collaboration among the CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), United Nations Global Compact, World Resources Institute, and World Wide Fund for Nature. The coalition has 575 companies who've committed to create climate-change-reduction programs, of which 231 have reached the point where they can set measurable targets based on scientific principles.

Other fashion companies who have either committed to create or have already set goals under the initiative include: Chanel, Gucci-parent Kering S.A., PVH Corp., Nike Inc., Puma SE, VF Corp., Hennes & Mauritz, Eileen Fisher Inc., Guess? Inc., Levi Strauss & Co., Gap Inc., Zara's parent company Inditex S.A., Uniqlo's parent Fast Retailing Co., and One Jeanswear Group, makers of denim brands such as Nine West, Gloria Vanderbilt, and Bandolino. Among retailers, whose sales include fashion, and are part of the initiative, are Walmart Inc., Target Corp., Tesco PLC, Marks & Spencer Group, and Carrefour S.A.

For these companies, emission reductions are planned ""across all their products, their whole value chain,"" said Cynthia Cummis, director of Private Sector Climate Mitigation at the WRI, a global environmental research organization. As a result, participants are ""aggressively addressing climate change in line with the ambition of the Paris Agreement"" setting global goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The Science Based Target initiative defines a “science-based target” as a goal adopted by a company to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These goals are set to meet broader objectives to keep global warming well below a level of 2°C (35.6°F) above pre-industrial temperatures, and not to exceed 1.5°C (34.7°F), according to benchmarks reported in the 2018 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C.

Going forward, Cummis said the initiative wants to gain broader knowledge of the fashion industry, ""to understand where the most emissions are along the value chain, where the biggest reduction opportunities are, and map out for apparel companies how those activities can add up to meet a science-based target,"" Cummis explained.

Small and big steps for the planet

Participating companies in the initiative also pledge to be transparent about their nitty-gritty goals by keeping the public apprised about progress.

Measures to reduce emissions can include using recyclable materials, but also something as basic as reusing cardboard boxes or creating operating efficiencies. Reducing or replacing petroleum-based materials is another step. For example, citrus-based textiles are made by Italian fiber company Orange Group, whose customers include fashion house Salvatore Ferragamo.

Burberry's sustainability efforts, large and small, in total go well beyond its decision last year to stop the practice of burning unused stock, seen as polluting and wasteful.

Since the fashion house estimates 76% of its direct carbon emissions come from its retail operations, the company has appointed Responsibility Leaders in several stores to get staff to increase energy efficiency.

The brand's stores also have switched to LED lighting. ""We then used the cost savings from energy reductions to finance additional renewable energy procurement,"" the company said in a statement. ""We are on track to achieve our RE100 commitments as we now obtain 58% of our total energy (including 68% of our electricity) from renewable sources, an increase of 13% from last year."" Throughout its supply chain, the brand is also moving toward renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power.

What is sustainability?

As consumers focus on pursuing eco-friendlier lives, more fashion and other consumer products are being sold as""sustainable,"" although there isn't a standard definition for what that means in terms of the environment.

Projects like the Science-Based Targets initiative help brands back their sustainable claims with a set of standards to which they can point to as proof of their commitment. Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron recently tapped Kering SA Chief Executive Officer Francois-Henri Pinault to lead a global fashion industry sustainability effort, but there's been no discussion yet about marketing guideposts.

""Since no one so far can really define sustainability exactly, it is hard to imagine how it can be policed” to prevent false claims in marketing, said Jeffrey Silberman, professor and chairperson of the Textile Development and Marketing department at the Fashion Institute of Technology, New York. (When reached by Fortune, he was in North Carolina visiting a cotton farm.)

Some countries do have agencies in place to hold companies accountable for their marketing language. Norway, for example, is currently investigating H&M's fashion marketing around its summer ""Conscious"" collection.

In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission provides guidance on marketing language, compliance with which is voluntary but is nonetheless weighed as regulatory authority. But the FTC so far hasn't passed judgment on what constitutes ""sustainable"" in product advertising.

With the 2012 release of revised ""Green Guides"" for environmental marketing language, the FTC said it ""lacks a sufficient basis to provide meaningful guidance"" on defining sustainable, as well as natural and organic, since each has various meanings.

Regardless, being able to credibly say a company is sustainable requires a lot of work and longterm commitment. ""I think it's going to be a combination of lots of activities that companies are going to need to put in place to claim that they're sustainable,"" Cummis said.

""But I assume it will be a collection of investing in energy efficiency in their supply chain,"" Cummis said. ""For apparel companies, the majority of emissions are primarily upstream in their supply chain, with the extraction of raw materials or the [manufacture of] fabric at the textile mills.""

To cut down on emissions, a company could switch to textile mills using renewable energy, or have circular-business models that reduce waste, she said.

There are also independent organizations doing sustainability oversight, according to Katrin Ley, managing director of Fashion for Good, a global sustainability initiative supported by companies like Adidas, Galeries Lafayette Group, Kering, PVH Corp., Stella McCartney, and Target.

""Working with these organizations or using materials that meet particular standards all help the wider industry and consumers understand where a brand is on the spectrum,"" she said. These organizations include the Road Map to Zero Programme, Sustainable Apparel Coalition, Better Cotton Initiative, Fair Wear Foundation, Cradle to Cradle Institute, and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.

Brands at the Forefront

Some brands have been transparent about their sustainability initiatives since the beginning. One company doing this effectively is Reformation, a celebrity-favorite line known for blousy dresses and tops with low necklines. (Its website reads: ""Being naked is the #1 most sustainable option. We're #2.)

Because there is no standardized framework for evaluating the sustainability of fibers, the company has released its own set of fiber standards. Grade A fibers are ""Natural fibers that are rapidly renewable, plant-based and have a potential for circularity,"" such as recycled cotton, Tencel Lyocell, and organic linen; grade B fibers are ""almost all natural or recycled fibers"" like organic cotton, ENKA Viscose, and Tencel Modal.

""We tried to make these standards as holistic as possible, taking into consideration water input, energy input, land use, eco-toxicity, greenhouse gas emissions, human toxicity, availability, and price,"" said Kathleen Talbot, Reformation's VP of Operations and Sustainability, in a statement to Fortune. ""At the end of 2018, about 67% of our fabric purchases were our A & B rated fibers, and we are continuing to develop new fabrications and design into these highest impact fibers like Tencel, linen, and recycled cotton or wool.""

A New Generation of Shoppers

Over the past few years, Silberman has noticed students at FIT demanding the sustainability angle be covered in nearly every class.

Reflecting this interest, a 2015 Nielsen report found 73% of millennials are willing to pay more for a product if it is marketed as sustainable.

""Despite the fact that millennials are coming of age in one of the most difficult economic climates in the past 100 years, they continue to be most willing to pay extra for sustainable offerings--almost three-out-of-four respondents,"" the Nielsen report says.

LONDON, Nov 13 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Major British retailers including Marks & Spencer, John Lewis and Next are joining forces with law enforcement agencies in a bid to eradicate labour exploitation and modern slavery from the fashion industry, Britain's anti-slavery body said on Tuesday.

Six of the country's top fashion brands have vowed to raise awareness to stop worker abuses, protect at-risk and exploited employees, and root out modern slavery from their supply chains, according to the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority (GLAA).

Companies face growing scrutiny in Britain and beyond to ensure their operations are slave-free as rising demand for cheap clothing fuels labour exploitation in factories worldwide.

""Tens of thousands of people are employed in the textiles industry in the UK and it contributes billions of pounds to the economy,"" said Ian Waterfield, head of operations at the GLAA.

""That alone makes it an attractive proposition for unscrupulous employers and criminals who exploit workers.""

About 25 million people are estimated to be trapped in forced labour worldwide, according to the United Nations.

The global fashion industry has come under pressure to change since more than 1,100 garment workers were killed in the Rana Plaza factory collapse in Bangladesh five years ago.

Yet big brands have been criticized for failing to improve conditions in their supply chains - from fields to factories - and allowing or turning a blind eye to abuses such as excessive working hours, child labour and bans on forming trade unions.

None of the six brands - which also include New Look, River Island and Shop Direct - responded to requests for comment about the partnership, but the British Retail Consortium (BRC) trade association called it an ""important step"" to end worker abuses.

The agreement is being backed by Britain's labour inspectorate, tax authority and health and safety and immigration officials, as well as several industry bodies.

Anti-Slavery International welcomed the commitment of the major brands but said the deal highlighted the gaps in Britain's landmark anti-slavery legislation, which came into law in 2015.

Britain's Modern Slavery Act requires firms with a turnover of 36 million pounds ($46 million) to file an annual statement outlining their anti-slavery efforts. Yet compliance is low as there are no penalties for offenders, according to activists.

""Proactive identification and eradication of exploitative practices shouldn't be a voluntary act but a standard practice sanctioned by the law ... "" said Klara Skrivankova, UK and Europe manager for charity Anti-Slavery International.

""Only then the businesses that do their part in ending slavery wouldn't be undercut by those which profit from exploitation,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Leading fashion designers, entrepreneurs and campaigners will be questioned by lawmakers on Tuesday as part of an ongoing state inquiry into the sustainability of the fashion industry.

"Most of us recognise that sustainability is a global issue that needs to be addressed.

However, behavioural change remains at a modest level. That’s according to the 2019 Behaviour and Attitudes 'Sign of the Times' survey.

Meanwhile, Irish startups are leading the way with innovative solutions in the sustainable space. One of these is Evocco, a shopping app which lets consumers know the carbon footprint of their shopping basket.

Another finding from the B&A survey was that consumers believe that ""bigger issues, such as global warming and pollution, are beyond our agency to change.""

The fashion industry is one of the largest contributors to pollution and is responsible for 10% of global carbon emissions. Sustain Sister’s founder Caitriona Lynch wants to give fashion consumers the tools to be more sustainable.

Ms Lynch studied fashion buying and retail management in DIT and worked in fashion buying before setting up Sustain Sister to provide an alternative to the high street.

Her business comprises an e-commerce site, a rental service and fashion tours. The first option is the buying side. She partners with eco-friendly brands around Europe, including Swedish Stockings which make hosiery in zero waste factories from recycled yarn. Ms Lynch has recently added runners made from pinatex, a leather-like fabric made from pineapple leaves which is entirely biodegradable.

The second part of Sustain Sister is rental. Ms Lynch says buying new clothing for occasional events didn’t make sense to her as ""party dresses are worn on average 1.27 times.""

Through the website vintage dresses from designers such as Nina Ricci and Agnes B are available to borrow for seven days from €20. The price includes an eco-friendly dry cleaning service.

The third part of Sustain Sister is about educating people about how to shop more sustainably. Ms Lynch has recently partnered with Finn McCools Tours to offer tours around Dublin visiting vintage and secondhand shops and educating guests about clothes swapping and local designers.

Ms Lynch believes this is just the beginning for sustainable fashion and refers to predictions that resale fashion is expected to overtake the “fast fashion” industry by 2028. Meanwhile, as Sustain Sister tackles the fashion consumer, another Irish startup is looking at water conservation.

Heatwaves and water shortages have become a typical feature of recent summers, and Jack Dooley and Cian Fogarty have come up with a unique product to help reduce water wastage.

The Greener Globe co-founders were in transition year in Tullamore College in Co Offaly when they came up with a shower head that alerts the user to water usage with a traffic light-like system.

At the time, in 2014, the water charges debate in Ireland was in full flow, Mr Dooley says. He says the Environmental Protection Agency was recommending seven minutes as an appropriate shower time.

So, he and Mr Fogarty set out to find out if that was realistic. They carried out over 900 surveys and found that their peer group spent an average of 11 to 12 minutes in the shower. As the average shower uses approximately nine litres per minute, they figured out that a reduction of four minutes would save 36 litres per shower.

Their product, the Aquacica, is a showerhead with integrated LED lights in the base and powered by a kinetic system which uses the water flow.

The B&A Survey found that sustainability was a source of guilt for many. The Aquacica aims to tap into that guilt to encourage habit changes so that ""once the shower head hits red, you feel bad for wasting water."""
"Charity shops spend millions of dollars a year in dumping fees for donated clothes that can't be resold.

You've bought well, then made do and mended, but that favourite old shirt, skirt or pair of shoes is now beyond repair and in no condition to be foisted upon the volunteers of your local second-hand shop.

But with Australians sending an estimated 6 tonnes of clothing to landfill every 10 minutes, coming up with other options than simply chucking old clothes in the bin is part of tackling our waste problem.

Restyling, upcycling and repurposing are all ways of eking a bit of extra life out of a garment. Textile recycling is often touted as the final step in this chain. So is it an option for most Australians?

Not yet, but hopefully soon, says Veena Sahajwalla, a materials engineer at the University of New South Wales.

Textile recycling is about looking at how individual components in an old garment can be reused.

""At the macro level, the textile can rip apart and tear but at the micro level a lot of the fibres are still well and truly alive.""

""If you can find a way to use these micro materials in a textile then you could bring it back to life again.""

What is textile recycling?

Share It's hard for many recycled fabrics to compete with virgin materials.

Commercial textile recycling generally involves breaking down fabrics into a form where they can be spun back out into new yarns.

For natural fibres like cotton and wool, the material is shredded, blended and combed, and then spun into a yarn that can be woven or knitted back into cloth.

But the end result is lower quality than virgin materials because the fibres are shorter and the fabric doesn't have as fine a texture.

(This is actually where the word ""shoddy"" comes from — shoddy is a fabric made from woollen waste cloth or clippings.)

Clearing out your wardrobe? These questions will help you decide what needs to go and where We all have our own reasons for a spring clean anytime of year. The good news is not everything needs to end up in landfill.

The process is different for synthetic fabrics like polyester, which are shredded, then granulated and formed into plastic pellets called nurdles (another fun word).

These pellets undergo a few processes so they can be melted, extruded and spun into a new fibre.

Because recycling natural and synthetic fibres involve different processes, recycling blended fabrics — which so many of our clothes are made from — is a challenge, according to fashion sustainability expert Clara Vuletich, whose research focuses on sustainable textiles.

""People were able to crudely recycle say, cotton or wool, but they really didn't know what to do when it was a polyester mixed with a cotton,"" Dr Vuletich said.

The answer to that is chemical recycling: where solvents are used to dissolve the material so the synthetic components can be taken out and recycled, but this has its own challenges as it involves flushing away the natural fibre components, she said.

How widespread is textile recycling?

There are some commercial-scale textile recycling facilities overseas but the industry is still in its infancy in Australia.

Quite a few research groups and entrepreneurs are experimenting with new techniques for extracting both natural and synthetic components from fabrics and turning them into substances that can be reused, but the next piece in the puzzle is scaling it up, Dr Vuletich said.

""There's a lot of noise around this at the moment but it's actually all just at the very early scale,"" she said.

""There's no-one who's managing to build a large-scale factory to turn this into what it needs to become, which is a scale decent enough to disrupt the industry.""

But perhaps large-scale industry isn't the only answer. Professor Sahajwalla thinks micro-recycling could be a more sustainable way of dealing with waste.

Share Veena Sahajwalla with building materials made from recycled textiles.

Her research group has been developing a way of breaking down fabrics and then re-forming them into building materials such as wall and flooring panels.

She hopes the technology her group has developed will be able to be deployed within communities, where waste collection and reimagining happen at a local level.

""We are moving away from the notion that everything we make has to be done on a mass scale,"" Professor Sahajwalla said.

""Instead of economies of scale, which we're used to thinking about, we're talking about economies of purpose.""

Professor Sahajwalla's textile recycling method breaks down fabrics — both natural and synthetic — to the molecular level, allowing them to be turned in to almost anything, not necessarily just another fabric.

""To an everyday person, when we talk about recycling it's very much about replacing like for like,"" Professor Sahajwalla said.

""What we are doing is recognising that the elements that are there in the textiles are not essentially bad just because the textile is no longer fit for use.

""By the time you've broken it down to those micro-elements, you can bring it back to life and use it in a whole range of products.""

Thinking beyond downcycling, where items are reused but for a lower-quality purpose, was key to being truly sustainable, she said.

""I don't want to downplay the thing that a lot of people do — just cut it up and use it as rags — that's OK if that material is not really fit for any other purpose.

""But if you've got really superb quality textiles, why would you just downgrade it?""

How can I recycle my clothes?

For the average Australian, finding a way to recycle clothes was still a challenge, Dr Vuletich said.

Some places you can donate old clothing do accept garments that are no longer wearable.

Some of these are turned into industrial rags or possibly recycled in overseas facilities, although it's often hard to tell exactly where these donations end up.

Check with your local council about what's available in your area, because tonnes of donations to charities aren't able to be used, leaving them to pay millions of dollars a year in tip fees.

Dr Vuletich encouraged people to actively lobby governments and industry to invest in recycling facilities.

""I think some Australian brands would be willing to try that a bit more, but we don't have the infrastructure and systems in Australia,"" she said.

""You need to help investors and entrepreneurs and give them a kick start to find the solutions, because a lot of the solutions are there."""
"Thrift and consignment store shopping isn't just a way to save a little money — it's also become an antidote to the ""fast fashion"" that's taking a toll on the planet, says a business owner who helps people find ""pre-loved"" fashions.

""Fast fashion tells us to buy now, buy a lot, buy today, because tomorrow the trend will change.... And so the waste just piles up and it fills the landfills,"" says Lynnette Regehr, who owns Sustainably Styled — a Winnipeg-based pop-up shop.

She also does personal thrift shopping and holds home parties in Winnipeg.

""As I started learning more about the environmental impact that fashion has on the Earth and on people living close to where production happens, I made it more of a conscious choice to switch to buying almost all of my clothing pre-loved,"" Regehr said.

According to groups such as Forbes and Greenpeace, consumers globally purchase 400 per cent more clothing today than they did two decades ago. More than 80 billion garments are produced each year.

According to a UK study, almost a third of clothes in closets there hadn't been worn in more than a year.

That's why Winnipeg personal stylist Monique Andrew — a.k.a Style Hunter Fox — takes the time to check local second-hand stores when shopping for her clients.

""I love consignment stores. It's a great way for people to possibly sell their fashion that they're no longer wearing so they can purge and maybe get something out of their original investment, and you can find amazing things,"" says Andrew.

""The planet can't handle everything that it's producing. We have more than enough already in existence for anything that we could possibly need.""

Andrew spends a lot of time in consignment and thrift shops, doing personal shopping for clients like Crystal Thompson.

""I myself personally am more of a classic style so … the styles that come in and out for about 48 seconds don't matter to me as much,"" Thompson said as she looked through a rack of clothes Andrew curated for her.

""I think the super fun part of recycled or thrift or high-end thrift shopping is that you might find a better quality piece for less money, while supporting the local community and the environment too.""

Thrift and consignment store shopping used to be something you'd never admit to in public, but sustainable shopping is becoming an antidote to 'fast-fashion' that's putting a toll on the planet. 2:53

According to the UN Alliance for Sustainable Fashion , between eight and 10 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions are created by the fashion industry —more than all international flights and maritime shipping combined.

It takes around 7,500 litres of water to produce one pair of jeans, the UN says — equivalent to the amount of water the average person drinks over a period of seven years.

""When you hear about what happens just because I want a pair of jeans, it just doesn't sit well with me at all,"" says Regehr.

""It's shocking because we don't feel it here in North America. We don't have the direct impact of that. Our waterways have not been polluted. Our drinking water has not been sullied and we're not sick from the cost of fashion.""

Regehr encourages consumers to follow the seven R's :

Reduce.

Reuse.

Recycle.

Rent.

Repurpose.

Repair.

Research.

She says research is important so consumers know if their clothes are made safely, sustainably and fairly, and so they can hold themselves, and the industry, more accountable.

It's the idea behind Fashion Revolution Week, which includes the April 24 anniversary of the collapse of the Rana Plaza clothing factory , which killed 1,138 people in 2013.

The tragedy sparked a campaign for changes, putting pressure on the fashion industry to conserve, protect and restore the environment, and give a voice to garment workers — most of whom are women.

Back at the consignment store, Monique Andrew agrees.

""Stay away from the fast-fashion stores. You don't have to go to the mall to re-energize your wardrobe,"" she said.

""The trends are already in the thrift stores, in the consignment stores.… Fashion is cyclical, so whatever you are looking for now, chances are it was already in fashion 10, 15 years ago and it's back."""
"news, national,

In the midst of Victoria's recycling crisis and mounting waste problem, a community of fashion-lovers are advocating for the power of individual changes that have a collective impact. More than 150 people attended the launch of the Ballarat Ethical Fashion Festival on Saturday, an event that is raising awareness of the environmental cost of a throwaway textile culture. The week-long fashion festival features talks and workshops that share inspiration for a re-style, re-use and re-pair approach to clothing. Vogue Australia's sustainability editor at large and presenter of the Wardrobe Crisis podcast Clare Press was the keynote speaker at the launch event, held at the Art Gallery of Ballarat. She highlighted the mounting problem of fashion waste and practical solutions to empower the individual reduce their fashion footprint. Professional mender Erin Lewis-Fitzgerald shared her experiences and tips on visible mending to give old clothes a new life and how visible mends can become a conversation starter for reducing clothing waste. A fashion show featuring the work of Ballarat fashion designers highlighted the creative possibilities for up-cycling clothes. Later in the afternoon more than 100 women flocked to the Clothing Exchange where they could swap something they do not wear in their wardrobe for another donated item. Grampians Central West Waste and Resource Recovery Group organised the event as part of its region-wide approach to encourage long-term community solutions to waste reduction. ""Ultimately the reason we have such an issue with out waste is because of the way we purchase and where we are going with consumerism, so these are the things we need to address long term,"" chief executive La Vergne Lehmann said. If nothing changes with the fashion industry's current take-make-dispose model, by 2050 the industry will use up a quarter of the world's carbon budget, according to the Ellen McArthur Foundation. Ballarat Ethical Fashion Festival keynote speaker Clare Press is passionate about changing consumerism and the fashion industry for the better. Speaking at the festival on Saturday, Ms Press said addressing fashion waste was simple and we could solve the problem today. ""We just have to decide to stop buying stuff and throwing it away,"" she said. Australians spend approximately $1.7 billion on clothes they don't wear, according to the Clothing Exchange, and 80 per cent of the clothes we throw out still have 75 per cent of life left. In the past year one in six people threw away clothes they had only worn once, according to the 2017 YouGov survey. ""This is a story of inefficiency and waste, not just of physical resources but of creative ones too because think of all of the love and care and thought the designers and makers and retailers and anyone who works in the fashion supply chain has poured into making these garments,"" Ms Press said in her presentation. ""What if we stopped focusing on the making and selling of clothes but focussed on how those clothes lived in our lives afterwards? ""It is in our communities that we can start the process of change."" Ms Press said there were practical ways to take action to reduce fashion waste. She recommended slowing down purchasing habits, purchasing from local makers, supporting brands that focus on sustainability and choosing natural fibres including organic linen while avoiding polyester. Making your own clothes, purchasing second-hand, up-cycling and mending clothes increases the life cycle of clothing that may otherwise go to landfill. Ms Press said the future of fashion was in the rental space that had not yet become prominent in Australia, but consumers would drive demand for business change. ""While consumers have a part to play, we need governments to regulate the industry and we need brands to take action,"" she said. ""As a consumer it is difficult to navigate, but I know we can choose not to throw our clothes away and not buy things with the express intention of throwing them away after a few wears."" Ms Lehmann said Ballarat had the potential to become the ethical fashion capital of Victoria. The expansion of the Ballarat Ethical Fashion Festival this year has attracted interest and visitors from beyond Ballarat. Conversations between organisers and national organisations are already underway for the 2020 event that will respond to the growing interest in Ballarat and beyond. Ballarat sustainable fashion advocate and stylist Bianca Flint said she had seen more people interested in purchasing pre-loved since she began pre-loved fashion boutique Hattie's Wardrobe Green four years ago. ""I am seeing a lot more people get on board and realise that just because something is pre-loved it doesn't mean it is un-trendy or old,"" she said. ""It is about recognising second hand isn't second best and you can find amazing pieces at the op shop. Or if pieces aren't quite right you can embellish them to change them up and make them look new and fresh to suit your personality. ""Over the last couple of years I have seen such a change and we get quite a community of women coming into the shop now talking to me about sustainable fashion and wanting to make better choices."" Ms Flint was one of four fashion designers who created pieces for the Up-cycled Fashion Show at the festival's launch event. ""With the up-cycled collection it was about finding pre-loved pieces that were at the end of their life rather than at the beginning,"" she said. ""One of my pieces was on the dollar rack at the op shop, it's last stop before heading to landfill. You could tell why it had been left there because some of the lace was worn, but it was beautiful. I got some broken necklaces from the op shop and used the beads to embellish the bodice to cover the damage. ""It is finding those pieces that may have potential but have been forgotten or left behind and giving them a new lease on life to make them fun and new again. ""It doesn't have to be making it from scratch. Sometimes it is a glue gun and bits of beads."" Ms Flint is passionate about sending positive messages about body image and using fashion as a representation of personality. She said changing attitudes to fashion waste and feeling positive about your body came hand in hand. ""The less pressure you can put on fashion being perfect or cookie cutter or looking a certain way, the more we can encourage women and young girls to find their own sense of style, make their own changes to the clothes they are wearing, wear their personality and have fun with fashion,"" she said. See who was at the Ballarat Ethical Fashion Festival launch below. The Ballarat Ethical Fashion Festival comes as the Victorian Government prepares to release a circular economy policy and action plan late this year. The policy will examine new ways for Victorian businesses and communities to reduce waste in all stages of making, using and disposing of products and infrastructure relied on every day. Part of the plan will focus on designing products so they are durable and can be readily repaired, reused and recycled at the end of their lives. It will also encourage business model that encourage intense and efficient product use, like sharing products between multiple users or supplying a product as a service that includes maintenance, repair and disposal.

This week I’m buying…"
"The protest group Extinction Rebellion have announced it plans to draw attention to global warming by “shutting down” London Fashion Week, which opens on 13 September.

ER’s Boycott Fashion group says, “we need to change our culture around consumption … people have no idea how environmentally destructive fashion is”. Well, that’s just not true. Most of us know fashion is wasteful and we know we buy too much, but what can be done about it?

The lure of cheap fashion is as addictive as drugs. Most designer-sold sustainable lines cost far more than the high street and will only be bought and worn by the middle classes.

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.

High street behemoth, Zara, (whose Join Life branded eco-aware clothing will account for a quarter of sales this year) has pledged to only sell sustainable clothes by 2025, while ASOS and Net-a-Porter have both launched “sustainable” lines – but that’s a drop in the ocean.

It’s the sheer volume of sales and the waste generated that’s the real problem here. Clothing purchases in the UK are higher than in any other EU country at 26.7kg per person each year, compared with 16.7kg in Germany.

Instead of taxing consumers, the law should focus on producers. Companies must be legally compelled to sign-up to paying a living wage for workers and reveal what they do with unsold goods. The industry is responsible for more tonnes of greenhouses gases than international flights and shipping combined.

I agree with designer Katharine Hamnett, who said this week that it would be more effective to ensure fashion made outside the EU complies with the same standards as goods made within the eurozone. That way workers get paid fairly and pollution and toxic emissions are monitored. The scandal of over-production and dumping needs to be highlighted so consumers can choose which brands to boycott.

Picketing fashion week is a meaningless gesture."
"Clothing labels for people with disabilities offer much-needed comfort and dignity

Posted

When Trish Jackson goes shopping at any department store, she knows it will be a difficult experience to find items that suit her needs.

More than 4 million Australians are estimated to have a disability, yet there are only a handful of boutique manufacturers across the country making inclusive and adaptive clothing for them.

""Most shopping days when I'm desperate for clothes I end up in tears, absolute tears because you just get so frustrated nothing fits you,"" Ms Jackson said.

She is a thalidomide survivor, one of 10,000 babies affected by the world-wide pharmaceutical tragedy half a century ago.

She was born without arms and also endures other chronic health issues.

She said up until 10 years ago her mum would make all her clothes, which would allow her to use her feet as hands and get dressed independently.

""I've tried online shopping and to find dressmakers, but the minute you say you want something different they all seem to get scared and don't want to do it or they charge ridiculous prices that you can't afford,"" she said.

""We all wear clothes so I don't know why there isn't a market. I know a lot of my disabled friends would absolutely yearn to walk into a shop and buy something like everyone else.""

What is adaptive clothing?

This is a specialised class of garment designed for people with disabilities who find it difficult to dress independently, as well as for the elderly, infants with medical devices or for people sensitive to certain textiles and materials.

Buttons and zippers on the clothes can be replaced with velcro or magnets to enable easier dressing.

Australian adaptive clothing label Timeless by Heather Hill designs clothes for women who want to maintain a sense of style as they age, fall ill, or become injured.

Co-founder Hayley Clarke said she had been surprised by the lack of fashionable and affordable options available in Australia for adaptive clothing.

""Adaptive clothing should look beautiful, it should be elegant,"" she said.

""I think it's really important for people that they don't lose that sense of dignity, that sense of pride in themselves — and that they have the ability to wear something that makes them look and feel great.""

Ms Clarke said their clothes were also designed to make assisted dressing easy.

""Adaptive clothing isn't always for the individual, it's also for the family or carers to provide a little bit of assistance to somebody,"" she said.

In 2016, Tommy Hilfiger became the first mainstream fashion label to create adaptive clothing options for children, and has since launched a line called Tommy Adaptive.

Target Australia has also started stocking sensory-friendly T-shirts for children, with other adaptive clothing pieces available to customers in the United States through its online store.

Charlotte Coory launched Brisbane's first online inclusive clothing store, Hello Yello Clothing, late last year, inspired by her sister, who struggled to find clothes while being treated for terminal stomach cancer.

""We looked for various clothing options and there were some out there, but often they put function over fashion so those clothes didn't necessarily reflect her and her fashion style,"" she said.

Ms Coory said her store focused on inclusive clothing — mainstream garments for a range of ages designed to include people with disabilities, different abilities and different needs.

""Inclusive design is good design,"" she said.

""We can get stuck into thinking shirts should be designed a certain way because we've always done it that way but the button is a man-made invention.

""It doesn't have to be done that way. Inclusive design makes people think more creatively and will bring everyone better solutions for clothing.""

Universal design for clothes needed

Disability advocate and model Angel Dixon was named Queensland's Young Australian of the Year for 2019 and said the fashion industry needed to embrace universal design principles.

""Universal design is the concept of creating all of our things to be as usable by all people without the need for specialised design or adaptation,"" she said.

""It's something brands are becoming more aware of, so if we move a zipper from the back of a dress and turn it into a magnetic strip in the front, then everyone can use it and that creates freedom within dressing for everyone.""

Ms Dixon said a long history of segregation of people with a disability has led to a lack of diversity within fashion but she acknowledged some progress has been made.

""It's important to honour the fact we are seeing change, there have been people within the disabled community fighting for this for a long time,"" she said.

""Fifty-three per cent of our global market has a direct connection to disability through either family or friendship or lived experience, so you're missing out if you're not including us in your designs or selling to us.""

A lot of us love a bargain outfit - we buy fast, we buy cheap and we too often wear things once and then throw them out.

But ""fast fashion"" is a major contributor to greenhouse gases, water and air pollution, creates problematic levels of waste, and often comes with poor working conditions in other countries.

The Environmental Audit Committee demanded the government clean up the industry, making 18 recommendations covering environmental and labour practices. The government says it is dealing with the problem.

Here's what sustainable fashion experts say we can we do to reduce the harmful effects of our shopping habits.

1. Buying less is more

""The most important thing essentially is buying less,"" says Tolmeia Gregory, an environmental activist who blogs about ethical fashion under the name Tolly Dolly Posh.

She says we need to get rid of the whole culture of buying clothing for specific occasions, such as nights out and holidays

Image copyright Tolmeia Gregory Image caption Tolmeia Gregory

""At first people can get defensive. You can feel attacked,"" she says. ""But we have to try our best to break through that and think of it as more of a hopeful thing.""

Kate Fletcher, Professor of Sustainability, Design, Fashion at the Centre for Sustainable Fashion, agrees. She says buying less clothing ""is not at all some sort of devastating body blow"".

She recommends going through your wardrobe and ""noticing what you've already got that adds to the quality of your life"".

""Many of us shop for things and realise it's the anticipation rather than the purchase that gives us satisfaction,"" she says.

People experience ""spikes of pleasure"" when they are shopping, but are often uninterested in their purchases once they have them, she says.

""In studies where people report how happy they are, beyond a level of consumption where the basic needs have been met, every additional new purchase adds very little to people's wellbeing.""

Aggressive marketing by clothing brands have ""overridden this knowledge"", she says.

""What we actually see now is that having more tends to undermine the sense of wellbeing.

""It is linked to isolation, higher levels of depression. It's actually making us less happy and less well connected.""

2. Buy second hand

Ms Fletcher - who has written several books on sustainable fashion - says the High Street offers ""a very restricted range of pieces that people are choosing from endlessly"".

""If novelty and newness and change and variety is what you're interested in, there's much more to be gained through looking through things in your wardrobe or second hand purchases.""

Image copyright Francesca Willow

Francesca Willow, who writes about sustainability on her blog, Ethical Unicorn, says: ""Second hand is always the best option to look at first because it's extending the life of things that already exist.

She says some are put off by the idea of charity shops because they have something specific they are looking for, but second hand apps that let you tailor your searches, like Depop and Vinted, are helpful.

3. Choose natural materials

The sustainability blogger says people should avoid buying clothing made of virgin synthetic materials ""at all costs"".

""I look for hemp or linen and organic cotton that meets the Global Organic Textile Standard or [are part of the global programme] the Better Cotton Initiative - although they aren't perfect,"" she says.

And, she adds, we need to be extending the longevity of clothes. ""It's about how you look after them - looking at the care instructions and washing them properly.

""Most people wash their clothes too hot - washing them colder reduces energy consumption as well.""

When washing the synthetic fabrics you already own, use bags that catch the microfibres they release, as they can pollute the marine environment, she says.

The bags are ""not a solution"", but can be used ""as mitigation to a problem we've already caused"", she says.

4. Do your research

Before buying new clothing from a brand, Ms Willow says people should ask it where the item was made and by whom, she says.

""Choosing brands that use factories with certifications from organisations like the Fair Wear Foundation can be helpful as they provide some guarantee of proper wages"", she says.

Many sustainability blogs have directories of more ethical brands that can also provide guidance, she says.

""It can feel like a bit of a Wild West, to be honest, and it can be a lot of work for the consumer. That's why we need systemic and policy change,"" she says.

""But it's easier to start with yourself. Learn the skills, then you can build it up, and it stops being overwhelming."""
"Over the past few years, the fashion industry has seen more inclusivity on runways, in ads, and on social media, but many brands have been reluctant to fully embrace the body positivity movement. That’s a damn shame, considering that according to the International Journal of Fashion Design, Technology and Education, the average American woman is a size 16 to 18. Sixty-eight percent of American women are larger than size 14, putting them into what the fashion industry categorizes as plus-size. While most women fall into that category, not every clothing brand sells sizes to accommodate them — including some brands that claim to be body positive. “The body positive movement is the radical idea that you should love the skin you’re in, regardless of its size, shape, color, age, ability,” fashion photographer and body positivity activist Anastasia Garcia said during an “ICYMI by HuffPost” panel discussion in New York City on Jan. 15. She said that although some clothing brands advertise body positivity or offer plus-size clothing, that inclusivity is still limited. “Some brands that claim to be inclusive stop at a size 20. I’m a 22/24.”

"HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s acquisitive apparel firm Shandong Ruyi is targeting more global deals involving “affordable luxury” brands, under a push to establish the first high-end Chinese fashion empire to eventually challenge behemoth LVMH (LVMH.PA).

Its chairman, Qiu Yafu, who has led a spate of deals buying tailors Gieves & Hawkes to Swiss luxury brand Bally, told Reuters on Monday the company would focus on affordable luxury, where he sees growth even amid broader economic slowdown.

Qiu, a little-known billionaire with a low-profile even in China, has big ambitions in the world of fashion, where his growing empire is leading the race in China to rival established fashion houses in the traditionally European dominated industry.

The magnate, who started as an apprentice at the age of 17 at one of Ruyi’s textile mills, has built up control of a range of European luxury brands through aggressive acquisitions worth billions of dollars, including French fashion house SMCP and Britain’s Aquascutum.

Qiu, tall and wearing a dark fitted suit and red tie, said the broader Ruyi group wanted to become as big as LVMH, though added that wouldn’t happen overnight.

“LV is a world renowned god-like enterprise. It is our role model. We are still a far cry from it but that’s our vision,” Qiu, who was born in 1958, told Reuters during an interview in Hong Kong on the sidelines of a luxury industry conference.

“Would it take five years, 10 years, even longer, or for the next generation or a better team to achieve? It is a very important project and challenge. It may even be impossible. But it doesn’t mean we shouldn’t learn, imitate or borrow ideas.”

Qiu added the firm would “pursue” deals for quality “trend-setter” brands with sustainable development prospects, though he was less interested in brands he likened to “pop music, only catering to people’s tastes for a short while but not lasting”.

“Ruyi has firm and specific requirements and strategic positioning for fashion brands. We are always studying and watching brands that fit the positioning of high quality, high growth and high pricing,” he said.

Ruyi and Qiu are looking to help brands target China’s huge but slowing domestic apparel market, which research firm Euromonitor expects will hit 2.2 trillion yuan ($316.05 billion) by 2022, up around 10 percent from its current size. To that end, he said the firm would look to leverage big data and online stores to reach more shoppers.

The firm’s pivot into fashion is part of a wider drive by Chinese firms that also includes conglomerates Fosun (0656.HK), which could lead to an increase in fashion sector deal-making.

Once a state-owned textiles firm, Ruyi was privatized two decades ago as part of a government reform. Its deal-making spree started in 2010 and has stretched from Japanese brand Renown to Hong Kong-based Trinity Group and textile brands such as Lycra.

With presence in 84 countries, Ruyi’s annual sales revenue has exceeded 20 billion yuan, Qiu said."
"An Edinburgh-based textiles product manufacturer whose clients including the V&A Dundee and Creative Scotland is to expand its premises and create additional jobs.

Kalopsia Collective, which focuses on a circular economy business model involving an ethical and sustainable manufacturing process to help reduce waste, was founded by former fashion designer Nina Falk and graphic designer Adam Robertson in 2012.

The firm, which is based in the Leith area, offers custom designed and manufactured clothing and accessories and an “assemble” service using fabric provided by clients to produce batch white label accessories, including ties, bags, dresses, cushions and totes.

Kalopsia, which became a social enterprise in 2016, is now gearing up to expand its base and increase the team from five to eight by the summer.

Support from Business Gateway Edinburgh over the last year includes ongoing business development, marketing and help to build the venture’s network with related industries.

Robertson said: “Our aim is to raise awareness of ethical and sustainable textiles, including recycling all fabric cuttings and to work closely with designers to ensure they are using products with the minimum environmental impact which our innovative ‘Assemble’ model has allowed us to do.

“We’ve seen an overwhelming engagement from both our clients and consumers with our environmental and social missions, resulting in a notable increase in our sales year-on-year.

“This goes against the general consensus on consumer behavior around the price of goods and shows clearly that more and more people are putting the quality of a product and the conditions in which it was made ahead of its price, which we’ve been in a position to utilise.”

Susan Harkins, head of Business Gateway Edinburgh, added: “We are delighted to be able to support Kalopsia who are leading the way in sustainable and environmental design and manufacturing in Scotland and creating new jobs in the industry.

“Their ethos, impressive portfolio of clients and growth over the last few years is testament to the very talented founders and their mission to change the way consumers shop particularly in the retail industry.”"
"Many Singaporeans are familiar with fast-fashion brands that are in the market.

However, not many people may be aware of the issues associated with some of these brands.

For one thing, the garments sold by some of these Western fashion companies are often produced by low-wage workers in factories where employee safety and welfare are disregarded.

One such factory was Rana Plaza in Bangladesh, where structural defects caused its collapse in 2013, claiming the lives of 1,134 workers.

So what can consumers do to put a stop to such fast-fashion practices? Reduce, reuse and recycle. We often hear the 3Rs in connection with the use of plastic. We can do the same with our clothing, too.

One practice that people can adopt is thrifting, or buying second-hand clothing.

Unfortunately, in Singapore, second-hand clothes tend to carry the stigma of being ""out of fashion"" or of ""poor quality"".

For the sake of protecting the environment and reducing the demand for production that relies on low-wage factory workers, it is time we changed our thinking and considered thrifting our clothes from stores like Praisehaven Thrift Store and Refash instead.

Achieving this mindset shift requires education.

For example, schools should hold assembly talks to persuade the youth to support sustainable fashion - making them aware that ""fast"" is not the only way to consume clothing and encouraging them to make conscientious decisions when purchasing clothes.

"A Tipperary woman is taking on the environmental impact of fast fashion by starting her own designer dress rental service.

Edel Lyons, 31, a former marketing executive and fashion blogger started Rag Revolution just three months ago from her bedroom in Dublin, a premium fashion rental service that allows customers to rent dresses for special occasions, paying a fraction of the price, and returning the item when the event is over, helping save money – and the planet.

According to the Ellen McArthur Foundation, clothing production has approximately doubled in the last 15 years, while the annual value of clothing discarded prematurely is more than €350bn.

While the average consumer bought 60% more clothes in 2014 than in 2000, people now keep each garment for half as long, and discarded clothing made of non-biodegradable fabrics can sit in landfills for up to 200 years.

Second only to oil, the clothing and textile industry is the largest polluter in the world and produces nearly 20% of global wastewater.

As the drive to be more environmentally conscious becomes more immediate, Ms Lyons saw a gap in the market for Ireland’s fashion-forward to be more sustainable, supporting reuse instead of consumption.

“I had a lot of events over the last three years, balls or weddings and work functions and was struggling to find something a bit different but that wasn’t really expensive, and I didn’t like the fact I was only wearing things once, it wasn’t good for me money-wise or the environment.

“I kept seeing expensive and real statement pieces that I knew if I bought, I wouldn’t wear again.

“We’re not like our mums’ generation, we don’t keep pieces anymore for a long time.

“With social media having such a presence in our lives, we’re less likely to re-wear outfits, people don’t want to keep wearing these statement pieces because there’s already a picture of them wearing it on Instagram or Facebook, and it sounds awful but that’s how people are now.""

“While all this was going on, I was becoming more and more aware of the effect ‘fast fashion’ was having on the world.

“I am very environmentally conscious and I wouldn’t buy a lot of clothes, and stick to key pieces, and that’s how I fell into this idea.

“I did some research and I couldn’t see anything that offered style that I would wear, and saw the gap and thought; ‘I should do this’.”

Rag Revolution offers dresses from designer labels such as Rixo, Reformation, Olivia Rubin and Self-Portrait, who can command up to €400 for a dress and rents them out for as little as €70.

Lyons’ thoughts on the future of the industry runs parallel with economic experts, who predict that the way we think about clothes is about to shift, as the industry moves to cater to sustainability and mindful shoppers.

Recent research by Deloitte revealed over 80% of millennials across Australia, Canada, China, India, the UK and the US say it is important for companies take steps to diminish their environmental impact.

Consumers aged 25-35 are projected to spend €135bn on sustainable goods by 2021.

“I’m quite interested in the industry and they’re predicting in a few years we’re not going to be buying clothes like we are now,” Ms Lyons added.

“We’re all headed toward buying key pieces, good jeans and boots – things like that, but you’re not going to have a wardrobe full of dresses from the high street or occasion-wear.

“At this rate the industry can’t keep going as it is, even in regard to the disposal of clothes.

“90% of fashion go to a landfill and aren’t recycled.

“It’s on a lot of people’s minds now about how and where they shop, people used to want to have loads of clothes, but that’s a thing of the past, people are looking for something more sustainable.

“I’ve always wanted to do something like this and I just took the leap, it’s not for the fainthearted but it’s really satisfying, I’d tell anyone who has an idea to just go for it.”"
"Zara is still taking market share in Australia, growing sales almost 11 per cent last year. Bloomberg

Zara now has 19 stores in Australia and launched a dedicated Australian online store in March 2018. One store was opened in November at Kotara, in Newcastle, NSW, while a store at Robina on the Gold Coast closed this year.

Zara’s Australian sales are now approaching those of H &M, which booked sales of $353 million in 2018, down from $363 million the previous year.

According to Macquarie Equities, Zara, H &M and Uniqlo account for about 2.1 per cent of the Australian clothing, accessories and department store sector, up from 1.6 per cent two years ago.

While their combined market share is small, the global chains have forced Australian brands to cut prices, invest in product design and store refurbishments and overhaul supply chains.

Growing chains

Macquarie analysts said the global chains would likely continue to gain share, although their store roll-outs were largely complete and any further gains would come from like-for-like sales growth in stores and online.

The growth of the international chains will continue to affect department stores such as Myer and discount department stores such as Target and Big W, which are all looking to reduce their physical footprints by either closing stores or handing back surplus floors.

In May last year, the Lew family ended its 18-year relationship with Inditex. Solomon Lew’s son Peter sold his 10 per cent stake in Zara Australia to Zara’s parent and stepped down from the board.

Zara Australia paid an interim dividend of $5 million in January and a $30.9 million final dividend last May, even though it earned a net profit of only $8.9 million in 2017. The Australian company has a $45 million loan from its parent and received a $15.5 million capital injection last year.

Zara's growth comes amid growing consumer concerns about environmental damage from the fashion industry, which is the second largest polluter in the world after the oil sector, emitting 1.2 billion tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions a year.

Both Zara and H &M have launched sustainable and ethical clothing collections, and Zara has vowed to stop sending unused textiles to landfills by 2020. But these initiatives have largely been dismissed as publicity stunts while they continue to pump out 80 billion garments a year."

"Boohoo who have just launched their first dedicated recycled fashion, as part of its efforts to help prevent clothing waste.

The For the Future range has been made of 95% recycled polyester, the fabric derived from plastic which would have otherwise gone to landfill and repurposed to produce new yarn.

The other 5% is made up of elastin.

The brand also notes that the items were produced in the UK which notability reduces air miles and uses non-toxic, environmentally friendly dyes.

Even the clothing tags are sustainable, made from recycled paper and a biodegradable jute thread.

""For The Future is all about clothes you can #doyourthing in as well as doing your bit for the environment,"" reads the statement on the website.

Each piece in the clothing range is made from recycled materials without compromising on the trends you love

The 34 piece collection includes a range floral summer dresses, bodysuits, culottes and tops in sizes 6-24 and prices range from €10–€30.

Speaking about the new range, group founder Carol Kane said: “We are consistently listening to our customers and have been working on developing a recycled offering for some time.

“Boohoo acknowledges its responsibility to be a sustainable business and [the] ‘For the Future’ fashion range is the next step in that journey.”"
"Ministers came under fire last night for rejecting a ‘fast fashion tax’ on throwaway clothes to help raise money to deal with waste.

MPs from all parties had argued that a 1p charge per item would help fund the collection and recycling of the mountain of cheap clothing that is thrown away every year.

But the Government rejected this and other initiatives from the Commons environmental audit committee designed to tackle pollution caused by waste clothing.

MPs from all parties had argued that a 1p charge per item would help fund the collection and recycling of the mountain of cheap clothing that is thrown away every year (file image)

Instead, ministers said they have developed their own initiatives – some based on voluntary efforts by the industry.

In response, committee chairman Mary Creagh said: ‘Fashion producers should be forced to clear up the mountains of waste they create.

‘The Government has rejected our call, demonstrating that it is content to tolerate practices that trash the environment ... despite having just committed to net zero emission targets.’

The Labour MP added: ‘The Government is out of step with the public who are shocked by the fact that we send 300,000 tons of clothes a year to incineration or landfill.

‘Ministers have failed to recognise that urgent action must be taken to change the fast fashion business model which produces cheap clothes that cost the Earth.’

Online retailers selling dresses for £5 or less have helped fuel the idea that clothes are disposable. At the same time, much of the fast fashion is made from plastic which sheds billions of polluting particles into the seas when they are washed.

The MPs said a 1p charge could raise £35million a year to deal with waste. They also called for a legal ban on incinerating unsold stock or sending it to be buried in landfill. This too was rejected by the Government, which wants the industry to do more to use waste textiles."
"For years now, we’ve watched the old guard of the packaged-food industry get pummeled as consumers look to fill their grocery carts with trendier items bearing feel-good labels such as “natural” or “sustainably sourced.”

The beauty business, too, has had to adapt to this changing ethos; hence the proliferation of skincare products billed “eco-conscious” or “organic.”

So we can’t help but wonder: Is the apparel industry next?

Several prominent clothing retailers are revamping their manufacturing and tailoring their brand images for just this kind of change. J. Crew Group, for example, recently debuted its “Eco Jean,” a selection of denim it boasts is made from “sustainably dyed organic Italian cotton.” Earlier this year, Levi Strauss & Co. announced a new initiative that eliminates many chemicals from its jeans manufacturing process and reduces textile waste. In Europe, luxury group Kering SA, Swedish fast-fashion chain Hennes & Mauritz AB, and British retailer Marks & Spencer Group Plc have all undertaken environmental and social projects. These range from a library of 3,000 sustainable fabrics that Kering’s luxury brands can draw on, to recycling over 30 million garments over the past 10 years at M&S stores.

These brands have very good reasons to take these steps and highlight them in their messaging to customers.

The environmental concerns around clothing manufacturing are more acute than ever before. Nearly twice as much apparel was sold in 2017 than in 2003. Some of that reflects growing spending power of consumers in emerging economies. But it also reflects the rise of fast fashion, which has trained shoppers to think differently about the shelf life of the goods in their closet. People are tiring of their wardrobes more quickly, with global clothing utilization — or the number of times a garment is worn — declining significantly in recent years.

Meanwhile, Helga Vanthournout, a sustainability expert at McKinsey & Co., points out that very little of our clothing is recycled, in part because it can be a technical challenge to do so for blended fabrics such as a cotton-polyester.

Policymakers are taking notice of this issue, such as in the U.K., where a committee of lawmakers has launched an inquiry into the sustainability of the fashion industry. Against that backdrop, clothing companies are going to want to have good answers for how they are going to be part of the solution to a mounting problem. If they don’t, they might find themselves painted as corporate bad guys.

But beyond that, and even more importantly, apparel makers don’t want to risk being late to what could be a consequential shift in consumer preferences. Chip Bergh, the CEO of Levi Strauss, told Bloomberg Opinion this summer that he has observed sustainability being particularly important to younger shoppers — the ones retailers covet most.

“There’s no question, millennials care about it more than baby boomers. And Gen Z cares about it more than millennials,” Bergh said.

YouGov, an opinion and data-research company, has found that younger consumers are more likely than older ones to like it when brands take a stand on something. So why not do so on sustainability?

There are hints that the clothing world is moving toward prioritizing sustainability. Edited, a fashion data-research firm, analyzed online product listings across more than 52,000 apparel brands. It found a strong increase over the last three years in garments labeled with certain descriptors related to sustainability:

That doesn’t necessarily mean companies are making more such goods, but at the very least, it means they are trumpeting those characteristics more. That likely means they’ve concluded this matters more now to consumers.

H&M first ventured into sustainability in the 1990s with its Nature Calling collection. However, it didn’t take off — not just because of the unfortunate name, but also because the products weren’t stylish enough. It tried again in 2005, when it collaborated with Stella McCartney, and in spring 2010, launched its first Conscious Collection. Products launched this year have included accessories made from discarded candlesticks, and dresses made out of fishnets and other nylon waste, offered at a range of price points. H&M is able to make these cheap-chic pieces more environmentally friendly in part because of its large scale. Huge volumes mean it can offset the higher cost of using greener materials.

Among smaller producers, Community Clothing, a social enterprise founded by British tailor Patrick Grant, sells a range of classic fashion items that are manufactured at British factories at times of the year when they would otherwise be idle. The facilities work to the highest environmental and social standards and as they produce locally, there is less damage from transporting goods long distances. The price points aren’t that of fast fashion, but they compare well to mid-market stores. The aim is that as sales increase, factory volumes should escalate and economies of scale kick in.

To be sure, there is reason to be skeptical that sustainability attributes will ever influence fashion purchases to the extent they have in the food business. After all, in food and beauty, “organic” has basically become a proxy for “healthy.” That logic doesn’t apply in quite the same way with apparel, so it’s possible it won’t stir shoppers’ passions as dramatically.

But it seems inevitable that sustainability will figure at least somewhat more prominently into apparel-purchase decisions in the near future. And so clothing retailers must be ready to do right on this issue — and to tout their efforts to customers instead of just burying updates about it in their annual reports.

We suspect their customers will think eco-consciousness is a good look.

"“We can choose to recognise the value of our heritage and take control over the distribution of our culture, or we can let the hunters tell the story of how they slayed the beastly lions,” writer Lineo Segoete so aptly argues.

Think of it this way: how much are you willing to pay for something that is truly and authentically yours? This may seem theoretical, but this question is pertinent for our local fashion industry.

There’s been more than one instance of “African” designs being packaged by multimillion-dollar fashion houses and sold for a pretty penny. The retail prowess of the brands behind them means thousands of people have flocked to consume these garments. But when it comes to local fashion, is this still the case?

Designers including Laduma Ngxokolo, Thabo Makhetha, and Mzukisi Mbane are taking the “African” fashion wave in their stride, showing that homegrown fashion has some serious potential.

Not only are these designers making their own textiles and original, traditionally infused designs, they are making their mark on the local and international fashion industry — as seen with their appearances in stores and on the runway at fashion weeks locally and abroad.

But when it comes to local brands such as these, there seems to be an air of reluctance to buy into luxury African products, which are viewed by some consumers as too expensive and inaccessible."

Emma Kelly MD at Elevate PR

How do you spend money on clothes?

I am trying to shop my wardrobe and to buy very little these days.

As my shopping is sporadic, I like to check in with the new season (especially, my favourite, autumn), in the shops, in person.

I do end up shopping client press days and shoots.

I make my own choices and hopefully know at this stage of life what works for me.

Is there a certain expectation of you to maintain your wardrobe?

I am not sure. Work apparel has become so much more casual and it feels like only lawyers and bankers have to be formal in their workplace dress anymore.

Plus, in PR you need to be in the background at events. I do feel that I need to support Irish designers and prefer to shop in a real store as opposed to online, which I mostly find to be disappointing.

What’s your wardrobe weakness?

I am horribly practical. I used to shop for my fantasy life, but now I just shop for my real life.

At the moment I love Helen Steele, Simone Rocha, Vivetta, Ganni and Dries Van Noten, but would wait for the sales for those kind of investment pieces.

I recently have had to start to wear glasses for reading, so I chose a statement pair of frames from Vision Express.

Do you have any particular go-to brands for work?

Mint Velvet denim just works for me, with a blazer or jacket. I also am a fan of the black dress for work events and have a range of them. Both uniforms feel comfortable. Pockets are a must for work events, to keep a pen, phone, etc.

What is your Return on Investment?

I have been selling a lot of black tie stuff, bags and jewellery with Siopaella, but I never buy anything with resale in mind. I am just at a stage of life where I want to have a lot less, so just one handbag, one winter coat etc and am getting rid of everything else.

What’s your financial strategy for maintaining your clothing portfolio?

Cost-per-wear for frequently worn items like coats, bags, and shoes makes sense. As a graduate of economics, I see clothing as an expenditure that immediately depreciates, and an irrational expense, given that in the West we all have more than enough of any wardrobe item.

I am a high street shopper but am increasingly concerned about ethics in manufacturing and consumerism.

Justine KingFashion Stylist

www.justineking.com

How does what you wear impact what you do for a living?

Being a fashion stylist does mean you’re not only constantly around beautiful clothes but also expected to be dressed well in many elements of your work.

You can’t turn up to pitch a fashion campaign to a client looking like you just got out of bed or go on camera telling viewers to buy into a certain trend when you don’t look like you know what you’re talking about.

At the same time, a lot of my days are spent in isolation sitting at a computer screen and I’m definitely not wearing high heels and makeup.

How much do you spend per month on clothing?

I’d say I spend €300-€400 a month on average which I don’t think is too bad considering the daily temptation I’m faced with. I’m lucky in that I do get gifted clothes and vouchers in my job.

What’s the most expensive item you own?

I don’t really splurge massively on designer goods. I have loads of beautiful pieces that I really love but most are high street, vintage or items that were gifted to me by designers and brands.

I am about to buy my first designer handbag which my friends have very kindly contributed towards for my 30th birthday and that’s costing in the region of €2,000.

Can you re-wear your clothes or do you need to regularly replenish your wardrobe?

I’ve become much better at making smart purchases and buying pieces I really love, which I wear over and over again.

I’ve had some items for over 10 years and I still love them. Other purchases that weren’t so smart unfortunately don’t last in my wardrobe longer than a year or two so I’ll donate those to charity and restock as I go along.

What’s your financial strategy for maintaining your clothing portfolio?

I’m more likely to consider an expensive or designer purchase for a long time whereas I impulse buy high street pieces all the time.

I definitely look for quality in wardrobe staples - jeans, boots, coats, an everyday bag, then scrimp on the trend pieces to update my wardrobe each season.

I’ve always been a fan of vintage and have some real gems, particularly from thrift stores in New York. It’s definitely about balance. A gorgeous coat can make an entire outfit from Penneys look designer; it’s all about how it’s styled.

Sonia Reynolds Co-founder of STABLE of Ireland

www.stable.ie

What’s a typical day like and how does what you wear impact what you do for a living?

Since opening our store just over 18 months ago, my days are more structured and so is my approach to what I wear.

I have a pretty busy life between the business and family and so I try to keep things as simple as possible — multi-functional and purpose is key for me.

I’m also inclined to wear flat shoes (especially since a knee injury last year) so that influences my dress to some extent. I also love walking and cycling to work or around town.

Do you feel there’s a certain pressure to maintain an image or look for your role?

Presentation is important as I’m meeting customers every day and don’t want anything complicated for now. Tailored, simple, quality and of course fun are the order of the day. I’ve always been a strong believer in it’s how you wear clothes, not how they wear you.

What’s your wardrobe weakness?

My big weakness is scarves (naturally) and sunglasses, so I am grateful to have places like Optica in Dublin and Miss Daisy Blue in Cork for super vintage and special finds.

How do you spend money on clothes?

I’m not a routine shopper. I’m more of a ‘considered’ shopper and am not lead by trends, so my ‘eye’ is slightly different. I buy what I feel suits me and the environment I’m in.

What is your Return on Investment?

I’ve always had a great appreciation of quality textiles, interesting prints and good tailoring. I still wear clothes that I’ve had for years. As I get older, with a changing shape and frame of mind, I have clothes that I’ll be heading to a consignment store. I’m also a big fan of charity stores for recycling.

Do you have any particular go-to brands for work?

I wear COS for simple and easy-to-wear pieces mixed with brands past and present, such as Joanne Hynes, Peter O’Brien, Stella, Prada and Joseph.

Throughout my careers, I’ve managed to champion Irish designers and I’m proud of that.

Now with STABLE, I am working with Irish weavers and craftspeople creating beautiful, and timeless pieces from scarves (I was known for my head scarves years ago) to Irish linen robes, macs, raincoats, and our growing Art Series Collection with a new silk scarf being launched in August.

Niamh McCoy Owner of Gallery 9, Naas

www.gallery9.ie

What’s a typical day like and how does what you wear impact what you do for a living?

A typical day is spent in the shop, so I try to wear what we are selling in season, mixed with some older classic pieces.

Today I am wearing a Rejina Pyo skirt and shirt which I had bought for a friend’s wedding but have dressed it down with different footwear and accessories. I love when I can get wear from something long after the occasion for which I bought it.

What’s the most expensive item you own?

The most expensive item I own is my wedding dress from a brand we work with — Dice Kayek. I wasn’t really into wedding dress shopping, so when I saw it in a short version I asked can this belong too?

I worked with the designer on some tweaks and they made the dress for me. My architecture background has given me a love for structure and form, and that’s what I love about Dice Kayek’s designs.

Can you re-wear your clothes or do you need to regularly replenish your wardrobe?

Working in the industry I try to wear current season stock most of the time mixed with classics from the past. I wear the new season pieces over and over in the season mixing and matching so I can get plenty of fresh looks from the same pieces.

Is there a certain expectation of you to maintain your wardrobe?

Absolutely. My fashion image directly impacts my business so it is imperative that I represent the Gallery 9 brand in the correct way. I try to dress professionally but always with an edge.

Do you have any particular go-to brands for work?

For work I wear a bit of everything but I do love a bit of Victoria Victoria Beckham.

Her pieces make you feel great; the cut and quality are superb; and they generally can be re-styled and re-worn lots of ways.

I also love to wear Rejina Pyo — her silhouettes are amazing and there is a definite fashion edge to her pieces.

What’s your ﬁnancial strategy for maintaining your clothing portfolio?

Sustainability has become an increasingly hot topic on the streets of Houston. Instead of avoiding purchases altogether, one way that locals are beating the buyer-blues is by repurposing and reselling vintage items. Every first Saturday of the month, EaDo Vintage hosts ""Swap Meets"" to do just that.

These buy, sell, trade events have been hosted by the Texas Art Asylum and EaDo Vintage's shop owner, Jennifer Rowland since 2016.

Rather than contributing to fast fashion and adding to the ever-growing landfills, venders are concerned about the bigger picture of where their items end up.

""We're in a position where we can maintain our goods, keep them, clean them, make sure that they're durable, high quality made items,"" Miyo Stylehouse owner, J. Houston said. ""We should be able to use them over time.""

Many vendors who have been selling their vintage items for over ten years as well as those who are selling vintage for the first time get the chance to bring their items to the event.

""I think it's great when we do these events,"" Vida Antigua shop owner, Luz Perez said. ""We get to interact with like-minded customers that feel the same way about recycling and the environment and just keeping it stylish as well.""

Perez has been coming to pop up shops as Vida Antigua for about seven years and organizes a similar event called ""Got Vintage"" to build the vintage community in Houston.

Some vendors have second-hand shops both online and in the city, and have sold at pop-up shops before.

""I would go to Buffalo Exchange or go to estate sales or even on some occasions thrifting, but then I noticed that I would pick up items that weren't even in my size just because I thought they were so dope,"" Houston said. ""So that's when I said, 'okay, I'm basically shopping for other people without realizing it,' so that's when I really started collecting""

For buyers like Wenting Xie, events like these are an opportunity to support a more zero-waste way of living.

""Having more people come here and check out all the fun things and touch it with their hands, I think to start, it makes people realize that you don't need to go to the default, which is going online and buying something that's really quick and easy or going to a corporate chained market,"" Xie said.

The purposeful curation of the items sold at Swap Meets eliminate the tendency of single-use purchases, but they also make for a more unique home and wardrobe for buyers.

""I have decorated my entire home on a budget and it's freaking cool when you come visit it,"" Xie said.

Beyond aesthetics and environmental impact, the re-circulation of these items carries additional importance to curators.

""Vintage is a part of the history,"" Vender, Jay Weiss ""Flamingo King"" said. ""And you have to record the history.""

The way that shop vendors differentiate between vintage and non-vintage items is by checking labels, becoming familiar with what brands have made over time, and by keeping pieces for over 30 years.

""I've always liked unique things, but vintage to me represents sustainable fashion that stands the test of time and it's also fashion that repeats itself,"" Houston said. ""I'm not big on the current and the latest trends. I'm more into trendless items that can last and sustain into multiple decades, and to me, vintage does that.""

Venders and buyers alike that come to the EaDo Vintage Swap Meet's express the need for social responsibility when selling or buying products and an awareness of what that means for the environment.

""I think we need to live in a more circular mindset of what the impact we have on the earth is,"" Xie said."
"‘Going green’ is good business says private sector at UN

Businesses across the world should no longer be viewed solely as greenhouse gas emissions culprits, but more as indispensable partners for climate action, who stand to increase profits from “going green”. That was the key message as the United Nations COP24 climate change conference went into its second week in Katowice, Poland.

For years, sectors such as construction, transport, farming and retailing, have had the finger pointed at them for being major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions globally and for putting profit ahead of environmental protection. But increasingly, new technologies and models are transforming the private sector so that business leaders no longer have to choose between making money and taking better care of the planet.

This is one of the key issues being discussed here at the COP24 conference, where negotiations are continuing on the implementation of the climate action agreement adopted in Paris, in 2015, when 197 parties committed to try and limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.

“We are calling on all companies across sectors and regions, to set their science-based targets to a new level of ambition, one that aligns with the 1.5°C target,” said Lise Kingo, who heads the UN Global Compact, a network of 9,500 small and large private companies which have committed to invest more in sustainable development.

Speaking at a press conference at COP24, along with the heads of Maersk - the Danish global shipping company – as well as US confectionary giant Mars, and the French-based water and waste management conglomerate, Suez, she stressed that “this is the only way we can reach the ambition of the Paris Agreement and the UN sustainable goals by 2030”.

According to the Global Compact, nearly half of the Fortune 500 list of leading US corporations, have set clear energy targets or greenhouse gas reduction goals. Moreover, in 2016, 190 of those companies captured a total of US$3.7 billion in savings thanks to their emissions reduction measures.

1000 solutions to protect the planet while making money

To make it easier for the private sector to adopt environmentally-friendly solutions while also boosting profits, one NGO – the Solar Impulse Foundation – has endeavoured to gather together 1,000 solutions already in operation, and vet them for their positive environmental impact and their profitability before presenting them to governments and the private sector at large.

“This is where can make a big difference for the protection of the environment… showing that it is profitable, that people can create jobs and make money with it,” said the founder of the foundation, Bertrand Piccard, who was also the first person ever to complete a round-the-world flight powered only by solar energy, in 2016.

Seeking to “bridge the gap between ecology and economy”, the 1,000 efficient solutions initiative was launched over a year ago and, so far, more than 1,500 companies have joined, with over 600 projects in the pipeline. So far, 58 solutions having already received the Solar Impulse Efficient Label on sustainability and profitability.

“The point I’m trying to make is that the biggest industrial market and financial opportunity of the century is in transforming the old devices, systems and infrastructures which are inefficient and polluting, into efficient and clean and much more profitable industrial processes, devices, systems, technologies and solutions,” Mr. Piccard told UN News in an interview at COP24.

From solutions which make homes carbon-neutral, to developing cleaner cooling systems, or producing stainless steel more efficiently and more economically, the pioneer hopes the initiative will help make the case that climate action can happen now. He said it should not have to wait until 2050, and can be about “winning, not losing” - something he believes to be particularly critical for the poorer and more remote communities across the world, which are often dependent on others for all their energy needs.

“Energy – if they make it locally with sun, with wind, with biomass, with waves, with hydroelectricity on a small river – would allow them to develop their wealth, their social stability and peace. They would not need to fight for energy, as they would produce it themselves,” he explained, acknowledging that such a shift would require an initial investment by an external entity willing to share the profits with the communities.

“Today we are seeing that the most profitable solutions need a little bit more upfront investment, and afterwards, they bring much more money back,” noted Mr. Piccard. “Take electric buses: an electric bus is just a little bit more expensive to buy than a diesel bus, but over ten years, which is the usual lifespan of a bus, if it’s electric, it brings about $400,000 in savings.”

Big clothing brands commit to showing the (run)way to sustainable practices

Along with the construction and buildings sector, as well as fossil-fuel energy producers, the fashion industry is often criticized for wasteful, polluting and highly unsustainable practices.

To course-correct, on Monday, at COP24, dozens of leading companies in the fashion industry – including Adidas, Burberry, Esprit, Guess, Gap, Hugo Boss, H&M, Levi Strauss & Co., Puma, Inditex - which owns brands like Zara and Bershka, as well as retailer Target, signed the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action, under the auspices of the UN Climate Change Convention secretariat, UNFCCC.

“The fashion industry is always two steps ahead when it comes to defining world culture, so I am pleased to see it now also leading the way in terms of climate action,” said UNFCCC chief Patricia Espinosa.

The document, open for others to join, and aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement, presents a vision for the industry to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and defines issues to be addressed every step of the way in the life of fashion products, including: the use of environmentally sustainable materials, low-carbon transport; consumer awareness-raising; ‘scalable’ solutions through resource and political mobilization; and exploring ways to extend the life expectancy of fashion products as well as recycling possibilities.

“I congratulate the signatories of this important charter, which represents a unique commitment and collaboration from an array of fashion leaders. The Charter, like the renowned fashion runways of the world, sets an example that I hope others will follow,” noted Ms. Espinosa.

"Bloomingdale's this week joined the clothing-for-hire trend, just in time for fall fashion, back-to-school, and college campus shopping, with all the attendant Instagram posts.

As the latest entrant in this increasingly crowded niche, starting in September, My List at Bloomingdale's will offer women a $149 monthly fashion subscription. Initially, customers get four pieces, with unlimited substitutions.

Other newcomers to the fashion rental market are Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie, and Free People—divisions of URBN brands, which through its Nuuly service in July began offering six-piece rental boxes of women's clothing for $88 a month. Included in their fashion selection are vintage denim and designer pieces.

Even with such an increasingly crowded field, “To us, subscription models feel very modern,” said Oliver Chen, managing director of retail and luxury for the brokerage firm Cowen. “People are rethinking material things. It’s possessions as a service.”

Still a small retail niche

Rented clothing once meant tuxes and Halloween costumes. Now options abound: There’s fine jewelry (Switch, $29 per month) plus-size fashion (Gwynnie Bee), kids' wear and sneakers (Walmart, $48, and Nike Adventure Club, $20, respectively), maternity (LeTote, $89, or $79 for non-maternity).

Many mall specialty brands, including American Eagle, Ann Taylor, and Vince, have rental programs. It’s a shampoo-rinse-repeat model for fashion: Choose it, wear it, return it—and order more. Customers can always be shopping. To that end, Bloomingdale’s My List has a 10-item queue feature for future wardrobe choices.

Yet despite this growing flurry of fashion-rental-on-demand interest, the market segment remains small, relative to in-store and online clothing and accessory sales.

David Hayne, chief digital officer URBN and Nuuly president, characterized clothing rental as having “light awareness” among U.S. shoppers—but it’s growing. GlobalData Retail valued the rental market at $1 billion last year, with a 20% annual growth rate.

“We think this is the way the customer is headed,” said Hayne. So much so that, while others are outsourcing their rental programs, the Philadelphia-based URBN ponied up for the infrastructure: A new 300,000 square-foot warehouse, a laundering plant, and a dedicated team. They're targeting 50,000 subscribers in 12 months, but Hayne declined to share how many they’ve signed on so far.

CaaStle, which owns Gwynnie Bee and Haverdash, both rental services, reinvented itself as a third-party provider (the name is an acronym for ""clothing as a service"") to capitalize on demand for a one-stop management system. They have signed on more than a half-dozen brands—including Bloomingdale's— since launching in 2018 and just opened a second warehouse, in Phoenix. Walmart's children's fashion box is in partnership with the Kidbox subscription service.

What's going to work?

Fine-tuning fashion box businesses has its difficulties. Retailers need to figure out: How much should they charge? How many pieces and how many change-outs? Will this cannibalize sales in an already-struggling sector?

Rent the Runway, a pioneer and reputed $1 billion player in the clothing rental business, started as a way of allowing women to score cocktail dresses they only planned to wear once. So attractive was this niche that Neiman Marcus formed a partnership with the startup. Another early entrant, Stitch Fix, has developed its personal styling and fashion subscription business since 2011, now catering to women, men, and kids.

“We expect growing pains,” Chen said of the industry. “There are a lot of questions as brands learn how to do this. The business models were not set-up for this expectation [of rental inventory] so they’re going to need to think in new ways about the lifecycle of the garment.”

He said it may be particularly challenging for department stores such as Bloomingdales, a Macy's division, to manage a different kind of demand. Some fashion labels may get squeezed, either by not being represented in subscription menus or by being widely rented (and then not actually bought.) Bloomingdales declined comment but its news release announcing My List mentions its house labels as well as Frame, and Kooples.

URBN is prepared for some cannibalization of its retail sales. “We do anticipate that some sales might be impacted,"" Hayne said but added that, longterm, Nuuly should be able to recoup and grow. “We know the customer’s desires are evolving and we want to be where she’s going.”

In nearly all rental services, shipping is free both ways, but Chen pointed out that customers like to return in stores. The retailers who can offer this option, rather than mandating the ship-back, will benefit from that traffic. As well, if customers rent an item in the wrong size, they may want to facilitate a quick exchange in store.

CaaStle said for the brands it manages, which includes LOFT, American Eagle, Vince, Rebecca Taylor, and others, a customer spends 100 minutes a month on the brand's rental sites. Moreover, existing brand customers spend 125% more, year-over-year, through all channels once they become subscribers.

Is subscription fashion more sustainable?

The global apparel industry is considered among the biggest industrial polluters . The popularity of fast-fashion has sped up not just the array of store merchandise, but consumer discards too. In theory, with subscription boxes, if closets go more communal, fewer garments can be made and they can be worn longer.

“Sustainability is a real part of this and something the consumer innately understands,” Hayne said. “We made as many decisions as possible through the lens of what’s right.” For instance, Nuuly reusable shipping bags are spun out of ocean-waste plastic. Garments will be laundered in low-water machines designed to use special detergents.

However, Darin Archer, chief strategy officer at Elastic Path, a commerce platform provider that counts LVMH as a client, said it’s not certain that rental services will be a net positive for the environment.

“If a rental service buys too many of one style that ends up being unpopular does that garment just get thrown out or is it donated or recycled?” he noted. “Additionally, with this model, consumers who might not have shopped online on a monthly basis due to budgetary constraints are basically getting the same experience but at a lower cost, adding more packaging and emissions from shipping into the mix.”

Archer also questioned sustainability from a time/effort standpoint. Will people really want to manage their closets so actively?

""Some subscription services are, frankly, too rigid and it’s a pain for customers to update order frequency, change their delivery date or just put a pause on deliveries altogether,"" he said. ""There’s definitely the risk of clothing rental becoming a novelty or getting relegated to something only for special occasions.""

"Trying to live sustainably can sometimes feel like an uphill trek without one clear-cut path to the mountaintop. Often a product that might be environmentally championed for one reason is problematic for another.

Almond milk production is the lowest emitter of the plant-based milk family, but it does require the most water to make, according to an article in Science. Compostable coffee cups might seem like an obvious more eco-friendly alternative than its paper-and-plastic predecessor, but only if disposed of properly. And, of course, there is always the question – how much is this going to cost?

Fortunately, sustainable consumer choices have become increasingly more affordable and accessible. While diet choices and their consequences on the environment and our health have been brought to the forefront with last month’s EAT-Lancet report which suggested people need to dramatically reduce their meat and dairy intake, there are other choices you can make at point of purchase that are considered to be wallet and planet friendly, as well as relatively straightforward.

Packaging-free

Long before David Attenborough highlighted the detrimental impacts of plastic pollution on our oceans, plastic packaging has caused substantial environmental and economic consequences.

A 2018 UN report found that if our global current consumption habits and waste management practices continue as is, by 2050 there will be roughly 12 billion tonnes of plastic litter in landfills and the environment.

The problems plastic brings are multifold for both humans and the environment, and the report goes on to say that studies suggest, “the total economic damage to the world’s marine ecosystem caused by plastic amounts to at least $13 billion every year”. Therefore, reducing our plastic use is good for both the environment and national spending. But what about for our bank account?

Zero-waste consumer options are cropping up across different industries in Ireland, particularly among grocers. Waste-free food shopping options have appeared both online, with sites such as Minimal Waste Grocery, and in-store.

Noms, an organic food shop based in Phibsboro in Dublin, uses sustainable packaging and goes package-free wherever possible. While its organic produce is more expensive than its non-organic counterparts, package-free purchases can reap pocketbook benefits in certain instances.

“Everything is loose, so you only have to buy what you need,” Ciaran Smyth of Noms says, recalling an experience whereby, “someone came in with a recipe written out looking for two tablespoons of cacao and coconut” and as Noms has its own weighing station, it was possible to measure out and purchase the exact amount. Bought in a larger load, such as an organic 200g package of raw cacao from Tesco, the purchase of one ingredient would work out to be €7.49.

British cosmetics retailer Lush is addressing the plight of excess packaging with their #LushNaked packaging-free line, providing customers with package-free products in Dublin and Cork.

At face value, purchasing a 55g Lush shampoo bar is more expensive than a standard-sized bottled alternative, such as Herbal Essences or Head & Shoulders. But, according to Lush, the bars give purchasers between “80 and 100 washes”, which, “does the job of three 250g bottles of liquid shampoo”. That extra bit of money at the till could lead to long-term savings, as well as lessening your own plastic consumption.

The Keep Cup

Alongside packaging, plastic features as a key component of disposable takeaway coffee cups, as it’s combined with paper. Since the two elements are often difficult to parse apart, recycling them has proven to be incredibly difficult. The Conscious Cup Campaign, which aims to increase the use of reusable cups in Ireland, estimates that as a nation, we dispose of over 200 million non-recyclable cups each year.

Combined with other channels of plastic consumption, the average Irish person now generates 61kg of plastic per year, which is roughly double the EU average.

Many big-name, nationwide coffee chains offer financial rewards to reusable cup users thanks to sustainable company efforts and campaigns.

A switch to a reusable alternative, like a Keep Cup, as a container for your morning, afternoon or I-just-need-to-push-through-this-all-nighter coffee initially sounds like quite an investment. Ready-to-use Keep Cups vary in size and design, and range in price from €9.50 to €29 online.

But, many big-name, nationwide coffee chains offer financial rewards to reusable cup users thanks to sustainable company efforts and campaigns like Conscious Cup, which is supported by Voice of Irish Concern for the Environment (Voice) and the Eastern Midlands Regional Waste Management Office.

Starbucks offers a 35 cent discount on a beverage bought with a consumer’s own mug, and Butlers Chocolate Cafe will offer a 10 cent discount to a customer using a reusable cup. Cafe Nero and Insomnia offer in-store benefits through Caffe Nero’s loyalty card and Insomnia’s Treats account. And in the long-run, if you buy a €22 Keep Cup, after 63 coffee purchases at Starbucks, your cup has paid for itself and you’ve substantially lowered your own personal plastic pollution.

You might say: “Hey, I’m not ready to make a reusable cup switch, and surely the relatively-new-on-the-market compostable coffee cups do the job?” Well, no. Not quite. While Insomnia introduced compostable bins into their stores in June 2018, there is still quite a way to go regarding their waste treatment both within shops and on streetside bins.

“Compostable cups are not compostable on the ground,” says Voice co-ordinator Mindy O’Brien. “They need specific industrial treatment to get enough heat to break down. If you throw a compostable cup on the ground, it’s just going to sit there. It’s not like an apple core.”

Fast fashion

If you’re asked to name high-emitting industries, one significant contributor and very necessary product might not immediately come to mind: clothing. According to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the fashion industry contributes roughly 10 per cent of all global greenhouse gas emissions because of its energy-intensive production and long-supply chain. Fast fashion, inexpensive clothing produced quickly at a mass-market level, is a particularly guilty culprit.

And even after its production, its disposal poses an environmental threat. According to Carrie Ann Moran, the Fashion and Eco Store at the Rediscovery Centre programme manager at Ballymun’s Rediscovery Centre, textile waste has become a major issue in Ireland.

And due to the high-percentage plastic-based make-up of clothing, the material, according to Moran, “will stay there for the same amount of time as a plastic bottle, but that will differ because of the landfill environment”.

So for the environment, our fashion choices – no matter what styles or fast fashion trends you follow – can bear a huge cost. How can we go about reducing our impact in a cost-effective way?

One pocketbook-friendly and community-serving way to do so is by shopping at secondhand clothing stores. Ireland certainly has no shortage of them, with branches of Oxfam and St Vincent de Paul second-hand charity shops found nationwide. Or there’s the Fashion and Eco Store at the Rediscovery Centre for Dublin-based shoppers, a social enterprise that provides training to the long-term unemployed, produces redesigned and repurposed clothing, and each handmade piece is valued by price comparison on the market.

The fashion industry contributes roughly 10 per cent of all global greenhouse gas emissions because of its energy-intensive production and long-supply chain.

You can also bring clothes you no longer wear to a consignment shop, which provides a place for secondhand items to be sold at a price determined by the store itself. If the item sells, both the owner and the consignment store split the profit, and an item that would have sat in a landfill is once more in use.

One such system is Dublin’s Siopaella, with four different shop locations in the city, reselling and exchanging products from designer bags to premium high street fashion to vintage items.

Siopaella head-buyer and chief executive Ella de Guzman advises shoppers to think carefully about their purchases. “If you’re thinking about global warming and if you’re going to have kids, you really need to start thinking about how you are shopping. Make sure that if you do buy a fast fashion T-shirt, you’re willing to take care of it and mind it for the rest of its life, because a store like me is not going to buy it off you.”

Not only does sustainable fashion therefore create economic and environmental savings, it also allows you stand out from the crowd, Carrie Ann Moran says, as, “you know that the pieces are unique, because not everyone on the high street is going to be wearing one.”

Next step

Each one of our ecological footprints is like a mosaic of sorts, with a tile varying in size from almost every realm of consumption. Switching to options at the till and barista counter that are environmentally friendly has become notably cheaper over the past years. If consumer behaviour continues to bend towards sustainability, it has a strong chance of becoming more affordable and widespread outside of urban pockets. And while some choices might bear a greater up-front cost than disposable alternatives, the long-term savings for both your wallet and the planet seem like a fair price to pay."
"Share All sharing options for: No online shopping company can figure out how to quit this one plastic bag

In 2018, the healthy meal-kit service Sun Basket swapped out their recycled plastic box-liner material for Sealed Air TempGuard, a liner made of recycled paper sandwiched between two sheets of kraft paper. Fully curbside recyclable, even when wet, it allowed Sun Basket to reduce its box size by about 25 percent and reduce the carbon footprint of shipping, not to mention reduce the amount of plastic in their shipment. Customers were pleased. “Kudos to your packaging folks for coming up with this concept,” one couple wrote in.

It was an admirable move toward sustainability, but the truth remains: The meal-kit industry is one of many e-commerce sectors that still rely on (a frankly astonishing amount of) plastic packaging — way more pieces than you would ever bring home from the grocery store. Normally, you might purchase one glass bottle of cumin that would last you for a few years. But in a meal kit, each teaspoon of spice and each dollop of adobo sauce comes in its own piece of plastic packaging, and this pile of plastic is repeated every single night you cook up one of their pre-packaged recipes. It’s impossible to miss.

Sun Basket, despite its earnest attempts to improve its environmental footprint, still has to ship perishable food products in plastic bags. “Proteins, such as meat and fish, come to us already packed from outside vendors, who use a layered combination of polystyrene and polypropylene,” Sean Timberlake, senior content marketing manager at Sun Basket, told me via email. “This is industry standard material designed to ensure maximum food quality and safety.”

This reliance on plastic is not unique to shipping food. E-commerce retailers can easily offer up cardboard boxes with recycled content, FSC-certified tissue paper, and soy-based inks, which can all be stuffed in the recycling bin. They can tie reusable cloth ribbons or twine onto their goodies and pack their glass or metal containers in mushroom-based packing foam and starch packing peanuts that melt in water. But there’s one thing that continues to bedevil even the most sustainably minded brands: low-density, polyethylene, #4 virgin plastic film bags, known in the industry as polybags.

I’m talking about the clear ziplock or branded plastic bags that all your online orders come in, from meal kits to fashion and all the little components for toys and electronics. Although they are made from the exact same material as plastic grocery shopping bags, polybags used in shipping haven’t yet come under the same widespread public scrutiny, nor have they been subject to bans or taxes. But they are definitely a problem.

The impossibility of plastic-free and zero-waste shipping

An estimated 165 billion packages were shipped in the US in 2017, and many of them had polybags inside, protecting the garments or electronic components or buffalo steaks. Or the packages themselves were branded poly shipping bags, with poly dust bags of clothing inside. The Environmental Protection Agency reports that US residents use more than 380 billion plastic bags and wraps yearly.

This wouldn’t be such a crisis if we actually took care of our waste, but a lot of this plastic — 8 million tons a year — goes into the ocean, where researchers aren’t sure when, or even if, it will truly biodegrade. More likely it will just break into smaller and smaller toxic bits, which (despite being microscopic) are getting harder and harder for us to ignore. In December, researchers discovered that 100 percent of baby sea turtles have plastic in their stomachs. Microplastics have been found in tap water around the world, the majority of sea salt, and — on the other side of the equation — human poop.

Microplastics have been found in tap water around the world, the majority of sea salt, and — on the other side of the equation — human poop

Polybags are technically recyclable (and so are not, for example, on Nestlé’s “Negative List” of materials they plan to phase out of their packaging) and many states now mandate that grocery and convenience stores provide a bin for customers to return used plastic bags. But in the US, nothing gets recycled unless there is a business willing to purchase the recyclable material. Virgin plastic bags are so cheap, at 1 cent per bag, that old (often contaminated) ones are rumored to be worthless; they just get trashed. And that was before China stopped accepting our recyclables in 2018.

The burgeoning zero-waste movement is one response to this crisis. Adherents strive to send nothing to the landfill by reducing their purchases; recycling and composting everything they can; using and carrying reusable containers and utensils with them wherever they go; and patronizing businesses that provide package-free options. When one of these conscious consumers orders something from a supposedly sustainable brand and receives it in a polybag, it can be deeply frustrating.

”Just received an order from you and the items were wrapped in plastic bags,” a commenter responded to Everlane’s Instagram post promoting its “No New Plastic” guides.

In a 2017 survey by Packaging Digest and the Sustainable Packaging Coalition, packaging professionals and brand owners said that the questions they were most asked by consumers were a) why their packaging isn’t sustainable, and b) why they have too much packaging.

Which is sort of the same thing.

Would you like a bag with that?

From my conversations with brands large and small, I gleaned that most overseas consumer product factories — and all garment factories — from tiny sewing workshops to giant 6,000-person factories, ship finished products in plastic polybags of their choosing. Because if they don’t, the goods wouldn’t make it to you in the condition that you require.

”What consumers don’t see is the flow of the garments through the supply chain,” says Dana Davis, VP of sustainability, product & business strategy at the fashion brand Mara Hoffman. Mara Hoffman garments are manufactured in the US, Peru, India, and China. “When they are finished, they need to go to a trucker, to a loading dock, to another trucker, a shipping container, and then to a trucker. There is no way around using something that is water repellent. The last thing that somebody wants to receive is a shipment of clothing that is damaged and becomes waste.”

So, if you don’t receive a polybag with your purchase, it doesn’t mean it wasn’t there before, just that someone probably took it off before your goods got to you.

Even Patagonia, a company that is famously vocal about environmental issues and has been selling clothing made from recycled plastic bottles since 1993, currently ships its garments individually wrapped in polybags. Elissa Foster, Patagonia’s senior manager of product responsibility, has been diligently working on this problem since before 2014, when she published the results of Patagonia’s case study around polybags. (Spoiler alert: They’re necessary.)

“The last thing that somebody wants to receive is a shipment of clothing that is damaged and becomes waste”

“We’re a pretty big company, and we have a complicated conveyor belt system at our distribution center in Reno,” she says. “It’s literally a rollercoaster ride for the product. They go up, they go down, they go flat, and they do three-foot drops. We have to have something that protects the product.”

Polybags truly are the best at this job. They are lightweight, effective, and cheap. Plus (and you may find this surprising) in life-cycle analyses that measure environmental impacts over the entire life of a product, plastic bags have lower greenhouse gas emissions than paper bags. But when you’re looking at what happens when your packaging lands in the ocean — dead whales, asphyxiated sea turtles — well, plastic can seem pretty evil.

What can an eco-friendly brand do?

This last consideration for the ocean is the most important for United by Blue, an outdoor apparel and camping brand that promises to remove one pound of trash from oceans and waterways for each product sold. “It’s industry standard to ship everything with polybags for quality control and reduce contamination, but it’s terrible for the environment,” says Ethan Peck, United by Blue’s PR associate. They handle this inconvenient truth by switching their e-commerce orders from the factory-standard polybags to 100 percent recycled content kraft envelopes and boxes printed with eco-friendly, VOC-free ink before they ship to customers.

When United by Blue had their own distribution center in Philadelphia, they sent the used polybags to the catch-all mail-in recycling service TerraCycle. But when they moved distribution to a professional third-party logistics service in Missouri, the distribution center didn’t follow their instructions and customers started receiving polybags in their packages. United by Blue had to issue an apology and hire additional hands to oversee the shipment process.

Now, with the glut of used polybags in the US, the waste management service that handles the fulfillment center’s recycling is warehousing polybags until they can find someone who wants to buy them.

“It’s industry standard to ship everything with polybags ... but it’s terrible for the environment”

Patagonia’s own stores and wholesale partners take the product out of the polybags, stuff the polybags into shipping cartons, and ship them back to their Nevada distribution center, where they are pressed into four-feet cubed bales and shipped to the Nevada location of Trex, which turns them into recycled decking and outdoor furniture. (It seems that Trex is the only US business that actually wants these things.)

But what about when you take a polybag off your order? “The direct-to-customer, that is the challenge,” Foster says. “That is the piece where we don’t know exactly what happens.”

Ideally, customers would take used e-commerce bags, along with their bread bags and grocery bags, to their local grocery store, which often has a collection point for them. In practice, they often try to stuff them in their plastic recycling bin, which gunks up the machinery at the recycling plant.

Rental brands, which have a loop of clothing going out to customers and back again, like ThredUp, For Days, and Happily Ever Borrowed, use reusable cloth packaging from a company like Returnity Innovations. But getting customers to volunteer to ship empty used packaging back for proper disposal has proved nearly impossible.

For all the above reasons, Davis, Mara Hoffman’s sustainability VP, looked into compostable bags made of plant material when Hoffman decided to turn her whole fashion collection sustainable four years ago. A top challenge was the fact that most of Mara Hoffman’s business is in wholesale, and large retailers are notoriously picky about the packaging that items arrive in. If brand products arrive in packaging that doesn’t follow the retailer’s exact rules on labeling and size — which vary from retailer to retailer — the brand will be charged a fee.

The Mara Hoffman office volunteered at a New York City composting center so they could identify any problems at the outset. “When you are working with a compostable bag, you also have to think about all the components that go onto the bag: the ink — you have to print the suffocation warnings in three languages — it needs a sticker or tape. The challenges of finding a compostable glue were crazy!” She saw in the community composting center that the fresh, beautiful dirt is filled with fruit stickers. “Imagine a big brand slapping stickers on them, and this composted dirt is full of these stickers.”

For Mara Hoffman’s swimwear line, she found compostable bags with a zip closure from an Israeli company called TIPA. The composting center verified the bags are actually backyard compostable, meaning if you put it in a compost pile, it will disappear in less than 180 days. But the minimum order was too high, so she sent out an email to every single person she knew in the industry (including me) asking if they knew any brands that would be interested in going in with them on an order. With the help of the CFDA, a few other brands onboarded the bags. Stella McCartney announced in 2017 that they were also switching to compostable bags by TIPA.

The bags, which have a shelf life of a year, are double the price of plastic polybags. “Cost has never been the thing that has stopped us from moving forward. When we made this shift [to sustainability] we knew we would be taking the hit on our end,” Davis says.

If you ask consumers, half of them will tell you that they will pay more for sustainable products, and half of them will also tell you they check product packaging before purchase to ensure the brand is committed to a positive social and environmental impact. Whether that is in fact true in practice is debatable. In that same sustainable packaging survey I mentioned before, respondents said they just can’t get consumers to pay a premium price for sustainable packaging.

“We pay a premium for packaging, but we’re willing to make that sacrifice”

It took a year of research for the team at Seed, a microbiome science company that sells a combined probiotic and prebiotic, to find a sustainable bag for sending monthly refills out to customers. “Bacteria are incredibly sensitive — to light, heat, oxygen ... even trace amounts of moisture can be degrading,” co-founder Ara Katz told me by email. They finally chose a shiny home-compostable oxygen- and moisture-protection pouch by the company Elevate, made from bio-based raw materials, housed inside a non-GMO US-grown cornstarch-foam padded mailer by Green Cell Foam. “We pay a premium for packaging, but we’re willing to make that sacrifice,” she says. She’s hoping that other brands can pick up the packaging they pioneered. Happy customers have mentioned Seed’s sustainability to other consumer brands like Warby Parker and Madewell, who have contacted Seed to learn more.

Patagonia looked at bio-based or compostable bags, but their main issue was the tendency for customers and employees alike to put compostable plastic-like products in with the regular plastic recycling. “By keeping all our bags the same, we’re not contaminating our waste stream,” Foster says. She points out that “oxo” packaging products, which claim to be biodegradable, just break down into smaller and smaller pieces in the environment. “We would not want to support those types of degradable bags.”

So, they decided on plastic polybags made with recycled content. “The way our system works is you have to scan a tag that has a barcode through the bag. So we had to work hard to identify a 100 percent recycled content bag that is clear.” (The more recycled content a bag has, the milkier it can be.) “We’ve tested all the bags, making sure they don’t have some weird content that would cause some discoloration on the product, or tear.” She says the price isn’t too much higher. They had to ask their 80-plus factories — all of which produce for multiple brands — to specially order these polybags just for them.

Starting with their Spring 2019 line, which hits stores and the website February 1, all the polybags will have somewhere from 20 percent to 50 percent certified post-consumer recycled content. Next year, they will be 100 percent post-consumer recycled content.

Unfortunately, this isn’t a solution for food companies. The FDA prohibits plastic food packaging with recycled content unless a company gets special permission.

The entire outdoor apparel industry, which serves customers especially attuned to plastic waste, has been experimenting with various approaches. There are water-soluble bags, sugar-cane bags, reusable mesh bags, and prAna even ships bag-free by rolling its apparel and tying it with raffia paper ribbon. It’s notable, however, that none of these individual experiments have been taken up by several companies, so there’s been no silver bullet found yet.

Linda Mai Phung, a long-time French-Vietnamese sustainable fashion designer, has a unique overview of all the challenges inherent in eco-friendly packaging. She co-founded an ethical streetwear/cycling label Super Vision and works out of an office above a small ethical denim factory in Ho Chi Minh that her co-founder, Marian von Rappard, owns, called Evolution3. The team at Evolution3 also acts as a middleman for mass-market brands looking to put in orders to Ho Chi Minh factories. In short, she’s involved in the entire process from beginning to end.

She was so keen on using sustainable packaging that she put in an order for 10,000 (the minimum) biodegradable shipping bags made of cassava starch from Wave, a fellow Vietnamese company. Von Rappard talked to the mass-market brands Evolution3 works with, trying to convince them to go in on the order with them, but they declined. The cassava bags are 11 cents per bag, where a normal polybag is only a penny.

“What the big brands told us … is that they really needed the [pull-off closure] tape,” Phung says. Apparently, the extra steps to fold the bag and pull the biodegradable sticker from a sheet and put it on top to close the bag add up to a lot of time lost when you’re talking about thousands of pieces. And the bag is not even fully sealed, so moisture could potentially get in. When Phung asked Wave to develop a closure tape, they said they couldn’t retrofit their manufacturing machine.

Phung knows they’ll never use up the 10,000 Wave bags they ordered — the bags have a three-year shelf life. “We asked how we could keep them longer,” she says. “And they said, ‘You can wrap them in plastic.’”

"JOHANNESBURG – The labour movement has a vested interest in encouraging localisation. As one of the social partners at Nedlac, they were signatories to the Local Procurement Accord in 2011, making a number of commitments to support localisation, which have contributed to the narrative around the buy local movement and broader localisation.

When there are job losses, the first cries we hear are from the unions, who blame employers for protecting profits at the expense of the workers they are laying off. But without re-industrialisation, retrenchments may sometimes be unavoidable if the choice is between business closure and saving at least some jobs by being leaner and therefore more profitable.

The unions’ need to contribute meaningfully to re-industrialisation is in part entrenched in their need to protect their membership base.

Jobs shed in the poultry, clothing, textiles, leather and footwear industries as highlighted in previous columns here have predominantly (if not all) been from among their own numbers, whether represented by small regional unions or large national federations.

However, while most unions are equal in their vocal objections to redundancies, not all are as active as they might be in their collaboration with or support of the buy local movement.

Historically, the relationship between the union movement and Proudly South African has had most success coming from the relationship we have with the South African Clothing & Textile Workers’ Union (Sactwu).

With more than 100 000 jobs lost in their sector between 2002 and 2015, they needed little galvanising by us to embrace buying local and to practise what they preach.

They have introduced their own ""Wear South African"" campaign, which champions ethical sourcing, empowers local creative talent, creating authentic local brands in the process and establishing 19 independent stores across the country.

In addition, Sactwu’s 44-year-old tradition of the Spring Queen & Fashion Pageant held annually in Cape Town and celebrating the workers behind the designers, has become the world's largest fashion show featuring workers as the models.

Machinists, pattern makers and textile weavers among the many others that bring to life the vision of the designers proudly model the products of their own labours, bringing in an audience of around 10 000 every year.

We would love to see every South African proud to wear something made locally. It is our family members, friends and neighbours, or even just someone you shared a taxi with that are the everyday people behind what we wear, and if we persist in buying imported clothing, we will see them retrenched one by one.

How can our business and factory owners keep their doors open if there is no local demand for what they are making? How can they invest and grow if they do not enjoy the support of us all? Our economic contraction is another country's economic growth. One job loss here is a job created elsewhere. By buying local we can break the cycle of unemployment which leads to persistent poverty.

Back to the unions, whose shop stewards are able to wield a lot of influence with their employers. If they are able to change their companies’ internal buying habits, for example of bathroom detergents, kitchen materials, uniforms, even office stationery and furniture, this would already go a long way to helping those local suppliers stay in business, protecting fellow workers from job losses.

I guess Brenda Fassie was on to something when she said Umuntu ngu muntu nga bantu, which can loosely be translated as meaning “you need others to become a better person”.

We all need to support and rely on each other, look out for each other’s jobs by buying what is locally produced and manufactured.

By keeping people in work, we break the poverty cycle, feed and educate our children and raise the future leaders of this country.

Eustace Mashimbye is the chief executive of Proudly SA.

"Sarah Williams, CEO and Founder of t-shirt company Affordable Healthcare 123 is set to launch new t-shirt designs in 2019

Sacramento, CA - February 1, 2019 /MarketersMedia/ —

Sarah Williams, CEO and Founder of t-shirt company Affordable Healthcare 123 is set to launch new t-shirt designs in 2019 that incorporate animal- and eco-friendly textiles. Started in 2018, Affordable Healthcare 123 Tees aims to raise awareness about America’s health care crisis and create space for community-wide dialogue.

When she went to a healthcare rally in Sacramento, California, Sarah Williams didn’t realize that she would be starting a business. “While I was at the rally,” she notes in an interview, “numerous people came up to me and asked me where I got my shirt and where they could get one as well. I was so moved by their compliments that I decided to use my skills in graphic design to benefit my pursuit of accessible healthcare for my community and millions of Americans around the country.”

In starting Affordable Healthcare 123 Tees, Williams decided to combine her love of elegant graphic design with her commitment to healthcare activism. By combining fashion and a political message, the company works to spread the idea that healthcare should be as affordable as clothing.

Now, the business hopes that its new, 2019 products will continue to create an open discussion about a controversial issue while helping the environment. The apparel company is shifting to more animal- and environment-friendly fabrics such as hemp and linen. With more than 15 million tons of fabrics discarded per year, Affordable Healthcare 123 Tees plans to incorporate biodegradable fabric choices that won’t add to landfills. In using these materials, Williams and her team hope to create breathable, moisture-wicking clothing that is also well designed and fashionable. But Williams remains dedicated to the company’s original cause. By committing to environmentally safer fabrics, the business hopes to help consumers make better choices about clothing, even as it continues to foster a more open dialogue about healthcare.

"Inclusive fashion show hits the runway at Melbourne Fashion Week

Posted

Peacock punk, Edwardian Kabuki punk and London street punk are just some of the descriptions used when describing outfits at the Access to Fashion event at Library at the Dock, in Melbourne's Docklands precinct.

Featuring a diverse cast of models living with various disabilities, the history making event organised by appearance advocate Carly Findlay was a first for Melbourne Fashion Week.

""I wanted disability to be at the centre of Melbourne Fashion Week,"" said Ms Findlay.

Brands like Target, Kmart and the boutique labels Lazy Bones and Misguided were inclusive fashion pioneers in the Australian market, Ms Findlay said.

Ms Findlay said with many Australians living with a disability, there was a sizeable untapped market share for an industry where many Australian labels were either folding or struggling to remain viable in a challenging retail climate.

The event, which explored disability and inclusion in the fashion industry, aimed to highlight the need for accessibility in stores and changerooms; adaptive and accessible clothing design; and more diverse and authentic representation of people with disabilities in the fashion media.

Although the runway experience was a first for many of the models, there were some seasoned professionals in the mix.

Model Kimberley Holiday-Coleman, who came from Ohio in the US for the event, modelled professionally 15 years ago, before a battle with cancer left her with a colostomy.

Wheelchair user Jason Clymo has modelled extensively and participated in a mainstream Melbourne Fashion Week show the day before.

With the pressure now on for Australian fashion retailers to evolve to a racially diverse market, a market more conscious of ethically and sustainably produced clothing, as well as age friendly, plus-size friendly, accessible and adaptive fashion choices, it is hoped that a focused Access to Fashion event will not need to be held again.

""I want the fashion industry to take note that we're here, and embed us in everything that they do,"" said Ms Findlay.

She said she hoped that inclusive and accessible design would simply become a convention in the mainstream fashion industry.

She liked her job but it didn't excite her. She took up sewing as a creative outlet. Then she had a baby girl, and Duff, once a solid size 12/14, was in the 16/18 zone.

"Why do we need a fashion revolution? Because six years after the Rana Plaza factory collapse in Bangladesh, which killed 1,138 garment workers, our clothes are still being made by some of the poorest, most overworked and undervalued people in the world.

A report published last week by the Worker Rights Consortium, gives a shocking picture of repression, violent attacks and intimidation of garment workers in Bangladesh who are simply trying to campaign for a living wage. Desperate workers – vital cogs in the country’s $30bn (£21bn) industry – have been asking for more money since the minimum wage was raised in November 2018 to the equivalent of $22 (£17) a week, less than 45 cents (35p) an hour.

Since last December, at least 65 workers have been arrested on false charges, while factories producing clothes for some of our favourite brands have fired and blacklisted 11,600 workers with no legal justification. According to the WRC, some have paid with their lives, shot dead by the police as retribution for speaking out.

“The industry and the government seem to be driven by a desire to maintain control and low prices, regardless of the risks to workers’ lives and well-being,” says the report. “They are clearly betting that western brands and retailers care a great deal about prices and very little about labour standards.”

Beyond Black Friday: 12 ways to care for your clothes Read more

I care, and I want the brands I spend my money with to care, too. That is why I will be taking part in Fashion Revolution week this week to ask: Who made my clothes?

“We are campaigning for an industry where environmental protection, as well as human rights, are the standard and not the exception,” says Carry Somers, who founded the campaign in the immediate aftermath of the Rana Plaza collapse. She started Fashion Revolution because she, like co-founder Orsola de Castro and many others working in the industry, felt that the disaster had to stand for something. “It had to lead to revolutionary change within the fashion industry.”

Last year, 3.25 million people took part during the week to ask, #WhoMadeMy Clothes? That question, when a brand is tagged on social media with the hashtag # WhoMadeMyClothes?, has already resulted in major change within the industry.

Marks & Spencer now publishes its supplier list along with an interactive map of the factories who produce its food and clothing around the world. The map covers 67 countries and details 1,720 factories employing 994,512 workers; 85 of these are in Bangladesh. Many other brands are now publishing their supplier lists including Asos, the H&M group (including Cos, Arket and & Other Stories), Primark and Levi’s.

“Fashion Revolution has been really successful in terms of giving people easy tools to be curious, find out, and to do something about it,” says Somers.

I will be doing just that. The textiles industry accounted for 1.2bn tonnes of CO2 in 2015. Its use of non-renewable resources - including oil to make synthetic fibres - is estimated to increase from 98m tonnes in 2015 to 300m tonnes by 2050. Dyeing and textile treatment processes contribute to 20% of the world’s industrial water pollution.

“When the system is killing us, we must change it,” said Sara Arnold, founder of fashion rental company Higher Studio, which is taking part in the Extinction Rebellion protests. “The privilege and influence of the fashion industry should be used to force governments to declare emergency and act.”

Fashion Revolution week provides the perfect platform to urge brands to put worker welfare and safety and environmental safeguards above shareholder profit. “We have to start looking at the true cost of our clothing, because at the moment that is hidden,” says Somers. “Ultimately, future generations are going to bear the cost of the unseen social and environmental impacts.”

We all have the power to make a change. This Fashion Revolution week is all about demanding fair and decent conditions and pay, environmental protection and gender equality. On Wednesday, Fashion Question Time will be at London’s Victoria & Albert Museum, with a panel of speakers including Mary Creagh MP, chaired by Baroness Lola Young. Limited tickets are still available here. There are thousands of other events around the world – to get involved, go to Fashion Revolution’s events page.

Our voices really do count. And it’s such a small action. All you need to do is join #WhoMadeMyclothes? You may be pleasantly surprised by the answer.

This article was amended on 22 April 2019. An earlier version stated that 1,338 workers were killed in the Rana Plaza collapse; 1,138 died. It also reported that 32.5 million people took part in Fashion Revolution week in 2018; 3.25 million participated.

We've been hearing so much about climate change recently, and the facts don't look good.

The evidence shows that, thanks to human activity, global temperatures are rising at a level which isn't sustainable for the environment to be able to survive.

That's partly why there are people taking their clothes off in parliament and school kids going on strike.

(Plus, when the nation's grandad David Attenborough starts talking, it's probably worth listening.)

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Climate Change - The Facts is available to watch on BBC iPlayer

But it's difficult. We're being bombarded with scary stories and told that we must change our ways - and soon.

So what can we actually do? How can we make a difference when it seems like everything has a bad impact on the climate?

Well, Radio 1 Newsbeat has been chatting to sustainable bloggers for tips on easy changes we can make to help reduce our impact.

Image copyright wastelandrebel.com Image caption Shia Su - AKA the Wasteland Rebel

The first is not to beat yourself up if you forget your bag for life or your reusable cup - it will probably just add to your eco-anxiety.

""I never had the notion that I had to be perfect,"" says Shia Su from zero-waste blog Wasteland Rebel.

""I had no intention of going zero-waste. I read about it and I just thought it was cuckoo and unrealistic,"" she says.

But one day she decided to take a jar to her local coffee shop instead of asking for a takeaway one - and she grew greener from there.

Image copyright wastelandrebel.com

So how did Shia get to the point where she now says she can fit her entire year's waste into a litre-sized jar?

Her second tip - shared by most of the bloggers we spoke to - is about turning your good intentions into good habits.

Do whatever you can, and after a while it will become a habit,"" she says.

""Normally, when you leave the house you grab your phone, you grab your wallet, you grab your keys.

""After a while you'll grab your bottle, your food container and then you're good to go - it will become a habit.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Keep it minimal

And the third tip that all our bloggers share is probably the one which involves the biggest change.

It's about living a minimal lifestyle - cutting out needless buys.

""Living a sustainable lifestyle is about consuming less in general,"" Shia says. ""I only buy a new piece of clothing if another one needs replacing.""

Shia says it's not as hard as it sounds: ""A lot of things have already been done - we're just going back to them.

""Ask your grandparents, they can teach you a lot about how to not create trash.

""It's a really nice bonding experience as well. I think it makes them smile when I get out my hanky to blow my nose [instead of a disposable tissue].""

What else can I do to help me live a greener life?

We got other eco-bloggers and Instagrammers to give us their top tips on different areas of life.

Fashion

Go vintage: ""Do things like shopping second-hand and vintage, going to your local charity shop. You can also buy on sites like eBay and Depop.""

Buy less: ""If you can, just not shopping at all is a really great way to do it. Embracing what you already own and what's already in your wardrobe. There's a great phrase you hear a lot: 'Loved clothes last'"".

Look for eco-friendly materials: ""Look out for more natural fibres - go for cotton over polyester. Not only do they feel a lot nicer when you wear them, but don't contain things like microfibres that go into our water and into marine life when we wash our clothes.""

Learn to DIY: ""It doesn't take much to learn how to hand-sew and stitch up a hole. Or if you have a pair of ripped jeans that are becoming a bit too ripped, you could always cut them and keep them as shorts.""

Food

Immy Lucas is a blogger and YouTuber who goes under the name Sustainably Vegan.

Consider a more plant-based diet: ""I don't think everyone has to go vegan to make a huge change. The more realistic thing is for the majority of people cutting down meat consumption to a couple of days a week.""

Eat as locally as possible: ""If you're eating soy beans that are shipped from China or bananas that have been shipped from Colombia, that's not as sustainable as if you're eating apples grown in Kent. If you support your local farmers' market, you're also supporting more low-scale food agriculture which tends to be more kind to the Earth. ""

Eat as seasonally as possible: ""If you're eating tomatoes from the UK that aren't in season, then you know they've been grown in some huge greenhouse that uses a massive amount of resources to basically fake the weather. So you're using a massive amount of heat energy to grow the tomatoes out of season.""

Think about packaging: ""There are zero-waste shops where you buy unpackaged food. But you can also go to the supermarket, and make better choices by buying unpackaged fruit and vegetables, or opting for cans and cardboard that are widely recycled instead of plastic. So there are better choices that you can make in regular shops.""

Beauty

Nicole Whittle - AKA VeganBeautyGirl - blogs about living a vegan life.

Image copyright Nicole Whittle Image caption Nicole Whittle

Ditch the face wipes: ""Just use a good old flannel like your nan's got in her bathroom, and a nice oil-based cleanser to help break down make-up at the end of the day. If you've got a baby and you need that on-the-go reliability, then you can find biodegradable wipes.""

Buy package-free: ""You can get shampoo, conditioner and body wash bars - they might cost a bit more but they last much longer. So the cost-per-use is a lot lower.""

Think about your menstrual products: ""Tampons and pads are single-use items, and not everyone disposes of them properly. The big change you can make is going to a menstrual cup, which is a silicone cup that catches all the blood and can be reused each month - they're not as scary as they sound. There's also menstrual underwear these days which is a lot more sustainable.""

Big brands can also be eco-friendly: ""A lot of the big beauty brands are really taking inspiration from the vegan environmental movement. It's great to see these changes happening. It's taken them a while but these brands have seen that there's future in these sorts of products.""

Travel

Florine Hofmann runs The Wasted Blog, where she tries to find eco-friendly alternatives to everyday habits.

Think about your journey: ""We're so fortunate here in Europe - I usually try to take the train whenever I can. I'm conscious of trying to fly as little as possible.""

Pack sustainably: ""I recently bought a second-hand suitcase because it was already something that was made, and it was cheaper. I try to pack as minimally as possible - for instance my toiletries I try to reduce to soap and a shampoo bar, stainless steel razor and toothbrush. I don't want that much plastic trash in another country. I try to leave as little behind as possible.""

Plan where you eat: ""I usually do some research beforehand. I'm a massive foodie, so it's very important in my everyday life. But also because I want to support restaurants for instance that do think about their waste or whether they compost or not.""

Local knowledge is best: ""I love renting a bike in a new city and just exploring new areas. You find the best spots through talking to people and getting all the hidden gems.""

"With the unstoppable rise of fast fashion and cheap clothes, many of us are guilty of snapping up 'bargain' garments that we never wear again.

This is not just bad for the environment but a waste of money, and should prompt even the most zealous shopaholics to reconsider their shopping habits.

Luckily, help is at hand as London-based stylist Alizé Demange, who has worked with the likes of Maya Jama, has shared some simple tips to make shopping more sustainable.

She advises renting clothes, investing in key pieces and buying garments made from ethical fabrics - as well as choosing vintage fashion, passing on old items and repairing damaged pieces.

Stylist Alizé Demange has shared her tips to make shopping more sustainable in an age of fast fashion. File photo

1. Renting

'Instead of splurging on designer pieces shoppers can pay a fraction of the price on renting them for a fixed period.

'According to research from Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield almost 60 per cent of 16-34 year olds are interested in renting clothes.'

This week sees The Drop at Westfield Stratford City, the first ever UK pop-up store which has a collection of streetwear available to hire.

2. Investing

'The key to a sustainable wardrobe is having a capsule collection of your own, according to Demange.

'Investing in high quality timeless pieces that you can mix and match is better than buying one off trendy items.

'The stylist also advises looking after your clothes better by giving them a 30 degree wash and air drying clothes as tumble drying can damage clothes.'

3. Materials

'Demange advises buying clothes that have been ethically produced and knowing where your clothes come from.

'Ask yourself where are they made and how exactly are they made?

'Clothes sold by fast fashion brands are ending up in landfill after shoppers have bought them and worn them one before discarding them.'

4. Vintage

'Buying from vintage stores is a great way to shop sustainably as they will not create any new risk to the environment.

'As well as being eco-friendly, vintage finds also ensure you've bought something unique and they can often be great bargains.'

5. Pass on old clothes

'Demange suggests giving your old clothes to friends, or swapping them for something of theirs that you want and they no longer wear.

'You could even swap with someone of the opposite sex as many clothes sold today aren't gender specific.'

Buying from vintage stores is a great way to shop sustainably as they will not create any new risk to the environment. File photo

6. Repair and restore

'The UK has had to double its domestic waste capacity since 2010 from 6.3 million tonnes to 13.5 million tonnes, and throwaway fashion has played a big part in this.

'If your clothes get damaged, instead of just throwing them away patch them up or take broken heels to be mended.'

7. Donate

'Donating old clothes to charity is not only helping those in need but is also good for the environment as they aren't going into landfill.

'Demange suggests living by the mantra of every time you buy something, you'll donate something else in your wardrobe.'

Visitors can visit The Drop at Westfield Stratford City from Thursday 6th December until Sunday 16th December. For more information please visit www.uk.westfield.com."
"There’s no doubt that eating vegan has exploded in popularity, with a quarter of a million people taking on the recent Veganuary challenge by going plant-based for the month of January this year. But veganism isn’t just about skipping the cheese course – instead, it’s much more of a lifestyle choice.

The Vegan Society says: “Veganism is a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose.”

So it’s not just about the food on your plate, but the clothes, shoes and accessories you wear too.

“More and more people are aware that animal skin is only ever ‘natural’ on the animal who was born with it – and that it must be treated with a whole host of chemicals to stop it from decomposing,” says Yvonne Taylor of PETA. Luxury brands, from Gucci to Burberry, are leading the charge by going fur-free, and use of leather could very well be heading a similar way.

Our shopping habits are changing too, as more and more plant-based material options – including so-called vegan leather – are becoming available, so it’s no surprise the fashion industry is following suit. But what is vegan leather made of, and how do all the options differ?

What is vegan leather?

The latest H&M Conscious collection uses ‘leather’ made from pineapple leaves for its boots (H&M/PA)

It basically does what it says on the tin – a material that looks and feels like real leather, but has been produced with no animal products.

This means there’s a whole lot of innovation going on in the sector, as fashion brands search for materials that look like the real thing but are also ethical and – if lucky – environmentally-friendly too. Topshop’s vegan leather shoes (Topshop/PA)

High-street brands have been noticing this demand for cruelty-free fashion and have started diversifying their offerings. Marks & Spencer has a whole range of vegan footwear and in April Topshop released its first 100% vegan shoe collection – complete with faux snakeskin and mock-croc.

What kinds can you get?

Vegan leather broadly falls into three categories: First is what you might know as ‘pleather’ – artificial leather that’s actually made from plastic (more on that later).

The second category is rapidly expanding and is made from natural materials which aren’t as potentially environmentally damaging. One of the most exciting recent examples of this is Piñatex, which claims to be a “natural, sustainably-sourced, cruelty free material”. It’s a by-product of the pineapple harvest; a leather-like material is made using fibres from the fruit’s leaf. These leaves are traditionally thrown away, but now there’s a new kind of use for them. It’s slowly reaching the mainstream – H&M’s recent Conscious Collection features Piñatex boots.

And finally there’s lab-grown leather, which might not be natural but it’s renewable and eco-friendly. It’s currently in development – Taylor calls it “exciting” and says: “This innovation, in which real animal skin is grown without raising and killing an animal, will allow designers to use actual leather without harming animals and with less impact on the environment.”

Are there any issues with vegan leather?

listen I know vegans are against cruelty of animals which I’m all for, but please do not buy faux leather. because you know what it really is? plastic. it harms the environment WAY more than anything cows do when they manufacture it AND it’s a pollutant that‘ll be here forever. — Luna 🐺 (@its_lunamarie) April 29, 2019

Unfortunately, not all alternatives are quite the same. Many of the most commonly used vegan leathers are made of plastic – like the old-school PVC or the newer and more popular polyurethane, and those come with their own environmental issues, as they’re not biodegradable.

It’s a tricky situation, because even though animal-based leather is biodegradable and not adding to the plastic problem on the same scale, tanning – where animal hides are made into leather using certain chemicals – is an environmentally polluting process.

Perhaps this is why many people are putting their hopes into the new innovations being developed, which have the potential to be both friendly to animals and the environment.

“Vegan leather has come a long way since the days of ‘pleather’,” says Taylor, who prefers to focus on new innovations that mean “natural, renewable materials can be transformed into durable, high-quality, stylish, eco-friendly fabrics that will replace cruelly obtained and highly polluting animal skins”.

Veganism and eco-credentials often come hand in hand, so it’s so surprise many of the newer alternatives are striving to be as environmentally-friendly as possible. It’s a fast-moving market, so we can expect many new innovations in the future, as more people want to shop in a way that’s sustainable, ethical and cruelty-free.

"A woman from Tipperary is taking on the environmental impact of fast fashion by starting her own designer dress rental service.

Edel Lyons, 31, a former marketing executive and fashion blogger started Rag Revolution just three months ago from her bedroom in Dublin, a premium fashion rental service that allows customers to rent dresses for special occasions, paying a fraction of the price, and returning the item when the event is over, helping save money – and the planet.

According to the Ellen McArthur Foundation, clothing production has approximately doubled in the last 15 years, while the annual value of clothing discarded prematurely is more than 350 billion euro.

While the average consumer bought 60% more clothes in 2014 than in 2000, people now keep each garment for half as long, and discarded clothing made of non-biodegradable fabrics can sit in landfills for up to 200 years. (Brian Lawless/PA)

Second only to oil, the clothing and textile industry is the largest polluter in the world, and produces nearly 20% of global waste water.

As the drive to be more environmentally conscious becomes more immediate, Lyons saw a gap in the market for Ireland’s fashion forward to be more sustainable, supporting reuse instead of consumption.

“I had a lot of events over the last three years, balls or weddings and work functions and was struggling to find something a bit different but that wasn’t really expensive, and I didn’t like the fact I was only wearing things once, it wasn’t good for me money-wise or the environment.

“I kept seeing expensive and real statement pieces that I knew if I bought, I wouldn’t wear again. We’re not like our mums’ generation, we don’t keep pieces anymore for a long time.

“With social media having such a presence in our lives, we’re less likely to re-wear outfits, people don’t want to keep wearing these statement pieces because there’s already a picture of them wearing it on Instagram or Facebook, and it sounds awful but that’s how people are now.

I did some research and I couldn't see anything that offered style that I would wear, and saw the gap and thought; 'I should do this'

“While all this was going on, I was becoming more and more aware of the effect ‘fast fashion’ was having on the world.

“I am very environmentally conscious and I wouldn’t buy a lot of clothes, and stick to key pieces, and that’s how I fell into this idea.

“I did some research and I couldn’t see anything that offered style that I would wear, and saw the gap and thought; ‘I should do this’.”

Rag Revolution offers dresses from designer labels such as Rixo, Reformation, Olivia Rubin and Self-Portrait, who can command up to 400 euro for a dress, and rents them out for as little as 70 euro.

Lyons’ thoughts on the future of the industry runs parallel with economic experts, who predict that the way we think about clothes is about to shift, as the industry moves to cater to sustainability and mindful shoppers.

Recent research by Deloitte revealed over 80% of millennials across Australia, Canada, China, India, the UK and the US say it is important for companies take steps to diminish their environmental impact. Ms Lyons wants to support reuse of clothes (Brian Lawless/PA)

Consumers aged 25-35 are projected to spend 135 billion euro on sustainable goods by 2021.

“I’m quite interested in the industry and they’re predicting in a few years we’re not going to be buying clothes like we are now,” Lyons added. “We’re all headed toward buying key pieces, good jeans and boots – things like that, but you’re not going to have a wardrobe full of dresses from the high street or occasion-wear.

“At this rate the industry can’t keep going as it is, even in regard to the disposal of clothes. 90% of fashion go to a landfill and aren’t recycled. It’s on a lot of people’s minds now about how and where they shop, people used to want to have loads of clothes, but that’s a thing of the past, people are looking for something more sustainable.

“I’ve always wanted to do something like this and I just took the leap, it’s not for the fainthearted but it’s really satisfying, I’d tell anyone who has an idea to just go for it.”

That means clothing production and sales are both on the rise, and so is the amount of clothing in landfills.

That’s been the case for Rumors, a vintage thrift shop started in Richmond, Va., that is known locally for its location in Chapel Hill. The company opened a Durham location on June 1. Rumors buys and sells secondhand clothing, along with some new items bought from wholesalers.





“We get a lot of people that are starting to stop shopping at places like Forever 21, H&M and Urban Outfitters and coming here instead,” said Micah Moses, buyer at the Durham location.

Moses said he’s seen increasing interest in thrifting over the past few years.

The cycle begins when online and fast-fashion retailers promote low prices for trendy clothing. For example, SheIn, a fast fashion website, offers tops for as low as $4.

“Fast fashion is definitely an epidemic for the age group that our shoppers are,” said Juliet Magoon, assistant manager of the Chapel Hill Rumors location. “People are wearing things one or two times and getting rid of it. We’re giving items a second life.”

Extensive waste

Leonas said people are buying 60% more clothes today than 15 years ago.

Millennials are reselling and buying thrifted items the most, she added. Still, only about 15% of clothing is recycled or reused, leaving the other 85% in landfills.

In Wake County, it costs about $60 per ton to dispose of textile waste, according to Leonas.

Stores and companies are trying their best to combat the extensive waste, but the real problem lies with consumers, Leonas said.

Once clothing is bought from a company, even fast fashion retailers, the fate of the clothes is up to the buyer. And most fast fashion clothing won’t be worn in a year, Leonas said.

The best option is to donate or sell clothes to a secondhand store, or to repurpose them. Rumors partners with a local company, the Cosmic Circle, to turn old clothing into new, desirable items.

If a shirt has a stain on the bottom, they can turn the shirt into a crop top, Moses said. He’s also seen them turn pairs of pants into a dress.

Rumors has also enacted a Zero Waste Initiative at its stores to try to do their part to eliminate waste. Instead of giving people plastic bags with purchases, Rumors offers tote bags with their logo on it for $2.

Their hope is that people will be reminded of the amount of plastic bags they typically use, and then reuse the tote bag at other places. Customers are also rewarded for bringing the tote bags back to Rumors.

Online fast fashion

In addition to the well-known retailers such as H&M and Forever 21, online fast fashion brands have also been expanding.

Moses said he’s seen a rise in people ordering from companies like Wish, an online brand.

“The problem with ordering from places like Wish is you could order a small and it could come in and be like infant-sized,” he said. The sizing issues then create more clothing waste.

Leonas thinks that the stigma about shopping at thrift stores has been reduced over the past few years.

“Raising people’s awareness to alternative ways of disposing of their garments is exciting,” she said. “It’s encouraging to see places like these thrift stores.”"

"Hong Kong Design to Shine at New York Fashion Week

Three leading Hong Kong fashion designer labels will take part in the Fashion Hong Kong runway show, organised by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC), at New York Fashion Week February 2019, showcasing Hong Kong's fashion creativity to industry elites and style influencers from the United States and around the world.

Launching their Fall/Winter 2019 collections at the runway show on 8 Feb (EST) will be Annette Chan (brand: ANVEGLOSA) and the design duo Yi Chan and Lary Cheung (brand: HEAVEN PLEASE+), who return to the show for the second consecutive year, as well as Mountain Yam (brand: 112 mountainyam). An after-show party will be held for the designers to network with industry players.

B2B Showroom to Facilitate Business Exchange

Fashion Hong Kong is a series of international promotions organised by the HKTDC to raise the global profile of Hong Kong fashion designers and labels. Since 2015, Fashion Hong Kong has been staging world-class runway shows at major international fashion events, including New York Fashion Week, London Fashion Week, Copenhagen Fashion Week and Tokyo Fashion Week, to showcase Hong Kong's fashion design prowess in overseas markets.

To further promote the city's fashion brands and foster exchange and collaboration between Hong Kong designers and international buyers, the HKTDC will run the Fashion Hong Kong Showroom from 1 Feb to 31 March at FTL Moda, one of the major professional showrooms located on New York's Seventh Avenue, also known as ""Fashion Avenue"".

In addition to the three designer labels showcased at the runway show, 10 other budding Hong Kong fashion brands - BIG HORN and Ejj Jewellery (both returning for another year), ANDREW KAYLA, ARTINI, Berayah, Blank Concept, FAVEbyKennyLi, Jade in Style, Jewcells, and NoBeing - will be featured in the Fashion Hong Kong Showroom.

New Promotion Channels

To maximise exposure for the Hong Kong fashion brands during their time in New York, Fashion Hong Kong will take part in COTERIE - the premier global event and trade platform for contemporary fashion brands in New York - for the first time. Participating brands, which include ANVEGLOSA, HOUSE OF V, Methodology and more, will showcase their collections in COTERIE to help them connect with international buyers.

Fashion Hong Kong, for the first time, is collaborating with international fashion media Women's Wear Daily to produce a ""Hong Kong Style Guide"". The guidebook introduces Hong Kong fashion brands that have showcased their collections during New York Fashion Week, including ANVEGLOSA, HARRISON WONG, HEAVEN PLEASE+, Hidy N.G. and Loom Loop. The guidebook will be distributed during New York Fashion Week to promote Hong Kong's advantages as an innovation hub and centre for fashion design.

Brand: ANVEGLOSA

ANVEGLOSA is a contemporary women's fashion brand specialising in leatherwear. The brand's inspiration lies in combining practicality and style.

The brand has attracted high-end retailers from overseas, including Harvey Nichols, Galeries Lafayette Beijing and Lane Crawford.

Fall/Winter 2019 Collection: Salute to Fashion

The collection is inspired by the ""good old days"" of fashion design and is also a symbol of our respect towards the tradition and heritage of the fashion industry. It features three main colours: black and white to represent the nostalgia of old photos, and an accent of green to invigorate the collection.

- Lary Cheung & Yi Chan : HEAVEN PLEASE+

Designers Profile:

The design duo both graduated with a fashion design degree from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Yi Chan started her career at Marie Claire as a fashion editor, while Lary Cheung worked as a menswear designer at British labels Kent & Curwen and Aquascutum. They founded the brand HEAVEN PLEASE+ in 2011 and launched their first collection for Fall/Winter 2012. The designers are devoted to applying their experiences outside the fashion industry, including arts, music and literature, into their design concepts and sketches, attempting to empower fashion with insightful and perceptual values.

Brand: HEAVEN PLEASE+

Independent, Dreamy, Extraordinary. Since its debut collection in 2012, HEAVEN PLEASE+ has been searching for an alternative narrative from the language of design details and silhouettes. The brand has designed several costumes for Hong Kong artists and large-scale events, such as the Ultimate Song Chart Awards Presentation. In 2013, HEAVEN PLEASE+ opened its first retail location, which was chosen by the LOUIS VUITTON HK City Guide 2015 as one of the recommended fashion stores to visit.

Fall/Winter 2019 Collection: ELIZABETH, WATCH THE STAR

Inspired by the Armada Portrait of Elizabeth I and French band Air's album Moon Safari in 1998, the brand redefines the appearance of women in the 21st century. From the Golden Age to the future, this collection explores timelessness and eternity.

Mountain Yam graduated with a master's degree in Fashion Design from the Institute of Textiles & Clothing at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Yam started his own company, My Fashion International Limited, in 2015. The designer has two labels, couture made-to-order label MYam Atelier and a ready-to-wear fashion label, 112 mountainyam. In 2014, Mr Yam was recognised in the ""40 under 40"" awards presented by Perspective magazine. In 2018, he represented Hong Kong in the ""Belt and Road International Young Fashion Designers Showcase Tour"".

Brand: 112 mountainyam

Designer Mountain Yam likes to explore contrasting elements, drawing inspiration from the natural environment and modern buildings. The brand style carefully combines men's and women's cutting, together with sports and party elements, to create a strong image for the modern woman.

Fall/Winter 2019 Collection: Hide & Seek

Wild animals hide in the forest, avoid being hunted and also seek chances to hunt. When faced with a threat, wild animals believe they will survive only by fleeing. In the human society, people tend to hide in their comfort zone; when facing problems, most people run away or find excuses. It's time to be brave and face them! Get the issues solved and move forward!

A woman from Tipperary is taking on the environmental impact of fast fashion by starting her own designer dress rental service.

Edel Lyons, 31, a former marketing executive and fashion blogger started Rag Revolution just three months ago from her bedroom in Dublin, a premium fashion rental service that allows customers to rent dresses for special occasions, paying a fraction of the price, and returning the item when the event is over, helping save money – and the planet.

According to the Ellen McArthur Foundation, clothing production has approximately doubled in the last 15 years, while the annual value of clothing discarded prematurely is more than 350 billion euro.

While the average consumer bought 60% more clothes in 2014 than in 2000, people now keep each garment for half as long, and discarded clothing made of non-biodegradable fabrics can sit in landfills for up to 200 years.

Second only to oil, the clothing and textile industry is the largest polluter in the world, and produces nearly 20% of global waste water.

I did some research and I couldn't see anything that offered style that I would wear, and saw the gap and thought; 'I should do this' Edel Lyons

As the drive to be more environmentally conscious becomes more immediate, Ms Lyons saw a gap in the market for Ireland’s fashion forward to be more sustainable, supporting reuse instead of consumption.

“I had a lot of events over the last three years, balls or weddings and work functions and was struggling to find something a bit different but that wasn’t really expensive, and I didn’t like the fact I was only wearing things once, it wasn’t good for me money-wise or the environment.

“I kept seeing expensive and real statement pieces that I knew if I bought, I wouldn’t wear again.

“We’re not like our mums’ generation, we don’t keep pieces anymore for a long time.

“With social media having such a presence in our lives, we’re less likely to re-wear outfits, people don’t want to keep wearing these statement pieces because there’s already a picture of them wearing it on Instagram or Facebook, and it sounds awful but that’s how people are now.

“While all this was going on, I was becoming more and more aware of the effect ‘fast fashion’ was having on the world.

“I am very environmentally conscious and I wouldn’t buy a lot of clothes, and stick to key pieces, and that’s how I fell into this idea.

“I did some research and I couldn’t see anything that offered style that I would wear, and saw the gap and thought; ‘I should do this’.”

Rag Revolution offers dresses from designer labels such as Rixo, Reformation, Olivia Rubin and Self-Portrait, who can command up to 400 euro for a dress, and rents them out for as little as 70 euro.

Lyons’ thoughts on the future of the industry runs parallel with economic experts, who predict that the way we think about clothes is about to shift, as the industry moves to cater to sustainability and mindful shoppers.

Recent research by Deloitte revealed over 80% of millennials across Australia, Canada, China, India, the UK and the US say it is important for companies take steps to diminish their environmental impact.

Consumers aged 25-35 are projected to spend 135 billion euro on sustainable goods by 2021.

“I’m quite interested in the industry and they’re predicting in a few years we’re not going to be buying clothes like we are now,” Ms Lyons added.

“We’re all headed toward buying key pieces, good jeans and boots – things like that, but you’re not going to have a wardrobe full of dresses from the high street or occasion-wear.

“At this rate the industry can’t keep going as it is, even in regard to the disposal of clothes.

“90% of fashion go to a landfill and aren’t recycled.

“It’s on a lot of people’s minds now about how and where they shop, people used to want to have loads of clothes, but that’s a thing of the past, people are looking for something more sustainable.

“I’ve always wanted to do something like this and I just took the leap, it’s not for the fainthearted but it’s really satisfying, I’d tell anyone who has an idea to just go for it.”

"Fur has always been one of the most incendiary topics in the fashion industry, but the debate has reached new heights in recent months as an increasing number of labels implement bans on using animal skins in their clothing.

The ethical issues of using animal fur for clothing are well-documented, and while it might’ve once been considered uber glamorous to glide down the street in a fluffy mink coat like a 1930s Hollywood starlet, doing so now would be seen as a sartorial cause célèbre. Also, an activist might pour a bucket of fake blood on you, which is probably not much fun either.

Gucci, Burberry and Coach are just a few of the numerous high-profile brands that have now banned fur. London Fashion Week also announced it would be going entirely fur-free in September 2018, subsequently fuelling the demand for faux alternatives that have been popularised by playful, millennial-focused brands such as Shrimps and Charlotte Simone.

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.

But environmentalists claim that these cruelty-free substitutes are made almost entirely from plastic and are causing serious harm to the planet.

This propagates a “damned if you do, damned if you don’t” narrative around fur, which puts shoppers in a difficult position: do the environmental consequences of faux fur outweigh the ethical implications of real fur? Or is it time for fashion fans to move away from a fur-based aesthetic altogether and champion materials that carry less emotional baggage?

Fur farming has been banned in England and Wales since 2000 – Scotland and Northern Ireland followed suit in 2002 – but it remains legal to import and sell fur from species such as fox, rabbit and chinchilla, most of which are produced by European farmers.

And despite what we know about animal welfare (furs sold in the UK have either been farm reared, or trapped and killed) it continues to be in-demand. In 2017, Britain imported £63m worth of fur and items with fur, a governmental report states.

Despite countless brands going fur-free, many, such as Fendi, Louis Vuitton and Miu Miu, continue to use it in their collections.

Newer labels are using it too, such as Scandinavian label Saks Potts, whose vintage-inspired fox fur coats are a firm favourite among celebrities such as Selena Gomez and Lady Gaga.

Mark Oaten, chairman of the International Fur Federation (IFF), tells The Independent he believes fur can be ethically sourced and is significantly more sustainable than faux alternatives.

“It’s a totally natural product, it is bio-degradable and in the case of wild fur it comes from conservation and population management projects,” he says, adding that designers such as Gucci and Burberry have “jumped on a vegan and animal rights bandwagon” by banning fur.

He adds that the IFF is in the process of developing a global certification programme called Furmark that aims to give brands and consumers confidence in the welfare of animals with regards to fur farming.

Comments such as Oaten’s are heavily disputed among animal rights campaigners, who argue that the fur industry is attempting to “greenwash” itself amid the rising popularity of faux fur.

“Fur is only ‘natural’ when it’s on a live animal’s back,” says Claire Bass, executive director at Humane Society International.

Bass argues that fur production poses its own environmental threats.

“There’s water pollution in the form of nitrogen and phosphorus from animal waste,” she tells The Independent, “air pollution from incinerating animal carcasses and releasing pollutants such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide and hydrochloric acid.”

There is also a “cocktail of toxic chemicals” used in the tanning and dressing process, Bass adds.

Describing the fur industry as sustainable has, in fact, proven controversial in the past. In 2012, an ad campaign by the European Fur Breeders’ Association was banned because it claimed it was “eco-friendly to wear fur” because it “lasts a lifetime” and “helps conservation”.

As for faux fur, Labour MP Mary Creagh is among those to have spoken out about the environmental threats the material poses, telling The Independent that fake fur coats are often made from synthetic fibres derived from fossil fuels that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.

“Fashion tells us we can have anything we want, that we don’t want to kill animals to have our fur, but what they’re not telling us about is the carbon consequences of extracting the material for faux alternatives,” she said.

“These garments are made entirely out of artificial fibres like polyester that are a by-product of the petroleum industry.”

The Wakefield MP also said that faux fur garments were “almost impossible to recycle” and often end up in landfill due to the rise of fast fashion culture that means clothes are worn and then discarded to make room for the next trend.

But Bass claims that the faux fur industry is rapidly moving in a more sustainable direction, with more brands adopting innovative production techniques that reduce their carbon footprint.

New York-based brand House of Fluff, for example, makes the majority of its faux fur products from natural dyes and materials.

Speaking to The Independent, CEO Kym Canter explains that the label is committed to using “the most earth-friendly” materials possible.

“We are also working with scientists at Cradle to Cradle to produce a completely compostable faux fur textile,” she adds.

“Our garments are also very luxe and stylish, these are not coats you wear for a season and then discard, these are coats you will happily keep for a lifetime and then pass down.”

But she points out that the argument that fake fur is damaging the planet could be applied to the fashion industry as a whole and should not be limited to one section.

“Sadly, many of the garments we all wear are made from synthetic fibres that are not great for the planet,” she explains. “It will take all of us to reverse these issues and move forward. Let’s not confuse this issue or use it to distract people from issues of animal welfare.”

Celebrity stylist Anna Berkeley concurs that the criticisms surrounding faux fur are indicative of a systemic issue affecting the fashion industry.

“In the fast fashion sector, products are discarded and take years to bio-degrade,” she tells The Independent.

“I do not agree with farming and killing animals solely for fashion, but the industry needs to find a solution to the environmental impact of all fashion items.”

Whichever way we look at it, due to the fashion industry’s ephemeral trend circuit and widespread use of polyester fabrics, sustainability remains an ongoing issue, one that faux fur is a very small part of.

The government is urging the industry to address this and brands like Stella McCartney are setting an admirable example for others to follow.

But when it comes to animal fur, the problem may be much closer to being solved. And that’s undeniable progress."
"From dangerous sweatshops to blackface sweaters (yes, that was a thing) the fashion industry is never far from an ethical quagmire.

But we've all got to wear clothes. So, is there a way we can buy them with a clear conscience? And, should we believe brands that say they're 'woke'?

This week, in our pop culture and ethics series It's Complicated, we're looking at what we wear, how it's made and marketed, and why the ""cost"" of clothing always exceeds its price tag.

Environmental degradation, worker exploitation and cultural appropriation are just a few of the problems posed by the fashion industry. So, we've enlisted the help of a fashion lecturer, culture commentator, sustainability expert and a philosopher to help us sleep easier (and feel wiser) about our sartorial choices.

There's nothing inherently evil about fashion. It can be a form of art, an opportunity for self-expression and, at an economic level, an asset to both developing and developed countries.

According to Joshua Badge, a lecturer in philosophy at Deakin University, fashion as a form of excellence can promote eudaimonia or ""human flourishing"", a concept central to political philosophy.

But since the rise of globalisation, we've seen an influx of fast fashion — mass-produced, inexpensive garments that copy catwalk designs — and the consequences are steep.

In 2013, an eight-story building, known as Rana Plaza, collapsed in Dhaka, Bangladesh, killing more than 1,100 people and injuring 2,500. It was home to several garment factories, which manufactured clothing for internationally recognised brands, including the UK's Primark, Spanish label Mango and the US giant Wal-Mart.

Image The Rana Plaza had shown visible cracks a day before it collapsed, but garment makers were forced to continue working. ( Reuters: Andrew Biraj )

Alyx Gorman, a fashion writer and engagement lead at Time Out, says the humanitarian disaster shed light on dangerous industry practices, and provoked many of us to ask:

Do our clothes cause human suffering — either at the agricultural level or in the factory where they're sewn?

Do our clothes cause human suffering — either at the agricultural level or in the factory where they're sewn? Are the workers being exploited or paid below the living wage?

In the six years since the Rana Plaza collapse, we've seen the creation of websites and apps dedicated to rating fashion labels on their ethicality, working conditions and supply chain transparency.

Despite this, an Oxfam report from February found that not a single garment worker in Bangladesh was earning a living wage. Some were paid as little as 55 cents per hour.

Mr Badge says increased awareness hasn't abolished exploitation.

""There's almost no way, at the moment, to certify that the clothes we buy and wear every day weren't made using child labour, because no-one is monitoring that,"" he points out.

""The ethical problems posed by fashion happen far away from the consumer, and so they aren't quite as pressing as, for example, cost.

""I tell my students when we discuss this in class, 'There's a reason that a shirt only cost, you know, $5, and it's because somewhere along the line, someone is losing out'.""

Your activewear is destroying the environment

But it's not just farmers and factory workers paying the price for cheap clothing.

As much as 10 per cent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions come from the fashion industry.

And according to McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm behind the annual State of Fashion report, nearly three-fifths of clothing ends up in landfill, or an incinerator, within a year of being made.

For Clare Press, presenter of the sustainable fashion podcast Wardrobe Crisis, this statistic is all the more worrying when we consider what our clothes are made from.

""Approximately 70 per cent of the clothes produced each year are made from synthetics,"" she says.

""Synthetics are not biodegradable, so when you chuck them out, where do you think they go? They hang around in the environment, in landfill, for potentially hundreds of years.""

GIF Should fashion labels be held more accountable for their environmental impact? ( The Simpsons/20th Century Fox )

Polyester is one of the most common synthetic fibres in our garments and shoes.

According to Kimberly Jenkins, a lecturer in fashion at Parson's School of Design in New York, you'll be hard-pressed sourcing yoga wear, sports clothing or ""athleisure"" made without it.

""A lot of our athletic clothing has polyester to help with your moisture wicking [drawing moisture away from the body],"" she explains.

""Polyester has microplastics and when we wash it, those plastics shed into the water, which goes into the water streams and ultimately into the oceans.

""Animals are ingesting [the micro-plastics] and then they end up — if you eat fish — on your dinner plate.""

So, who can you trust?

Seeing as nudism isn't an option for most of us, are there ways to discover which brands are more sustainable or ethical?

Baptist World Aid Australia produces an annual Ethical Fashion Guide and, in the 2019 edition, they scored 400 brands on their systems to prevent slavery, child labour and environmental damage.

But even the companies that score an 'A' aren't necessarily perfect.

Adidas, for example, was one of the highest-ranking brands, despite the fact that polyester makes up 50 per cent of the material in its products. (To Adidas's credit, the company has vowed to use only recycled polyester in its clothing and shoes by 2024.)

Ms Press says it's tough — perhaps impossible — to consider every factor, so settle on one issue and go from there.

""Pick the thing that really matters to you, for example, animal rights or carbon footprint, and then look for the brands that are doing good work in that particular space,"" she says.

""If you talk about something like climate change or social justice, these can be very overwhelming subjects, so I think the secret is to start small.""

For Alyx, vetting a brand's ethical credibility means checking up on its parent company, too.

""If you really care passionately about these things, you should be thinking about who owns that label and are they complicit in a broader ethical minefield that makes you feel uncomfortable or that you strongly dislike,"" she says.

""It's that classic story of Dove putting out messages of empowering women, while at the same time Lynx is using … the idea of female sexual exploitation in their advertising campaigns. They're both owned by Unilever.""

But it's not just the multi-nationals who are creating harm.

Ms Jenkins says many labels pride themselves on hiring people of colour or workers in the developing world, but without adequate employment or educational opportunities, these businesses can disempower the people they're trying to help.

""It almost becomes this kind of saviour complex,"" she says.

""My concern is … are you stabilising or sustaining these own micro-economies, not just using workers in your ad campaigns as these smiling people of colour who are so happy and gracious that sustainable start-ups have come to their country?

""Are these practices … helping [workers] to become self-sufficient and empowered to run their own businesses?""

When racist imagery rears its ugly head

So that covers (most of) the ins and outs of the fashion supply chain. But there's another ethical conundrum we haven't yet considered: cultural sensitivity.

In the past year, some of the world's biggest luxury labels have made serious fashion faux pas — and no, I'm not talking about the socks and sandals trend which has somehow gone mainstream (thanks, Kanye).

In November, Dolce & Gabbana cancelled an event in Shanghai, after its ad campaign depicting a Chinese woman eating pizza with chopsticks was accused of racism. (Ensuing comments allegedly made by co-founder Stefano Gabbana were more overtly offensive.)

Image Dolce & Gabbana's ""Eating with Chopsticks"" advertising campaign on Instagram sparked major controversy. ( Instagram: dolcegabbana )

A month later, Prada recalled their red-lipped monkey key chains, after the customers decried the $US550 figurines for resembling the blackface 'Sambo' character.

Earlier this year, Gucci apologised for a balaclava jumper, which gave the wearer a blackface appearance when worn rolled up. And just last week, Gucci faced fresh condemnation — this time from the Sikh Coalition — after its 'Indy turban' appeared on an American online store.

So, why do these brands — coincidentally, all luxury Italian labels — and many others keep making racially charged, culturally clueless gaffs?

Alyx says it comes down to changing societal standards around what's appropriate and what's not. Despite their fortunes, many brands haven't caught up.

""It's only the past couple of years people have started turning around and going, 'Hang on, you can't wear a feathered headdress to Coachella, like, you wouldn't wear a Pope's hat to Coachella, it's a sacred religious symbol, please take it off your head,'"" she says.

She adds that the lack of diversity in high-end fashion houses helps explain how provocative products make it to market.

""If you don't have decent cultural awareness and sensitivity training within your business practices, and you also have a very white workforce, the chance that you're going to make a very public blunder is going to become much higher,"" she says.

Getting 'woke'

In the 2019 State of Fashion report, ""getting woke"" was identified as one of the biggest consumer shifts set to affect the industry.

""Younger generations' passion for social and environmental causes has reached critical mass,"" it says.

According to Ms Jenkins, many brands are jumping on the ""wokeness bandwagon"" — but it's not always sincere.

""You have labels … piggybacking on Black Lives Matter and feminism, body positivity, the interests of the LGBTQ+ community, you name it, ability and differently abled bodies,"" she points out.

""I'm sceptical because when you look under the hood of these organisations, you're not really seeing true diversity or ethical business practices at play.""

Last year, American NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick became the face of Nike's Just Do It campaign, which marked the 30th anniversary of the slogan.

Image Nike's advertising campaign featuring Colin Kaepernick was divisive among customers. ( Supplied: Nike )

Kaepernick garnered attention in 2016 for kneeling during the national anthem in a series of pre-season games to protest racial inequality and police brutality.

While Ms Jenkins supports the collaboration with Kaepernick, an ""icon of wokeness"", she's still not a big Nike shopper.

""I want to see ethical treatment [and] a clean record in terms of what's going on in their factories and how their shoes are produced,"" she says.

According to Mr Badge, Nike hasn't just jumped on the Black Lives Matter bandwagon, it's attempted to ingratiate itself with the LGBTQI community.

""Last Gay Pride Month, [Nike] made a series of sneakers that included the pink triangle, which is traditionally a symbol of the queer community and specifically associated with the radical queer movements of the '80s, particularly ACTUP or the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power,"" he says.

""They kind of appropriated this deeply important symbol in order to turn a profit, and they didn't donate any money to anyone.""

The system isn't perfect, but we do have a choice

It's not all bad news. There are brands trying to change the systems that harm people, animals and the planet.

Ms Jenkins cites Eileen Fisher, and her eponymous label, as a leader in the sustainability space, and commends Kerby Jean-Raymond, founder the menswear label Pyer Moss, for his political approach to fashion.

GIF After inexpensive and ethical clothing? Clare Press recommends op-shopping, 'swapping' and vintage. ( Schitt's Creek/Canadian Broadcasting Corporation )

Ms Press points to outdoor clothing company Patagonia as one that lives by its values.

""Their mission statement is 'Patagonia is in business to save our home planet',"" she says.

""You've got them giving 1 per cent of profits to the planet, you've got them engaging in large-scale political actions in the US on behalf of national parks that are under threat.

""It's a brand that's operating in the political commercial space, but doing so with a very clear environmental agenda, and I think that fans and customers respond to it.""

Ms Gorman agrees, adding that Patagonia responsibly sources fabrics and repairs clothes they've already made.

""There's no such thing as a totally morally pure, new fashion brand, you can't buy something new that is not, in some way, environmentally or socially an issue,"" she says.

""The way the world has been built is you can't exist in the 21st century and be perfectly ethical without taking to the wilderness … but you can make better choices."""

Amid a slow fashion trend, traditional and handwoven clothing is seeing a revival.

Tweed startup Love Mo Chuisle is putting a modern spin on the classic Irish fabric with its range of handmade clothing for men, women, and children.

Designer Anna Dobson studied fashion textiles at the University of Ulster and worked in the industry for 15 years before moving back to her home town of Avoca in Co Wicklow with her three sons in 2015.

In late 2017, she started Love Mo Chuisle. Tweed still has connotations of horse riding and waistcoats, Ms Dobson says, but she wanted to bring tweed into the 21st century with a look that’s “more fashion than heritage”.

Moving away from traditional grey and navy herringbone and plaids, she introduced colours such as mustards and raspberries to brighten up the kids range.

She says the market for kids tweed clothing is “completely untapped in Ireland” and her raspberry cape for girls is a best-seller. The girls range comprises capes, coats, dresses and matching accessories in traditional patterns as well as bright colours.

The men’s and boys ranges include a “mini-me” collection with matching bow-ties and waistcoats for boys and their dads, while the womens range offers fitted blazers, dresses, waistcoats, and coats in traditional patterns and modern styles and colours priced from €129 to €389.

While there are several competitors in the Irish market, such as established tweed brands like Magee, she believes there is still room for more companies.

The brand is popular with tourists, Ms Dobson says, and the accessories, in particular, are easy to transport and make an affordable handmade gift from Ireland.

Sustainability is the buzzword in the fashion industry these days. Ms Dobson buys her tweed from Donegal where it is woven from locally sourced wool.

“Working with an accessible and natural, durable material like wool on high quality and timeless design offers a more sustainable product,” and she believes that returning to traditional fabrics is a way to move away from throwaway trends.

The business has grown quickly. Following her win in the Arts category of the Network Ireland Wicklow Businesswoman of the Year 2018, she launched the website in September

2018

for direct sales.

Love Mo Chuisle exhibited at Showcase Ireland in January. The creative expo of fashion, jewellery, and gifts, held over three days at Dublin’s RDS was attended by around 5,000 buyers from more than 20 countries.

Ms Dobson’s stand on the balcony alongside other Local Enterprise Ireland-supported startups, received lots of interest from international buyers, and as a result of the exhibit, she secured stockists in the US, Germany, and France, while wholesalers in Italy, Belgium and Canada place forward orders.

Meanwhile, stockists across Ireland include The Design Loft at Powerscourt Estate, Kilkenny Design Centre, Shannon Airport Duty Free, the gift shop at Bunratty Castle, and outlets in the North.

Currently working with two others on production, Ms Dobson says it has taken time to build the team and “get the right fit”. One of her biggest challenges has been to find seamstresses because of the lack of local manufacturers.

She has availed of assistance with business planning through the Acorns programme for rural-based early-stage female entrepreneurs. Her Local Enterprise Office in Wicklow has provided mentoring, training and funding, including a priming grant and financial support with capital expenses and marketing and website costs.

Ms Dobson has recently moved the company’s production from her home to a premises in Avoca village. She plans to open a retail unit at the front of the building next month. Locals have been very supportive, she says, and neighbours are “knocking on her door” enquiring when the shop “Tweed in the Valley” will be up and running.

She plans this year to build out the website to push sales in the US and other countries. She hopes to showcase at one of two big tradeshows in Boston or Chicago in the near future."
"Charity shops are being flooded with poor-quality clothes that they have to turn away, because of fast fashion, the head of the environment select committee has said.

Mary Creagh, Labour MP and chair of the Environmental Audit Committee said the fashion industry is failing to cut waste, leading to tons of clothes clogging up landfills.

She explained: ""the whole industry is based on us buying more than we need, and not valuing an item of clothing when it comes to the end of its life.""

The MP said that the rise of fast fashion, where t-shirts are sold for just £2 and dresses for £5, means clothes are worn once then thrown away, where they end up in landfill.

Mrs Creagh told The Telegraph: ""Charity shops can't be the dumping ground for the high street's dirty little secret - much of what they take back they can't sell because of the quality and it's very difficult to recycle the fibres.

""They are turning it away as they can't sell it so fabric either goes to Europe or the developing world. It's disrupting markets in other countries.""

A spokeswoman from Oxfam said: ""Our shops tell they have seen an increase in clothing donations in the past five years, and this is probably due to fast fashion. But we believe Oxfam actually slows down fast fashion in the UK because clothes donated to us are given a second chance to be sold. We're lucky to receive all sorts of fashion including plenty of high quality garments too."""
"MPs have summoned bosses at 10 leading UK clothing retailers to come clean about their environmental record as part of an investigation of ""fast fashion"".

The inquiry into sustainability by the Westminster Environmental Audit Committee was prompted by concerns at the role the industry plays in the leaching of synthetic fibres and microplastics into oceans and waterways.

However members of the committee are also concerned at the flood of cheap clothing into the UK, often from sources with low pay and poor working conditions, and a throwaway culture which sees high-street versions of catwalk couture designed to last for only a few months. MPs are concerned that increased clothing sales have seen an equivalent rise in the hundreds of thousands of tonnes of clothing dumped every year.

Senior figures at firms including Marks & Spencer, Primark, Next, Tesco, Asda and Sports Direct are among those being asked to explain what they are doing to cut waste. Environmental Audit committee chairwoman Mary Creagh has written to bosses at the firms inviting them to appear before MPs.

She said: ""The way we design, produce and discard our clothes has a huge impact on our planet.

""Fashion and footwear retailers have a responsibility to minimise their environmental footprint and make sure the workers in their supply chains are paid a living wage. We want to hear what they are doing to make their industry more sustainable.""

The responses will contribute to an eventual report on how the UK's fashion industry – worth £28 billion a year to the UK economy – can reduce its environmental footprint. An earlier inquiry by the same committee led to the Government passing a ban on the use of microbeads in cosmetics, which is regarded as one of the toughest in the world.

Expert evidence published by the committee shows people in the UK buy more new clothes than any other European country – almost double that of consumers in Italy, Germany and the Netherlands – and purchase twice as much clothing as they did 10 years ago.

The committee's latest report also raises concerns about ocean pollution from synthetic fibres from clothing. Research from the University of Plymouth has shown a single washing machine load can release 700,000 fibres to wastewater.

Up to 90% of garment workers are paid below the National Minimum Wage, do not have employment contracts, and are subject to intense and arbitrary work practices, the committee was told by the British Retail Consortium. Meanwhile the global fashion industry produced more CO2 emissions than international flights and maritime shipping combined in 2015, according to a submission from the Institute of Mechanical Engineers.

The committee expects to invite some of the biggest retailers into Parliament for further questioning from November.

John McNally, SNP MP for Falkirk, is a member of the Environmental Audit Committee. He said: ""You probably wouldn't consider that so many microplastics would be in the clothes you buy. But we need to find out more about the fashion industry and its sustainability. There is a lot of waste as well as a lot of water and chemicals being used in the industry.

""But even calling these companies to appear before MPs could have an impact. Sometimes it only takes one manufacturer or designer to take a lead,"" he said.

MPs request for companies to look more closely at the environmental and social impact of the clothes and shoes they sell was welcomed by Friends of the Earth.

The charity said its own research had shown clothes washing in the UK generates around 4,000 tonnes of plastic microfibre pollution every year – of which 1,600 tonnes could be ending up in our rivers and estuaries.

Public concern about the issue of plastic pollution has been high since the recent BBC series Blue Planet II aired. But a spokeswoman said only 45 per cent of the public know that new clothing can often be made from, or contain, plastic.

Friends of the Earth plastics campaigner Emma Priestland said: “Clothing firms must come clean about their impact on the environment.

“Clothes washing generates thousands of tonnes of plastic microfibre pollution every year – much of which ends up in our rivers and estuaries, where it can enter the food chain.

“The fashion industry must do far more to reduce the significant damage it does to our planet. And if it doesn’t, the government must make them.”

Friends of the Earth is urging retailers to find out which are the most polluting fabrics - and find solutions to stop them shedding microplastic pollution.

The environmental campaign group is also calling on the public to embrace ‘slow fashion’ rather than fast fashion; and buy fewer, better quality items made with sustainable material"
"Climate protesters are planning to blockade the main routes in and out of Dover on the day after Brexit to deepen any disruption to Britain’s food imports.

Activists say their demonstrations on major roads from the port will “cause major delays but nothing critical”, and will “highlight the need for emergency action” on the climate and ecological crisis.

But news of the plans by Extinction Rebellion organisers on Saturday 30 March was met with an immediate backlash from supporters, who warned that delaying food supplies was unfair and risked turning the public against them.

There are already fears that Brexit could disrupt imports and exports of many goods if Britain leaves the European Union (EU) without a deal.

Half the UK’s food arrives through Dover and Folkestone, and in spring around 90 per cent of lettuces, 80 per cent of tomatoes and 70 per cent of soft fruit is sourced from or delivered via the EU.

On social media, the campaigners said: “While newspapers resound with predictions of empty supermarket shelves as a result of Brexit, this is nothing compared to the misery of climate crisis-induced famine and hunger. The Dover block will highlight the extreme vulnerability of British people to food insecurity and underline the need for government to take emergency action on the climate and ecological crisis.”

They said the blockade would be non-violent and was unconnected to Brexit.

“There is no doubt this will be a controversial action but rest assured, the Dover blockade will not stop medicine and food supplies getting through,"" they added. ""This is a symbolic one-day blockage.

“It will cause major delays, but nothing critical. Its purpose is to tell to the public and government to wake up; very soon we could have food supply collapse and medicine scarcity because of climate breakdown.”

The Extinction Rebellion movement, whose activists are prepared to be arrested in mass civil disobedience protests, is also planning international demonstrations next month to try to force world leaders to treat climate and ecological breakdown as an emergency.

It will cause major delays but nothing critical – its purpose is to tell to the public and government to wake up Extinction Rebellion

Organisers insisted they had no political view on Brexit, adding: “There will be no food on a dead planet, only dead people.”

Supporter Lois Brooks warned the blockade could prove crippling to crop growers abroad, and Jonathan Griffiths warned it was a “massive mistake”.

He said: “If Brexit goes ahead as scheduled, Dover is likely to be in chaos regardless of this action. I think that XR acting to worsen this and the likely food/essentials shortages the UK will experience is a very bad idea.""

But another supporter said one day of action would have little impact on food supplies.

Organisers have issued three demands, including the creation of a citizens’ assembly to oversee policy changes to halt carbon emissions."
"MADRID (Reuters) - A cross-party group of British lawmakers recommended on Tuesday that brands and retailers in the fashion industry should pay a penny per garment to fund better clothing waste collection following an eight-month inquiry into the sector.

The British buy more clothes per person than any other country in Europe, the report published as a result of the inquiry noted, while around 300,000 tons of textile waste are sent to landfill or incinerators in the UK every year.

The inquiry, the first of its kind carried out at parliamentary level worldwide, coincides with growing public awareness of waste and its environmental impact.

The fashion industry is big business in Britain, worth 32 billion pounds ($41 billion) in 2017 and employing 890,000 people in retail, manufacturing, brands and fashion design in the country.

But charities, scientists and academics raised concerns during the inquiry that fast fashion - an accelerated business model that sees increased numbers of new collections every year, often at low prices - was unsustainable.

“‘Fast fashion’ means we over-consume and under-use clothes,” said Environmental Audit Committee Chair Mary Creagh, who is also a Member of Parliament. “Fashion retailers must take responsibility for the clothes they produce.”

Aside from the penny charge to fund better waste collection, the committee called on the government to implement tax reforms to reward companies that design products with less environmental impact and to favor reuse, repair and recycling of garments.

It also recommended lessons to design, make and mend clothes should be on the school curriculum, while sales taxes on repair services should be reduced.

“The government must act to end the era of throwaway fashion by incentivizing companies that offer sustainable designs and repair services,” said Creagh."
"Voices Is African fashion ready for the world?

The country of origin is not often considered when purchasing clothing, unless we’re searching for internationally acclaimed luxury that comes from Italy or France. These European labels are globally appealing because of their promoted heritage of crafting and the legacy of their designers – including the French Coco Chanel, Hubert de Givenchy and Christian Louboutin, and Italian Gianni Versace and Giorgio Armani – whose brands have stood the test of time.

It’s unfortunate that this doesn’t often hold true for African designers who have succeeded in the global fashion industry. African fashion is viewed as costume clothing that reminisces on a historical era that no longer has a place. African traditional wear is saved for special occasions and has little influence on our daily choices of clothing.

Nevertheless African designers have strived to transform these traditional clothing concepts into modern trends, but their creativity occupies a niche space with insufficient growth. Since colonialism, Africa has undergone significant fashion changes, the most visible being the judgemental manner in which we control women’s garment choices. In an essay published in Fashioning Africa: Power and the Politics of Dress, Andrew Ivaska considers the adoption, and arguable creation, of the mini skirt in 1960s Tanzania. The mini skirt unfolded wide debate on nationalism and cultural unity, despite the introduction of the more modest kitenge wrap during this same period.

African fashion is viewed as costume clothing that reminisces on a historical era that no longer has a place.

While we have embraced Western styles, we still view African fashion as a symbol of pan-African unity. But when we explore the meanings of unity that we have imposed on traditional African garments, we should equally consider the meanings we have imposed on Western trends. Clothing represents our individual identity as well as our collective sense of self. Culture establishes our social ideals, and we use clothing as a method of association.



Aranda Textile Mills manufactures traditional Basotho and initiation blankets but its legacy is rooted in Italian crafting. This dissemination of African cultures is skewed towards European models of production, and a shortage of investment into black entrepreneurs compels us to continually embrace Western invention. But when we deem these Western standards as those for Africa, we perpetuate a cycle that deems all things African as less than.

China is an example of a country that built its economy on manufacturing and clothing production, and subsequently impacted on fashion supply chains around the world. Despite becoming experts in mass production of Western clothing, their burgeoning fashion industry remains largely influenced by their own heritage. The Chinese are neither traditional nor modern; their sense of identity is unique and provides a valuable selling point for their designers. Africa has the potential to do the same by understanding the evolution of African styles.



China is the largest luxury consumer market in the world. Millennials there are considered to be intensely brand conscious and are projected to account for 45% of global luxury sales by 2025. And in the age of the internet these consumers are well informed. To maintain their growth, luxury brands have been incorporating Chinese aesthetics into their clothing and accessories – with heavy branding during Chinese New Year. This is a political marker of Chinese spending power, which now has influence on international brand identities.

China is an example of a country that built its economy on manufacturing and clothing production, and subsequently impacted on fashion supply chains around the world.

African fashion can also make a bold political statement. It embraces our history of colour, texture and symbolism in an amalgamation of modern trends, which is particularly meaningful now, as the industry undergoes a shift towards sustainability. As the world looks to Africa as the next destination for clothing production and consumption, we have the responsibility to promote the uniqueness of Africa’s knowledge systems for innovation.

Africa’s history of exploitation has tainted the value that we place on our skills and indigenous knowledge. South Africa is considered uncompetitive in the fashion industry because of our concern about social sustainability – born of our history. Extensive poverty and the wide wealth gap have propelled us towards policy that regulates minimum wages and promotes investment into self-sufficiency.

Africa remains a continent driven by the success of small to medium enterprises that employ 77% of the population. Markets for clothing, food and other household items are the norm. This shows an economy that rewards the creation of value, and the fashion industry is a distinct area for growing African ownership.

Africa’s history of exploitation has tainted the value that we place on our skills and indigenous knowledge.

The aim of African fashion is to take pride in our collective and individual identities. Africa is a continent that instils solidarity and respect for the land, resources and people. It provides an innovative model for sustainability that is able to bestow new luxury narratives that brands made in France and Italy have dominated.

Understanding history and assigning scientific reasoning to indigenous knowledge are the foundation for any society to evolve. The fashion industry is influential in spreading these new perspectives and rising African aspirations within the global market. Africa is able to achieve this through the promotion of sustainable small-scale farming, investing in handcrafted products and appreciating the design houses that specialise in what it means to be African.

It is up to us to redefine fashion through a modern made-in-Africa narrative – where resources are valued for their ability to not only create wealth but also share it equally. Supporting modern African fashion dismantles traditional perspectives that subscribe Africa’s identity to one of assimilation and hardship. Africa’s potential in the global fashion marketplace is only as great as our ability to understand ourselves through our own lens of diversity, and stand out.

"Walk into a coffee shop with £5 and you will be doing well to walk out with two hot drinks, let alone change.

But take that £5 into the world of fashion, and it’s an altogether different situation. You could, for instance, pick up five of the new £1 black bikinis from online retailer Missguided, one of a plethora of websites offering High Street fashion at rock-bottom prices.

The item in question — a flimsy string affair, in black — is available in sizes 4 to 24, but in a marketing ploy the retailer is only selling 1,000 of the sets each day.

‘Introducing the £1 bikini, a one-off item to celebrate ten years of empowering women to look and feel good without breaking the bank,’ declared the retailer. ‘It cost us more to produce than £1 and we’ve absorbed the costs so we can offer it at an incredible price as a gift to you, our babes.’

Sadly for Missguided, the response was less gratitude, more horror.

Beth Hale investigated the sustainability of fast fashion and celebrity-driven throwaway culture, after Missguided is slammed for selling a £1 bikini (pictured)

‘Wow, a £1 bikini. That is wrong on so many levels,’ wrote one Twitter user, while over on Instagram, the brand’s post (with accompanying picture of model wearing the bikini) was greeted by a barrage of criticism.

‘While I’m sure a £1 bikini is tempting, it encourages overconsumption which has been proven harmful to the planet. In addition, there’s no way this is ethically produced at that price. Where are your clothes being made? What are the conditions under which your workers are labouring? Please inform your customers of the true cost,’ said one commenter.

‘Absolutely no shame,’ wrote another.

Perhaps predictably at that price, the limited edition bikini keeps selling out — but there’s no shortage of cut-price alternatives for the hordes of young women looking to emulate the stars of Love Island. (Missguided partnered with the ITV show last year, while rival bargain store I Saw It First is this year’s retail sponsor.)

A huge industry caters to millennials looking for a ‘fast fashion’ fix. In the click of a button, a trend-conscious young woman can buy a garment that will arrive within days, and pay so little she can happily wear it only once.

A search of such online retailers this week — Boohoo, Missguided, Pretty Little Thing, Shein, even established names such as H&M and New Look — revealed dresses costing as little as £4, camisole tops for £2.99 and a pair of flip-flops costing 90p.

There is also a growing outcry about the environmental cost of a celebrity-driven (even Taylor Swift has worn Missguided) throwaway fashion culture.

For in all likelihood, many of those £1 bikinis and £4 dresses will end up discarded at the back of the wardrobe or in the bin after just a handful of outings.

The Government recently rejected recommendations that there should be a tax on fast fashion to help fund recycling, Pictured: Pretty Little Thing's £4 crop top

Meanwhile a new crop of digital brands, who use Instagram and Facebook as their shopfront and churn out clothes as fast as they can, are accelerating the fast fashion cycle.

Orsola de Castro is the co-founder of Fashion Revolution, a global campaign to promote more transparent and sustainable fashion. She says: ‘A £1 bikini is just the strongest visualisation of when an industry is promising something it’s not delivering. It almost feels like a slap in the face to me, it’s tempting people to do something quite bad for the environment, and doing it openly.’

The environmental costs that Orsola talks about have been well documented, notably when the House of Commons environmental audit committee published a report, Fixing Fashion: Clothing Consumption And Sustainability, in February. The committee’s recommendations based on that report included introducing a ‘fast fashion tax’ of 1p per item to help fund recycling of the mountain of cheap clothing thrown away every year. It is no small irony that on Monday — just as the £1 bikini was launching — the Government rejected those recommendations.

In 2016, British consumers purchased more than 1.1 million tonnes of clothing — up from 950,000 in 2012. Women have four times as many clothes in their wardrobes today as they did in 1980.

According to the Institution of Mechanical Engineers the global fashion industry produced more CO2 emissions than international flights and maritime shipping combined in 2015, pictured: Shein's £3.99 cami

One survey found 33 per cent of women consider clothes ‘old’ after a couple of wears, so it should come as no surprise to find around 350,000 tonnes of clothes, with an estimated value of £140 million, are said to go into landfill in the UK each year.

While clothing comes sixth on the list of household spending, it’s fourth in terms of its impact on the environment — below housing, transport and food.

Experts say it’s an environmental and ethical minefield. The total carbon footprint of clothing in use in the UK was 26.2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2016 — up from 24 million tonnes in 2012 — and if the trend continues it is feared the industry could account for a quarter of the world’s carbon budget by 2050.

In 2015 the global fashion industry produced more CO2 emissions than international flights and maritime shipping combined, according to the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

Cotton is a thirsty crop, draining water resources, while polyester, made from oil-based polymers, has twice its carbon footprint.

Then there is the hugely damaging impact of plastic on marine life.

The Daily Mail has led the way in highlighting the scourge of global plastic pollution with its Turn The Tide On Plastic campaign, and it’s a sad fact that billions of polluting particles are being flushed into our waterways every time we do a wash.

Boohoo have seen a sharp rise in profits and revenue this year, pictured: Boohoo's £4 dress

Then, of course, there is the human cost of workers around the globe working in terrible conditions, often paid a pittance to make the cheap clothes worn by many.

Two years ago, Channel 4’s Dispatches programme exposed a cheap clothing scandal in which factory bosses in Leicester said they were in direct competition with Bangladesh and China. An undercover reporter was paid less than half the national living wage in three factories (£3 an hour in one) to pack and press dresses for High Street stores. Nevertheless, the fast fashion trend has, to date, proved a business winner.

Earlier this year, Boohoo unveiled a sharp rise in profit and revenue for the year. The firm saw overall revenue rocket by 48 per cent to £856.9 million in the year to February 28, while pre-tax profit jumped 38 per cent to £59.9 million.

Of its bikini, Missguided, which has said it had a ‘challenging year’, stressed the garment cost more than £1 to make and it had ‘absorbed’ costs to be able to offer the item as a gift.

‘There has been no compromise with this bikini — it is sourced to the same high standards as all of our other products,’ it said.

Tim Cooper, professor of sustainable design and consumption at Nottingham Trent University, said some brands — such as ASOS — were showing a greater interest in addressing the issues.

Environmental audit committee chair Mary Creagh MP, believes eco-conscious shoppers are realising that the cost of fast fashion could end up costing us the Earth, pictured: Missguided's £12 mini dress

But of fast fashion: ‘They are throwaway garments for young people who don’t want to be on Facebook in the same item twice, clothes for going out are becoming throwaway items.’

And the future? ‘We can carry on pouring clothes into landfill, but we will pay the price in due course in one way or another,’ he says. ‘The Government should intervene in this discussion.’

Environmental audit committee chair Mary Creagh MP said she was heartened by the backlash against the budget swimwear. ‘I think this shows the era of fast fashion is coming to an end, and not before time. The backlash shows that the eco-conscious shopper is realising that bikinis that cost less than their morning coffee are going to end up costing us the Earth.’

‘We heard a lot from brands [on the committee] about the steps that they were taking to reduce their environmental and social impact, but this shows it’s business as usual in the fashion world and people are getting very rich, very quickly online from business products that are fundamentally wrong.

‘The £5 dress, the £2 T-shirt, the £1 bikini — the question is how much is the person making it getting paid, how much is the fabric being used costing and what is the real environmental cost of that item?

H&M who have reduced their CO2 emissions by 11 per cent, hope to ensure all packaging used on clothes is made of 100 per cent recycled or sustainably sourced materials by 2030, Pictured: H&M's £2.99 top

‘I think people are now saying they have had enough and that an entire generation of consumers are turning their backs on fast fashion.’

Boohoo, which owns PrettyLittleThing, said: ‘We are committed to continuing to drive improvements and take our environmental responsibilities extremely seriously.’

Boohoo has a number of sustainability initiatives in place.

Primark said: ‘We sell our products at lower prices because we make a lower profit margin, buy in bulk, and keep our costs down.

‘Everyone should have access to good quality fashionable clothing at a price they can afford. Not everyone can afford expensive clothing. Our products are made in factories where care and respect is given to workers’ rights and the environment.’

H&M has reduced the CO2 emissions from its operations by 11 per cent. It is aiming to ensure all packaging used on clothes is made of 100 per cent recycled or sustainably sourced materials by 2030.

New Look declined to comment.

Missguided has also joined the Ethical Trading Initiative.

Nitin Passi, the CEO and founder of Missguided, said in written evidence to the House of Commons’ environmental audit committee: ‘While we are a “fast fashion” retailer, we do not operate at the discount end of the market.’

And: ‘Most of our ranges — over 75 per cent — have a full-price of between £10 and £35.’

Shein and I Saw It First were approached for comment."

"A cross-party group of MPs produced a report on the impact of so-called fast fashion (Anthony Upton/PA)

‘Out of step’ Government accused over bid to crack down on fast fashion BelfastTelegraph.co.uk A series of proposals aimed at ending the era of throwaway fashion have been rejected by the Government, a cross-party group of MPs has said. https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/uk/out-of-step-government-accused-over-bid-to-crack-down-on-fast-fashion-38229264.html https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/uk/article38229263.ece/e8ef4/AUTOCROP/h342/bpanews_068d756d-52b8-4478-afe4-3be5ed134659_1

Email

A series of proposals aimed at ending the era of throwaway fashion have been rejected by the Government, a cross-party group of MPs has said.

The Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) accused the Government of being “out of step with the public” and claimed urgent action is needed to make retailers take responsibility for the waste they create.

In a report, the MPs recommended a raft of measures, including charging fashion producers a penny per garment to raise £35 million for better clothing collection and recycling – but all proposals were rejected, the group said.

The Government said action is already being taken to deal with the issue of so-called fast fashion and plans are in the pipeline for the future.

Labour’s Mary Creagh, chairwoman of the committee, said: “Fashion producers should be forced to clear up the mountains of waste they create.

“The Government has rejected our call, demonstrating that it is content to tolerate practices that trash the environment and exploit workers, despite having just committed to net zero emission targets.

“The Government is out of step with the public, who are shocked by the fact that we are sending 300,000 tonnes of clothes a year to incineration or landfill.

“Ministers have failed to recognise that urgent action must be taken to change the fast fashion business model which produces cheap clothes that cost the earth.”

The committee’s report, entitled Fixing Fashion: Clothing Consumption And Sustainability, was published in February and recommended “clear economic incentives” to encourage retailers to “do the right thing”.

It suggested the Government reform taxation to reward companies that design products with lower environmental impacts and penalise those that do not.

The MPs proposed extending the tax on virgin plastics, due to come into force in 2022, to synthetic textile products to encourage the use of recycled fibres. And they called on ministers to explore how they can support hiring, swapping or subscription clothes services.

The group also urged the Government to change the law to require companies to perform due diligence checks across their supply chains to ensure their products are made without child or forced labour.

They pointed to labour exploitation in the UK, and said the “Made in the UK” label should mean workers are paid at least the minimum wage.

Ms Creagh said: “We presented the Government with the evidence that it has failed to stop garment workers in this country being criminally underpaid, despite its claim that the number of national minimum wage inspectors has increased.

“The public has a right to know that the clothes they buy are not produced by children or forced labour; however, the Government hasn’t accepted our recommendations on the Modern Slavery Act to force fashion retailers to increase transparency in their supply chains.

“This is plain wrong. The EAC will be closely monitoring steps that the Government claims it is taking to address the problems exposed in our report.”

The Government addressed each of the committee’s recommendations in its response and pointed to its voluntary Sustainable Clothing Action Plan (Scap), which sets industry targets for reducing carbon emissions, water and waste.

Fashion producers should be forced to clear up the mountains of waste they create Mary Creagh

“The Scap along with other actions in our Resources and Waste Strategy reflect the Government’s plans in relation to the sector,” it said.

“The Resources and Waste Strategy also outlines our plans to review and consult on measures such as extended producer responsibility (EPR) for five new waste streams, including textiles, so that producers are responsible for the full net costs of managing their products at the end of their useful life, encouraging greater reuse and recycling.”

It said it had “noted” the committee’s recommendation to charge producers one penny per garment and would consider it as they developed the EPR schemes.

A Government spokesman said: “It simply isn’t true to say we are not accepting the Committee’s recommendations – we are tackling the environmental impacts of ‘fast fashion’ and much of what the committee would like to achieve is already covered by government policy.

“In our landmark Resources and Waste Strategy we will take forward measures including developing proposals and consulting on extended producer responsibility (EPR) and higher product standards for textiles. This would make producers responsible for the full cost of managing and disposing of their products after they’re no longer useful.

“Through the ground-breaking Modern Slavery Act, the UK was the first country to require businesses to report on the steps they have taken to tackle modern slavery in their own business and throughout their supply chains.

“The Prime Minister announced last week that the Government will create a new central online reporting service for modern slavery statements to give consumers the ability to make more informed choices about where they shop.”

"U.S. consumers are eating more beef, more than they have in a decade. But a byproduct of this carnivorous hankering is piling up, unloved and unwanted. Shoppers who once coveted leather jackets and shoes are instead scooping up cheaper, synthetic alternatives, reflecting a growing ambivalence toward this former staple of American closets.

The glut of cowhides has caused prices to plummet, rendering many worthless. And just as the American love for meat has caught on around the globe, so too has the abandonment of leather, from clothing to car seats. Hides are even starting to go to landfills while the smaller leather processors are going out of business.

Just five years ago, prices soared after a drought shrank the U.S. herd to a six-decade low. Leather outpriced itself, forcing shoe and clothing designers to cut the material from their products. Combine that with the rise of athleisure, the growing popularity of vegan clothing, and industry focus on creating more sustainable fashions, and one can see why demand hasn’t come back.

Cattle hides, an obligatory byproduct of beef and dairy consumption, will be around as long as Americans like cheeseburgers, steaks, and ice cream. And while cattle ranchers and dairy producers have been under pressure from declining milk demand and dairy alternatives, the rise of substitutes, including plant-based burgers, has yet to dent America’s taste for the real thing.

With piles of 100-pound cowhides accumulating all over the country, unused and unsold, leather makers are warning of a looming commercial disaster. Hides have often accounted for 50% of the value of the animal’s byproducts, and byproducts can be 10% of a steer’s value or more. Hides from cows, which are lower quality than those of steers, have fallen to only about 5% of the value of all byproducts—worth less than tongues and cheek meat. It’s not even 1% of the value of a live cow.

“There are hides with no value,” said Joe Brannan, manager of export sales at Twin City Hide, a processor based in South St. Paul, Minnesota. “We’re throwing a natural product in the garbage.”

Demand from high-end fashion

There’s still plenty of demand for high-quality leather—the type used in pricey handbags or high-end sofas—but that’s just one part of the industry. Most animals don’t have perfect hides, and many are branded. Older animals that have weathered the elements on pastures for years have skin marred by imperfections.

Twin City Hide has had to stop taking lower-quality hides from smaller beef companies, since the cost of processing them is more than it can recoup. In the first five months of this year, the company saw a 27% drop in production, with 20% of its current inventory sitting in warehouses—worthless.

“There’s no one bidding, no one trying to buy them,” said Brannan, who has worked in the hide business since 1976.

According to Hidenet, a leather markets research firm, a hide from a branded cow went for as little as $4 the week of July 15, down from as much as $81 just five years ago. Vera Dordick, chief executive officer and publisher of Hidenet, added that it’s not just the U.S. industry that’s suffering.

“It’s a worldwide crisis,” Dordick said. “Some people used to say, ‘We haven’t buried any hides yet.’ Now they can’t say that.”

Before the bottom fell out, imperfect hides could be turned into small leather goods, such as cheap handbags. A finishing treatment, like a print, a coat of polyurethane, or buffing the hide into suede, could smooth over rough spots, said Stephen Sothmann, president of the Washington-based U.S. Hide, Skin and Leather Association, an industry lobbying group.

Drawbacks of leather alternatives

But thanks in part to synthetic fabrics, that’s no longer the case. So-called fast-fashion and athleisure—clothing which contains no leather at all—now dominate American retail. And for those who still favor the look of leather, imitations have gotten more sophisticated and can breathe like the real thing, said John Hochstein, vice president of hide and leather sales for National Beef Packing Co., one of the four major U.S. meatpackers.

Many synthetic leathers are made of petrochemicals, which raises an environmental dilemma for some consumers. So now, shoppers are flocking to eco-friendly faux-leathers made from fruit peels and recycled fabrics.

As long as it doesn’t contain leather or other animal products, it can be described as vegan. Such clothing, accessories, and footwear saw a 54% increase at U.S. retail stores in the first half of 2019, according to Helen Palmer, director of materials at trend forecaster WGSN. Shoes saw the biggest gains, while the decline of leather footwear—which traditionally used about half of the world’s cattle hides—has been especially pronounced.

“Clothing brands are trying to get in line with a more ecologically conscious, younger buyer,” Palmer said. And there’s some star power behind this latest trend: Meghan Markle has been spotted wearing Veja sneakers, which are made from recycled plastic and corn.

Vegan clothing aside, the choice between buying fossil fuel-based yoga pants or the skin of mammals raises another question: Which is worse for the environment?

Huantian Cao, a professor of fashion and apparel studies at the University of Delaware, said both have drawbacks. Petrochemical-based synthetics have the same sustainability problems as plastic, and they may even be worse. Every time you wash those stretchy pants, plastic microbeads and microfibers flow down the drain, into rivers and oceans.

Leather's environmental footprint

While leather is a natural material, it’s derived from cattle farming. That industry generates methane emissions from cows and waste-filled runoff. Most U.S. hides, meanwhile, are exported to countries with less strict environmental regulations, where they’re tanned with harsh chemicals including chromium sulphate.

Even worse, this process uses a lot of water, said Cao, who also runs a sustainable apparel initiative. There’s ongoing research to try to find more environmentally friendly tanning methods, like using plant extracts and enzymes. But currently, he said, the chemical creates a better product.

Humans have been tanning hides to make leather since prehistoric times, using them for clothing and shelter. Byproducts of the cattle carcass such as bones, blood, and fat end up in soap, fertilizer, gelatin, medicines, and other products. But leather has always been the most prized byproduct.

National Beef’s Hochstein called environmental concerns about leather production “a ridiculous mindset.” The idea that turning hides into leather is bad for the environment “is so far from the truth, you have to laugh at it—but then you have to cry,” he said. “It shows how far people are removed from the food supply chain, that they don’t understand the value of raw materials.”

“A leather shoe isn’t going to end up in a million microbits in the ocean killing fish,” said Sothmann, the industry lobbyist. “It’s a natural material, and because we are dairy and meat consumers, we have an ethical need to produce these products as well.”

The industry is going to have to promote itself if it wants demand to come back, he said. While most processors ship their hides overseas, the trade war started by U.S. President Donald Trump has hurt that export market as well. U.S. leather makers recently received money from the administration to help offset the negative effect of tariffs.

Buffeted by this maelstrom of changing tastes and environmental awareness, an industry older than the nation is increasingly at risk.

Lowell Carson, owner of the Double L Ranch in Altamont, N.Y., who’s been working in the meatpacking industry for more than 30 years, said the leather business is in the worst shape he’s ever seen. He used to get $70 for his hides, he said. Now he’s giving some away for free and soon may have to send them to landfills, where he already ships his lambskins.

On the other side of the country, in Boise, Idaho, Southwest Hide Co. said it hasn’t made a profit in two years. As a result, the leather processor has been forced to cut production and hide purchases. The company handles millions of hides a year, sourced from small to medium-size beef processors. Margins were a few dollars apiece, so with the cutbacks, tens of millions of dollars are being lost.

“We have to tell our suppliers, ‘Listen, we can’t take this anymore,’ ” said Jay Jensen, the company’s director of international sales. “That leaves them in a situation where they have to figure out what to do with them.”

"Now it’s December, we can officially start looking back at what has gone down in 2018, and it’s been quite a year for fashion.

Ecommerce site Lyst has compiled search views, social media mentions and more to get a full picture of what the year in style terms has looked like.

These are some of the biggest trends we’ve been obsessed with in 2018…

1. Meme fashion

2018 really has been the year of silly fashion. Trends you think won’t take off – like Jacquemus’ ludicrously large hat or Gucci’s couture balaclavas – go viral, and this converts into sales. The fashion industry has stopped taking itself quite so seriously, and instead has been embracing meme culture and the LOLs it can bring.

2. Nineties and Noughties inspirations

Nostalgia is seductive, and for 2018, the decades we’ve been emulating are the Nineties and Noughties. Big brands clocked on to this early and started reviving some of their past iconic styles – like the Dior saddle bag, brought back with the fanfare of a huge Instagram influencer campaign.

It’s not just people sporting designer garms who have been loving these eras – we’ve all been digging out our old gold hoops, scrunchies and cropped hoodies.

3. Dad fashion

According to Lyst, views of ‘Dad’ fashion increased by 439% this year. It seems all things ugly have really taken off, and arguably started with sneakers – chunky, orthopaedic and insanely popular.

From there, fashion’s obsession with ugliness has expanded into all manner of clothing – think fleeces your grandpa would be happy wearing, but at a distinctly higher price point.

Balenciaga reached peak ‘dadcore’ in its June menswear show, inspired by “young dads in the park with their kids.” This manifested itself into fathers holding toddlers and walking down the runway in sweaters.

4. Sport luxe

Athleisure wear isn’t new; by now we’re all more than happy to turn up to brunch in yoga pants. However, what is new is how invested luxury brands now are.

Apparently 62% more items on Lyst were labelled as sportswear this year, and we’re also willing to pay more for our favourite items, with the average price of leggings increasing by 60%.

Just take the latest Alexander Wang collection, which was full of couture bike shorts and rugby shirts.

5. Neon

As with many trends on this list, we can attribute a large part of its popularity to the Kardashian-Jenner clan. Highlighter colours have been all the rage, from bright pinks and greens to fluorescent yellows.

One of the most coveted items was Prada’s large clutch, which comes in bang-on-trend bright green or pink.

6. Plastic

If you’re into painful shoes, no doubt you’ve tried plastic heels. Again, this is a trend beloved by the likes of Kim Kardashian West, but it’s a controversial one – they’re likely a hotbed of bacteria, as there’s literally no space for your feet to breathe.

7. Artsy

This fad is one part high fashion and one part GCSE art. Customisation has become particularly big this year, with suits and bags scrawled with sketches and words.

8. Cowboy

Cheesiness is everything with this trend. Western cowboy clothing allows you to be really flamboyant, experimenting with everything from fringed jackets to those iconic boots.

Sure, you might not be riding a horse any time soon, but Western motifs proved to be very stylish this year. If you were feeling particularly brave, you could level up and add a cowboy hat to your look.

9. Pre-Raphaelite prairie

High necks, puffy sleeves and long skirts might sound more like modest fashion, but designers have been indulging in everything reserved this year.

Brands like Erdem and The Vampire’s Wife have realised, every so often you want to be a bit more sartorially conservative, and have supplied the dresses to match. This is a very whimsical trend, focusing on femininity and floatiness.

10. Sustainable

(Chris Jackson/PA)

2018 has been something of a turning point for fashion, with the industry starting to consider what impact it has on the environment, and how this can be minimised.

As a result, more sustainable brands have become hugely popular. We even saw the Duchess of Sussex wearing the “it” Veja sneakers during her trip to Australia, which are known for being eco-conscious.

"If you've ever wanted to dress like the street style stars of Instagram who are always strutting around Fashion Weeks in achingly cool designer ensembles, now you can - even if you're on a budget.

The Resolution Store is the secret designer fashion shopping site featuring labels from high ends labels such as D&G and Cartier, as worn by popular fashion bloggers and influencers.

While most items are second hand, the site only stocks clothing that's in good condition and some clothing is still good as new with the label on.

It means you could snap up a designer dress for a fraction of the price, such as a white lace D&G number that originally cost £1,350 for £498.

For those with a more modest budget, there's also plenty of purse-friendly options to choose from, including labels such as Karen Millen, Linea and Levis.

This Balenciaga, which is worn but in good condition will set you back £250. A brand new Coach trench coat with tags is £240, but would have cost you £475 to buy in store

The site was set up by brand consultants Alicia Waite and Anna Sutton and making designer labels accessible to the average person is only a small part of the site's mission.

More important is its goal to help reduce waste, given that more than 300,000 tonnes of textiles go into landfill every year in the UK alone.

‘The idea for The Resolution Store was born through a desire to do something about the shocking statistics surrounding waste, in particular, created by the clothing industry,’ the founders explained.

‘A fashion garment in the UK lasts an average of 3.3 years before the garment is discarded. Extending the life of a garment from as little as nine months can decrease its environmental impact by 20-30 per cent.’

These second hand Jimmy Choo pink suede sandals are on sale for £135. A good as new Cartier clutch that originally cost £2,120 can be yours for £850

In addition to giving unwanted garments new life, all deliveries are courtesy of RePack, a reusable packaging service called RePack.

Clothes that need cleaning before going on sale are refreshed by an eco-friendly garment cleaning service.

And the site has also partnered with Traid so that any unsold items are absorbed into the up-cycling market.

An Isabel Marant Etoile top in good condition can be snapped up for £135

Additionally, 20 per cent of profits go to Labour Behind the Label, a campaign group for better working conditions for garment workers around the world.

Shoppers will find designer pieces that have come from the wardrobes of fashionistas such as Camille Charrière, Lucy Williams, Pandora Sykes and Laura Jackson.

The pair decided to target influencer wardrobes as they spotted an area where a lot of clothing that's given away for free in return for Instagram snaps was going to waste.

The potential waste ‘bothered’ them, Alicia told Elle.

‘Just because the gift is for free, and may generate more sales, doesn’t mean it hasn’t taken a huge amount of work - as well as water, energy, natural (or non-natural) fibres,' she explained.

'And it really bothers me that they might end up languishing at the back of someone’s wardrobe unwanted, when they could be having a life elsewhere.’

"As London Fashion Week kicks off, it’s an opportunity to ogle some incredible designs and find out what the latest trends are.

However, it’s also a chance to take stock of how eco-friendly the fashion industry is. There’s no denying it has a problem with sustainability, and considering the popularity of fast fashion, it can be easy to feel, as a consumer, somewhat detached from the environmental issues. After all, you’re just buying another t-shirt, right?

Science and natural history presenter at BBC Planet, Liz Bonnin, has teamed up with sustainable fashion brand Mother of Pearl to tackle these issues head on, and make sure sustainability is front and centre at LFW. For the occasion, they’ve created a capsule collection using eco-friendly methods, and will unveil a short film (which will be available to watch across BBC Earth social platforms), narrated by Bonnin, that delves into fashion’s impact on the planet.

We spoke to Bonnin and Mother of Pearl creative director Amy Powney to find out more about the fashion industry’s eco record, and what we can all do to help.

The fashion industry has a major impact on the environment

(BBC Studios/PA)

Bonnin is no stranger to discussing environmental issues facing the planet – last year she made BBC One documentary Drowning In Plastic. However, she is still shocked by the fashion industry’s impact – even if she’s not totally surprised.

“The facts and figures are harrowing with this particular industry,” she says. “But they’re harrowing with a lot of other industries contributing to our environmental crises, too.”

Both Bonnin and Powney agree the culture of fast fashion is a big contributor. “Fast fashion is a huge problem, and it’s just a matter of time [before] social media leaks the truth and for people to really start taking note,” says Powney.

According to a report from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, if nothing changes, the fashion industry could use up more than a quarter of the world’s carbon budget by 2050. Every year, it releases half a million tonnes of microfibres into the ocean – the equivalent of more than 50 billion plastic bottles.

It can be easy to feel detached from the fate of our clothes

When buying a new top online or picking up some trousers in your local shopping centre, thoughts of environmental sustainability are probably far from your mind.

For Bonnin, one of the most startling things she learned in making this documentary, is how little clothing features recycled material. “Less than 1% of the materials used to produce clothing are recycled – I always thought we were more responsible than that,” she says. “You’d think we’d be able to recycle more natural materials, like cotton – so how is it that less than 1% is recycled?”

It’s a good point, and makes you think: What do you actually know about what happens to your clothes after you throw them out? “We don’t think enough about how we take from the natural world and then how we dispose of it,” says Bonnin. “It’s so easy to think things are different, and to throw away things we use, thinking they go somewhere to be taken care of responsibly.”

Powney has been considering issues of sustainability and fashion since producing her graduate collection more than a decade ago. When asked why it’s taken so long for the industry to catch up with her, she pauses, then says: “The kindest answer is, a lot of people don’t know how complex it is and how bad it is. From a consumer point of view, people don’t relate fashion as having an environmental impact – they haven’t put the two together, and quite frankly, a lot of people in the industry don’t know either.”

It’s a case of being more mindful of how you shop

Amy Powney: “I’m a true believer in small things done by everyone being much more powerful than one person on their own” (Mother of Pearl/PA)

“There’s something incredibly empowering and joyful about taking responsibility for how you shop,” says Bonnin. “Whether you’re giving back to nature by wearing a garment and not dumping it, or buying less, there’s a feelgood factor which encourages us to act more responsibly.”

Helping the environment, even in your own small way, can make you feel great – but what can you actually do to contribute?

“It is a bit of a minefield,” notes Powney. “It’s still a bit complicated knowing exactly what to buy.” However, “shopping consciously is something that’s really important,” she explains.

“Before you buy something, ask yourself: Do you really want that piece? Do you feel emotionally engaged with it so you want to wear it again and again? If the answer’s ‘no’ you should maybe put it back on the rail.

“It’s finding that love again for your garment. I remember being a child and begging my mum for a party dress – you loved it, you stared at it, you couldn’t wait to wear it, and I think we need that back.”

It’s not always easy to shop ethically – the information on factors like supply chains are often quite hard to obtain, but you can still make an effort to shop consciously. Perhaps adopt the Marie Kondo method – if it doesn’t spark joy, is it really worth spending money on?

“If you do fall out of love with something or grow out of it, think about reselling, repurposing or repairing,” Powney advises, “even if throwing something in the bin is the easiest thing to do.”

This will have a knock-on effect on the industry

Powney believes we’re in a moment of real change. “Sustainability in fashion wasn’t a widely discussed topic – until now,” she says. “Consumers are waking up and asking where their products are coming from. There’s a movement towards that in general across the world, so fashion’s next.

“I do think there’s a really positive possibility for consumers to drive that demand, which fundamentally will make a lot of brands change [their ways].”

“To turn something around of this scale – how we consume and how we produce – does take time,” says Bonnin, but there’s hope. However, it’s clear we all need to act now – before it’s too late.

Mother of Pearl’s eco capsule collection, created alongside BBC Planet, will be available from June.

"Image copyright Zara Image caption Zara's white polka dot dresses have gone viral on Instagram

I am seeing spots. More specifically polka dots, on a white maxi dress. Three women have walked by me - all wearing the same identical dress - in the half hour I've been sitting outside this café. I know it's from Zara, I've tried it on, and now I'm seeing those spots everywhere.

It is the dress of the summer, another viral Zara fashion statement, complete with a dedicated Instagram account set up by fans.

Just one sign of how the Spanish clothing giant is bucking the trend of many of its struggling High Street competitors and posting record sales.

Considering the success and size of the company, it might be thought of as a bit of an enigma. It doesn't advertise, it does little marketing and its boss, who was named best performing chief executive in the world by a business magazine last year, has not given any big interviews, until now.

Pablo Isla recently laid out plans for Zara's future and said it was all about a digital and sustainable transformation. But is it possible for a company to be sustainable, when the entire business is about getting shoppers to buy as much fashion as possible?

'No contradiction'

Speaking at their campus-like headquarters in northern Spain, Pablo Isla, the chairman of Zara and its parent company Inditex, tackled the sustainability issue.

""There is no contradiction at all between sustainability and profitability of the company,"" he says.

Image copyright Zara

""In the next year, all our stores in the world will be efficient - this means their consumption of energy and water is significantly lower. If your energy consumption is 20% less, you have a return.""

In fact some of the key ways in which the business works helps with its sustainability goal. Mr Isla explains that Zara works with a ""low level of inventory"".

This helps the retailer minimise waste and avoid discounting huge amounts of clothing.

On my tour of the headquarters, I walk past rows of desks where staff are analysing instant data from Zara's store managers.

They use this information to decide what to make each week - Zara's factories will only make what they know will sell. Most of Zara's clothes are manufactured at its sites in Spain or in nearby Portugal, Morocco and Turkey.

'Long-term relations'

One of the key factories producing Zara's womenswear is just next to the head office. This way of working is all about speed, which allows Zara to get fresh trends into stores before their competitors.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Do companies like Zara have a responsibility to combat fast fashion?

But it hasn't always meant being able to keep a close eye on standards. Two years ago, some Zara customers in Turkey found notes in clothes from workers saying they hadn't been paid and asking for them to back calls for better working standards. When asked about it, Mr Isla says working with these suppliers was an ""evolution"".

He says ""the most important thing is the idea of long-term relations with our suppliers"" when it comes to keeping an eye on working conditions.

Fashion Revolution is an independent organisation which monitors where clothes come from and how ethical they are. They say Zara needs to provide more information about where their clothes are made to be held accountable for standards.

""Inditex, which owns Zara, remains one of the major fashion retailers that is dragging its feet on publishing a list of its manufacturers,"" says Fashion Revolution policy director Sarah Ditty.

""Other brands have published a list and proved that doing so doesn't hurt them competitively. ""

Recycled plastics

Back at headquarters, I wander through the pilot store built on-site - a perfectly-kept Zara shop where everything is in place - but there are no shoppers. This is where Zara test how everything should look and feel, from lighting to displays.

They are aiming to reach zero waste in store - all packaging is made from recyclable cardboard and plastic. Recycling is a big theme for the clothes too.

Image copyright Zara Image caption Zara has boxes in stores encouraging customers to donate clothes they don't wear

They have been working with the renowned US university MIT to develop ways of making fabric from recycled plastics. I take the opportunity to feel the texture of some of the latest recycled plastic clothes from their sustainable line. The cloth feels silky to the touch.

Mr Isla has committed to 100% of the cotton, linen, and polyester used by Zara - and all of its sister companies - being organic, sustainable, or recycled by 2025.

Sarah Ditty from Fashion Revolution says that while it is great to see Zara taking steps to incorporate more sustainable material into its ranges, it is essential action that all brands should be taking.

However, she highlights that the real issue is all about the sheer volume of clothes they make.

Inditex reported putting over 1.5 billion products on the market in 2017 alone. Even with more environmentally-friendly materials, producing that many items each year is unsustainable for our living planet.

How much clothing we buy is a marker of just how much the industry has grown and changed in a short space of time. The UK has the highest rate of consumption in Europe, at 27.6kg per person per year.

Customer decisions

Indeed, Zara has an enormous turnaround, fashion influencer Jasmine Jonas tells me.

""I feel confident walking into a Zara, [being] able to find something that will look good, fit well, and that I can afford. But across the board, demand for eco-conscience clothing is rising.""

It's not just Fashion Revolution - many campaigners say the only way to truly tackle sustainability in fashion is to make and sell less.

But how can that be a solution for Zara and Inditex if they want to keep those record-breaking sales?

Image copyright LightRocket / Getty Images Image caption Should shoppers buy less, or are retailers the problem, when it comes to sustainability?

""It's always the customers' decision of how much do they buy of each particular product,"" says Mr Isla.

""I think our responsibility as a company is taking care of manufacturing our products in a very sustainable way. Each customer, each person, is free to decide how much would he or she like to buy at any point in time, if this person wants to spend money going to a restaurant or buying clothes... this is the freedom that each person has.""

""Should I, shouldn't I?"" is the age-old changing room debate, but does it take on a new dimension if, as Pablo Isla says, it is ultimately in shoppers' hands to decide the crucial sustainability issue?

In the meantime, Zara says it will do what it can to keep the environmental conundrum for customers to a minimum."

The fashion industry is one of the biggest polluters in the world and a major contributor of greenhouse gases.

Parts of the industry have also been accused of breaching human rights and not paying workers enough.

But the latest Fashion Transparency Index has revealed some brands are beginning to show signs of improvement.

Campaign group Fashion Revolution looked at 200 labels' social and environmental policies.

It found the most transparent brands were Adidas, Reebok and Patagonia - they each scored 64% of the total points possible - followed by Esprit and H&M.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Adidas was ranked of the most transparent fashion brands

""We know anecdotally, that there's a sense of competition between brands to do better than their competitors, particularly between sports or luxury brands,"" Carry Somers, founder of Fashion Revolution told Radio 1 Newsbeat.

""But we do really have a long way to go, the average score is only 21%.""

In a statement on its website, H&M said: ""We believe being transparent - clear and open - about how and where our products are made, is an important part of helping us become more sustainable.

""The more we share, the more we learn, and the more we can identify the areas to focus on.""

While Fashion Revolution says it's good news that more brands are becoming more open by publishing their policies, it doesn't mean they're the most ethical or sustainable.

""What we need to see the brands doing is to disclose more about the outcomes of their polices and the tangible impacts they're having on the lives of their producers and environment,"" Carry Somers says.

""We have the right to know that the money we're spending with the brand isn't supporting human rights abuses and environmental degradation - transparency is the first step in making sure this takes place"".

The Index also looked at fashion's environmental impact.

It found that more than half (55%) of the 200 brands are publishing their annual carbon footprint on the company's own sites, but only 19.5% reveal carbon emissions in the supply chain - which is where more than half of the industry's emissions occur.

Exposing flaws

The Fashion Transparency Index started after the Rana Plaza factory collapsed in Bangladesh in 2013.

More than 1,100 garment workers died and hundreds more were injured.

Image copyright European Photopress Agency Image caption More than 1,100 workers were killed after the Rana Plaza factory collapsed

The disaster exposed poor safety standards and regulation, and raised questions over the responsibilities of the big retail brands given their push to keep prices as low as possible in an era of fast fashion.

'Fashion brands need to do better'

Not all brands are telling the public about their human rights and environmental policies, practices and impacts - five scored zero on the Index.

They included Eli Tahari, Jessica Simpson, Mexx, Tom Ford and Chinese menswear brand Youngor.

Another 10 brands revealed almost nothing (less than 2%), including Longchamp, Max Mara and New Yorker.

""There are still far too many big brands lagging behind,"" Fashion Revolution policy director and report author Sarah Ditty says.

""Major brands are disclosing very little information and data about their purchasing practices, which means that we still don't have visibility into what brands are doing to be responsible business partners to their suppliers.""

"The multitrillion-dollar business of fashion, with its complex and long supply chain, is worryingly vexed with problems contributing to climate change.

The fashion industry emits more greenhouse gas than all international flights and maritime shipping journeys combined , and it's estimated that a garbage truck's worth of clothing is either burned or sent to a landfill every second. On top of that, thanks to our powerful washing machines, our clothes pollute the ocean with microfibers equating to approximately 50 million plastic bottles each year.

Conversation and action around sustainability and climate change has been quiet and slow to come within the sector, but Monday marks another move toward collective change. A fashion industry charter for climate action was formally launched at this year's United Nations climate change conference, COP24, in Katowice, Poland.

Support for the new charter has come from high street retailers, luxury fashion houses and other suppliers within the sector. Stella McCartney, Burberry, Adidas and H&M Group are included in the list of 40 signatories.

Aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement, the new charter includes 16 principles and targets. The companies involved have committed to reducing their aggregate greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030 and they've agreed to prioritize low-carbon transportation suppliers and favor climate-friendly materials.

Stella McCartney, whose eponymous label is already a leading player in sustainable fashion, was one of the founding signatories. She announced her involvement in late November during Voices, a fashion industry conference staged in the English countryside, where she was also honored for her work in the sector.

Fashion's new vanguard

During an interview at the conference, she acknowledged the complexities of working sustainably and responsibly: ""There are millions of limitations from a design and creative point of view. There are millions of limitations from a sourcing and manufacturing point of view. But for me, all of those challenges are part of being a designer and part of being a businesswoman.""

McCartney called upon her peers in the industry to sign the charter, urging the industry to work together.

""It's a no-brainer but there has to be a collective conversation,"" she said. ""I think that's what's so powerful and exciting and promising about COP24.""

"Boohoo has dramatically u-turned on its pledge to ditch wool after announcing it would scrap the material for animal cruelty reasons.

The online fashion retailer faced a backlash after it announced it would be banning wool with one farmer branding it 'absurd'.

But in a recent statement the company has now announced it will be scrapping the initial plan to ban wool.

The statement said: 'Boohoo continues to assess all options as part of its ongoing commitment to a more sustainable future.

'We are committed to ensuring the wool used in our supply chain comes from good husbandry and meets high levels of animal welfare, and will continue to use wool as a sustainable material.'

The online fashion retailer faced a backlash after it announced it would be banning wool with one farmer branding it 'absurd'

The company also tweeted to tell its customers about the quick change of plans.

It comes after the move by Boohoo which shocked farmers who said shearing sheep should not involve any cruelty.

One farmer told Sky News they thought the move to scrap wool was 'absolutely disgusting'.

A disappointed Twitter user said: 'It seems Boohoo are doing what they think their customers want without actually looking at real farms and sheep. What a shame'.

Another user branded it a publicity stunt and said: 'A marketing ploy. So many other areas more deserved of attention'.

And a campaign for wool backed by Prince Charles branded the action 'absurd'.

In fact, removing fleeces is vital on welfare grounds to stop the animals from overheating and to protect them from insect infestations.

If they had stuck to the new move, retail giant Boohoo would have banned both of these coats. The Double Breasted Check Wool Coat (left) costs £34.60 and the Petite Wool Fitted Parka costs £41.80

Wool is a natural, sustainable, source of yarn and clothing, unlike the plastic and polyester that is used for most of the cheap lines churned out by Boohoo, including dresses for as little as £3.

Currently, retailers – particularly fast fashion firms – are under pressure for fuelling the problem of plastic pollution by promoting throwaway clothing.

Boohoo's initial decision followed pressure from campaigning vegan group PETA, which caused controversy in November after calling for the Dorset village of Wool to change its name as part of its campaign against what it claims is cruel sheep farming.

The group, which includes the brands Boohoo, BoohooMAN, PrettyLittleThing, and Nasty Gal, previously told PETA that as of autumn-winter 2019/20, 'we will not knowingly source any wool products'.

A spokesman told the Mail that the change was being made on animal welfare grounds.

However, the National Sheep Association hit back. A spokesman said: 'Wool is not a cruelly sourced product. In the vast majority of cases sheep are handled with care when being shorn, and are shorn for health and comfort reasons.

'The sheep industry does not condone any behaviour that falls below the highest welfare standard for the sheep.'

Nicholas Coleridge, chairman of the Prince of Wales' Campaign for Wool, added that PETA's position opposing the use of wool was 'absurd' and 'out of date'.

This double breasted 'wool look' coat and others like it would have replaced all of their coats that include real wool

'The reason the Prince of Wales is so passionate about the use of wool is that it is ecologically more sound than almost any other material,' he said.

'It is reusable and natural as well as making beautiful clothes.'

PETA claims the process of shearing can involve cruelty and rough handling of the animals. Since 2004, it has released 11 exposes of 99 sheep-shearing facilities on four continents, including in the UK, where it claims there is evidence of abuse. It also claims the wool industry causes damage to the environment because manure from livestock contributes to greenhouse gases.

PETA supporters protested outside a London Fashion Week event against the use of wool. Activists carried signs proclaiming, 'Wool Is as Cruel as Fur'.

"Take Me to the River

Elizabeth Kolbert, in her article about rising sea levels, ascribes much of Louisiana’s disappearing coastline to the levee system (“Under Water,” April 1st). The levees are indeed a significant cause of the problem, but they aren’t the only one. Scientists employed by oil and gas companies have conceded that their industry is responsible for at least thirty-six per cent of the land loss. River dams are also a problem: on the Missouri, which empties into the Mississippi, just six dams retain roughly a hundred million tons of sediment—a quarter of the entire sediment load that the Mississippi once carried to the Gulf. At the mouth of the Mississippi, two-mile-long shipping-channel jetties divert a substantial amount of sediment into deep water, where it can’t contribute to building land. These and other engineering interventions have catastrophically disrupted the coastal ecosystem, destroying communities, industries, and lives.

There are many reasons to be skeptical of Outdoor Voices, the faddish clothing brand that Jia Tolentino writes about in her recent piece on athleisure, and its C.E.O.’s commitment to the health of its customers (“Athleisure Time,” March 18th). Chief among these is the fact that a significant amount of the brand’s clothing is made of plastic. Only a few weeks ago, The New Yorker ran a piece by Carolyn Kormann about the world’s growing addiction to plastic, which is severely degrading the ocean environment. A 2017 report by the International Union for Conservation of Nature estimated that thirty-five per cent of microplastics entering the ocean comes from synthetic textiles. As Kormann explains, scientists around the world are gravely concerned about these microplastics, which take decades to break down and are becoming increasingly present in our food cycle. Customers of clothing companies like Outdoor Voices should realize that they aren’t just wearing plastic—eventually, they might be eating it, too.

After spending time with the staff and the C.E.O. of Outdoor Voices, Tolentino observes that she has never been “less able to distinguish what was good from what was profitable, or my life from my work.” The concept of “wellness” promoted by Outdoor Voices and many other companies depends on the blurring of another distinction: between virtue and health. These brands encourage customers who have the time and the money to get fit to feel superior about their ability to do so. Going to a Pilates class or drinking an expensive juice isn’t a moral act; it’s just another form of consumption.

Becca Schonberg

Tolentino includes the clothing brand Nasty Gal in her list of companies that, like Outdoor Voices, are “highly visible, female-centered, life-style-adjacent, digital-savvy millennial brands built around a charismatic founder and her story.” It’s true that when Sophia Amoruso founded Nasty Girl, in 2006, her personality was central to the branding of the company. Initially, this seemed like a successful formula. But by 2015 Amoruso had resigned as C.E.O., and by 2017 the company had declared bankruptcy, after spending heavily on advertising that failed to build a long-term customer base. The brand was bought by an online fashion retailer. Entrepreneurs seeking to emulate the early success of companies like Nasty Gal would do well to consider the whole story.

The French designer Jean Paul Gaultier says big fashion brands are harming the planet by producing ""far too many collections with far too many clothes"".

He said companies must stop engaging in a ""contest"" to make the most clothes.

""Big groups are doing more collections, new collections... with a big amount of clothes. It's absolutely ridiculous.""

Gaultier, one of the world's most influential designers with a more than 40-year career, is speaking as someone who knows the fashion world inside out.

""It's not a question of thinking about what people need. It's thinking about being bigger,"" he added when speaking to BBC News. ""It's only a question of power and politics.""

Image copyright Luke Austin Image caption Jean Paul Gaultier's now legendary conical bra features in his Fashion Freak Show

Too many companies produced clothes that were ""not to be worn"" but were ""more like advertising,"" he said.

Gaultier became known as a fashion's ""enfant terrible"", based on audacious designs such as Madonna's infamous cone bra and the sarong worn by David Beckham.

He had no formal training but from his first show in Paris in 1976 to his later role as creative director at Hermes, he fused the traditional with the radical - embracing androgny, championing diversity and challenging gender stereotypes.

In many ways he is part of the fashion establishment. But that has not stopped him criticising the fashion industry, which produces billions of items of clothing every year.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Burberry said it would bring in measures to recycle its unsold clothes rather than burn them

UK citizens alone discard around a million tonnes of textiles per year, according to a report from the House of Commons environmental audit committee in February. The same report said the country was estimated to send £140m worth of clothing to landfill every year.

Last year it emerged that Burberry burnt unsold clothes, accessories and perfume worth £28.6 million to protect its brand and maintain its exclusivity. It became clear that the practice was in fact commonplace.

""Some people destroy the clothes, they burn them,"" said Gaultier. ""It's scandalous.""

Gaultier is no stranger to excess. He is bringing Fashion Freak Show, a huge musical extravaganza about his life and career, to the Southbank Centre in London in July.

It features hundreds of new outfits, alongside some of his most legendary designs.

But he insists he is a convert to recycling and promises that his next haute couture show in January ""will be all about recycling"".

And he has a message for his fans: ""Keep your clothes... and after, we can make something new. I will help you do that.""

"Think hard about what you put on before leaving the house this morning. How many times will you wear that shirt, those pants, that dress, before throwing them out?



Probably far fewer than you think. One garbage truck of discarded clothes is burned or sent to landfills every second. That means that every two days, the world discards or burns enough clothing to fill AT&T Stadium. We could fill Dallas's White Rock Lake twice each month with the world's trashed apparel.

Gone are the days when people would buy a shirt and wear it for years. The average consumer bought 60 percent more clothes in 2014 than in 2000, but kept each garment for half as long. In a world of accelerating demand for apparel, consumers want -- and can increasingly afford -- new clothing after wearing garments only a few times. Entire business models are built on the premise of ""fast fashion,"" providing clothes cheaply and quickly through shorter fashion cycles.

It's a global problem, and a local one. Dallas residents discard more than 9 million tons of materials into landfills every year, according to a report by the Texas Campaign for the Environment Fund. More than 5 percent of it is textile waste.

But this isn't just a waste story. The linear fashion model of buying, wearing and quickly discarding clothes negatively impacts people and the planet's resources. Here's a look at the economic, social and environmental implications.

Economics

According to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, clothing production has approximately doubled in the last 15 years, driven by a growing middle-class population across the globe and increased per capita sales in developed economies. An expected fourfold increase in world GDP by 2050 will drive even greater demand for clothing.

The economic loss from fashion waste is tremendous. The annual value of clothing discarded prematurely is more than $400 billion globally. North Texas is literally burying tens of millions of dollars in recoverable materials each year, according to the annual Texas Campaign for the Environment State of Recycling report.

Early research also shows the economic benefits of slowing fast fashion down. Though the economic externalities are difficult to quantify, one report showed that addressing environmental and social problems created by the fashion industry would provide a $192 billion overall benefit to the global economy by 2030.

Several North Texas cities like Aubrey, Little Elm, Corinth, The Colony, Lancaster, Bedford, Haltom City, Richland Hills and, most recently, Plano have adopted curbside collection for textiles. Higher quality textiles are sorted and sold to resale stores, while lower quality materials may be cut up and used as rags in auto shops or mining operations.

While recycling textiles is a step in the right direction and helps divert waste from landfills in the short term, it does not address the resource consumption associated with unsustainable clothing production."
"The multitrillion-dollar business of fashion, with its complex and long supply chain, is worryingly vexed with problems contributing to climate change.

The fashion industry emits more greenhouse gas than all international flights and maritime shipping journeys combined , and it's estimated that a garbage truck's worth of clothing is either burned or sent to a landfill every second. On top of that, thanks to our powerful washing machines, our clothes pollute the ocean with microfibers equating to approximately 50 million plastic bottles each year.

Conversation and action around sustainability and climate change has been quiet and slow to come within the sector, but Monday marks another move toward collective change. A fashion industry charter for climate action was formally launched at this year's United Nations climate change conference, COP24, in Katowice, Poland.

Support for the new charter has come from high street retailers, luxury fashion houses and other suppliers within the sector. Stella McCartney, Burberry, Adidas and H&M Group are included in the list of 40 signatories.

Aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement, the new charter includes 16 principles and targets. The companies involved have committed to reducing their aggregate greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030 and they've agreed to prioritize low-carbon transportation suppliers and favor climate-friendly materials.

Stella McCartney, whose eponymous label is already a leading player in sustainable fashion, was one of the founding signatories. She announced her involvement in late November during Voices, a fashion industry conference staged in the English countryside, where she was also honored for her work in the sector.

Fashion's new vanguard

During an interview at the conference, she acknowledged the complexities of working sustainably and responsibly: ""There are millions of limitations from a design and creative point of view. There are millions of limitations from a sourcing and manufacturing point of view. But for me, all of those challenges are part of being a designer and part of being a businesswoman.""

McCartney called upon her peers in the industry to sign the charter, urging the industry to work together.

""It's a no-brainer but there has to be a collective conversation,"" she said. ""I think that's what's so powerful and exciting and promising about COP24.""

Burberry was recently criticized when it was revealed the brand destroyed clothes and perfume worth more than $36 million in 2017. After widespread outrage, the luxury fashion label said in September that it would ban this practice"
"Dr Dorothy Maxwell has long been frustrated by the fashion industry’s waste. She explains why it must take action, writes Ruth O’Connor.

At the Rediscovery Centre, an award-winning eco-centre in a former civic boiler house in Ballymun, Dublin, a wide ranging audience gathered recently for Ireland’s first Circular Fashion Conference.

The event took place during ‘Fashion Revolution Week’ - an annual event in memory of the Rana Plaza incident, six years ago, in which over 1,000 garment workers were killed, and thousands more injured, in a factory collapse in Bangladesh.

Dr Dorothy Maxwell holds a PhD and MSc in Environmental Science and is a lecturer, author and advisor on the subject of sustainability having worked for the likes of Nike, Walmart and House of Fraser.

Dr Maxwell recently took on the role of Sustainability Director at Brown Thomas and Arnotts and appeared alongside representatives of Proudly Made in Africa, Rediscover Fashion, sustainable change agency circular. fashion, Eastern-Midlands Waste and The Nu Wardrobe as well as social media influencer and stylist Courtney Smith.

Put simply, the current model of fashion and clothing consumption is a linear one: the fibres (for example cotton or flax) are grown or extracted from oil in the case of polyester, they are spun into fabrics, they are dyed and embellished, they are made into clothing, they are sold, worn and dumped.

A circular fashion economy on the other hand is regenerative and restorative — it uses resources in a way that they can be reused and kept in the system.

A circular fashion economy is based on a system that values the resources that go into the clothes on our backs or the shoes on our feet. It examines how brands can make clothes that use fibres that are less harmful to the environment but also that are more easily recyclable when they come to their end-of-life. A circular fashion economy also looks at ways of keeping existing items out of landfill through up-cycling, resale and clothing rental systems.

Speaking at the event Aisling Byrne, founder of online community and clothes sharing platform The Nu Wardrobe, said that the current model of fashion supply and demand is broken and unsustainable.

“People are focused on saving fast fashion brands, even though their business model of making clothes cheaply and selling them in increasing volumes is inherently unsustainable,” said Byrne.

“Why, when we are running out of time to limit the effects of climate change, are we haemorrhaging our resources and talent into fixing a broken system, rather than focusing on completely new models?”

Sustainability Director at Arnotts and Brown Thomas, Dr Dorothy Maxwell, spoke to the Irish Examiner at the event and said she finally feels that stakeholders are coming together to obtain the critical mass needed to affect real change.

I’ve been frustrated by these issues for 20 years but it’s finally coming to the point where you can walk into a store and buy something that is sustainable but also beautiful and at the right price point.

A speaker that many in the audience had turned out to see was Safia Minney— an expert in sustainable, fair trade and ethical supply chains in fashion. Minney is the founder of ethical clothing brand People Tree although she is no longer involved in the business.

Speaking to the Irish Examiner at the event Minney said: “The urgency with which we need to tackle climate change and environmental collapse is the issue and the circular economy is part of that. Since the 1970s we have lost 60% of the species on the planet.

""Thirty years after talking about sustainability, climate change and social and environmental justice I am deeply frustrated, but, at the same time I am excited by movements such as the school strikes and Extinction Rebellion because it is putting front of mind the urgency with which we need to change things.”

“I applaud designers and business people getting involved but we need to be thinking about wholesale changes in the system. If we want a future for the planet we need to spending time looking at the structure that is deeply broken in our system. I am concerned that we don’t get stuck tinkering around the edges.

""We should not expect civil society [the people, the consumer] to change the things that need to be changed in 12 years. We need to do the right thing as individuals but we also need to force business and politicians to act now.”

Five days after our meeting at the Rediscovery Centre, the UK government approved a motion to declare an environment and climate emergency— a step in the right direction. The Welsh and Scottish governments, as well as several towns and cities in the UK, including London, have already declared a climate emergency.

The Irish government is the second country to declare a climate emergency.

"Many fashion chains have long banned fur and exotic animal skins for ethical reasons.

But one leading online clothes retailer has taken things a step further – and halted its use of wool.

The move by Boohoo has shocked farmers who say shearing sheep should not involve any cruelty. And a campaign for wool backed by Prince Charles branded the action ‘absurd’.

In fact, removing fleeces is vital on welfare grounds to stop the animals from overheating and to protect them from insect infestations.

Under the new move, retail giant Boohoo would ban both of these dresses. The Double Breasted Check Wool Coat (left) costs £34.60 and the Petite Wool Fitted Parka costs £41.80

At the same time, wool is a natural, sustainable, source of yarn and clothing, unlike the plastic and polyester that is used for most of the cheap lines churned out by Boohoo, including dresses for as little as £3.

Currently, retailers – particularly fast fashion firms – are under pressure for fuelling the problem of plastic pollution by promoting throwaway clothing.

Boohoo’s decision follows pressure from campaigning vegan group PETA, which caused controversy in November after calling for the Dorset village of Wool to change its name as part of its campaign against what it claims is cruel sheep farming.

The group, which includes the brands Boohoo, BoohooMAN, PrettyLittleThing, and Nasty Gal, told PETA that as of autumn-winter 2019/20, ‘we will not knowingly source any wool products’.

A spokesman told the Mail that the change is being made on animal welfare grounds.

However, the National Sheep Association hit back. A spokesman said: ‘Wool is not a cruelly sourced product. In the vast majority of cases sheep are handled with care when being shorn, and are shorn for health and comfort reasons.

‘The sheep industry does not condone any behaviour that falls below the highest welfare standard for the sheep.’ Nicholas Coleridge, chairman of the Prince of Wales’ Campaign for Wool, added that PETA’s position opposing the use of wool was ‘absurd’ and ‘out of date’.

This double breasted wool look coat would still be on sale at the retailer, as it stops wool clothing because of animal welfare

‘The reason the Prince of Wales is so passionate about the use of wool is that it is ecologically more sound than almost any other material,’ he said. ‘It is reusable and natural as well as making beautiful clothes.’

PETA claims the process of shearing can involve cruelty and rough handling of the animals. Since 2004, it has released 11 exposes of 99 sheep-shearing facilities on four continents, including in the UK, where it claims there is evidence of abuse. It also claims the wool industry causes damage to the environment because manure from livestock contributes to greenhouse gases.

Just yesterday, PETA supporters protested outside a London Fashion Week event against the use of wool. Activists carried signs proclaiming, ‘Wool Is as Cruel as Fur’.

Boohoo currently has some coats and jackets which contain a mix of real wool in the material. However, most of its range has already been given over to what it calls ‘wool-look’ products, which are made from a mixture of polyester and viscose."
"The context

“If this generation doesn't fix it, there won’t be another generation”, warns Frances Fogarty, a Limerick College of Further Education fashion student, of fast fashion.

“I just feel that we need to start teaching our younger generation the dangers of fast fashion and the harm that its doing our environment.”

Ms Fogarty explains that the microbeads in clothing have been making their way into the ocean and polluting the sea.

Ms Fogarty says it’s possible fast fashion is already the biggest polluter in the world due to microbeads from clothing making its way to the ocean from the washing machine.

Cristóir King, from the University of Limerick’s Environmental Society, explained that clothing made from natural materials, like cotton, are more environmentally friendly.

Speaking at the societies annual “Happy Market”, a space for students to sell unwanted clothing is to “promote sustainable fashion on campus.”

Fast fashion companies are: producing things that are not good quality and that aren’t intended to last so by shopping second hand we can try prolong the life cycle of our clothes.”

“Vintage clothing is probably the first stop shop , if you want to call it that, for sustainability in terms of buying clothes,” Gracie Coiller, owner of SPICE Vintage, explains.

“It’s second hand, which means that its been preloved by someone else before you got your hands on it and it means that you're not participating in fast fashion and contributing to something that's actually destroying the planet.”

"Sustainable fashion has become a lot more mainstream.

“You have a lot more awareness, you see more brands integrating it into their marketing,” says Kathleen Talbot, the vice-president of operations and sustainability for the Los Angeles-based brand Reformation.

But, in 2009, the conversation around eco-conscious clothing wasn’t nearly as widespread.

“It was a pretty bold ambition to build a brand that had sustainability at its centre but was also really fashion forward and was focused on creating great product that you would want to wear anyways — not just because it had this positive impact,” Talbot says.

And yet, that’s exactly what the company’s founder, Yael Aflalo, did after a sourcing trip to China saw her come face to face with the impact of the fashion world, first-hand.

Safe to say, she didn’t like what she saw.

“She realized that she was complicit in it, and that she didn’t want to do that anymore,” Talbot explains. “She felt that she could just re-engineer the business model and create a different way of making clothes.”

It’s no secret that the fashion is one of the most polluting industries in the world. In fact, it ranks as the third-worst contributor thanks to its resource-heavy requirements for textiles, water-intensive production processes, fair labour issues — not to mention poor end-of-life strategy that sees millions of garments tossed into landfills each year.

Confident she could remain in the industry, while also affecting positive change, Aflalo decided to do something about it, creating the brand Reformation in 2009.

While the brand’s roots were in upcycling of pre-loved garments in the back of a Los Angeles storefront, the company has since grown to encompass a full range of sustainable, stylish pieces that are available in petite sizes through size 22 (for select styles).

“The brand has obviously grown in scale a little bit since that storefront, but we have really tried to keep that commitment, that ethos, at the centre of everything that we’re doing,” Talbot says.

Reformation is billed as a fully carbon, waste and water-neutral company, working with sustainable fabrics primarily through their L.A. factory such as Lyocell, rayon (viscose), modal, linen, etc.

“We source all of our fabrics ahead. We do base qualities. And then our design team actually designs into the materials we have,” Talbot explains of the waste-free aims. They’re incentivized and motivated to use it up because we won’t give them more options until they do.”

The approach enables the brand to better optimize the use of raw materials, while also allowing for a speedy production process — a design can go from sketch to reality in as little as 10 days — and a smaller minimum for orders of a each design, so garments don’t have to be sold off or scrapped at the production end if they don’t prove popular with shoppers.

“There’s a dark, ugly underbelly of the industry that up to 30 per cent of clothes that are produced never make it to you,” Talbot says. “From bad planning decisions or overstock — and those get incinerated or thrown out.

“By creating a model that’s really responsive and focuses on making small runs first, and only making more of what we know will sell … we have, functionally, no finished waste.”

The company’s stylish pieces and sustainable aim have garnered them a loyal fan base of “Ref girls,” followers of the brand that includes celebrities such as Rihanna, Meghan Markle and Karlie Kloss. The popularity has allowed the company to further expand their offering, including operating 14 stores across the U.S.

And now, the Reformation brand has landed in Canada.

“We are really excited to be here,” Talbot says of the new store, which is the first permanent international retail location for the brand, in Toronto. “We’ve had an incredible base of customers through our online business for years. So, (Canada) has always felt like such a natural place to come for us.”

Occupying a sleek, 1,650-square-foot space in Yorkdale Shopping Centre, the store carries a selection of styles including seasonal dresses, jeans and tops. The space stays true to the brand’s mission of consciousness with elements such as vintage furniture, reusable totes in lieu of shopping bags, cardboard hangers — and an 100-per cent offset of the electricity usage in-store with wind energy, according to a news release. Reformation also timed the launch of its Canadian e-shop, which sees duties added into the price of the garments, to coincide with the store opening.

“For us, we see our online and ecommerce stores as really compatible,” Talbot say when asked of the decision to open up a bricks-and-mortar store rather than just stick to growing the online business in Canada. “We’re pretty convinced that a lot of retail is dying because it’s terrible. The associates are spending all their time folding clothes. They’re not paying attention to you. They’re not focused on what you need, styling and giving you that attention. You spend forever looking at each rack, and when you find something, you have to find it in your size.

“The convenience factor of shopping online just hasn’t translated well into the store setting.”

In response to this, the company has looked to offer a “seamless” in-store experience that makes shopping in stores effortless (think: fewer items on display to search through) — and attractive to shoppers who would otherwise prefer to skip the experience altogether.

Fingers crossed, the expansion plans include a Vancouver location sometime soon.

"Rihanna recently launched a new luxury clothing brand for Fenty in partnership with LVMH, and the campaign imagery has fans commending the singer.

To promote the 31-year-old's latest collaboration, model Aweng Mayen Chuol was photographed with her face turned to the side, leaving the scars on her cheek on display.

People quickly noticed how the facial scars remained visible instead of being airbrushed away, like other campaign pictures for similar clothing and beauty brands.

Perfectly imperfect: Rihanna's new Fenty clothing line with LVMH released campaign images. In the images, model Aweng Mayen Chuol bares her facial scars unretouched

Groundbreaking: Rihanna became the first black woman to run an LVMH Maision brand, and the collection released on May 29

In the close-up campaign image, Aweng was photographed wearing a dangly earring with an ear cuff and a white button-down shirt from the line.

The decision to feature the model without airbrushing her skin was commended by fans online.

'I love that the images used on Fenty are not retouched, and that the models skin is not perfect by societal standards,' one fan wrote on Twitter.

Another person commented: 'Wow! As a girl with scars, this really touches my heart. I've never had any reason to feel less terrible about my scars until seeing this.'

Rihanna has built her Fenty brand around providing beauty products and clothing that embrace all skin tones and sizes, so it should come as no surprise that the campaign images would have limited editing.

In 2017, she launched her first clothing line called Savage x Fenty — which focused on inclusively sized lingerie and sleepwear.

Her inclusive message was further promoted during her New York Fashion Week show, as it featured a range of models including women who were pregnant.

Model Aweng previously spoke about her facial scars last year and how she hoped people would embrace the marks as beautiful.

Proud: People online commended the brand for its campaign imagery for the new line

Happy: Fans expressed how they thought it was a good choice to use the unretouched campaign images

Stunning: Aweng, pictured in February, previously said in an interview how she hoped people would embrace the marks as beautiful, especially given her industry

Beautiful: Rihanna's Fenty collection LVMH — the luxury parent company behind her first high-end label — officially launched on May 29

Something different: The line includes a range of clothing items as well as jewelry

Focused: 'I started off by being an endorser of brands, lending my likeness and my face to fashion brands, but this is totally different,' Rihanna said

'I don't know if you've seen images of me, but I have a lot of facial scars,' she told Dazed & Confused magazine last year.

'People tell me I look like a jaguar or that I'm ""exotic,""' she continued. 'Sometimes I just want to shout at everyone: ""Look at me, I'm not just a scar, I'm a human."" But I get it, it's a curiosity. I know I'm different, I know my facial features are different, but to me that's beauty.'

Rihanna's Fenty collection LVMH — the luxury parent company behind her first high-end label — officially launched on May 29. The line includes a range of clothing items as well as jewelry.

Important: Fenty is one of a number of brands that have focused on provided unretouched campaign images for consumers

'I started off by being an endorser of brands, lending my likeness and my face to fashion brands, but this is totally different,' Rihanna said in an interview with Vogue. 'Everything I’ve learned so far has led me to this moment.'

Rihanna is the first black woman running an LVMH Maison brand, and the first woman in general to launch an original brand at LVMH.

'Everybody knows Rihanna as a wonderful singer, but through our partnership at Fenty Beauty, I discovered a true entrepreneur, a real CEO and a terrific leader. She naturally finds her full place within LVMH,' LVMH Chairman and Chief Executive Bernard Arnault told Business of Fashion in May.

'To support Rihanna to start up the Fenty Maison, we have built a talented and multicultural team supported by the group resources. I am proud that LVMH is leading this venture and wish it will be a great success.'

So not only is the line becoming a leader with Rihanna at the helm of an LVMH Maison brand, but its also promoting unretouched imagery.

There has been a movement, as of late, for brands to feature campaign images with limited editing involved.

Companies including Aerie, CVS, Target, Dove and ASOS have all announced initiatives within the last year to create body-positive ads by avoiding airbrushing the models.

The response to Fenty's latest campaign could inspire other brands to also promote unretouched ads when selling beauty or fashion products."

What's this about a Canadian Green New Deal?

The Brits show you can increase GDP while reducing emissions

Feel-good fashion: The case for sustainable jeans

The Green New Deal travels north

(Chris Wattie/Reuters)

On Monday, people across Canada rallied in support of the environment. It was the first salvo for the Pact for a Green New Deal by a coalition of more than 60 organizations — as well as celebrities such as k.d. lang, William Shatner and David Suzuki — pushing to make climate action a priority in the upcoming federal election.

Brendan Pietrobon spoke to Concordia University professor Damon Matthews, who was recruited by the Pact to speak to the scientific basis for climate action proposed in the Green New Deal.

What inspired this movement?

One is the U.S. version of the Green New Deal that has been gaining some traction. The other is in Quebec — Le pacte pour la transition launched in November of last year. It's a similar idea — trying to develop a groundswell of support for social and economic transition in light of the climate challenge. Le pacte … has almost 300,000 signatories to date, mostly within the francophone community in Quebec.

What are the goals of the Pact for a Green New Deal?

It's not meant to be a set of policy prescriptions at this point, but more an acknowledgement that we face challenges and that Canada as a country is not providing the kind of climate leadership that we could be. The premise of it is that we need to limit climate change to within a safe regime. Yes, that involves meeting our obligations to the Paris agreement, dramatically strengthening our national emissions targets. In order to be aligned with the Paris agreement, we should be targeting something like a 50 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.

What are Canada's unique challenges?

The challenge for us is finding a way to move away from oil and gas as a fundamental part of our economy, while not leaving people behind who are dependent on that industry for their livelihoods.

The starting point, honestly, is a flat-out acknowledgement that the future of oil and gas is limited — and we haven't had that conversation at the political level in Canada hardly at all. The conversation right now is still that oil and gas is going to be an important driver of our economy for the next several decades. That narrative fundamentally assumes that we do not take climate mitigation seriously.

What would ""doing our part"" look like for Canada?

Showing that even though we are a resource-based economy, we can make serious efforts to solve this problem. Obviously, it is a global problem, and Canada's emissions are about 1.5 per cent of global emissions. As a nation, we have a fairly prominent sphere of influence in the world, and if we set an example and show that we're taking this problem seriously, that will give an incentive for others to do the same and ramp up their ambition as well.

What would you like to see happen next?

I hope that people sign on to [the pact]. I hope that the town halls start to provide some tangible ideas and build some momentum. Ultimately, I hope that the federal election that's coming up rallies around climate as a central issue. I think some parties are pushing the climate agenda in important ways; others are not. My hope is that the federal election can be a statement that climate action is actually important to Canadians.

More on meal kits

Last week, Brendan Pietrobon wrote a piece on a University of Michigan study that found that dinner made from a meal kit had a smaller carbon footprint than one made from grocery items. We felt we should pass on a couple of clarifications for your consideration. One reader pointed out that in the study, 11 per cent of emissions associated with the grocery-store meals came from using a vehicle to pick up the ingredients. Walking or taking public transportation to the grocery store would bring the two options much closer in terms of carbon emissions — and leaving the car at home is always a great choice for the environment. Also, HelloFresh contacted us to say that the photo accompanying the piece was a little outdated. The company said that packaging is ""an important topic for us,"" and noted that since 2017, HelloFresh has reduced its packaging by about 45 per cent. Comments? Email us at whatonearth@cbc.ca.

The Big Picture: Emissions reductions vs. economic growth

Often, when environmentally minded politicians stress the need to reduce carbon emissions, detractors say that doing so could hurt the economy. That argument is becoming less sustainable, especially if you look at what Great Britain has achieved in the last three decades. Since 1990, the U.K. economy has grown by about 77 per cent — all while decreasing emissions by 43 per cent.

Hot and bothered: Provocative ideas from around the web

Every week seems to bring another warning of environmental catastrophe. This week, it was a United Nations report stating that a million species of animals and plants are at risk of extinction within decades if we don't take action to restore their habitats.

One of Canada's most iconic boating experiences is becoming greener. The Maid of the Mist, the fleet of vessels that gives tourists a close-up view of Niagara Falls, is going electric. Thanks to a Swiss company called ABB, two of the boats in the fleet will run on lithium-ion batteries starting in September.

Canada may be responsible for less than two per cent of worldwide carbon emissions, but that doesn't mean we're blameless. A recent report by the International Energy Agency shows that the vehicles we drive are the biggest, heaviest and least fuel efficient in the world.

Food waste is a recurring topic in this newsletter. In South Korea, they've found a high-tech way to address the problem: by recycling it. A few years ago, the government introduced a system that compelled consumers to buy special bags and deposit their food scraps in street-level machines. The unused food is subsequently carted off and turned into fertilizer or animal feed. The result: South Koreans now recycle 95 per cent of their food waste.

Blue jeans go green

(Anara)

The phrase has become all too familiar: ""We are consuming too much.""

But even if your wardrobe is down to the bare essentials, the contents might still be problematic — that is, eco-unfriendly.

Most clothing is made from cotton or a blend of synthetic fibres such as plastic-based polyester. Both materials damage the environment, from the heavy use of pesticides associated with growing cotton to the contribution of greenhouse gases from producing synthetics.

Experts say that varying the materials used to make clothes is crucial to reducing the fashion industry's impact on the environment.

""We have to introduce other fibres that aren't so reliant on water, that are freer in their growth so we're not robbing our own resources,"" said Rachel Miller, studio head of textiles at Sheridan College in Oakville, Ont. She said she is seeing ""a higher dependency"" on these lower-impact fibres from producers, ""because we can't keep going like this.""

One of the companies exploring such lower-impact fibres is Canadian-Australian startup ANARA, which makes hemp-based denim. Their jeans are 54 per cent hemp, 44.5 per cent organic cotton and 1.5 per cent spandex.

Co-owner Jamieson McCormack explained that hemp uses less water. A study by the Stockholm Environment Institute shows that one kilogram of cotton — enough to make a T-shirt and a pair of jeans — uses almost 10,000 litres of water. One kilogram of useful hemp fibre requires 343 litres.

Hemp fabric is also more durable and has antibacterial properties, which means fewer washes, more wears and a longer life for the garment. Miller notes that hemp doesn't need the same amount of chemical processing to turn it into a fibre as other fast-growing plants do, such as bamboo.

ANARA, which sells its wares online, would like to produce their jeans entirely from hemp, but McCormack said that if it wasn't made from a mix of materials, the fabric would lose that classic denim look and feel. She said this is essential, because the goal is to replace what people would normally buy with something that fits the same way but is more eco-friendly and lasts longer.

Despite such efforts, observers say we should only buy for need, not for novelty. Researchers from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation report that clothing production almost doubled between 2000 and 2015.

""If we're still consuming at the same rate, that doesn't solve the problem,"" said Anika Kozlowski, assistant professor of fashion design ethics and sustainability at Ryerson University. ""The best thing you can do is buy something that you're going to own for a really long time and know how to take care of it.""

If you are in the market for a new item, there's a tool you can use to investigate your options. The Transparency Index, from advocacy group Fashion Revolution, scores 200 fashion and apparel brands on the transparency of their production methods, including social and environmental impacts.

"Many products made from waste are finding their way onto runways and into design museums and households.

From packaging to clothing to cigarette butts, more and more everyday items that once were destined for landfills are being recycled, composted or upcycled in creative ways. Many of the new products made from waste are finding their way onto runways and into design museums and households.

The company TerraCycle, for example, has devised ways of collecting waste like ocean plastics, cigarette butts, chewing gum and even dirty diapers, and then processing it so it can have a new life.

“Waste is way more than figuring out how we can deal with a negative. It’s really rather exciting,” says TerraCycle’s CEO, Tom Szaky, who loves to put surprising trash items to use. Some of the company’s upcycled products, like tote bags made from juice pouches and laptop cases made out of retired US Mail bags, are sold online, by the retailer dwellsmart.com .

Pittsburgh, New Orleans, San Francisco and dozens of other cities, partnering with TerraCycle, are finding it worthwhile to collect and process old cigarette butts and packaging, which is shredded, separating the ash, tobacco and paper from the plastic filters, Szaky says. The ash, tobacco and paper are then composted, and the plastic filters (made from cellulose acetate) are shredded, compounded and turned into plastic pellets to make a variety of products like park benches. The cigarette recycling program in the U.S. is financially supported by The Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company, he says.

Kiehl’s, Nespresso, Colgate, Tide, Brita and a host of other brands, meanwhile, are finding it advantageous to offer clients ways to recycle their packaging so that it doesn’t have to end up in landfills, an eco-friendly effort which gives them cachet among eco-minded consumers.

And a new program about to be launched in Europe, partly paid for by a diaper company there, will distribute publicly accessible odor-proof bins to collect dirty diapers, which will then be recycled into their various components and reprocessed, Szaky says.

Many firms are finding uses for recycled materials at the beginning of the design process. The company ReWall, for example, makes high-performance wall board, exterior and other architectural products out of unwanted packaging materials. ReWall recently worked with the architecture and design firm Bureau V and designer Mary Ping to come up with a futuristic tabletop as part of a commissioned artwork.

“This was one of our first projects using upcycled materials, but it certainly won’t be our last,” says Peter Zuspan, founding principal at Bureau V. “It’s definitely the type of thing we’ll see more of in the future.”

The tabletop was featured in one of two recent exhibits at the Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum that looked at ways in which items many people assume cannot be recycled are transformed. It includes Starbucks packaging, with the famous green logos barely visible in the swirls of pattern, and is part of the museum’s new exhibit, “Tablescapes: Designs for Dining.” Another show that originated at the Cooper Hewitt, “Scraps: Fashion, Textiles and Creative Reuse,” is on view at the Palm Springs Art Museum Architecture and Design Center in California through Jan. 14, 2019. It includes an array of textile works from three designers who give new life to waste materials that might otherwise have been thrown away.

One of the designers, Christina Kim, cut up handwoven sari fabric to create a new clothing line. She then utilized every bit of the scraps in other products. The tiniest bits at the end of the process were turned into amulets to be used for necklaces.

And interest in eco-friendly textiles is hardly limited to lesser-known designers. Big clothing labels like Everlane are making fashionable clothing out of recyclables (in their case a new line of jackets made from recycled PET bottles).

“Designers are looking for alternative ways to produce things, and are paying more attention to what they produce them from,” says Matilda McQuaid, who organized the “Scraps” exhibit and heads the textiles department at Cooper Hewitt. “People in general are looking at materials in a very new way, with a much greater focus on sustainability.”"
"Many fashion chains have long banned fur and exotic animal skins for ethical reasons.

But one leading online clothes retailer has taken things a step further – and halted its use of wool.

The move by Boohoo has shocked farmers who say shearing sheep should not involve any cruelty. And a campaign for wool backed by Prince Charles branded the action ‘absurd’.

In fact, removing fleeces is vital on welfare grounds to stop the animals from overheating and to protect them from insect infestations.

Under the new move, retail giant Boohoo would ban both of these dresses. The Double Breasted Check Wool Coat (left) costs £34.60 and the Petite Wool Fitted Parka costs £41.80

At the same time, wool is a natural, sustainable, source of yarn and clothing, unlike the plastic and polyester that is used for most of the cheap lines churned out by Boohoo, including dresses for as little as £3.

Currently, retailers – particularly fast fashion firms – are under pressure for fuelling the problem of plastic pollution by promoting throwaway clothing.

Boohoo’s decision follows pressure from campaigning vegan group PETA, which caused controversy in November after calling for the Dorset village of Wool to change its name as part of its campaign against what it claims is cruel sheep farming.

The group, which includes the brands Boohoo, BoohooMAN, PrettyLittleThing, and Nasty Gal, told PETA that as of autumn-winter 2019/20, ‘we will not knowingly source any wool products’.

A spokesman told the Mail that the change is being made on animal welfare grounds.

However, the National Sheep Association hit back. A spokesman said: ‘Wool is not a cruelly sourced product. In the vast majority of cases sheep are handled with care when being shorn, and are shorn for health and comfort reasons.

‘The sheep industry does not condone any behaviour that falls below the highest welfare standard for the sheep.’ Nicholas Coleridge, chairman of the Prince of Wales’ Campaign for Wool, added that PETA’s position opposing the use of wool was ‘absurd’ and ‘out of date’.

This double breasted wool look coat would still be on sale at the retailer, as it stops wool clothing because of animal welfare

‘The reason the Prince of Wales is so passionate about the use of wool is that it is ecologically more sound than almost any other material,’ he said. ‘It is reusable and natural as well as making beautiful clothes.’

PETA claims the process of shearing can involve cruelty and rough handling of the animals. Since 2004, it has released 11 exposes of 99 sheep-shearing facilities on four continents, including in the UK, where it claims there is evidence of abuse. It also claims the wool industry causes damage to the environment because manure from livestock contributes to greenhouse gases.

Just yesterday, PETA supporters protested outside a London Fashion Week event against the use of wool. Activists carried signs proclaiming, ‘Wool Is as Cruel as Fur’.

Boohoo currently has some coats and jackets which contain a mix of real wool in the material. However, most of its range has already been given over to what it calls ‘wool-look’ products, which are made from a mixture of polyester and viscose."

"As we come to the end of global Fashion Revolution week – which asks brands the seemingly simple question ""who made my clothes?"" – the complexities and harsh realities of the fast fashion industry are once again in the spotlight.

Research shows clothes are among the items most at risk of being produced through modern slavery in an industry where women make up a staggering 80 per cent of the global workforce.

The environmental cost is high, too. Global textiles production emits 1.2 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases annually – more than international flights and maritime shipping combined. To make matters worse, 73 per cent of the 53 million tonnes of fibres used to make clothes and textiles each year are burnt or sent to landfill, according to Fashion Revolution’s latest reports.

But with consumer awareness about how are clothes are really being made on the rise, it’s an exciting time for sustainable fashion.

There is lots of advice for shopping more ethically, from pledging only to buy an item if you can commit to wearing it at least 30 times (a commitment made by Emma Watson) to shopping in charity or vintage shops.

Buying less and buying better is an important one. The reality is, ethical fashion often does cost

more. This reflects the true cost of using materials that are less damaging to the planet, made in factories that are safe to work in, have better eco-credentials and pay fairer wages to their employees. But, as the brands featured here shows, it doesn’t have to cost a huge amount more and a good tip is to sign up to newsletters before you make your first purchase, which usually entitles you to at least 10 per cent off.

Ethics and sustainability are more of a spectrum than a hard line between right and wrong. We’ve chosen brands for who sustainability is at the heart of their business, not a side eco-range within an otherwise unsustainable brand. Searching through sustainable brands to find pieces that match your style can take more time, but this list is a good starting point...

You can trust our independent reviews. We may earn commission from some of the retailers, but we never allow this to influence selections, which are formed from real-world testing and expert advice. This revenue helps us to fund journalism across The Independent.

PARIS (Reuters) - French fashion group Kering, whose brands include Gucci and Saint Laurent, said it had set out internal guidelines for dealing with the welfare of animals, as fashion companies look to tighten their ethical standards.

Kering’s ‘Animal Welfare Standards’ cover issues such as how animals, which are often used in the fashion and textiles industry, are treated, and it would back prohibiting intensive farming and the use of sub-therapeutic antibiotic treatments.

Britain's Burberry and Kering's Gucci are among the latest brands to abandon fur. Luxury online retailer Yoox Net-A-Porter has also abandoned fur, and Los Angeles moved in September to outlaw its sale and manufacture within the city limits. [reut.rs/2MKBaR9]"
"Two students in Fredericton are using their passion for the environment to encourage others to live more sustainably — while also supporting their new business.

Brigitte Comeau and Emily Bourque are best friends who started the One Stop Sustainability Shop at the end of April.

They sell handmade clothing made from recycled materials and homegrown herbs in hand-painted pots through an Instagram page.

""We want it to be like a stop where people can stop and buy things that are more sustainable and ethical and just really like getting the word out there about sustainability,"" said Bourque, who's an environmental marketing major and hand paints the pots.

The University of New Brunswick students live sustainable lifestyles; Comeau is vegan, Bourque is a vegetarian. They shop secondhand and both avoid single-use plastics. And their decision to start a sustainable business was inspired by how they live.

""We changed a lot of things in our lifestyle to become more eco-friendly and it got to a point where we felt like it wasn't enough and we wanted to give other people the option to shop more sustainably,"" said Comeau, who is a marketing major.

Comeau, 19, got a sewing machine from her mother on her 16th birthday and has been sewing ever since. She makes the clothing out of recycled material she finds while thrift shopping.

""Just a couple months ago I started making clothes from scratch just because I got inspired … I started caring a lot more about the environment and I started thinking about fast fashion and I still wanted to buy cute tank tops and cute shorts, so I decided to try to make them myself,"" she said.

'Not about the money'

The online shop is gaining popularity, with more than 200 Instagram followers since the launch, but Bourque said their business isn't about profit.

These students are trying to inspire others to be more eco-friendly by selling sustainable products on their Instagram page One Stop Sustainability Shop. 0:33

""Just getting the word out there about the word sustainability and educating people on what the word sustainability means,"" Bourque said.

""[It's] not about the money, not about anything like that, just getting the message out there, showing our passion and just educating people on that too is also part of our business.""

So far, the duo is breaking even. They said their goal is to be convenient so people have a jumping off point if they want to be more sustainable.

""We're just trying to offer a more sustainable option for people because we know a lot of people try their best, but a lot of people won't look for these options if they're not like readily accessible to them,"" Comeau said.

Comeau and Bourque are interested in expanding their business to sell shampoo bars and produce bags. Now, besides clothing and pots, they also sell cloth utensil holders and tote bags.

The friends said they're hoping to be a small part of a worldwide fight to save the environment.

""Globally, I think that we want to change the mindset of people we want the thought of, 'How is this going to impact the environment?'"" Bourque said.

""We want that thought through everyone's brain for everything they do in their everyday life like, 'Oh, if I do this, how does this impact the environment?' That I think is something that needs to change.""

They'd also like to start selling their products across Canada, as long as they can find sustainable packaging, and set up shop at the local markets in Fredericton.

Comeau said she decided to live more sustainably when she went vegan a year and a half ago.

""I was just like, ""Wow, I really need to start doing something,' because no matter how little of an impact we have, we still do have an impact,"" she said.

And Bourque said everyone needs to work together if change is going to happen.

""It can't just be like my lifestyle, it can't just be her lifestyle, it has to be a movement. A global movement needs to start happening because if it doesn't, then it's really scary for my future, my kids' future."""
"News from Laurie Foon

Sustainable business champion Laurie Foon has launched her campaign for the Wellington City Council’s Paekawakawa/Southern Ward as a Green party candidate.

She says a “youthful determination for change” is behind her decision to stand – that of the next generation.

“I have two daughters who are strong advocates for the environment. They are among the climate change debate and their passion and resolve, along with that of their peers, was what inspired me to stand for council.

“I feel like if I’m in a position to make a change then I should do it not just for my family but for my community.”

After polling high in the 2017 Southern Ward by-election, Foon has made the decision to re-stand on the Green party ticket, following David Lee’s decision to stand down after six years on the council.

Foon says the Greens’ local election campaign for a future for our children and their children and a promise to make Wellington one of the greenest cities in the world aligns closely with her own values and vision, and she is privileged to have the opportunity to fill Lee’s shoes.

Lee says that in standing down, he is proud to back Laurie Foon as Paekawakawa/Southern Ward candidate.

“Laurie is that rare blend – she works constructively alongside people of all stripes, offers a solid business focus and is a strong advocate for sustainable practice. She’s a hard worker and brings great energy, passion and heart to all that she does. Laurie will be an exceptional councillor for Wellington City.”

A resident of Berhampore for 20 years, Foon founded iconic New Zealand fashion label Starfish in the 1990s, running the business for 20 years as a pioneer of eco-friendly conscious fashion. She is currently Regional Manager for the Sustainable Business Network.

Foon says she holds tight to her vision for Wellington as the coolest little sustainable capital in the world and her priorities for council reflect this.

“We need to transition to a low carbon future that cares for people, supports local businesses and regenerates the environment.”

That means working towards zero waste by creating circular systems to reuse resources not create landfill says Foon.

“Let’s make organic waste kerbside collection by council a reality and divert that waste to urban farms to grow food not landfill. And let’s become a single-use plastic free city, starting with stopping single-use plastic at council facilities, venues and events.”

A low carbon economy is also a focus, with Foon calling for greater council investment in social enterprises, local and sustainable businesses, and support through buy local and sustainable procurement policies.

Foon is passionate about future-proofing Wellington by ensuring urban growth integrates energy efficiency, water sensitive design, urban greening, safer cycling, EVs and car sharing.

“I’m standing for a future I want our children to inherit. Let’s make good things happen.”

"Weekday jeans and Allbirds trainers are among the most wanted ethical fashion products this year, according to a new report.

Global fashion search platform Lyst's latest report, Searching for Sustainability, has investigated how the growing popularity of veganism and increasing concerns over plastic pollution leading people to invest in eco-friendly alternative materials is affecting consumer's search for more sustainable wardrobes.

According to the findings, the company saw a 66 per cent increase in searches for the term “sustainable fashion” from February 2018 to February 2019, which included sustainable keywords such as “ethic brands” and ""econyl"" - a form of nylon that is made entirely from waste products.

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.

Meanwhile, searches for the term “organic cotton” were up 16 per cent, year on year, while those for “vegan fashion” increased by 199 per cent since October.

""Over the past few years, the subject of sustainable fashion has grown from a small issue to something that more and more consumers care about,"" Lyst's ​fashion insights reporter Morgane Le Caer tells The Independent.

Nanushka has been a firm brand favourite among sartorial fans since 2018 and championed by models Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid. Despite the influence of fashion fashion, Le Caer tells The Independent that brands like Nanushka “design eco-friendly collections that more often than not sell out in a matter of days, proving that style and sustainability can and do go hand in hand”.

Since then, the label’s Gavin dress has become the most page viewed item for the brand on Lyst from September to December. “When it comes to style, being more sustainable is all about taking a step back,” explains Le Caer. “And when the well-being of the planet is in the balance, it's something that's worth doing, no matter how busy our schedules might be.” TheReformation 6/7 Allbird Tree Runners One of the most in-demand pair of environmentally-friendly trainers over the last year has been the AllBirds Tree Runners.

While it's unknown whether consumers interest, strong marketing campaigns, or powerful Instagram reach is to thank, Le Caer says ""there is no denying that the mentality towards a more eco-friendly fashion is shifting"".

The company's latest report ranks the most in-demand sustainable items across the company’s inventory of five million fashion products based on search and social impressions.

To compile the results, Lyst analysed the online shopping behaviour of more than 80 million shoppers over the past year, browsing and buying fashion across 12,000 designers and stores online.

The report also looked at social media metrics, taking into account multi-platform mentions of products, brands and related keywords, plus sentiment analysis.

It comes months after fashion houses including Victoria Beckham, Burberry, Versace, and Coach announced it would be banning fur and a month after Los Angeles welcomed its first Vegan Fashion Week in February.

"Americans throw away a staggering 13 million tons of textiles every year, according to a PBS report. That's equal to about 85% of the clothes they own. And the sad truth is that many of the old tees and jeans you're discarding could easily be upcycled into outfits that look as good as new.

Many brands, including Frank And Oak, have been proactive about leading the charge when it comes to sustainable fashion. The retailer has long been a champion of eco-friendly practices. It uses minimal impact processes (which basically means different materials and methods of clothing creation, designed with the planet in mind) and in 2019, 50% of the company's products were made using eco-conscious materials or created with resource-efficient processes.

And Frank And Oak's latest denim collection might be the brand's boldest foray into sustainable fashion yet.

About Frank And Oak

Frank And Oak is a clothing retailer focused on providing customers with quality wardrobe essentials that a) don't break the bank and b) are made eco-consciously. It sells pieces individually and also offers its signature Style Plan, a monthly clothing subscription that is personalized around your sartorial tastes. It takes away the painful bits of online shopping, like sorting through hundreds of styles before you find the one that fits your personality and body type, and instead curates a collection of clothing that suits your preferences. The service then delivers its top picks straight to your doorstep (after you approve them, of course). It's a subscription service CNN Underscored staffers stand behind, so much so that we named it a winner of CNN Underscored's Best Products of 2018. (You can try Style Plan risk-free and get $35 off your first box with the code CNN at checkout from now until August 31.)

What makes Frank And Oak's latest collection so special?

All eight of the brand's new styles of jeans (three for men and five for women) are made from post-consumer waste. By salvaging worn-out jeans that were destined for the landfill, Frank And Oak was able to repurpose the fibers and respin them into fashion-forward designs. On top of using upcycled materials, Frank And Oak partnered with Hydro-Less Laundry, an ethical, eco-certified facility that claims to use up to 79% less energy, 50% less chemicals and up to 95% less water than standard denim creation. So you can rest assured that the making of your jeans didn't unnecessarily waste water or contribute to landfills from start to finish. Simply put, this new line of denim will help you look good and feel good.

What styles are available?

Currently, the sustainable women's collection features the Nina Wide Leg Fit, a high-rise design that comes in six hues; a '90s-inspired Stevie Tapered Fit (also high-rise), which comes in three colors; and the classic Debbie Skinny, which comes in three colors as well. For men, the Dylan Slim Fit is the most classic design, with a regular rise, slim leg-opening and four color options. From there, a slimmer iteration is the Tyler Skinny, which has a much narrower leg opening and comes in three color variations; the Gordon Athletic design is a looser alternative, with extra room in the legs and thighs.

These are new styles of Frank And Oak's existing denim collection, which now features 11 distinct fits for both men and women.

How do the jeans look and feel?

Two members of our team, a female and a male, test-drove two pairs of jeans each. Here's what we thought:

""Right off the bat, I was super impressed with the texture of the jeans. My Nina Wide Leg pair was soft to the touch, and equally as comfortable to wear. That was also the case for the pair of Debbie Skinnies I tested out. You can tell pretty instantly that this denim is high quality. It has all the makings of what I look for in an excellent pair of jeans: sturdy construction that's still flexible, comfortable and an everyday wash that won't go out of style.

""The wide leg and delicate fraying on the leg opening of my Nina were both fashion-forward touches that really make the denim shine. And for the Debbie, I was most impressed with the fit and richness of color. Overall, each pair fit pretty true to size. And being someone who typically wears the whole spectrum of denim (from budget to designer), I was most impressed with how expensive my denim looked and felt. It was comparable to more designer pieces quality-wise and is only fractionally more expensive that the more budget denim I buy (which, I must mention, tends to wear out after a season or so of use). Simply put, I'm hooked."" - Banu Ibrahim, CNN Underscored Commerce Editor

""Being someone who typically wears Topman, Madewell or Gap jeans, I am pleasantly surprised with Frank And Oaks. After all, jeans are basically my uniform, along with a button-down shirt. I tried the Tyler and Gordon fits, which are both pretty much skinny-ish jeans. The Gordon has a more athletic fit that does not grip the body too tightly, with nicely sized legs and a bit more room near the thighs. It's a natural look that still feels like classic jeans, but with a slightly lighter-weight fabric. Tyler, on the other hand, is a more skinny fit from the ankle to thigh. Both are comfortable in everyday wear.

""Given that I'm a tech reporter, I appreciated being able to hold two phones in the front pocket, along with a wallet, keys, and two pairs of earbuds as well. The denim-like material is pretty soft and was very comfortable to wear."" - Jake Krol, CNN Underscored Associate Tech Writer

Are they worth the price?

Simply put, yes. At just $89.50 per pair, they're comparable to many denim brands and cost far less than luxury options. And on top of all of that, our team was impressed with the overall fit and quality of the denim. It makes you wonder why you'd ever pay more for less environmentally conscious jeans in the first place.

"He invested in Allbirds, a sustainable footwear brand, just weeks ago.

And on Wednesday, Leonardo DiCaprio was spotted sporting the brand's 'tree runners,' which are made from eucalyptus fibers.

'I am proud to join the company as an investor,' the 43-year-old actor said in a statement on August 1. 'Creating sustainable consumer products requires a deep commitment from brands that understand the role they have in helping solve our environmental crisis.'

Leonardo continued: 'Allbirds is on the forefront of developing new materials that will serve as a model for the footwear industry. This kind of innovation is crucial for creating a more sustainable future.'

Along with Allbirds, the Titanic star invested in several other companies over the summer including Kingo Energy, a Guatemalan company that aims to 'eradicate energy poverty,' and Califia Farms, a plant-based milk brand.

DiCaprio's eco-conscious foundation has donated more than $80 million dollars to sustainable ventures since its inception in 1998.

'I am proud to join the company as an investor,' DiCaprio said in a statement on August 1. 'Creating sustainable consumer products requires a deep commitment from brands that understand the role they have in helping solve our environmental crisis'

While trying to save the planet, Leonardo has also been busy filming Once Upon A Time In Hollywood—a Quentin Tarantino film.

The movie follows actor Rick Dalton, played by DiCaprio, and his stunt double, played by Brad Pitt, as they attempt to make a name for themselves in the film industry.

The main story runs parallel to the murder of actress Sharon Tate, played by Margot Robbie, who, along with four friends, was slain by Charles Manson's cult followers.

The source added: '[Leo] has never loved a girl like this. He's ready to have kids. [Camila] loves having little kids around and wants to have kids with Leo. But she wants to get married to him first. She's very traditional in that way.'"

"When Kirsten Kore wore a $1000 designer dress to a work event in 2015, she had no idea the expensive outfit would change her life.

The savvy Sydneysider didn’t pay the hefty price tag asked in store. She cleverly rented it from a woman she’d been connected to through Facebook.

Despite it being a “pleasant experience” Kirsten told news.com.au she’d been nervous about the online transaction.

“I literally messaged her my credit card details over Facebook, it could have been a total disaster,” she said.

However the whole exchange sparked an idea that saw her and her partner Costa Koulis, 42, become multi-millionaires, creating a platform for women to rent and list expensive dresses — now dubbed the “Airbnb for dresses”.

“When I came across a problem, I started looking at the idea to create a couture platform where you are able to track the whole process; from payment to returns,” Kirsten explained.

The super simple idea — born out of her own clothing dilemma — has now become a hugely popular service, seeing a surge following from the success of Marie Kondo’s Netflix show, Tidying Up.

But the couple made their first million with Designerex long before people like Kondo and Meghan Markle — who is a huge advocate for sustainable fashion — made it trendy.

And it’s thanks to their savvy business plan that differentiates them from other dress rental companies, like GlamCorner, which sees them have a huge costs to buy and own the gowns being leased out.

She said: “When we launched, we already had hundreds of dresses ready to be rented.

“We’d sourced renters through platforms like Instagram and Facebook, promoting the platform where they could earn money on their expensive garments.

“Once we had people listing their items, customers came organically but we did budget for marketing on social media channels.”

In the first year the pair raked in 500,000 and did the same the following year.

Now in their third year, they’ve been experiencing a huge surge to the site, growing at a rate of 150 per cent, Kirsten said.

“We have over 12,000 dresses listed on the site and every month $250,000 worth of luxury clothing is listed.”

“There’s been a real shift in fashion with women wanting a return when investing in expensive pieces.”

The site offers a wide variety of brands, but champion Aussie labels such as Scanlan and Theodore, Zimmerman and Bec and Bridge.

While Designerex is the largest clothing sharing platform in the world, it’s not the only rental business seeing a spike thanks to Kondo.

Australian owned GlamCorner agrees, with co-founder and CEO Dean Jones telling news.com.au there’s been a “lot of movement” recently around sustainable and affordable fashion.

“Marie Kondo has become a household name for helping to de-clutter and reorganise your life which has also given a positive push to interest in renting clothing instead of hoarding it,” Mr Jones said.

“Owning a tonne of clothing doesn’t exactly ‘spark joy’ as Marie puts in and the never-ending stream of fast fashion ending up in landfills so quickly is having a really negative impact on our environment. So renting and giving back makes more sense for so many reasons.

“Businesses like GlamCorner are giving the consumers an option to change up their style and looks, experiment with fashion, all while not adding clutter to their wardrobe and lives.”

GlamCorner is also launching a subscription based service in March, where customers pay a set fee and can use the service a number of times every month.

Kirsten added the Marie Kondo affect has made consumers “hyper aware” about their purchases and predicts “investment pieces” are going to continue to soar in popularity.

"The people who were working in our once-thriving clothing manufacturing industry two decades ago have retired or died, leaving a gaping skills and knowledge gap. Young people have no clue what happens in terms of production in fashion. They all want to be star designers like the Palesas and Davids, but not everyone can be a star designer.

""Nobody is telling the black child you can be a pattern-maker, cutter; you can be a grader, machinist. It is still a respectable job,"" says Fezile Mdletshe, creative design and graphic design lecturer at the Durban University of Technology (DUT), who established the Fezile Fashion Skills Academy this year to bridge this gap.

SUSTAINABLE FASHION RELIES ON SKILLS DEVELOPMENT

In April, Swedish retailer H&M hosted the Sustainable Fashion Africa Summit — an African first — inviting editors, journalists, and influencers to engage with H&M representatives and a panel of fashion industry players on the impact of fashion production on the environment and society.

Mdletshe was one of these expert panellists; she believes sustainability in fashion goes beyond eco-friendly textiles and recycling but includes people, skills and development.

Acknowledging H&M as being the first international retailer to celebrate ""who we are"" by bringing a range of Palesa Mokubung's Mantsho into its local and international stores, she stressed the importance of ethical fashion."
"There’s never been more choice for ethical products – that’s products that have a positive social impact, environmental impact, or both.

The term itself covers a whole range of factors including fair treatment of workers, transparency in how a company operates, the impact of manufacture on the local environment, sourcing of sustainable materials, and animal welfare.

With many brands claiming to be ethical, or sell ethical products, it can be hard to know where to put your money as a responsible consumer.

In the UK, the Good Shopping Guide is a handy general resource, as is the original Fairtrade pioneer Traidcraft.

If you are unsure about the ethical credentials of a brand, it’s a good idea to ask questions directly.

A good retailer will have no problem providing details about sourcing, materials or manufacture.

Guilt-free shopping doesn’t have to mean spending more or sacrificing on style, as the list shows.

What it may require is a little more time to seek out specialists and items that may be made in small batches or to order.

Aerende half glaze teapot: £70, Aerende

Emily Mathieson’s non-profit online shop is full of beautiful products made by people in the UK facing social challenges.

The verdict: Ethical homewares

Fairtrade often makes you think of far-flung places, but the positive impact of Aerende’s products starts at home. The teapot is an example of how a product can have a life-changing impact on communities in the UK, but it’s also a quality piece in itself.

"In a cultural climate where no one would be seen dead without a reusable water bottle and veganism is the mot du jour, it’s becoming increasingly uncomfortable for many of us to buy into brands that fall so short of our values – and fast fashion is one of the worst offenders.

There is no question that with the amount of information out there, we can no longer claim to be ignorant to the impact that our high street clothes have on the world around us. But trying to be more ethical in our purchases is easier said than done.

When you’re in desperate need of a pair of jeans to replace the ones you’ve worn to death, or a smart-looking top for a job interview, or despite all will power you’ve just fallen in love with the latest trend of the season, the vintage option just isn’t going to cut it.

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.

Shopping ethically can be time consuming. Hours spent trawling through charity shops and trying to replicate Pinterest DIYs could probably be better spent elsewhere, but with so much conflicting information out there it can be hard to work out where is a positive space to shop and where a swipe of your credit card will get you a one-way ticket to Unwokeland.

Work out what your priorities are

You’re going to struggle to find a brand that is independently owned by a non-problematic CEO, one which embraces diversity and gives most of its profits to charity, while manufacturing locally out of organic fabrics hand-treated with natural dye, committed to being carbon neutral and using only recycled materials for packaging.

The most important thing to work out is what your main concerns are: are they humanitarian issues, business ethics, sustainability, animal rights, inclusivity or something else entirely? It’s OK to prioritise the issues and have one or two that you stand firm on, while others you may be willing to compromise over.

Don’t be fooled by confusing terminology

The first thing many of us will do is go to a brand’s website, and a good rule of thumb is to exclude any company that doesn’t have any mention of its supply chain, ethics or sustainability credentials.

For brands, focusing on these areas comes at a cost, so they are going to want to shout about it. If you can’t find any information, it’s probably for a reason.

It becomes a bit more complicated when brands make nebulous claims about being “responsible” without really explaining what they mean by that. In these cases, sometimes it’s worth contacting the brands directly if there’s a particular area you’re interested in finding out more about, such as what their manufacturing process is, how they package their products, or how many people on their board are not straight white men. Contacting them on social media can often be the most efficient way to get the information you need.

Consider the cost

This is not information anyone wants to hear but the reality is that being ethical doesn’t come cheap. If you’re buying a T-shirt for under £5 it’s unlikely that the brand is undercutting itself – the profit margin is coming from somewhere, and it’s probably by paying incredibly low prices for the manufacturing labour or using cheap materials which are not sourced sustainably.

If the price seems too good to be true, it probably is. At the same time, absolutely don’t assume that a high price point is an indicator of ethics any more than it is quality. It’s always worth doing further research, but a super low price can be a good disqualifier.

Check the materials

If you want to make sure your garments are eco-friendly, fabric is crucial. Organic cotton is one of the most popular options among sustainable brands, and while it’s better than synthetic alternatives, it still requires a huge amount of water to manufacture.

Fabrics such as linen, hemp, silk, or even bamboo are much more sustainable.

Leather is a tricky one. From an animal rights perspective you may want to steer clear, but environmentally some argue that it’s less damaging than many “vegan” alternatives which are made from unrecyclable plastics sourced from fossil fuel. Where possible, aim for recycled leather which was a byproduct of the meat industry.

Dyes also matter, and natural options are always preferable as they won’t include many of the toxic chemicals which can be incredibly harmful to the environment and the workers handling them.

Aim local

There are some great brands based overseas which offer sustainable, ethical options, but if it’s being shipped halfway across the world, the carbon footprint of each item is going to be huge, especially if you plan on returning any of it.

Where possible, try and shop locally. The jury is still out on whether having items delivered is more sustainable than buying them yourself, but if you’re not using a car purchasing something made locally is probably your best bet.

Make third-party websites part of your shopping experience

Tools such as Rank a Brand, aVoid, the Higg Index, Good On You, the Fashion Transparency Index and the Environmental Working Group have done a lot of the work for you, rating big-name brands based on carefully considered objective criteria. If in doubt, always double check.

Certifications from organisations such as Fairtrade or Soil Association are helpful, but when it comes to smaller brands be aware that they might not have the resources to apply for them, and they cannot guarantee beyond their specific remit.

Become familiar with CSRs

Most big brands will have some sort of CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) guidelines on their website. Beware that much of this can be marketing fluff. If they’re “working towards” a goal, or “aiming to achieve” another that’s great for them, but they’re clearly not there yet.

Similarly, complying with local labour laws is not a badge of honour, it’s a basic legal requirement; if they are donating “a portion of their profits” to a charitable cause, try and find out what that portion actually is; and if it says the products are “made locally”, make sure that includes the entirety of the manufacturing process, rather than just the final touches.

You want to look for statements which show they are going above and beyond, by using exclusively recycled materials, for example, or paying their workers above minimum wage, offering additional benefits and trying to give back to local communities.

While this can feel overwhelming, it can help you build a wardrobe you’re proud of, and one that can really make a difference. As consumers in a ruthless capitalist society, the best way we have of affecting change is by voting with our wallets – and doing so as loudly as possible."
"The BBC is launching a sustainable fashion and lifestyle brand based on its Blue Planet and Planet Earth series, in an effort to capitalise on viewers inspired by the shows and presenter David Attenborough’s warnings about the effect humankind is having on the world.

Eco-friendly clothing, homewares and books are being rolled out under the umbrella of BBC Planet, which will act as a kind of kitemark for those who want to change their buying habits and choose more sustainably made products.

The brand is kicking off during London fashion week with a collection of sustainable clothes, including sweatshirts from ethical producer Mother of Pearl, made using a dyeing process that uses 10 times less water than conventional methods.

Also on the cards are live BBC Planet hi-tech shows on a giant screen, as well as events and education programmes. The BBC hopes these meet the demand for more information from viewers, particularly younger ones, about how they can make more careful consumption choices.

It comes off the back of the effect Blue Planet II had on audiences after the series highlighted the scale of plastic pollution in oceans. It was the most-watched British TV show of 2017 and led to a greater awareness of the devastating effect humans have had on marine life. It had a political effect too, prompting the environment secretary, Michael Gove, to announce changes to recycling schemes and a consultation on banning plastic straws.

Coupled with Attenborough’s warnings about the damage humans are doing to the planet, most recently to global leaders at the Economic World Forum in Davos, the BBC said it wanted to help shoppers make ethical decisions.

Julia Kenyon, a global brands director at BBC studios, said: “The BBC is seeking to partner with trailblazers who are providing solutions to how we consume so that we as individuals can become a part of the solution and work towards a sustainable future.”

BBC Planet is expected to be well received at next week’s BBC Studios showcase, an annual sales event for the corporation’s shows. More than 1 billion people have watched Planet Earth, Blue Planet and their sequels, according to BBC figures. A scene in Planet Earth II some have called “Iguana v snakes” won most popular TV moment of 2017 at the Baftas.

The BBC recently announced a run of new natural history shows, including two fronted by Attenborough called Green Planet and One Planet, Seven Worlds. The move follows forays by competitors into the natural history television, including Netflix with Our Planet, a series also narrated by Attenborough.

Although much of BBC Planet will arguably come under the corporation’s public service mission, it will also make money at a time of expected cuts to funding. The BBC faces having to shoulder the cost of free TV licence fees for the over-75s.

Despite being funded by the licence fee, the BBC is allowed to make money through its commercial arm, BBC Studios. It makes millions of pounds by selling TV shows and merchandise around series such as Top Gear and Doctor Who."
"Major high street names including Primark, Boohoo and Missguided have come under fire for fuelling a throwaway fast fashion culture that has been linked to the exploitation of low-paid workers in UK factories.

Britons buy more new clothes than any other country in Europe and MPs are looking at the environmental and human cost of £2 and £200 T-shirts amid growing concerns the multibillion-pound fashion industry is wasting valuable resources and contributing to climate change.

The low prices in Primark stores, where T-shirts can cost as little as £2, were challenged by MPs on the Commons environmental audit select committee, who suggested shoppers viewed its clothing as disposable.

Ten ways to make fashion greener Read more

“Isn’t the real problem with the fast fashion industry that if you are selling stuff at £5 people aren’t going to treat it with any respect and at the end of its life it’s going to go in the bin?” asked the Labour MP Mary Creagh, the committee chair.

Paul Lister, Primark’s head of ethical trade and environmental sustainability, denied that was the case: “We are proud of the quality and durability of our garments. They are not bought to throw away.”

Lister said the retailer kept its prices low by shunning traditional advertising, which saved it about £150m compared with rivals and “that goes straight into price”. He said he knew of no one under 16 working in any of its supply factories.

“Factory to store, we keep our costs to the absolute minimum and in store we keep margins very tight,” he said. “Our business model takes us to a £2 T-shirt.”

While Primark was forced to defend its low prices, Burberry was scrutinised over its now-defunct policy of burning piles of unsold expensive clothes.

Leanne Wood, the brand’s chief people and corporate affairs officer, told MPs it was an industry-wide practice: “We’re the only luxury business that’s reported it in their accounts … but it is something that happens in the industry.”

Online retailers Asos, Boohoo and Missguided were questioned about the health checks carried out on the large number of Leicester factories they worked with.

An investigation by Channel 4’s Dispatches alleged last year UK factories supplying retailers such as River Island, New Look, Boohoo and Missguided were paying workers between £3 and £3.50 an hour. A Financial Times investigation (£) also found examples of exploitation in Leicester factories.

Creagh questioned how it was physically possible for Manchester-based Boohoo to sell UK-made dresses for £5 when the hourly minimum wage was £7.83.

The company’s joint chief executive Carol Kane said the company did not make any profit on the £5 dresses, which were “loss leaders” designed to attract shoppers to its website. The typically short dresses, made out of polyester and elastane, featured no zips or buttons, so were easy for machinists to run up, she said.

“We do not make a profit on a £5 dress,” said Kane, adding that the cost price of the garments was even less at £2.50 to £3. “It’s a loss leader. It’s a marketing tool designed to drive visitors to the website.”

Asos and Missguided told the hearing they had pulled production from a number of factories in Leicester that fell short of their standards.

The select committee is examining the impact of clothing production, ranging from environmental cost to worker conditions, especially when garments are produced cheaply and quickly in response to fast fashion trends.

With 300,000 tonnes of clothing sent to landfill every year in the UK, Primark said it would launch a clothing collection service in all its stores next year in a similar vein to Marks & Spencer’s “shwopping” scheme.

But Mike Barry, M&S’s head of sustainable business, said collecting unwanted clothes was not the biggest problem for the industry – it has collected 30m garments over the past decade – but what to to with them, given the lack of a domestic industry to process the material. “It is quite possible to prevent clothing going to landfill but much harder to do something with the fibres you recover.”

The environmental cost of UK fashion

Britons spend £52.7bn a year on fashion, according to the government-backed Waste and Resources Action Programme (Wrap). The lion’s share (£47.4bn) goes on clothing while £4.5bn is spent on accessories.

The amount of clothes bought each year continues to rise – 1.13m tonnes in 2016, up from 950,000 tonnes in 2012, according to a 2017 Wrap report.

The total carbon footprint of the clothing worn in the UK was 26.2m tonnes of CO2e in 2016, up 9% on 2012. The carbon footprint per tonne fell 8% but was outweighed by the increase in consumption.

About 1m tonnes of clothing is cleared out of wardrobes every year. Of that, 700,000 tonnes is collected for reuse and recycling with the remainder sent to landfill or incinerated, at an estimated cost of £82m.

In the UK, two-thirds of clothing is made from synthetic plastic materials, which are among the leading contributors to microplastic pollution. Up to 2,900 tonnes of microplastics from the washing of synthetic clothing such as fleeces could be passing through wastewater treatment into UK rivers and estuaries, according to a recent Friends of the Earth report."
"Wrangler has launched an innovative new type of denim that will eradicate water waste typically generated from conventional dyeing techniques.

It can require thousands of litres of water to make just one pair of jeans. The repetitive drip-and-dry dying method typically used in manufacturing uses numerous large vats of water that are then discarded after use.

The American label has created a new sustainable process in a bid to combat the environmental consequences of this.

The new technique, named Indigood, was created in partnership with Texas Tech University and a Spanish fabric mill in Valencia called Tejidos Royo.

It replaces water with foam to transfer dye onto yarns, thus using 60 per cent less energy than traditional denim dyeing methods.

Nanushka has been a firm brand favourite among sartorial fans since 2018 and championed by models Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid. Despite the influence of fashion fashion, Le Caer tells The Independent that brands like Nanushka “design eco-friendly collections that more often than not sell out in a matter of days, proving that style and sustainability can and do go hand in hand”. Nanushka 2/7 Veja V10 Sneakers Worn by Emma Watson and the Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle, the Veja V10 trainer is the first ever fully ethically-made product to enter Lyst’s latest index. Markle wore a pair of the shoes – made of raw sustainable materials - in Sydney in October 2018 and searches for the brand have increased by 113 per cent, year-on-year. The wild rubber used in the shoe is sourced from the Amazon rainforest, while the vegetable-tanned leather and organic cotton biodegrades over time. Net-a-porter 3/7 Patagonia Nano Puff® Hoody With a mission statement dedicated to causing no unneccesary harm to the Earth and implementing solutions to the environmental crisis, it was to be expected that an item from Patagonia would feature on the list. This year, it’s the 100 per cent recycled polyester and water resistant Nano Puff Hoody jacket that’s become one of women’s most wanted ethical products. Meanwhile, the brand’s Classic Retro-X fleece jacket reigns among the world’s most sought-after men’s products in Lyst’ Index report. Searches for the brand have increased 66 per cent over the past six months on Lyst. Absolute Snow 4/7 Stella McCartney x Stan Smith faux-leather trainers In September 2018, British fashion label Stella McCartney released its first ever vegetarian pair of Stan Smith trainers in collaboration with Adidas. The shoes are made from vegan leather, 100 per cent recycled polyester and feature stars running down the side. Six months following its launch, searchers for the brand rose 21 per cent on Lyst, making the style the most searched sustainable trainers on the website and the best selling product for the fashion brand. Stella McCartney’s designs have been worn on several occasions by Meghan Markle, who was seen 'recycling' a navy blue sustainable cape dress by the brand in Sydney, Australia during her royal tour of Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, and the Kingdom of Tonga last year. Net-a-porter 5/7 Reformation’s Gavin Dress Reformation clothing was dubbed the second most wanted Instagram brand in 2018 according to Lyst’s Year in Fashion report. This may have something to do with Meghan Markle, who was photographed on Australia’s Fraser Island wearing the eco-friendly brand’s ‘Pineapple’ dress in October 2018. Since then, the label’s Gavin dress has become the most page viewed item for the brand on Lyst from September to December. “When it comes to style, being more sustainable is all about taking a step back,” explains Le Caer. “And when the well-being of the planet is in the balance, it's something that's worth doing, no matter how busy our schedules might be.” TheReformation 6/7 Allbird Tree Runners One of the most in-demand pair of environmentally-friendly trainers over the last year has been the AllBirds Tree Runners. The shoes are made from a eucalyptus tree fiber which uses just five per cent of the water and a third of the amount of land when compared to traditional footwear materials. Meanwhile, the padded insoles are made out of merino wool. From January to March, searches for the brand were up 29 per cent on Lyst, while searches for “AllBirds shoes” have grown by 170 per cent, year-on-year. Allbirds 7/7 Weekday Row Sky Blue Jeans Searches for “sustainable denim” are high this year and have resulted in a 187 per cent increase in page views for sustainable denim brands on Lyst. Weekday jeans, made from 100 per cent organic cotton, were the most wanted jeans among sustainable denim, resulting in an 80 per cent increase in searches from September. Weekday 1/7 Nanushka Vegan Leather Puffer Coat Searches for this padded vegan leather design with front popper closures and side pockets have increased by 30 per cent on Lyst since the beginning of January. Nanushka has been a firm brand favourite among sartorial fans since 2018 and championed by models Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid. Despite the influence of fashion fashion, Le Caer tells The Independent that brands like Nanushka “design eco-friendly collections that more often than not sell out in a matter of days, proving that style and sustainability can and do go hand in hand”. Nanushka 2/7 Veja V10 Sneakers Worn by Emma Watson and the Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle, the Veja V10 trainer is the first ever fully ethically-made product to enter Lyst’s latest index. Markle wore a pair of the shoes – made of raw sustainable materials - in Sydney in October 2018 and searches for the brand have increased by 113 per cent, year-on-year. The wild rubber used in the shoe is sourced from the Amazon rainforest, while the vegetable-tanned leather and organic cotton biodegrades over time. Net-a-porter 3/7 Patagonia Nano Puff® Hoody With a mission statement dedicated to causing no unneccesary harm to the Earth and implementing solutions to the environmental crisis, it was to be expected that an item from Patagonia would feature on the list. This year, it’s the 100 per cent recycled polyester and water resistant Nano Puff Hoody jacket that’s become one of women’s most wanted ethical products. Meanwhile, the brand’s Classic Retro-X fleece jacket reigns among the world’s most sought-after men’s products in Lyst’ Index report. Searches for the brand have increased 66 per cent over the past six months on Lyst. Absolute Snow 4/7 Stella McCartney x Stan Smith faux-leather trainers In September 2018, British fashion label Stella McCartney released its first ever vegetarian pair of Stan Smith trainers in collaboration with Adidas. The shoes are made from vegan leather, 100 per cent recycled polyester and feature stars running down the side. Six months following its launch, searchers for the brand rose 21 per cent on Lyst, making the style the most searched sustainable trainers on the website and the best selling product for the fashion brand. Stella McCartney’s designs have been worn on several occasions by Meghan Markle, who was seen 'recycling' a navy blue sustainable cape dress by the brand in Sydney, Australia during her royal tour of Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, and the Kingdom of Tonga last year. Net-a-porter 5/7 Reformation’s Gavin Dress Reformation clothing was dubbed the second most wanted Instagram brand in 2018 according to Lyst’s Year in Fashion report.

Wrangler claims that Indigood is the most sustainable way to dye denim.

The brand has created nine pieces using Indigood, including jackets, shirts and classic straight-leg jeans, which will form part of the brand’s Icons autumn/winter 2019 collection. Prices range from £80 to £130.

In a statement, the brand explains how the denim industry has been lagging behind in terms of making key manufacturing changes to reduce its environmental impact.

“Despite incremental changes towards comfort and sustainability, over the past 150 years, the denim industry has had just a handful of groundbreaking innovations,” it reads.

“Among these was the invention of synthetic dyes, which allowed for indigo-dyed fabrics like denim to become mainstream fashion and workwear. But since the introduction of synthetic indigo in 1897, no innovation has truly revolutionized the industry, until now.”

Wrangler, which is owned by Kontoor Brands, hopes that other denim brands will adopt its new foam-dyeing technique and revealed that it’s working with denim mills across Asia and North America to roll the technology out on a larger scale.

There are already plans in place for denim label Lee, also owned by Kontoor, to adopt the technique in due course."

"I have long wanted to get a special T-shirt printed for our national bi-annual fashion showcase. It would read: “I went to London fashion week and all I got was this lousy (unsustainable) T-shirt.” A pale form of dissent, I know, but it would probably generate some Insta likes and at least be a way to echo my frustration that the four premier global fashion jamborees (London, New York, Paris and Milan) continue to celebrate a system of production and consumption that is spinning us ever closer to ecological Armageddon.

I had better get a move on with my T-shirt before London fashion week (LFW) is cancelled. Because the environmental group Extinction Rebellion has seized the initiative, writing to the British Fashion Council (BFC), conveners of London fashion week, demanding it is scrapped in favour of “a people’s assembly of industry professionals and designers as a platform to declare a climate and ecological emergency”. It is too early to speculate on what format this might take, but it is not a scenario brimming with immediate Frow (front row) appeal. That is to say, it is hard to imagine fashion influencers, the Insta-elite and bloggeratti, including Kylie Jenner et al, stampeding to take part in a town hall meeting on Arctic melt rates. But Extinction Rebellion is not likely to be fazed by such frivolous objections. It is deadly serious, on account of the deadly nature of runaway climate change.

The fashion sector has been in Extinction Rebellion’s sights for a while. In February 2019, at the last LFW, the group formed a human blockade around venues to highlight the excessive carbon footprint of the industry and to force the BFC to declare a climate emergency. Two prominent members, Sara Arnold – founder of the fashion rental company Higher Studios – and the fashion designer Clare Farrell are former industry insiders. Farrell was a mentor for one of LFW’s outstanding designers in February, Bethany Williams. Williams’s social-justice themed collection was shown on the runway shortly before she received the Queen’s Award for British Design. Unfortunately, Farrell was not there to see it: she had been removed from the queue for the show by the police, who recognised her as a protester.

But Extinction Rebellion’s desire to up the ante is not motivated by revenge or spite. (Farrell was sanguine after the incident. “Oh well,” she said, “at least I don’t have to go through the rigmarole of an FOI request to find out if I’m on the domestic terrorism list.”) This is not about payback. When you get your mandate from the planet (as Extinction Rebellion might claim), there is no escaping the fact that the fashion system as it stands is unsustainable.

While for decades it managed to swerve any implication that it was anything other than fabulous, increased scrutiny of its environmental impact has proved startling. An industry that depends on the growing of cotton – a pesticide-dependent and highly thirsty crop – and the cracking of oil for synthetic fibres, inevitably has a huge impact. Over the past decade, production has intensified. Globally, we now produce in excess of an estimated 100bn new garments a year, almost all from virgin resources. These garments stay in our lives for an increasingly short space of time, becoming waste (with yet more impact). Even the industry-friendly Pulse report conceded earlier this year that fashion is failing to counterbalance the harmful impact of an ever-swelling clothing inventory and continues to be a net contributor to climate change. By 2050, without radical action, the global textile industry will be accountable for one quarter of all carbon emissions. As Extinction Rebellion organisers recently made clear in a talk at the Port Eliot festival, the emissions alone give them a mandate for decisive action. This business is their business.

Quick guide London fashion week Show Hide London fashion week Started in the 1980s, London Fashion Week is organised by the British Fashion Council. It takes place four times a year, in February and September for womenswear and January and June for menswear. February showcases autumn and winter looks, while September’s focus is on the following spring and summer seasons Around 14,000 people attend each year, including press and buyers, and the designers exhibiting include major heritage brands as well as emerging talent.

After the main event has ended, the 4-day London Fashion Week Festival takes place. This allows consumers and shoppers a chance to experience the shows and view collections.



But their move to cancel fashion week has caused a backlash. Judging by the flood of messages I have received – including from sustainable fashion campaigners – many think this is just too extreme. Some of the angst stems from a genuine worry that this will harm people (particularly young British designers who need the leg-up publicity from LFW’s NewGen platform to launch their careers). Then there is the much trumpeted fact that the UK fashion industry is a cash cow for the economy, contributing a reputed £32bn each year. To remove a linchpin event that – according to the BFC – secures more that £90m in global media coverage and generates more than £100m worth of orders of new clothes each year, would surely be a crazy move.

But isn’t that precisely the point? It wouldn’t be fair to say the BFC has ignored sustainability or the reduction of carbon emissions. Every season, at least one designer with sustainable values is profiled to the heavens. For many years, LFW ran Estethica, a dedicated wing of the show profiling sustainable fashion (although it was often housed in a rather hard-to-get-to wing of Somerset House). But these designers and initiatives are the exception, not the norm. Elsewhere, the 60 catwalks over six days perpetuate business as usual. This means studiously avoiding talking about the central problem: volume. Year on year, so much product is being thrown out into the marketplace that it is a wonder any designer can sell anything at all, and it is pretty obvious that the environment will never win.

Of course we should think about the effect on the next generation of design talent, many of whom have spent thousands of pounds on a fashion degree at one of the UK’s highly rated establishments – some of which include sustainability as part of their curriculum. But maybe this is a good opportunity to assess whether the current mechanism built around February and September shows is actually serving them. I suggest it isn’t.

We tend to regard the path to LFW unquestioningly, a little bit like those old-time Judy Garland films when an ingenue must get to Broadway to achieve their dreams. But in the fashion world, even those budding designers who get picked up as a talent can find themselves in a vicious and financially draining cycle. Even if you win a talent bursary, it doesn’t cover the thousands of pounds in subsequent seasons, when you are no longer the hot new talent, to rent showrooms in order to attract buyers to secure orders. Although the media outcry around fashion weeks has largely focused on the exploitation of models, many of whom are unpaid, you don’t have to go far to find designers who are similarly disillusioned.

You could argue fashion weeks are displaying all the pitfalls of late-stage capitalism, and remarkably few benefits. Yet we cling to them. This reflects a reluctance to admit we need systematic change, a complacency that is deep-rooted and happens in every sector. But in fashion there exists an assumption that it is enough to work with the industry and just tweak the supply chain toward sustainability – for instance, through the odd recycling initiative or sustainable collection. Basically, we want things a bit like now, but less bad. Extinction Rebellion’s stance shakes this assumption to the core.

There is also a precedent. Last month, the Swedish Fashion Council cancelled the 28th Stockholm fashion week. Looking at the reality of a fashion week in the context of a climate and ecological emergency led organisers to conclude that they needed to shut the event down until they could remodel it to be truly sustainable.

As to what that means, over the past year we have increasingly seen an evidence-based lens applied to the fashion industry by academics and institutions such as the UK’s Union for Concerned Researchers in Fashion. Academic researchers map the industry against the reality of how ecological systems actually work. Once you apply this framing, you move towards real sustainable options, namely curtailing production and consumption – that which fashion weeks are traditionally allergic to doing. If this smacks of deprivation, imagine focusing on a different system of circulating and using clothes, such as the rental model. Runway-dominated fashion weeks only allow for clothes to be celebrated when they are new. Why not celebrate a different phase?

But that’s for a future conversation. London fashion week’s day of reckoning is both logical and overdue and we should heed Extinction Rebellion’s call to mothball it. Don’t be scared: embrace the change."
"news, latest-news,

When it comes to slow, ethical and sustainable fashion Emma Morris knows there are enough facets that sometimes ""you can start to do your head in a little bit with trying to make it perfect"". This is why she's asking Canberrans not to be perfect, but to question their purchases and work towards making better choices. It's something that will come easily to those attending this weekend's Slow Fashion Market. Founded by Morris, the one-day event will bring together more than 30 independent brands, featuring men's, women's and children's new clothing and accessories, all of which are both ethically and sustainably produced. ""You go into a shopping centre or places and it all looks the same, it's actually quite expensive to buy fast fashion stuff - it's not always cheap - and you're not necessarily knowing who made it or if the quality is any good,"" Morris said. ""What is exciting about doing a market like this, the person who made it or the brand representative is standing there. ""You can actually talk to them about it and get so much more context for the stuff that you are going to buy, and it's really exciting how many people want to buy that way, and are choosing to come to the market and support it."" READ MORE: The event was inspired by Fashion Revolution, a global movement birthed from the Rana Plaza collapse in Bangladesh in 2013. The event saw more than 1100 garment workers die and thousands more injured when a factory collapsed due to structural failure. Since then, Fashion Revolution has been calling for greater transparency, sustainability and ethics in the fashion industry. The change in consumer attitudes has led Morris - who also runs two other sustainable markets - to the realisation that there was potential for a market for ethical fashion that wasn't secondhand. ""Secondhand clothing absolutely has its place and I love it, and I have loved it for a really long time but you can't always get what you need,"" she said. ""So if you're going to buy something new, more and more people want to know [what they're getting] and they're getting what I would call fast-fashion fatigue. ""I just felt like the timing was right [for this market] and people were not only producing stuff that was fitting but I could see there was the consumer demand, and people were starting to ask a lot more questions about how their clothes were made and how they made them."" For some of the stalls at Saturday's market, ethical fashion means local production - items that are made in Australia in short runs. For others, they take it a step further and focus on only using sustainable materials such as hemp. But at the heart of it, Morris says it's simply about people ""taking that time to question who made it or what it's made of, or who made my clothes"". ""What we've tried to concentrate on is the movement and the step towards making better decisions is just as important as the overall campaign.""

"Australia's retail industry is struggling but Canberra is offering a glimmer of hope

Updated

Activewear brand SKINS has filed for bankruptcy; Gap has left Australian shores; Kmart sales are down; the Avon lady is no more.

Across Australia the retail sector is suffering, but in Canberra there is a glimmer of hope.

Retail spending increased more in the ACT than anywhere else in the country in November last year, and experts said it was the growing interest in local products, sold in pop-up stores and at markets, proving Canberrans still loved to shop.

The ""maker to market"" movement has cemented itself in Canberra's retail scene as the ideal way, not only to connect with local businesses, but to shop sustainably, simply, and with heart.

""I think Canberra is at the forefront of this renaissance,"" Gabe Trew, co-owner of Pop CBR in New Acton's Nishi precinct, said.

Initially set to open just for the month of December to make the most of the Christmas trade, Pop CBR proved such a hit with Canberrans that they extended their lease.

""There was essentially a real push from people saying 'we don't want you to close, we want somewhere to go to be able to buy all those local things',"" Mr Trew said.

""There's a strong community of local artists and makers who have been able to mobilise their businesses through markets, and through a community that is really conscious of their buying.""

'People are looking for uniqueness'

Russell Zimmerman, from the Australian Retailers Association, said Canberrans were not alone in altering their buying habits.

""As a community, generally we are becoming more conscious,"" Mr Zimmerman said.

""What we're seeing at the moment is that consumers want to buy things that are ethically sourced, and local makers — artisans — fill a very niche market.

""We're seeing a lot of growth in that area. They can assure customers, for example, that there's no slave labour, or that the coffee is fair trade.

""They go out of their way to ensure the product is high quality, and you get a product you can trust.""

Mr Zimmerman said in the lead up to Christmas and in the post-Christmas sales, people actively turned back to small businesses to do their shopping.

""We're seeing it across the board, with anything from a local coffee shop, to a clothing retailer. People are looking for uniqueness,"" he said.

Products that 'spark joy'

If it is uniqueness consumers are looking for, Canberra's local makers provide it in buckets.

Pop CBR is one of several stores across the ACT region devoted to selling local wares, with over 50 brands stocked in the one store alone.

Customers can purchase everything from gin to chocolate to jewellery to ceramics to clothes, with the additional benefit of knowing exactly where their money is going.

""Local products resonate with people strongly,"" Mr Trew said.

""They feel direct value from spending money on a local product; you're buying an object that will, for want of a better phrase, 'spark joy' because of who made it and why they made it, because of the story.""

'They've got an attachment to their clothing again'

The concept of ""sparking joy"" may have been made popular by Marie Kondo, but local fashion designer Kelli Donovan said it was nothing new.

One half of Pure Pod, Ms Donovan launched her latest line Native Pollen in November and has been operational for 12 years.

""Marie Kondo is hitting the nail on the head with something we've been talking about for ages,"" she said.

""People want a connection, they want to love, they want to feel joy in the product, [they] are sick of constantly buying.

""With maker to market, a consumer can go and meet you and talk to you about the product and they've got an attachment back to their clothing again.""

Ms Donovan said Canberrans, particularly, were sick of the big chain stores.

""In Canberra there's a thirst for something that's a bit different,"" she said.

""They are getting sick of cheap fast fashion and all the stories that go behind that.

""There's a lot of pollution and waste, oversupply, over-manufacturing, there's a huge landfill problem. I didn't want to be part of the problem, I wanted to be part of the solution in the fashion industry.

""I understand that people can't always afford small, artisan work, but I think people are becoming more concerned about what's going on with the environment, what's going on with climate change, and they just don't want as much stuff.""

Buying local, sustainable doesn't mean more expensive

But according to Mr Zimmerman, the notion that buying local, sustainable and ethical products meant they were unaffordable was a myth.

""It's actually not that much more expensive,"" he said. ""Not every customer can do it, but there's a big enough slice of the market who can, and we're seeing this more and more.

""The consumer is smart, they don't want to be ripped off, and they're prepared to pay extra to get something good for them and the environment.""

That concept is backed by the business owners themselves.

""We want to say that local shopping doesn't have to be exorbitant,"" Mr Trew said.

""People really like supporting the community, particularly in Canberra, so they'll pay the extra few dollars. If you support the makers and buy local, prices come down.

""It a nice cycle. The more you shop local the more affordable it becomes.""

"The average Briton buys enough clothes to fill a large suitcase every year - more than any other nationality in Europe.

The scale of purchases was highlighted by MPs as they demanded retailers take action over 'fast fashion' - high street knock-offs of catwalk couture only designed to last for a few months.

British people splash out on some 26.7kg of clothing annually - up dramatically on a decade ago and almost double that of Italians, despite their reputation for being obsessed with style.

Germans came closest to UK residents, buying 16.7kg a year, according to analysis of eight countries by the European Clothing Action Plan project.

The scale of purchases was highlighted by MPs as they demanded retailers take action over 'fast fashion' - high street knock-offs of catwalk couture only designed to last for a few months

The Environmental Audit Committee pointed to the research as it warned that hundreds of thousands of tonnes of clothing are being dumped each year.

The MPs have asked bosses at 10 leading UK clothes shops to reveal their environmental record as part of an investigation.

Committee chairwoman Mary Creagh has written to bosses at companies including Marks & Spencer, Primark, Next, Tesco, Asda and Sports Direct.

She said: 'The way we design, produce and discard our clothes has a huge impact on our planet.

'Fashion and footwear retailers have a responsibility to minimise their environmental footprint and make sure the workers in their supply chains are paid a living wage.

'We want to hear what they are doing to make their industry more sustainable.'

Responses will help the committee investigate how the UK's fashion industry - worth £28billion a year to the UK economy - can reduce its environmental footprint.

The committee's latest report also shows ocean pollution from synthetic fibres, as a single washing machine load can release 700,000 fibres to wastewater, according to research from the University of Plymouth.

Environment Audit Committ chair Mary Creagh (pictured) has asked bosses at 10 leading UK clothes shops to reveal their environmental record as part of an investigation

Up to 90 per cent of garment workers are paid below the National Minimum Wage, do not have employment contracts, and are subject to intense and arbitrary work practices, the committee was told by from the British Retail Consortium.

The global fashion industry produced more CO2 emissions than international flights and maritime shipping combined in 2015, according to a submission from the Institute of Mechanical Engineers.

The committee expects to invite some of the biggest retailers into Parliament for further questioning from November."

Nannacay

Launched by Brazilian designer Marcia Kemp in 2014, Nannacay – the Aymara word for sisterhood – has become well-known for its handwoven basket bags that are embellished with cascades of colourful pom-poms.

But Nannacay is much more than a brand, it’s a social fashion project.

Nannacay provides economic opportunities for a collective of 200 artisans in Peru, Ecuador and Brazil by implementing training and workshops on skills development and finance management.

Style influencers Pandora Sykes and Man Repeller are reportedly fans.

Stella McCartney

As a vegetarian brand, Stella McCartney promotes a cruelty-free ethos and continues to innovate ways of creating sustainable materials.

The brand never uses leather, fur or feathers and is even exploring new ways of creating silk using pioneering biotechnology.

Just part of a commitment to leading “a responsible, honest and modern company”, Stella McCartney also relies on resilient supply chains that provide desirable jobs, foster people’s skills, strengthen workers’ voices and advocate for vulnerable groups.

Veja

Veja is a French brand that has a strong focus on transparency, fair trade and social and environmental responsibility.

It sources all of its natural rubber directly from seringueiro communities in the Amazon rainforest to save on water, energy and harmful emissions, and also collaborates with the factory that produces its sneakers to ensure the best work practices.

A must-have for fashion fans, Lyst reports that searches for Veja have increased by 113 per cent over the last year, largely thanks to the Duchess of Sussex sporting a pair during a trip to Sydney.

Ninety Percent

A London-based label that launched in 2018, Ninety Percent vows to distribute 90 per cent of its profits between charitable causes.

Ninety Percent makes its products from sustainable materials such as organic cotton, recycled polyester and sustainable alternatives to conventional viscose like Tencel and EcoVera.

All of its garments are made in excellent manufacturing facilities that place workers’ welfare as key to their business values, both in Bangladesh and Turkey.

Leigh Miller

Sculptural jewellery designer Leigh Miller launched her collection in 2014 after working as a designer for Calvin Klein.

Inspired by natural patterns and forms translated into metal, Miller uses the lost art of wax casting, which involves sculpting her pieces in molten wax before hand-hammering them into organic forms.

Every piece is designed and crafted locally in Los Angeles from a range of metals including brass and bronze, sterling silver, pink, and yellow gold.

Mother of Pearl

Mother of Pearl is committed to complete tractability across its supply chains, sourcing sustainable fibres like organic wool, organic cotton and Tencel for its collections.

Sustainability has been a lifelong passion of designer Amy Powney, who has made it her mission to make Mother of Pearl ethically conscious in all that it does, including using the best factories and suppliers.

The brand launched a special capsule collection of nine pieces with BBC Earth, made with “peace silk” – a material that is produced from silkworm cocoons without killing the worm inside – as well as eco-friendly dyes and textiles certified by the Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) and the National Program for Organic Production.

Maggie Marilyn

Determined to be a fashion brand that is compliant with the New Zealand government’s plan to be a carbon-zero country by 2050, Maggie Marilyn is doing its bit in a number of different ways.

Designing with this in mind, the majority of its products are produced near its studio in New Zealand and made from ethically considered materials, including GOTS-certified organic cotton, organic wool and recycled polyester.

In 2018, Maggie Marilyn also converted all of its dispatch plastic packaging to organic compostable packaging made from cassava root and sourced from a local New Zealand company.

Mara Hoffman

Mara Hoffman crafts each of its collections in socially responsible conditions using ethically sourced fabrics.

Each garment is made from certified organic and recycled fabrics; the brand also ensures that all people involved in the manufacturing process are treated fairly and respectfully along the way.

As part of the basic requirements of doing business with the brand, it requires every factory it partners with to adhere to internationally accepted environmental and human rights standards for responsible production.

Laura Lombardi

Laura Lombardi is committed to local manufacturing, with most of her pieces made in New York, where she works with a Brooklyn-based brass mill.

Each item of jewellery is also handcrafted from a mix of new, recycled and reclaimed metals that the designer finds on her travels.

The brand’s range of clean, minimal jewellery plays with proportion and scale, and includes everything from chain-link necklaces to hoop earrings.

Baserange

Womenswear brand Baserange is underpinned by a strong belief that sustainable products should not be a luxury. This philosophy has led to the affordable pricing of its garments.

The brand works exclusively with small, family-based factories, with whom it has built a close, trusting and lasting relationship, and uses natural fibres, such as bamboo and organic cotton.

Baserange focuses on wardrobe basics that are intended to last, thanks to their high quality and timeless designs. Its line-up includes lingerie, oversized T-shirts, swimwear and shirt dresses."
"The question of what to wear has earned Riley Kucheran, a member of Biigtigong Nishnaabeg, formerly known as the Ojibways of the Pic River First Nation, Ont., a 2019 Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation scholarship.

""It's really an incredible honour, and I'm very grateful,"" said the doctoral student at Ryerson University in Toronto, who is examining the effects of colonization on Indigenous clothing.

Kucheran's research shows that almost ""immediately upon contact"" with Europeans, traditional clothing starts to changes, even being used ""as a weapon in the colonization process,"" he said.

'Stripping away' clothing, stripping identity

""For example, in the residential schools, traditional clothing was taken away from the children and the kids were forced to wear more Western clothes – suits or corset and things like that – and that was just part of the assimilation process, this literal stripping away of our clothing, so in that process I think a lot of our own traditional Indigenous design was also taken away.""

Kucheran said he is interested in bringing back traditional designs.

The foundation grant will help cover his tuition and research costs as well as provide a travel allowance, so he can travel across Canada and gather information from a variety of Indigenous designers and clothing experts about the kind of supports they need and where they see the industry going in the future.

Indigenous design 'sustainable'

""The fashion industry is so powerful, we all participate in fashion, we all wear clothing, but it's really destroying the planet. It's the number two polluting industry. It's really doing a lot of damage, textile-waste for example is everywhere. But Indigenous design is inherently sustainable, both socially and environmentally, "" Kucheran said.

In mainstream fashion, clothes are mass-produced and there is little connection between the designer, the manufacturer and the consumer.

But with Indigenous design, because it is rooted in community, said Kucheran, ""you know every single person.""

""You know the hunter who caught it, or the trapper. You know the hide tanner. You know the beadwork artist. You have a personal and intimate relationship with every single step and every single person who touched that clothing so you can then make sure that they're getting paid fair wages or that the hunters are knowledgeable enough and respectful enough to not overhunt. That's the kind of difference you get with Indigenous design.""

Identify where it comes from

Riley Kucheran is a doctoral student from Northwestern Ontario who's recently won a prestigious honour. His field of study is the effect of colonization on indegenous clothing. 7:00

Kucheran also believes his research can shed light on the cultural appropriation debate, which ""has been a double-edge sword. Yes, it's brought awareness to Indigenous design but also now people are afraid to wear Indigenous items because they worry people are going to call them out.""

What matters, said Kucheran, is where the clothing comes from. Be cautious when buying an Indigenous-themed item at a chain store, ""but if you can identify where it comes from, you know the artist, you know who made it.. be proud to wear it!""

According to its website, the foundation selected 20 Canadian PhD students, ""who are hungry to play a leadership role in their communities and help inspire positive change. This year's recipients were chosen based on their compelling research that contributes to one or more of the Foundation's four themes. They will embark on a three-year journey that will foster their development as leaders and offer critical reflection on the subject of Power & Knowledge."""
"New York (CNN Business) Retailers are waking up to a $21 billion industry they have mostly ignored for years: Plus-size women's clothing.

More than half of US women ages 18 to 65 wear a size 14 or higher, according to statistics cited by Walmart. Analysts expect that number to grow.

Yet extended sizes represent less than a fifth of women's overall clothing sales, retail think tank Coresight Research estimated in a report earlier this year.

Top retailers are racing to strengthen their selection to capture new shoppers and meet increasing demand for trendy women's clothing in a broader range of sizes.

For example, Walmart ( WMT ) bought plus-size clothing brand Eloquii last week. Eloquii makes clothes exclusively for women sizes 14 and above. The move was Walmart's latest move into the plus-size industry: The company launched Terra & Sky, a private label brand, earlier this year. And Modcloth, the startup Walmart bought last year, sells extended sizes.

Other companies have taken mixed approaches to bolster their plus-size assortment.

Old Navy announced a ""Size YES"" campaign and will bring its formerly online-only plus collection to 75 stores. J Crew is partnering with Universal Standard for expanded sizes on a fall and winter collection.

Nordstrom ( JWN ) is trying to eliminate gaps in sizes by adding more 14, 16 and 18 choices at 30 stores, with 100 brands. It's also adding more signs in stores that highlight the options and featuring a broader range of mannequins.

""Brands and retailers are now seeing plus-size as a significant growth opportunity,"" said Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData Retail. ""What was once a specialist segment is now becoming mainstream.""

Walmart bought Eloquii last week for a reported $100 millon.

'She was not recognized'

For years, brands, fashion designers, and retailers have failed to offer fashionable plus-size styles, analysts say.

Choices have been mostly limited to oversized tops and dresses and stretchy leggings. ""Things that cover rather than highlight and flaunt,"" said Elizabeth Shobert, director of marketing and digital strategy at fashion analytics company StyleSage

Stores marginalized shoppers searching for extended sizes by displaying a sparse assortment in separate sections at the back or on higher floors. Many high-end designer brands have been unwilling to make clothes in extended sizes. Shoppers have had to rely on specialty stores like Lane Bryant and Catherines to find variety and innovative clothes.

""This customer was not thought about. She was not recognized,"" said Eloquii CEO Mariah Chase. ""The options that were given to her were subpar and a sea of sameness. There was a fear among retailers of taking real risks in terms of design and fit.""

Eloquii was founded in 2011 by The Limited. In 2013, The Limited shut it down, but the brand quickly relaunched as an independent direct-to-consumer online seller.

Riding a loyal customer base eager for contemporary looks, Eloquii's sales have tripled since 2015 with a mix of tailored basic and on-trend dresses, tops, pants, jackets, and lingerie.

""Our goal was to wake up an industry that was not being inclusive of a customer that wanted to buy fashion,"" Chase said. Eloquii has recently launched a workwear line and is collaborating with designer Jason Wu on a fall collection.

Eloquii's sales have tripled since 2015.

Designing the right fit

While retailers have poured money into research and technology to stay ahead of trends in so-called standard sizes, they have often lacked creativity in introducing plus-size clothing.

Shobert said many brands have struggled to answer basic questions with their extended sizes: Do you price a size 24 the same as a 2? Where do you put the clothes in the store and online?

Producing the right fit has also been problematic. When making an item of clothing, retailers usually take an average size and scale the dimensions up and down. But that has led to poor-fitting clothing in extended sizes.

""You have to have the right kind of talent, design, and product development that have worked with plus sizes and understand some of these specific challenges,"" Shobert added. ""Some companies haven't necessarily had that.""

Higher manufacturing costs have held back the plus-size segment, too. More fabric is used when producing extended sizes and additional design and fabrication expenses can come into play during the process, according to Saunders from GlobalData Retail.

""If the volume isn't there, then it is hard to make the business model work,"" he said.

#EffYourBeautyStandards

The success of mid-priced, plus-size online retailers like Eloquii, Evli, Torrid, Gwynnie Bee and Dia & Co. have forced big brands and retailers to renew their attention on the industry.

Online shopping opened up new opportunities for both sellers and customers: Brands previously hesitant to showcase their plus sizes on store floors could easily offer them on their websites, said Jane Hali, a retail analyst for Jane Hali & Associates who has been following the industry since the 1980s.

""There is a feeling of embarrassment having to shop for clothes in a separate store or department,"" she said. ""Plus-size consumers prefer to shop a retailer's core offer rather than a specific plus-size sub-brand.""

Under pressure to grow, retailers have reacted to shoppers who demanded more authentic-looking advertising. They're also responding to the rise of social media influences like Tess Holliday and Ashley Graham, and body-inclusivity movements like #EffYourBeautyStandards.

""Women who wear plus sizes have been vocal in recent years, particularly on social media, about their desire to buy fashionable, trendy clothes in the same fabrics and styles as offered in so-called straight sizes,"" Deborah Weinswig, founder and chief executive of Coresight Research, said in a report.

Eloquii's Chase noted that the ""power dynamic has been upended"" between brands and women who want more inclusive sizes. ""This customer said, 'Why aren't you serving me?'"""
"Written by Fiona Sinclair Scott, CNN Oxfordshire, England

Fashion is a powerful tool. Covering our bodies in clothes or adornments is an almost universal behavior, and how you dress is one of the most obvious indicators of who you are.

Show me a list of people, and the fashion brands they buy from or engage with, and I could easily produce a series of assumptions about each one. I might make an educated guess about their spending power, or how fashion-conscious they are (or aren't). I might even be able to give you a sense of their character -- at least, I'd feel fairly confident distinguishing the peacocks from the shrinking violets.

Speaking at The Business of Fashion's Voices conference in the UK on Thursday, data analyst and Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie took this relatively simple idea to its worrying but logical extension: Like any tool, he said, fashion can become a weapon in the wrong hands.

""Fashion data was used to build AI models to help Steve Bannon build his insurgency and build the alt-right,"" he told the conference. ""We used weaponized algorithms. We used weaponized cultural narratives to undermine people and undermine the perception of reality. And fashion played a big part in that.""

He would certainly know. As research director at Cambridge Analytica, Wylie used data harvested from 87 million Facebook users to produce algorithms that he says influenced the 2016 US presidential election. And having previously worked toward a PhD in fashion trend forecasting, he knew that someone's choice of clothing is one of the best ways to unpick their identity.

On stage, Wylie explained how people's preferences for fashion brands on social media were used to target specific groups with right-wing political messages. Although he has previously divulged how people's online activity was used to predict political leanings, it was the first time that he publicly detailed fashion's role -- and importance -- in Cambridge Analytica's models.

During his presentation, Wylie showed various charts and graphics demonstrating how the now-defunct firm mapped clothing brands against personality traits.

""There are strong relationships between the brands, style and aesthetics that people engage with, and how they see themselves and their identity,"" Wylie said during the talk.

Brands like Wrangler, the jeans company, and the American student favorite Abercrombie & Fitch were compared and contrasted. Wrangler is ""more cowboy, older,"" and more ""modest"" than Abercrombie, Wylie said. People who like yoga-wear brand Lululemon ""are more extroverted,"" while L.L. Bean fans are conscientious but ""low in openness."" Other brands featured included Nike, Louis Vuitton, Burberry, Armani, H&M, Elle and Vogue.

The simple, palatable takeaway is that modest, traditional, conventional brands tend to be favored by those with more conservative ideals, while provocative, directional brands, like Kenzo, were more likely to be worn by the liberal-minded.

Targeting vulnerability

The idea that advertisers might target us based on the brands we like, follow, talk about or engage with is hardly new. Nor is the story that Cambridge Analytica used ""hyper-profiling"" to target different groups for political gain.

More interesting, however, is Wylie's claim that fashion preferences are statistically among the strongest indicators of our personalities -- and that they were a particular focus at Cambridge Analytica.

What makes this especially irksome is the emphasis on specific personality traits. Openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism (the ""big five"" identified in a psychological model known as OCEAN) were the key traits mentioned.

But others listed in the materials shared by Wylie included depression, anger and vulnerability. In other words, people were being segmented on the basis of their mental stability. Then, if they were considered vulnerable to persuasion, they were targeted with political messaging. This is where the story starts to take on dystopian overtones.

According to Wylie, and as reported by The Business of Fashion, ""consulting psychologists encouraged researchers at the firm to ask more questions on aesthetic and stylistic preferences for clothing as they were found to be strong signifiers of traits that were used as a primary means to identify people who were susceptible to joining the alt-right.""

Having helped create what he called -- in typically bellicose terms -- an ""informational weapon of mass destruction,"" Wylie then ended his talk by turning responsibility over to the fashion industry. Those in the room had ""created the battlefields"" of a culture war, he said before directly challenging them to fix the problem.

""We need you guys to do a better job at cultivating our cultural narratives, for our own national security and for the preservation of our democracy,"" he said.

""The shame, the colonialism, the racial biases, the toxic masculinity, the fat-shaming that industry puts out -- and has been putting out for decades -- is exactly what Cambridge Analytica sought to exploit when they were seeking to undermine people and manipulate them.""

The message, in simple terms: Stop making people feel bad, Fashion. It makes them easy targets for untoward digital dealings.

A call to arms

It was difficult to get a sense of how the CEOs and other fashion industry figures in the room felt about Wylie's rallying cry. There was loud clapping, and most people stood to cheer eventually, but the room didn't exactly shake. Just hours later, designer Alber Elbaz attracted a more kinetic reaction by ending his own talk by blasting out Aretha Franklin's ""Respect"" and dragging people up on stage for a dance.

Did Wylie tell the industry something it already knew? Or is this another case of negative news overload -- just another horrible story about the US presidential election and data?

There are, of course, fashion brands that understand how to balance looking good and doing good. Some of them were represented at the conference.

Stella McCartney, for instance, has been working towards sustainability in fashion for nearly 20 years, and she used the event to announce two new green initiatives: A United Nations charter for sustainable fashion, launching officially on December 10 at the UN's annual climate change conference, and Stella McCartney Cares Green, a new arm of her charity platform.

But whether the fashion industry has the power, or the collective desire, to defend us from the cultural cyber warfare foretold by Wylie, remains to be seen. The fashion world is already tackling a number of troubling issues right now: diversity and inclusion, the treatment of models, human rights in garment factories, sustainability, the fur question. Solving some of these would, indirectly, constitute a start, as it would help craft more positive narratives for brands in need, but the road looks long."
"The fashion designer may be known for one thing, but all that is set to change, as he makes 2019 his year

You are probably already familiar with Duran Lantink’s fashion designs, even if his name doesn’t ring a bell. The Amsterdam-based fashion designer is the creator of the infamous vagina trousers worn by Janelle Monáe last year in her music video Pynk.

Despite becoming the most talked-about trousers – and cultural yardsticks of 2018 – the wavy pink pants almost never happened. Lantink was drafted in by the director – his best friend – five days before the shoot was scheduled to start, after the previous wardrobe team left the project. The rest, as they say, is music-video history.

But dismiss him as a shock-tactic attention seeker at your own liability as 32-year-old Lantink is one of the most highly regarded rising stars of his generation, thanks to his redefinition of luxury through a sustainable lens.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Janelle Monáe in Duran Lantink’s vagina pants in the Pynk video.

“It was a blessing and a curse because I always end up in the ‘vagina pants’ conversation,” he laughs on the phone from Amsterdam, where he was born and is based, admitting to having had some strange email requests since. “But that’s OK because it helped me get where I’m now. People are more conscious about what I am doing, which means I can tell a bigger story about creating sustainable collections.”

For his eponymous brand, he uses designer overstock which he sources directly from charity shops and fashion houses. He then cuts them up – “collages”, as he puts it – and sews them back together to create a unique piece of clothing from several brands. A typical piece of Duran Lantink clothing may contain a vintage Chanel skirt with pieces by Lanvin and a collar from Dior. “I started finding these beautiful and extraordinary pieces that didn’t get sold, which I found very sad. So I thought: why not create a sustainable new collection from things that didn’t get sold? I think it is good to create a circular collection with high-end overstock because there is a lot.”

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Duran Lantink: ‘I think is good to create a circular collection with high-end overstock because there is a lot.’ Photograph: Alice Whitby

Currently on the shortlist for the 2019 LVMH Prize – the most prestigious award in the fashion industry – Lantink has a clear idea of what luxury is right now. “For me, it has always been the feeling that someone has really paid attention to your garment; that you are the only one in the world wearing it, and it’s a special feeling. Creating unique pieces out of old stock is the new chic. You’re saying: ‘We won’t buy into new materials any more, we only buy into things that have already existed.’ To give something a longer existence is really interesting.”

The phrase “sustainable” also needs a new definition, he says. “For a long time, it was a dull subject – people found it boring; the colours were off. For me, it needs to be playful and youthful with a fashion-forward look on it – not a different way of fashion, but taking it to another level.”

Buyers like his process. Having already secured stockists including the world-famous Galleries Lafayette, people can’t get enough of his avant garde designs – and that includes the designers whose clothes he has cut up. In the past, such flagrant reappropriation of another fashion house’s product would have instigated lawsuits, but as the sustainable fashion movement is proving – and established houses are learning – it is important to support innovative new processes challenging the norm.



Facebook Twitter Pinterest Lantink’s designs – a hybrid luxury.

“I was at the LVMH shortlist event and I ran into Jonathan Anderson, who knew I had cut up a piece of his knitwear. He was super-enthusiastic. He said it’s so much better to do something new with it, otherwise it ends up in landfill. Humberto Leon from Kenzo was very positive about the approach, too. There are even a few brands who are offering me partnerships at the moment,” he adds, without naming names.

This week, Lantink arrives in London for Fashion Revolution Week (FRW) to set up “a clinic” at 50M – the new concept retail shop in Belgravia, London, that supports emerging designers and is interested in new ways to achieve sustainable fashion. He will occupy the retailer’s first designer residency, supported by the British Fashion Council in collaboration with Fashion Open Studio, which is a FRW initiative.

For the five-day pop-up, he will be offering 10 appointments during which customers can bring in old items, from which he will make two new outfits. “It’s for people to bring in old pieces they don’t wear any more, but which have a nice story. Or things they feel attached to, but which are broken. I create something new where there’s this fresh feeling for their old garments. A lot of people need that at the moment, as they have huge closets, and they don’t do anything with their old [pieces] – they are just hanging there.”

“Fashion Open Studio is at the forefront of showcasing change, so we want emerging designers such as Duran to see us as an important part of their showcasing future,” says Fashion Revolution’s founder, Orsola de Castro. “It is incredibly important to challenge the status quo, and design new systems as well as sustainable collections. We know that the impact of the fashion industry – culturally, socially and environmentally – is massive, and if we want our clothes to reflect our principles, we need to instigate a generational change towards different practices because the present system is damaging.”

For Lantink, the time is now. “People are finding that you can do playful and fashionable stuff with a sustainable approach and I think that’s a revolution.” This year, he looks likely to become known for a lot more than a pair of pink pants."
"A booming economy and companies’ own efforts to try to Amazon-proof their businesses are spurring strong sales at chain stores.

NEW YORK — The retail business isn’t dead for Home Depot, Kohl’s, Best Buy or Target. Many traditional chains have posted strong sales, both online and at stores, as people are in a mood to spend.

What’s driving it? A booming economy and companies’ own efforts to try to Amazon-proof their businesses. That means making their stores more pleasant, updating their websites and speeding up delivery.

The bounce is a welcome reprieve from talk of a retail apocalypse that flourished after a spate of bankruptcies. Plenty of stores are still struggling, particularly mall clothing chains like Victoria’s Secret and department stores like Sears. So is it the start of a sustainable revival?

“It’s a retail renaissance for a core group of retailers,” said Ken Perkins, president of research firm Retail Metrics. “They’re set to glide on this path for a couple of years,” he added. “But specialty apparel stores are going to struggle.”

Here are some of the main trends right now.

A strong economy

Shoppers are spending more freely in an economy that has recently grown at the fastest pace in nearly four years. Unemployment is near an 18-year low. Average hourly wages rose 2.7 percent in July from a year earlier.

“There’s no doubt that, like others, we’re currently benefiting from a very strong consumer environment, perhaps the strongest I’ve seen in my career,” Target CEO Brian Cornell told investors. Target saw sales at established stores post the strongest growth in 13 years. Customer numbers in stores and online had their best showing since at least 2008.

Walmart similarly posted the largest increase for same-store sales in more than a decade. Best Buy had its biggest second-quarter same-store sales boost in 15 years. These three retailers, along with Home Depot, Lowe’s, Kohl’s and others raised their outlooks.

Faster options at store

Stores are catering better to time-conscious shoppers with delivery and pickup services that take advantage of their store networks.

Walmart has curbside grocery pickup at 1,800 stores, and is expanding its pickup towers, which serve up items ordered online within seconds. Target says it has reduced the wait time for curbside pickup to 2 minutes. Target has also found where it’s testing same-day delivery for store shoppers that the average basket size is more than $200, the highest of any service it provides.

Though Walmart has dropped mobile checkout at its namesake stores, others like Macy’s and Kroger are embracing it. Urban Outfitters says more shoppers than it expected are using self-checkout at its store in Manhattan’s Herald Square.

“It’s all about instant gratification,” says Faith Hope Consolo, chairman of Douglas Elliman’s retail group.

Revamping websites

Stores are trying to make it easier to browse and discover products online as a way to compete with shoppers accustomed to Amazon.

Walmart overhauled its website with a special emphasis on fashion and home goods, and has special sections dedicated to Lord & Taylor as part of its partnership and for the outdoor brand Moosejaw it bought last year. Consolo cited Nordstrom and Bloomingdale’s as others that have made their sites easier to shop.

“Retailers are putting together an internet-friendly site that’s easy to navigate,” said C. Britt Beemer, chairman of America’s Research Group.

Exclusive brands

Shoppers are responding to the brands that stores have developed to differentiate themselves — and which have better profit margins.

Target has been aggressive here, particularly in clothing and home goods. Cornell says these brands are attracting new customers, and the children’s clothing brand Cat & Jack generated $2 billion in sales one year after its launch in 2016.

Macy’s hopes to have its private label and exclusive brands account for 40 percent of the merchandise it offers in the next few years, up from about 30 percent. And Kohl’s teamed up with media company PopSugar on a clothing collection that will hit next month.

“The department stores that have a clear strategy and vision are going to be the clear winners,” said Greg Petro, founder and CEO of First Insight, which helps retailers set prices."

"Globally, nearly three-fifths of clothing ends up in an incinerator or landfill site within a year of being made. Shopping for clothes is no longer a harmless pastime; it is yet another painful frontier between desire and conscience. No wonder so-called “sustainable fashion” is popping up on retail sites from Boohoo to Bloomingdale’s. But Orsola de Castro, co-founder of Fashion Revolution – a nonprofit movement campaigning for a more socially and environmentally responsible fashion industry – dislikes that term. “I just call it good design looking for solutions,” she says. But, whatever you call it, this approach is booming: the fashion search site Lyst recorded a 47% increase in shoppers looking for items through terms including “organic cotton” and “vegan leather” last year, while searches for the sustainable shoe brand Veja were up 113%. From upcyclers to zero wasters, activists to fabric inventors, here are six young labels that offer great design for the thoughtfully stylish – and might just change the way the wider industry thinks about fashion.

Econyl – the brand turning old fishing nets into swimwear that can be endlessly recycled

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Collecting ocean waste to make fabrics for the company Econyl.

Swimwear brands that use postconsumer recycled fabric are garnering a lot of attention. Auria London has dressed Daisy Lowe and Rihanna. Davy J has swimsuits for wild and sporting swimmers. Ruby Moon offers “activewear for activists”. Fisch is stocked at Matches. Mara Hoffman’s pieces sell for hundreds of pounds. But follow the stories of all these labels and you will arrive in the same place: at Econyl, a recycled nylon fibre that its Italian manufacturer claims is “infinitely recyclable”.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest An Auria swimsuit using Econyl fabric.

“At the beginning, many people were laughing at me,” says Giulio Bonazzi, CEO of Econyl’s parent company, Aquafil. An average of 64,000 tonnes of fishing nets are left in the ocean each year, and these were the first nylon items that Bonazzi’s company collected for recycling, initially from the fish farming industry in Scotland and Norway, from professional divers who spotted ghost nets, and now from “all over the world – Japan, Australia, south-east Asia, north and South America”.

Lejeune says that, when she started the Ethical Fashion Forum in 2006, plastic as an issue was not on her radar. “That has really changed in the past two years.” There is an obvious and pleasing circularity to the idea of swimmers bathing in recycled ocean waste. No wonder small fashion brands are not the only ones to love Econyl. Gucci adopted the fibre in 2017. Stella McCartney has pledged to stop using virgin nylon by 2020, switching to Econyl (she makes bags with it, too.)

The company now has more than 750 fashion clients and “demand is growing strongly day by day”, Bonazzi says. He has his sights set on the plastic industry at large – “glasses, furniture, chairs”, he rattles off – and even nets in which to transport and sell supermarket fruit.

Ninety Percent – the brand giving away its profits

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Ninety Percent sells organic cotton T-shirts, tie-dye hoodie dresses, asymmetric skirts and leisurewear.

“We are trying a crazy idea and seeing if it connects with people,” says Shafiq Hassan, co-founder of Ninety Percent, which sells well-cut organic cotton T-shirts, tie-dye hoodie dresses, asymmetric skirts and leisurewear. The brand gives away 90% of distributed profits, putting philanthropy centre stage. The people who make its clothes, in Bangladesh and Turkey, get 5%, the people who build the brand get 5%, and the rest is split between four charities, which consumers help to choose. Each piece’s care label carries a code that shoppers type into the website to vote for their preferred beneficiary.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Shafiq Hassan, founder of Ninety Percent.

As Tamsin Lejeune, founder of the Ethical Fashion Forum and CEO of the new enterprise Common Objective, points out, Ninety Percent is interesting because “some of the best and most innovative examples of change in the fashion industry are coming from the supply sector”. As for Hassan, his family moved from Bangladesh to England in 1971; and he lived his teenage years listening to John Lennon’s Imagine and Pink Floyd’s Breathe (“Don’t be afraid to care …”).

On a sourcing trip for New Look in the early 90s, he drove past the dump near Kamalapur railway station in Bangladesh. The smell was appalling, but worse still he could see “children eking out a living there”, and started to think about a sustainable business model. With his partner Para Hamilton, he set up the charity Children’s Hope (one of Ninety Percent’s beneficiaries). When the pair opened a factory in 2009, they provided a canteen with fresh food cooked daily. Other benefits include health insurance and on-site healthcare (there are now 12,000 employees and the factory has produced clothes for H&M, Debenhams and New Look.)

“Younger companies have to lead the way in sustainability,” Hassan says. But while Ninety Percent sounds like a radical idea, it is the result of decades of experience in the Bangladesh garment industry. Some of Hassan’s questions remain. “How can we be an agent of change? How can we share empathy, compassion, value, purpose and transparency? Power to the people, [that] sort of thing.”

Matthew Needham – transforming shopping trolleys into raincoats

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Sustainable fashion by Matthew Needham.

Matthew Needham was an intern at a major luxury brand in Paris where he saw firsthand the degree to which waste is built into the fashion industry. “It takes 10 weeks to order leather from the tannery, so the brands tend to order more colours than they need,” he says. They decide only when they arrive which to use and which to dispose of. “For me, the waste was thoughtless”. He describes himself as an upcycler, an approach shared by fellow designers Bethany Williams, who has worked with materials including book waste, and Helen Kirkum, with her amazing mash-up trainers made from discarded shoes.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Fashion upcycler Matthew Needham.

Needham, like De Castro, believes that sustainability “should be inherent in the design process for everyone”. He finds luxury deadstock before it goes to incineration (“Like the Burberry thing” – where the company destroyed £28m of its own products to guard against counterfeiting). He scours markets, the streets and sometimes his own studio. After a shopping trolley with no apparent owner sat in the street for two weeks, he turned it into a raincoat. Lace-like plastic found on a beach in Norway became a skirt. Often he blends these finds with high-end unused fabric, such as tweed that might have been Chanel, but instead spent years in a warehouse. “I like the idea of considering the value in creativity. Not the value in the materialistic thing itself, but the value in the creativity. That’s luxury. The craft, the skill, the mindset, the thought process that goes into making something,” he says.

His work has already appeared in i-D and he is often approached by big-name brands wanting to benefit by association. He usually declines. “For them, I’m a tick box.” Needham creates pieces to order; a deal with a major retailer is only a matter of time away. Being at the start of his career, he says, is a major advantage. “You have the benefit of not being tied down by marketing and business plans. You really have to decide for yourself what you think sustainable is. For me, it’s about using what we have, because we have too much.”

Kayu – the brand turning straw into sustainable fashion gold

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Jamie Lim of Kayu.

Jamie Lim grew up in Malaysia and Hong Kong. She loved the batik prints her parents wore, the beautiful furniture made of straw. At 17 she moved to the US for university, and each time she went home on vacation she looked for artisanal gifts to take back for friends. As time went by, they became harder to find. Plastic straw began to proliferate. “So that was the impetus of the brand – it started as a way to preserve indigenous techniques,” Lim says.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Multicoloured, £115, by Kayu, from net-a-porter.com.

Now, Kayu’s beautiful bags – California-style totes handwoven from natural plant fibres by artisans in Terengganu, Malaysia – are stocked at high-end stores including Liberty, Bloomingdale’s, Saks Fifth Avenue and Net-a-Porter. Reese Witherspoon and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, carry them.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest A handbag from Kaya’s Spring/Summer collection 2019

Crucially, these bags look great. They prove that conscientious fashion can compete with, and lead, the mainstream fashion industry in terms of aesthetics and design. “What they are producing is absolutely beautiful, and completely separate from what you might think of as sustainable fashion,” says Emma Slade Edmondson, a creative consultant who specialises in sustainability and ethics in fashion retail.

Lim is also in the process of steering Kayu towards zero waste. Excess fibre from the bags is being made into alphabet tags or pouches, with the proceeds donated to charity. The straw waste is biodegradable, of course, as are the bags, over time, although some of the hardware is not.

“At the beginning, people weren’t really on board. Now our customers are asking lots of questions. Is the straw plastic or real? Is it vegan? Have the bags been mass-produced?” And retailers are also asking those questions, Lim says. “Net-a-Porter asks the designers, what are your sustainable initiatives? [And] consumers really demand it.”

Mud Jeans – creating a rental revolution in denim

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Bert van Son, founder of Mud Jeans, at a recycling factory in Valencia, Spain.

“The idea was to make jeans – organic cotton, people getting properly paid,” says Bert van Son, who founded Mud in 2012. Nothing too radical there. “But we soon found out that cotton could be easily recycled. We thought: why not get the jeans back?” Mud offers a choice between buying jeans or leasing them. Those who rent simply swap the old ones for new.

“There is a mindshift happening,” Van Son says. “We used to have a 50/50 split between people renting and buying. But over the past 12 months the leasing has grown. People like to take another colour, wash or style after a year. They’re happy to send back their old jeans and get a fresh pair.”

As the rental side of the business grows, so, too, does the proportion of postconsumer recycled waste that the label uses. Initially, Mud jeans blended 20% recycled denim with 80% virgin cotton. Now, the recycled proportion accounts for up to 40%. Next year, Van Son is “hoping to announce the first 100% recycled postconsumer pair of jeans”.

The important word in that sentence is “postconsumer”. Other forms of recycling may repurpose offcuts from the factory floor, but postconsumer recycling finds a new life for a garment that might otherwise go to landfill. More than a billion pairs of jeans are sold globally each year, while less than 1% of materials used to produce clothing is recycled into new clothing.

At Mud, the buttons are made of stainless steel, which can be recycled. “The paper tags are cradle-to-cradle certified. We don’t use leather. We are making the pocket linings out of 100% cotton”. And then? “We will try to get biodegradable polyester stitching lining”, says Van Son. “We are purists.”

Birdsong – the brand that brings you face to face with its makers

Anyone buying a piece from Birdsong will come face to face with its maker. The London social enterprise label, which majors on statement tees and classic shifts, puts photographs of the women (they are all women) who cut, sew, embroider or knit the clothes on its labels.

This is not a gimmick. Birdsong’s creators, Sophie Slater and Sarah Neville, started out working in women’s charities. They personally know the 12 to 50 people who make the clothes. “We never set out to make a fashion brand,” Slater says. “We just loved fashion as the conduit, a way to use these women’s skills to bring about change.” Now the clothes are sold in more than 30 countries.

The brand was born out of feminism and the Fashion Revolution movement. Slater and Beckett wanted to take the clothes that were being made in daycare centres and sold in bring-and-buy sales, and showcase them on a stylish website.

“Then we had the idea of collaborating with all these amazing feminist photographers,” Slater says. She enlisted activists she knew how to model the clothes and adopted the slogan: “No sweatshop & no Photoshop.”

Now Birdsong has its own designer, bringing shape and coherence to the talents of the makers. To reduce waste and overstock, the knitwear designer Katie Jones has created a template for crocheted blocks that can be quickly sewn into sweaters or cardigans, depending on orders received.

“Traceability and transparency are big priorities,” says Emma Slade Edmondson (she suggests checking out another brand, Know The Origin, too). Slater, for instance, knows the Birdsong makers by name, pays them a London living wage, and has even been to a family wedding. “I guess our mission is to create beautiful things the women enjoy working on, and give them a revenue stream.”

Birdsong’s place in the fashion industry is changing, too. “When we used to be invited to events, it was to give a talk at a hemp convention,” Slater says. But at a recent industry breakfast with representatives from well-known high-street brands, some of Slater’s fellow attendees were discussing whether sustainability was a trend. “I stood up and said, ‘We’ve got 50 harvests left!’” she says – referring to the news that soil fertility will be eroded in the UK in the coming decades. “Me and my friends working in ethical fashion always said we felt like the geeks and the fashion people were the cool ones. Now it feels like they are really paying attention.”"

A colourful catwalk show blocked roads in central London as part of a protest highlighting the impact the fashion industry has on climate change.

The Fashion: Circus Of Excess event, organised by activist group Extinction Rebellion, took over the busy junction at Oxford Circus during evening rush hour on Friday.

Traffic was stopped for around an hour while models paraded across a neon pink carpet rolled out across the road.

The protest was part of Extinction Rebellion’s efforts to use “non-violent civil disobedience” to encourage action to tackle climate change.

Models strutted across the x-shaped catwalk in a range of distinctive outfits, cheered on by supporters holding large pink flags bearing the Extinction Rebellion Logo.

Plastic, tartan, denim, feathers and flowers all featured in the designs, with models carrying pink carrier bags, and many sporting pink face masks or face paint.

Some of the outfits had anti-fracking, climate change and “fast fashion” slogans written across them.

Protesters read out poems and sang through megaphones from the centre of the catwalk, while a band played by one of the entrances to Oxford Circus Tube station.

Earlier on Friday, a separate Youth Strike 4 Climate protest saw students also take to the capital’s streets to demand action on climate change.

Dr Eleanor Roberts, from London, who appeared on the catwalk, said their protest aimed to show people they can choose not to consume “disposable fashion”.

The 49-year-old scientist said: “It’s something that people can make a difference, they just don’t buy that new top, they rip up their old ones and sew them together in a different way.

“It’s such an easy, small way but millions of people can make a difference. Look at what happened with plastic straws.”

Models carried banners calling for change (Yui Mok/PA)

She added: “It’s just trying to bring awareness to very specific actions that people can take. I feel a lot of people feel very powerless when it comes to climate change.”

Florent Bidois, 32, originally from France, accused the fashion industry of creating waste and pollution.

The upcycling designer said: “People don’t seem to know about it, how terrible people are with consumerism and fast fashion, disposable clothing, things that don’t last.”

He said the quality of clothing on sale in the past 10 years had “become degraded”, adding: “It’s almost like it’s intentionally made so it doesn’t last”.

Mr Bidois said the “empowering” event showed fashion could be “fun” but people should be careful in their choices.

Pink flags flew over the crowd (Yui Mok/PA)

Father-of-three Tom Hardy, 65, from north London, said he came to support the protest because of his concerns for his children’s future.

“The only way to make government or business listen is to actually close things down because we’ve had 10 years of no action,” he said.

The retired teacher added: “The fashion industry lives on making people think that they need to buy something new all the time. Our point is that is just not sustainable.”

The fashion-focused protest continues a series of disruptive events organised by the Extinction Rebellion group in recent months.

In February, climate demonstrators blocked roads outside London Fashion Week to protest against the “unsustainable” industry.

Earlier this month, thirteen men and women were arrested after activists staged a semi-naked protest in the House of Commons while MPs debated Brexit.

From Monday, multiple days of protest action are also planned for central London and other cities across the world.

"Fashion week is dead. Haven’t you heard? It was dying, and then it was dying some more, and kept on dying, and now it’s dead.

Or is it? Perhaps fashion week is coming back from the dead, or maybe fashion week was never really dead at all. Despite the fact that fashion week still very much exists, people have been arguing about its death for years.

The concept of fashion week — which, in the US, usually refers to the New York Fashion Week that takes place in February and again in September — is relatively simple: designers presenting collections for the following season to a room full of their peers in the fashion industry.

Its genesis can be traced back more than 75 years, but over the past decade, NYFW has become something else. Depending on whom you ask, it’s turned into a bloated and outdated trade show for an industry that has evolved beyond it, or a parade of influencer narcissism, or an overcommercialized slog where nobody has any original ideas anymore. It’s possible it peaked in the late 1990s, after Sex and the City brought the glamour of New York fashion parties into living rooms countrywide, or maybe it was in the excesses of the mid-2000s, when fashion became an increasingly common business venture for celebrities, just before the recession devastated the economy.

Still, each time fashion week rolls around now, the same debates have to be litigated: Should fashion week still exist? Who is it for? These questions aren’t really about whether the parties are fun or the trends are cool. It’s about whether the structure of fashion week is relevant to the way people buy clothes today.

The history of New York Fashion Week

Though its origins lie in the “press weeks” that took place in New York every fall and spring beginning in 1943, in which editors would flock to ritzy hotels to watch runway presentations of designers’ latest collections, the fashion week we know today is a relatively young phenomenon. From the 1940s to the ’80s, New York, Paris, London, and Milan established themselves as the “Big Four,” the largest and most important centers of fashion, each with its own slate of shows. The concept of a dedicated week-long event for a city to promote its fashion industry has now spread globally.

For a long time, fashion weeks made sense. Runway shows offered editors and buyers a chance to preview the collections and larger trends that would hit clothing racks in six months, allowing time for magazines to plan content and for department stores and boutiques to make business decisions far in advance.

New York Fashion Week as it lives now didn’t begin officially until 1993, when Fern Mallis, then the executive director of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, sought to centralize the scattered process of editors and buyers running around to various runway shows all over the city.

“Organized shows put American designers on the map and changed the fashion landscape forever,” Mallis told Racked in 2015. “Before that, there were 50 shows in 50 locations. Everyone did their own thing without understanding what a nightmare it was if it was your business to get from one show to the other.”

By 1994, the success of American designers like Calvin Klein and the celebrities their shows attracted (a very young Leonardo DiCaprio, for instance) established NYFW as a must-cover event.

For 16 years, “the shows,” as they were called, took place inside tents set up in Manhattan’s Bryant Park. This not only freed attendees from frantically running from venue to venue but also meant designers were no longer responsible for the burden of producing a fashion show from scratch — the space, lighting, sound, and security were all handled by a production firm. That’s not to say it was cheap: In 2007, a show at Bryant Park cost “at least $50,000” for designers, according to one estimate.

Come 2010, the event had spilled beyond the reaches of the relatively small park — at its height, NYFW included nearly 300 shows — and after years of disagreements between the fashion industry and Bryant Park’s management over its expansion, the event was moved to tents within the plazas of Lincoln Center. The new location, while slightly farther from New York’s Garment District where many designers keep their studios, had 30 percent more space and was equipped with much better technology to fulfill the needs of the increasingly digital event. A year later, designers started regularly live-streaming their shows on YouTube so that even those without an invitation could tune in.

Meanwhile, another industry was exploding far outside the walls of the tents: personal style blogging. In the years before Instagram, a smattering of well-dressed (and often wealthy) fashion mavens all over the world shared photos of their outfits online alongside slice-of-life blog posts. Between 2004 and 2008, people like Bryanboy and Tavi Gevinson were starting to build brands with quirky clothing pairings and colloquial writing voices.

These early “influencers,” who gained fame even before the term became a bona fide career choice, planted the seeds of a fashion industry reckoning. They were outsiders, threatening the traditional system in which magazine editors held almost absolute power in directing public opinion of fashion trends. “They had a keen awareness of how technology could help them attract the attention of hundreds of thousands of like-minded fashion fans who had been shut out of the conversation,” critic Robin Givhan wrote in 2014.

And while the fashion industry ultimately embraced them — Marc Jacobs named a bag after Bryanboy in 2008, and Lucky magazine put three digital influencers on its cover in 2015 — these swaths of previously unheard-of showgoers were often blamed for ushering in the so-called death of fashion week.

To a certain extent, their critics had a point. These hoards of well-dressed digital natives were adept at peacocking for street style photographers who waited outside runway shows, thereby creating a spectacle outside the tents that was arguably bigger than what was going on within them. And even by the time they sat down, these oft-maligned newbies didn’t necessarily adhere to the old-school rules; namely, not taking photos during shows. Anyone who followed them online was privy to essentially the same access they had.

In 2015, the shows were booted from Lincoln Center, by way of a lawsuit that determined the space where NYFW was held could not be used for commercial purposes. But even prior to the settlement, many designers were already beginning to decamp to various other event spaces around the city. The biggest brands, like Alexander Wang, preferred to rent out enormous warehouses to put on fashion shows that morphed into all-night ragers, while up-and-coming designers experimented with intimate showroom presentations that felt more like art openings than fashion shows. The latter strategy was also a good way to avoid the gargantuan cost of putting on even the most basic runway show, which back in 2014 was estimated to cost around $200,000.

Though New York Fashion Week eventually relocated to two separate event spaces, many of its marquee designers had decided not only to host their shows on their own but to forgo the traditional fashion week calendar entirely. This creeping decentralization, both physically and temporally, has contributed to the event’s waning relevance.

Why fashion week isn’t as important as it used to be

It’s not that the organizers and participants of fashion week haven’t been trying hard to keep it alive: Price points aside, high fashion is as democratized as it’s ever been. Anyone with internet access can now watch almost any major runway show in the world in real time, and when designers screw up, they’re forced listen to the opinions of average people via social media. Racial diversity among models still isn’t great but has largely improved in the past three years alone. It’s no longer such a shock to see, say, a size 10 woman walk down a runway, nor is it unusual for a designer to make a progressive political statement with his or her collection. None of this has been enough, though.

Fashion week is dying because it has zero relevance to the way modern shoppers buy stuff.

The traditional fashion calendar, in which a collection of garments for fall is presented the preceding February and spring clothing is shown in September, actually comes from King Louis XIV. In the 17th century, he established France as the center of the luxury textile industry by imposing a seasonal schedule wherein new textiles would be released twice a year, as a means of encouraging people to buy more of them. From the beginning, it was simply good marketing — people bought the latest textiles because they were new, not because they were actually needed.

And back when fashion shows were more like trade shows, where new collections were presented to a small number of editors and buyers who would then report on the coming trends for readers or order garments for stores, this system still served its purpose. But now that images can spread worldwide in an instant and the act of buying a dress can be reduced to about three taps on a phone, the six months between when an outfit walks down a runway and when a person can actually buy it feels ridiculously archaic. Fashion trends, likewise, now flare up at lightning speed and flame out just as fast thanks to image oversaturation, so that after the half-year waiting period, an aesthetic can feel played out.

Much was made of the fact that in 2016, major designers like Burberry, Tom Ford, and Tommy Hilfiger adopted a “see now, buy now” strategy, in which their runway collections were available to purchase immediately. But for most mass-market clothing brands, that’s just business as usual. The biggest fast-fashion brands like Asos, for instance, can turn around entire collections in the span of a few weeks.

Another problem with the traditional fashion calendar is how it forces designers to put out four or more full collections a year, sapping designers of creativity and creating a huge financial burden for brands. (In addition to spring and fall collections, there are in-between seasons like resort and pre-fall, which sometimes also involve runway shows or live presentations.)

Enter drop culture. Companies have found success by creating scarcity, building buzz and dropping limited collections or individual items whenever they want instead of releasing collections on a regular schedule. The most famous of them is Supreme, the streetwear brand that, even after 25 years, still attracts lines that span full city blocks every Thursday morning. It doesn’t need a presence at fashion week to do that.

Plus, there are far fresher and less expensive ways to market a fashion brand that don’t involve runways. There are highbrow examples (like the brand Opening Ceremony’s relationship with the New York City Ballet) and quirky ones (like designer Rachel Antonoff turning a fashion presentation into a school science fair). And then there are presentations that just exist online, like Misha Nonoo’s “Insta-Show,” where the only spectacle was the one taking place on Instagram — the only medium through which most people have access to a fashion show in the first place.

At the same time, the draw of covering fashion week for magazines and websites has waned. As fashion week and the nitty-gritty cycles of high fashion in general have less relevance to consumers’ shopping habits, it isn’t surprising that readers aren’t as interested in hearing about them.

People aren’t sure whether fashion week is even worth saving

All of this raises the question: Who is fashion week even for? Designers are ditching it, no one seems to be clicking on coverage, and often, the events feel like little more than exercises in Instagram influencer posturing.

Sure, for smaller and up-and-coming brands, fashion week is still a banner event that can provide marketing opportunities. But for the most part, fashion week doesn’t seem to be succeeding in its primary function: getting people excited about buying things.

Part of this could be because we don’t care about clothes anymore. A Bloomberg feature last year called “The Death of Clothing” highlighted all the reasons Americans are spending less of their incomes on their wardrobes, from the casual-ification of work attire to the flattening of top-down influence (it doesn’t just come from fashion houses anymore).

Brands that been held up as innovators in the industry, like Nasty Gal, are now struggling. Neither of them put on high-profile runway shows, but they serve as examples of a possible decline in our interest in fashion and, more broadly, our interest in owning things versus our desire for experiences. “Who needs fashion these days when you can express yourself through social media?” the Bloomberg piece begins. “Why buy that pricey new dress when you could fund a weekend getaway instead?” Why indeed?

New York Fashion Week is currently place like it always does, in early February. This time around, however, it’s added more panel discussions and film screenings, expanding on the success of similar previous events from last fall. Perhaps making fashion week more relevant means making it more like a conference — accessible to more people and with a takeaway beyond just “buy some stuff.” Attendees can now also purchase tickets to shows, which traditionally have been free and invite-only, through bundle deals called “NYFW: The Experience.”

In most ways, though, this February’s New York Fashion Week looks the same as it has in recent years: which is to say, with fewer and fewer people paying attention."
"A London fashion brand has seen a 400% increase in visits to its website after the Duchess of Sussex inadvertently wore a dress with the tag still attached.

Self-Portrait, based in Mayfair, said its first unit of the £345 red outfit Meghan wore quickly sold out after photos of the fashion faux-pas were published.

It claimed sales have since increased by 35% in the UK, and in the US they have jumped 41%.

Other brands worn by the Duchess during the current royal tour have also said they have seen a boost in interest as a result.

Meghan, travelling with her husband Harry, began the tour in a white shift dress by Australian designer Karen Gee – an outing which marked her first public appearance since it was announced she is pregnant.

The resulting surge in people seeking out the £977 “Blessed” dress prompted the company’s website to crash.

Meanwhile, French designer Martin Grant said sales had “hugely” increased after Meghan wore a range of items from the brand, including a beige trench coat and a maxi sundress.

And there was a spike in Google searches for “Emilia Wickstead” shortly after she wore a custom-made black outfit by the designer at the opening of the Anzac Memorial in Sydney.

Other fashion highlights during the Duke and Duchess’s tour so far include a navy Stella McCartney cape dress, a grey plaid blazer from Serena Williams’s clothing collection, and a white pearl dress by Australian label Zimmerman, matched with a Stephen Jones hat and Aquazzura “Denzure” black bow pumps.

"Fashion week is dead. Haven’t you heard? It was dying, and then it was dying some more, and kept on dying, and now it’s dead.

Or is it? Perhaps fashion week is coming back from the dead, or maybe fashion week was never really dead at all. Despite the fact that fashion week still very much exists, people have been arguing about its death for years.

The concept of fashion week — which, in the US, usually refers to the New York Fashion Week that takes place in February and again in September — is relatively simple: designers presenting collections for the following season to a room full of their peers in the fashion industry.

Its genesis can be traced back more than 75 years, but over the past decade, NYFW has become something else. Depending on whom you ask, it’s turned into a bloated and outdated trade show for an industry that has evolved beyond it, or a parade of influencer narcissism, or an overcommercialized slog where nobody has any original ideas anymore. It’s possible it peaked in the late 1990s, after Sex and the City brought the glamour of New York fashion parties into living rooms countrywide, or maybe it was in the excesses of the mid-2000s, when fashion became an increasingly common business venture for celebrities, just before the recession devastated the economy.

Still, each time fashion week rolls around now, the same debates have to be litigated: Should fashion week still exist? Who is it for? These questions aren’t really about whether the parties are fun or the trends are cool. It’s about whether the structure of fashion week is relevant to the way people buy clothes today.

The history of New York Fashion Week

Though its origins lie in the “press weeks” that took place in New York every fall and spring beginning in 1943, in which editors would flock to ritzy hotels to watch runway presentations of designers’ latest collections, the fashion week we know today is a relatively young phenomenon. From the 1940s to the ’80s, New York, Paris, London, and Milan established themselves as the “Big Four,” the largest and most important centers of fashion, each with its own slate of shows. The concept of a dedicated week-long event for a city to promote its fashion industry has now spread globally.

For a long time, fashion weeks made sense. Runway shows offered editors and buyers a chance to preview the collections and larger trends that would hit clothing racks in six months, allowing time for magazines to plan content and for department stores and boutiques to make business decisions far in advance.

New York Fashion Week as it lives now didn’t begin officially until 1993, when Fern Mallis, then the executive director of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, sought to centralize the scattered process of editors and buyers running around to various runway shows all over the city.

“Organized shows put American designers on the map and changed the fashion landscape forever,” Mallis told Racked in 2015. “Before that, there were 50 shows in 50 locations. Everyone did their own thing without understanding what a nightmare it was if it was your business to get from one show to the other.”

By 1994, the success of American designers like Calvin Klein and the celebrities their shows attracted (a very young Leonardo DiCaprio, for instance) established NYFW as a must-cover event.

For 16 years, “the shows,” as they were called, took place inside tents set up in Manhattan’s Bryant Park. This not only freed attendees from frantically running from venue to venue but also meant designers were no longer responsible for the burden of producing a fashion show from scratch — the space, lighting, sound, and security were all handled by a production firm. That’s not to say it was cheap: In 2007, a show at Bryant Park cost “at least $50,000” for designers, according to one estimate.

Come 2010, the event had spilled beyond the reaches of the relatively small park — at its height, NYFW included nearly 300 shows — and after years of disagreements between the fashion industry and Bryant Park’s management over its expansion, the event was moved to tents within the plazas of Lincoln Center. The new location, while slightly farther from New York’s Garment District where many designers keep their studios, had 30 percent more space and was equipped with much better technology to fulfill the needs of the increasingly digital event. A year later, designers started regularly live-streaming their shows on YouTube so that even those without an invitation could tune in.

Meanwhile, another industry was exploding far outside the walls of the tents: personal style blogging. In the years before Instagram, a smattering of well-dressed (and often wealthy) fashion mavens all over the world shared photos of their outfits online alongside slice-of-life blog posts. Between 2004 and 2008, people like Bryanboy and Tavi Gevinson were starting to build brands with quirky clothing pairings and colloquial writing voices.

These early “influencers,” who gained fame even before the term became a bona fide career choice, planted the seeds of a fashion industry reckoning. They were outsiders, threatening the traditional system in which magazine editors held almost absolute power in directing public opinion of fashion trends. “They had a keen awareness of how technology could help them attract the attention of hundreds of thousands of like-minded fashion fans who had been shut out of the conversation,” critic Robin Givhan wrote in 2014.

And while the fashion industry ultimately embraced them — Marc Jacobs named a bag after Bryanboy in 2008, and Lucky magazine put three digital influencers on its cover in 2015 — these swaths of previously unheard-of showgoers were often blamed for ushering in the so-called death of fashion week.

To a certain extent, their critics had a point. These hoards of well-dressed digital natives were adept at peacocking for street style photographers who waited outside runway shows, thereby creating a spectacle outside the tents that was arguably bigger than what was going on within them. And even by the time they sat down, these oft-maligned newbies didn’t necessarily adhere to the old-school rules; namely, not taking photos during shows. Anyone who followed them online was privy to essentially the same access they had.

In 2015, the shows were booted from Lincoln Center, by way of a lawsuit that determined the space where NYFW was held could not be used for commercial purposes. But even prior to the settlement, many designers were already beginning to decamp to various other event spaces around the city. The biggest brands, like Alexander Wang, preferred to rent out enormous warehouses to put on fashion shows that morphed into all-night ragers, while up-and-coming designers experimented with intimate showroom presentations that felt more like art openings than fashion shows. The latter strategy was also a good way to avoid the gargantuan cost of putting on even the most basic runway show, which back in 2014 was estimated to cost around $200,000.

Though New York Fashion Week eventually relocated to two separate event spaces, many of its marquee designers had decided not only to host their shows on their own but to forgo the traditional fashion week calendar entirely.

"NEW YORK (AP) — The store isn’t dead for Home Depot, Kohl’s, Best Buy or Target. Many traditional chains have posted strong sales, both online and at stores, as people are in a mood to spend.

What’s driving it? A booming economy and companies’ own efforts to try to Amazon-proof their businesses. That means making their stores more pleasant, updating their websites and speeding up delivery.

The bounce is a welcome reprieve from talk of a retail apocalypse that flourished after a spate of bankruptcies. Plenty of stores are still struggling, particularly mall clothing chains like Victoria’s Secret and department stores like Sears. So is it the start of a sustainable revival?

“It’s a retail renaissance for a core group of retailers,” said Ken Perkins, president of research firm Retail Metrics. “They’re set to glide on this path for a couple of years,” he added. “But specialty apparel stores are going to struggle.”

Here are some of the main trends right now.

A STRONG ECONOMY: Shoppers are spending more freely in an economy that has recently grown at the fastest pace in nearly four years. Unemployment is near an 18-year low. Average hourly wages rose 2.7 percent in July from a year earlier.

“There’s no doubt that, like others, we’re currently benefiting from a very strong consumer environment, perhaps the strongest I’ve seen in my career,” Target CEO Brian Cornell told investors. Target saw sales at established stores post the strongest growth in 13 years. Customer numbers in stores and online had their best showing since at least 2008.

Walmart similarly posted the largest increase for same-store sales in more than a decade. Best Buy had its biggest second-quarter same-store sales boost in 15 years. These three retailers, along with Home Depot, Lowe’s, Kohl’s and others raised their outlooks.

FASTER OPTIONS AT THE STORE: Stores are catering better to time-conscious shoppers with delivery and pickup services that take advantage of their store networks.

Walmart has curbside grocery pickup at 1,800 stores, and is expanding its pickup towers, which serve up items ordered online within seconds. Target says it’s reduced the wait time for curbside pickup to 2 minutes. Target has also found where it’s testing same-day delivery for store shoppers the average basket size is more than $200, the highest of any service it provides.

Though Walmart has dropped mobile checkout at its namesake stores, others like Macy’s and Kroger are embracing it. Urban Outfitters says more shoppers than it expected are using self-checkout at its store in Manhattan’s Herald Square.

“It’s all about instant gratification,” says Faith Hope Consolo, chairman of Douglas Elliman’s retail group.

REVAMPING WEBSITES: Stores are trying to make it easier to browse and discover products online as a way to compete with shoppers accustomed to Amazon.

Walmart overhauled its website with a special emphasis on fashion and home goods, and has special sections dedicated to Lord & Taylor as part of their partnership and for the outdoor brand Moosejaw it bought last year. Consolo cited Nordstrom and Bloomingdale’s as others that have made their sites easier to shop.

“Retailers are putting together an internet-friendly site that’s easy to navigate,” said C. Britt Beemer, chairman of America’s Research Group.

POWERFUL EXCLUSIVE BRANDS: Shoppers are responding to the brands stores have developed to differentiate themselves — and which have better profit margins.

Target has been aggressive here, particularly in clothing and home goods. Cornell says these brands are attracting new customers, and the children’s clothing brand Cat & Jack generated $2 billion in sales one year after its launch in 2016.

Macy’s hopes to have its private label and exclusive brands account for 40 percent of the merchandise it offers in the next few years, up from about 30 percent. And Kohl’s teamed up with media company PopSugar on a clothing collection that will hit next month.

“The department stores that have a clear strategy and vision are going to be the clear winners,” said Greg Petro, founder and CEO of First Insight, which helps retailers set prices.

"That top you never wear. The dress that no longer fits. Those pants that are ""so last season"".

We all have our own reasons for cleaning out our wardrobe. And it turns out Australians do this a lot.

We throw out 6,000 kilograms of clothes every 10 minutes, according to the ABC's War on Waste.

""You know what's really scary about that?"" says eco-stylist Nina Gbor. ""We're the second most wasteful in textiles after the United States.""

It means that on average, each Australian is throwing out 23 kilograms of clothes a year.

The good news is, not everything needs to end up in landfill.

By asking yourself some simple questions, you might find some garments are worth keeping after all.

And for those that need to go, there are sustainable and financially beneficial ways to rid your wardrobe of unwanted clothes.

Do you care too much about trends?

Following fashion trends will likely result in you buying more clothes than you have time to wear.

Nina is a clothes swap enthusiast who stopped caring about trends the day she went to a vintage store for the first time and had a lightbulb moment.

Two hours into the visit, she'd decided from that day on she was going to mix vintage and contemporary styles and play dress up.

""Being able to play dress up with clothes, in so many ways, helped me heal a lot of the issues in my life, and allowed me to build self-esteem, allowed me to see myself in a different light when I put on certain outfits,"" she says.

Nina also believes trying to keep up with trends is actually near impossible.

""Trends used to be four seasons a year, but brands are now releasing new products several times a week, which is really scary.""

Also if you care less about fashion trends, you'll buy less fast fashion and find it easier to let go of items you are only keeping because you want to ""fit in"".

So if you have clothes from previous seasons with price tags still attached, why not ask yourself if they're still good to wear before parting with them unworn?

Just because they're not from this season, doesn't mean they can't still look amazing on you.

Can you restyle your clothes?

If you can find another way to wear a garment, you might not need to say goodbye.

In her clothes swap workshops, Nina shows her audience how to wear a dress in five different looks, from corporate to casual, with each transformation just taking two minutes.

Through layering and using different accessories, you can come up with something completely new.

For example, you can turn a dress into a top that drapes nicely by wrapping a skirt around the dress.

""I find that with women, we usually have a full wardrobe and nothing to wear,"" Nina says.

""Whenever we get an invitation to a wedding or a party, we go and buy a new dress or a new outfit.""

Instead, Nina encourages experimenting and being creative with what you already have.

Sometimes, it's not that you have nothing to wear, you might just be stuck in a fashion rut.

Why not reinvent your wardrobe without buying new clothes?

Can you sell your clothes online?

OK, so you definitely don't want to keep that top.

Could its new home be found on the internet?

Selling clothes online is a great way give your clothes a second life (and make some money at the same time).

You'll want your clothes to be in their best condition, and also need to decide on the internet platform that's right for you.

Put some time aside for getting your clothes photo-ready, and before you know it you'll be on your way.

Get started with this simple guide on how to sell your old clothes for extra cash.

Can you sell your clothes on consignment?

If you own clothes on the higher end of the fashion, maybe this is for you.

Search in your area for businesses that will sell your clothes and split the takings with you.

Victoria Barber has owned a fashion consignment store in Sydney's Paddington for 15 years, and she's all for sustainability and no waste.

""For customers who buy high-end fashion regularly, it feels good to shop waste-free. You feel better about moving your stuff on,"" she says.

Here are Victoria's tips for selling your clothes on consignment:

Know your area and the brands they look for;

Know your area and the brands they look for; Understand whether the shop wants vintage or current fashion;

Understand whether the shop wants vintage or current fashion; It has to look good. Know what's really in fashion and realise the brands that people want. For example, if it's Chanel that's great, but if it's ""grandma"" Chanel… not so great.

Can you do a clothes swap? A market sale? A garage sale?

""It's quite easy,"" says Nina, who suggests hosting clothes swaps with your local school, group of girlfriends, colleagues, church or neighbourhood.

""I try to make it an environment of grown-up women playing dress up, having fun. There's wine, there's snacks, there's music, so there's kind of a party atmosphere.""

You can also look up clothes swaps in your local area to see if there are any organisations that specialise in clothing exchanges.

No matter which way you do it, you'll want your clothes to be in tip-top shape.

A clothing exchange business with branches in Brisbane and Sydney recommends washing all items and checking for stains, damage, missing buttons or pilling.

Another tip: ""Wipe down any shoes or accessories to make sure they are looking their best — presentation counts!""

Can you donate it to a specific cause?

Do you have suits that are no longer suitable?

Well, there's always demand for corporate clothing in good condition from people who are looking for work or are new to the workforce.

If you're updating your looks for work, why not consider giving your suits and shoes to a local women's shelter or charities such as Vinnies and Salvos op shops?

There's also non-profit organisations such as Dressed for Success and Suited for Success, who are keen to receive your laundered and ready-to-wear professional clothes to give to new jobseekers.

You can also donate shoes and accessories, and unopened cosmetics and toiletries.

There are branches around the country, and if you think this is a great cause, you can even host a Dressed for Success Corporate Clothing Drive at your workplace.

It's a terrific way to feel good about making space in your wardrobe while benefiting others in need."

The French or Italians might like to think of themselves as the most fashionable people in Europe - but it is the Brits that are the most dedicated shoppers.

The British buy more clothes than their neighbours and five times as many items as they did in the 1980s.

What was once a monthly payday treat, is now something for every weekend - or perhaps more often than that. And who can blame us?

A quick trawl around the high street reveals dresses aplenty for under a tenner, and you can get a bikini for as little as £1.

Globalisation means things can be produced in far-off lands at low cost, meaning more choice and lower prices.

But how is that even possible? And what of the environmental cost of our shopping habits? The relationship between shopper and fashion industry may have become dysfunctional.

A BBC Radio 4 investigation for the Today programme took us from Spain to Ethiopia as we examined whether the planet, and some of its poorest inhabitants, are footing the bill for our unquenchable thirst for fashion - and how we should tackle that.

How do they do it?

The pressure on brands to get trends from catwalks to our backs cheaply, and deliver profits for investors, can lead to an unseemly bunfight to secure the cheapest source - a phenomenon critics refer to as ""chasing the needle"" around the world.

Image copyright NurPhoto Image caption In April, on the sixth anniversary of the Rana Plaza collapse disaster, activists campaigned for safe workplaces for garments workers in Dhaka, Bangladesh

The plight of some of those who make our clothes came into shocking relief in 2014, when 1,138 garment workers lost their lives in the collapse of the Rana Plaza factory complex in Bangladesh.

The scrutiny and pressure to improve terms and conditions there was immense, and yielded results. Some big retailers - such as H&M and Converse - have started publishing lists of their suppliers, and sometimes, subcontractors - which can run into their thousands - in response to calls for greater transparency.

Is the age of the sweatshop in the past?

But there have been unforeseen consequences of recent trends. As wages rose in Bangladesh, companies looked elsewhere to keep costs down.

In Ethiopia, for example, wages average just a third of the rates paid in Bangladesh. Rates of less than $7 (£5.75) per week are typical. Speaking on condition of anonymity, workers at a factory near Addis Ababa told us this was insufficient to live on.

They also said that conditions - from unsanitary toilets to verbal abuse - were intolerable.

This situation was brought to international attention by the Workers Rights Consortium campaigning group. Penelope Kyritsis, who wrote the report, told me of workers who had overtime payments withheld, and women who had their abdomens felt by hiring managers to check if they were pregnant. She claimed that there had been little improvement since the report came out some months ago.

In order to head off stiff competition, the Ethiopian government has made almost a virtue out of its low labour costs.

But Ms Kyritsis says that the country's garment industry can't use the excuse that at least it is providing a livelihood where none else might be available.

She highlighted the ""extremely high turnover, with workers leaving garment jobs for other jobs to resume positions in other informal sectors or in agriculture"".

Orsola de Castro, co-founded campaigning group Fashion Revolution in the wake of the Rana Plaza disaster. Her organisation is encouraging customers to ask tougher questions of their favourite brands, via a postcard campaign.

""There are two great misconceptions when it comes to sustainability and ethics - one is that the culprit is fast fashion, and this lets the luxury sector off scot-free, when in fact it is the entire Ethiopian fashion industry that needs to be called into question,"" she told the BBC.

""And the other is that locally-made is ethical and sustainable. It isn't.""

What about the environmental costs?

Textile production, it's claimed, contributes more to climate change than aviation and shipping combined. And there's consequences at every stage of a clothing item's life cycle - sourcing, production, transport, retail, use and disposal.

To start with the basic fabrics used, it's not as simple as cotton versus synthetic. Cotton is an extraordinarily thirsty crop.

As the UK House of Commons' Environmental Audit Committee highlighted in a recent report, a single shirt and a pair of jeans can take up to 20,000 litres of water to produce. It concluded that ""we are unwittingly wearing the fresh water supply of central Asia"".

Yet, a polyester shirt made out of virgin plastics has a far larger carbon footprint. Transporting items increases that further and dying fabrics can introduce more pollutants.

Microplastic fibres shedding into waterways is becoming an increasing problem - a single washing machine load can release hundreds of thousands of fibres.

Plus, a million tonnes of clothes are disposed of every year in the UK, and 20% of that ends up as landfill.

That impulse purchase or two quickly mounts up. But whose responsibility is it to tackle this?

What is the government doing?

The House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee has made 18 recommendations - from taxing a penny on the price of an item to fund recycling centres, to reducing the rate of VAT on clothing repair services, to introducing more sewing lessons in schools. As yet, none of these measures have been adopted.

Critics say if we're serious about sustainable fashion, the objective of policy should be to persuade us to buy less. That might need more drastic action, with perhaps an environmental tax on clothing. But given the fragile state of the High Street, and the importance of consumer spending to the economy, it's hard to see any politician entertaining that.

At present, the government favours a voluntary approach, encouraging retailers to sign up to the Sustainable Clothing Action Plan - but the number signing up accounts for less than half of the UK market.

How much is business actually doing?

As pressure from consumers grow, retailers are taking things into their own hands.

Just outside the Spanish coastal city of A Coruna lies the global headquarters of Inditex. It's hardly a household name - but its main fashion brand, Zara, is.

What started as a small manufacturing outfit is now one of the biggest retailers on the planet. Moreover, Zara changed the way we shop - by bringing looks from the catwalk to the high street in just three weeks at affordable prices.

The chain recently pledged to switch to 100% sustainable fabrics by 2025. It is, of course, not just Inditex - from H&M to M&S, retailers are looking to improve how they source and their processes.

Greenwash? Well, some big retailers do at least seem to be engaging and taking action. But at the heart of their business model is newness, convincing us to keep on buying - that is, if we needed convincing. Is it retailers' responsibility to convince us to buy less?

Zara's Pablo Isla argues not - that the retailer is simply responding to consumer's wishes, and that those customers should have the freedom of choice.

What about customers?

With Extinction Rebellion climate change protests taking place outside their windows, emerging designers at London College of Fashion told us that they were going on fashion strikes - taking a vow not to spend for several months or even a year. Such action is growing in popularity, and there's an increasing focus on buying better clothing - and making do and mending torn garments.

One of the designers we met even focused on making clothes out of the multitude of tents discarded at music festivals.

But it may not be enough. As the popularity of social media influencers has soared, so too have concerns about the impact they may have on our attitude towards shopping.

One in six influencers admit to not wearing an outfit again once it's been on social media.

Eco-activist Livia Firth has been using red carpet appearances alongside her husband Colin to showcase sustainable fabrics, including fish skin ""leather"" handbags. She even persuaded him to wear a tuxedo made out of recycled bottles. She says influencers need to change their approach, saying ""if Kim Kardashian were to promote sustainable fashion, I could retire"".

She likens our relationship with fashion to an addiction. With clothing demand forecast to rise by the equivalent of 500 billion t-shirts over the next decade, she may have a point.

But no one as yet has found the cure."
"While devotees rave about finding amazing designer bargains and unique pieces in charity shops, how realistic is it to give up your high street habits in favour of second hand gear?

Sustainable fashion expert Emma Slade Edmondson wears a combination of vintage, rented and charity shop finds and insists that anyone can have an ultra-stylish wardrobe, provided they know the right tricks.

The Londoner has been working with Love Not Landfill on a pop-up shop which opens this week, showcasing four collections featuring clothes from the Royal Trinity Hospice, Oxfam, TRAID and Barnardo's stores.

Last week, the environmental audit select committee heard that 'fast fashion' retailers are fuelling a culture in which 400,000 tonnes of clothing ends up in UK landfill sites every year, so there's never been a better time to break bad habits.

And the good news is, according to Emma, pre-Christmas is peak time to find the best pieces in charity shops across the UK.

From keeping an eye out for men's blazers and blanket scarves to getting to know the staff, here's how to build a designer-look wardrobe for a fraction of the price from your local charity shops.

BECOME AN INSIDER

The great thing about charity shops is that the staff and volunteers tend to be genuinely invested in creating a lovely environment for people to shop in.

Next time you head into your local charity shop, strike up a conversation with a volunteer or staff member, you’d be surprised how willing they are to give you a call if something you’re looking for comes in.

KNOW WHEN TO VISIT

Try before Christmas when there is a spike in donations, as people are reminded to get rid of last years unwanted gifts when they head out to do their Christmas shopping. Awkward, but true.

September is another key month. As it’s the start of a new school year, people naturally get that ‘new year, new me’ feeling and feel compelled to do a wardrobe spring clean.

HAVE A CLEAR IDEA IN MIND

Charity shopping can feel a little like sale shopping. I recommend hitting the shops with a clear idea of what you’re looking for in mind, to avoid feeling overwhelmed or unsure.

YOUR SECOND-HAND SHOPPING LIST Trends always come back around, so finding pieces that are key for this season in a vintage store or in the charity shop, really isn’t as hard as you might think. PRINTS: This season, keep an eye out for leopard print, zebra print, stripes and spots - team three prints together in a jungle frenzy for maximum impact Max Mara style. BLANKET SCARVES: Emulate the oversized capes seen at Saint Laurent and Isabel Marant. MEN'S BLAZERS: You’ll often find a checked or tweed men’s’ blazers in a charity shop. Throw over a feminine floral dress to achieve an on-trend look. TRENCH COATS: A sleek belted trench coat in a neutral colour such as khaki or stone grey, is a season-less staple that is always chic! SHIRTS: It is super easy to pick up an unusual silk shirt with interesting detailing in a charity shop. A unique shirt is the perfect piece to mix and match into your capsule wardrobe looks. LEATHER JACKET: You’ll wear it forever, over everything and it’s the type of wardrobe staple that never gets old.

So, decide on an occasion you’d like to shop for and look firstly for a key piece you can build around.

DON'T MIRROR AN ERA

Instead mix your eras - team a pair of '70s cowboy boots with a more delicate '90s slip dress, layered over a 60s turtle neck and you’ve nailed a look that channels Ganni’s Scandinavian bold, but simple feel.

Plus - you’re going to look much less like you stepped out of your nan’s closet and more like an accomplished style expert.

KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR KEY BRANDS

Keep an eye out for well-known designer brands, but it’s also worth looking out for independent brands that have limited volume production lines.

These independent brands really care about the detail of the material and the fit because they are making smaller volumes, for cult followings.

I would recommend brands like Rixo London, whose sell out dresses are playful, wearable but also incredibly well fitting.

WATCH OUT FOR UPCYCLING OPPORTUNITIES

Look for pieces that could be altered or up-cycled for maximum impact and multiple wears.

Buying second hand pieces and adapting them into something even better, is a great way to extend the life of clothes! There are many ways to prolong the life of an old favourite by adding something unique.

Have an old leather jacket? Extend the life of your well loved-piece by seeking out brands like Phiney Pet or Laurie Lee, who offer incredible hand painted commissions. Personalisation is a trend that’s here to stay.

Want to give new life to old denim? If you’re handy with a sewing needle, add on your own patches and badges – this is still fashion’s secret weapon when it comes to a quick and easy customization trick that makes a statement.

Sustainable fashion expert Emma Slade Edmondson recommends looking out for classics such as trench coats, leather jackets and on-trend prints

RE-THINK THE WAY YOU WEAR THINGS

Charity shops are the perfect place to get more experimental with your style, as there are lots of different pieces.

Style clever and try not to get stuck in a rut with the way you might ordinarily wear a piece. Get creative and check out the trends online for inspiration. Think:

Layer turtle necks, sweaters or even jeans under strappy slip dresses to get more wear out of them as we transition through the seasons.

Mix athleisure with the rest of your wardrobe. For example, wearing silk sweatpants with a crisp white shirt and heels, creating a chic office look.

Join the multiple jacket trend seen at Balenciaga. For a less dramatic look, layer just two of your jackets together, for example a utility jacket with a teddy coat over the top.

CHECK YOUR FABRICS

It’s inevitable that you’ll find items from fast fashion brands in charity shops that you’ll fall in love with, but it’s worth aiming to find good quality materials.

Not only are they better for the environment, but pieces that made using good fabrics will always last longer!

Check the label and to keep things simple, go for natural fibres like wool, cotton, silk, linen and bamboo and avoid polyesters and nylons.

The production of polyester for example uses harmful chemicals, which cause significant environmental damage. And when we wash synthetic fibres we contribute to the micro plastics being flushed into the water system and our seas.

"Fashion retailer Boohoo has said it will not be banning wool – just hours after it announced that it would be.

The company said that it ""continues to assess all options as part of its ongoing commitment to a more sustainable future"".

It added: ""We are committed to ensuring the wool used in our supply chain comes from good husbandry and meets high levels of animal welfare. We will continue to use wool as a sustainable material.""

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.

However, hours before, it had promised that its brands – including Boohoo, Pretty Little Thing and Nasty Gal – would ""no longer knowingly source any wool products"".

It was praised for that decision by animal rights charity Peta, who referred to it as ""business savvy"".

The organisation's director of corporate projects, Yvonne Taylor, the clothing group's decision was ""compassionate"" and ""business-savvy"".

She added: ""Kind shoppers agree that no jumper or scarf is worth kicking, punching, and killing gentle sheep on the shearing floor, and we're urging other retailers to follow Boohoo's forward-thinking example.""

Peta had pointed to 11 videos that it said was proof of ""systemic cruelty in the wool industry"".

But the move was criticised by farmers, who described it as ""absurd"".

""Wool is one of the most sustainable fibres on Earth,” Phil Stocker, chief executive of the National Sheep Association, told The Times. “It would be absurd to replace wool, a natural material, with plastic fibres which do not degrade, are made from fossil fuel and may end up polluting the ocean.”"
"Beyond just a trend, it's almost table stakes these days to serve up natural, organic and recyclable options when creating a new label or product — millennials and Gen Z-ers are demanding it. As far back as 2015, Neilsen reported that 73 per cent of millennials worldwide were willing to spend more money on a product that was sustainable. Today, those numbers are likely even higher.

We found eight recently launched local brands that are incorporating sustainable fabrics and materials into their wares, while being thoughtful about their effects on the environment. From clothing to housewares to self-care and beauty brands, here are a few of the latest eco-friendly companies that we love.

Maison Tess.

Launched in 2017 by Laura Nezri Chetrit, this Montreal-based bedding brand has its roots in Canada (everything is designed in Quebec), but also partners with sustainable textile manufacturers in Europe.

The brand's source of cotton, for instance — a decades-old, family-run business in Portugal — is part of the Better Cotton Initiative. Maison Tess. bedding also comes with an Oeko-Tex certification, which means all fabrics and dyes are free from potentially harmful chemicals.

Sheets, pillow shams and duvet covers come in three fabrics, including washed linen, percale cotton and coco-linen (a blend of percale cotton and linen), and colours like faded grey, pale rose and soft mint green — basically an Instagrammer's dream palette.

eco + amour

Toronto's zero-waste beauty and wellness haven opened in September 2018, featuring a plethora of products like refillable containers, and bulk shampoo, conditioner and body lotion, plus a selection of housewares and baby essentials.

eco + amour, which has an e-commerce site, also sells an in-house brand that consists of bamboo hair brushes, toothbrushes, produce bags and more.

Soft Focus

Having worked for companies like Aritzia and Joe Fresh, Soft Focus founder and Ryerson fashion design grad Sammi Smith knows about relaxed, cool-girl style. But it was her decision to become a freelance designer that proved to be the impetus for her future brand.

""Working from home was a huge lifestyle change that affected my personal style, so the question of 'How do you get dressed for the day when your office is your living room couch and a laptop?' became a key raison-d'être in creating Soft Focus,"" Smith says.

The line consists of super soft robes, lounge pants, scrunchies, tees and undergarments, taking the idea of wearing #pjsallday to the next level. Making items from plant-based fabrics like Tencel (a cotton-like fabric made from sustainable wood cellulose) and saving fabric off-cuts to make the aforementioned scrunchies, are two of the ways Smith aims to keep SF as sustainable as possible.

ai Toronto

The vegan leather handbags from ai (pronounced ah-ee) are streamlined and chic, made from sustainable and recyclable polyurethane, and handcrafted by artisans in Seoul, South Korea, in small batches. The label itself was founded in 2018 by a mother and her three daughters, all of whom are based in Toronto.

Although the women only came to fashion accessories in the last two years, the leap into designing was an easy one. ""We grew up with women in our family who love fashion, including my 90-year-old grandma,"" says co-founder Hannah Kim. ""Growing up we used to watch Fashion Television with Jeanne Beker with our grandma and mom every Sunday.""

Currently an online-only venture, the brand has just launched a faux-croc, cross-body, belt-bag hybrid that will likely sell out fast.

Lithe Lashes

Taking a more natural approach to false lashes, Lithe Lashes — which just launched this year — offers a range of falsies that can easily go from minimal to night-out worthy, without looking overdone.

Brand founder Linda Secondi believes that most false lashes look too uniform, not like how our natural lashes grow. So she created versions that have lashes of varying sizes and curl in order to get a more realistic yet still beautiful look.

The brand does not use mink or silk in their reusable lash strips, which is what most lashes have been made out of until now, meaning these are a great vegan option. Lithe also uses FSC-certified paper for their 100 per cent recyclable packaging.

Hadaka Beauty

Incorporating the Japanese word for ""nude"" in its name, Hadaka Beauty produces all its organic, fair-trade beauty products here in Canada. New to the market this year, the brand relies heavily on its staple ingredient: wild-harvested marula oil from Africa.

The company's Butterful body lotions are luxuriously thick, yet don't leave a greasy film after application. Hadaka just launched a body oil and a hair oil, which both come in recyclable glass containers. Its other products come in white plastic, which are more easily recycled.

The brand, which aims to be unisex, first launched with ecommerce, and now their products are available in locations across Canada including specialty spas, like The Ten Spot.

Dresst

Turning the idea of a subscription box on its head, Dresst is a new venture created by two young Canadian women. The brand points out that women only wear about 80 per cent of what's in their closet, yet they still purchase an average of five garments per month. This adds up quickly, with the average North American throwing away about 81 pounds of clothing per year — which is alarming to say the least.

This might be just the option for you if your job requires you to ""dress up"" or if you find you need to replace your wardrobe each season. At Dresst, you can select three items per month (at a cost of $99) from their ""closet"" to wear as your own. Brands in said closet include Ted Baker, Diane von Furstenberg, Equipment, Theory and Free People.

Once your month is up, you send back the items — free of charge — to the Dresst closet. With a roster of blouses, dresses, pants and blazers, you can freshen up your wardrobe each month without putting down your credit card to purchase any items at full price. Dresst also takes care of dry cleaning and any repairs that may be needed.

Ūnika Swim

Launched in June 2018, Ūnika is a sustainable swimwear line — the brand uses Econyl, a nylon textile that comes from waste and can be recycled multiple times over, and is handmade here in Canada — that aims to update classic bathing suit pieces for all body types. The range includes bikinis, one-pieces and cover-ups, in hues from hot red to bright blue to subdued beige and crisp white.

We also love that founder Betsy Campos believes women should feel comfortable in their swimwear, and that her brand's site and Instagram account — which now boasts close to 7,000 followers — feature images that feel refreshingly real and un-Photoshopped. ."
"Sustainability matters, but does it sell? A report commissioned by the governing body of the Italian fashion industry explored the question with buyers from over 80 department stores spanning 25 countries and the results indicate that the future looks bright.

Unveiled on Tuesday at the Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana’s third International Roundtable on Sustainability in Milan, which was headed by chairman Carlo Capasa, the report overwhelmingly found that sustainability has become an essential consideration for stores when it comes to deciding the brands they stock.

Five of the brands consulted for the report, which was conducted in collaboration with McKinsey & Company, were revealed as Barneys and Saks in the USA, Hyundai in South Korea, Printemps in France and Takashimaya in Japan. The full 80 account for total purchases of over €50bn (£43bn) annually worldwide.

Collectively, buyers expected to nearly double their total spending on sustainable products in the next five years, from 23% to 40%, while a quarter revealed that they have delisted at least one brand because of sustainability concerns. The key reasons given for delisting a brand include if a brand was related to social justice issues, if there were animal welfare concerns, or if a brand’s image did not fit with the concept of sustainability.

In addition, of those asked about the importance they place on sustainability, an average of 68% said that they consider sustainability to be a concept linked to “hard core” issues including origin of fabrics, process, traceability, and working conditions, as opposed to “soft elements” including publicity, brand reputation and philanthropy. This is significant, said Antonio Achille, senior partner and global head of luxury at McKinsey, as it demands extensive investment by brands to meet the required checks.

Achille said that the results from the report – which is the first to target fashion buyers on this scale – were “a positive shock”, noting that “people understand that the consumer is reacting seriously” to sustainable issues. “I think it’s a combination of brands finally recognising that the consumer is more important [than ever] and also that sustainability can help them differentiate from each other,” he added.

From the consumer side, the buyers estimated that 70% of consumers would accept a price premium for a sustainable product. “Consumers are willing to pay a premium if they perceive production fully respects workers’ welfare and has a clear ‘made in’ connotation,” a major European department store said.

In a breakdown by country of positive associations with sustainability, 20% of buyers cited Italy, something Achille said was not surprising given the country’s long-standing reputation for craftsmanship. It was followed by Japan on 14%, Germany on 13% and France on 10%. China came out worst, with 25% of those asked saying they had negative associations, followed by India on 11%, Pakistan on 7% and Vietnam on 7%.

As well as the feedback from buyers, the conference also relayed some sobering statistics. Between 2015 and 2050 , 22m tonnes of microfibres will have been added to the ocean; currently 73% of clothing will end up in landfill or being incinerated; and less than 1% of the material used to produce clothes is recycled.

Bright future? Fashion's watershed year as it moves from waste to woke Read more

On the plus side, Achilles said that 80% of Generation Z and millennials are actively interested in sustainability: “When something becomes fashionable, it becomes powerful and they will be the guardians of this movement.” During a panel discussion on securing investment for sustainable and conscious brands, Caroline Reyl, the head of premium brands of Pictet Asset Management, highlighted the importance of adopting sustainable practices throughout businesses as investors are increasingly looking to invest in brands that are providing consumers with what they are demanding.

“We think that for companies it’s going to be more and more important to show investors they have the capability to have a sustainability programme in their strategy in order to attract more capital,” agreed Raffaele Jerusalmi, chief executive of Borsa Italiana. “This is already becoming an important topic with a number of very large brands and I think it’s going to be more and more so in the future.”"
"From traditional tailoring to bold, gender-neutral designs, London’s Fashion Week Men’s celebrated colour and individuality earlier this month.

Designers like Bethany Williams, Zilver and Oculāris ensured sustainability was also woven into the schedule, inspiring us to go in search of some of the best ethical men’s fashion, available now or coming out very soon.

The brands that we’ve included in our list are thoroughly ethical, and don't just have a sustainable side line of clothing.

Each brand has completed a comprehensive questionnaire about its ethical standards, from workers in the supply chain to sustainability of materials.

Here are some of our favourites that prove on-trend, stylish design doesn’t need to come at the cost of the planet – or even your wallet.

Christopher Raeburn grey mesh bomber jacket: £350, Raeburn

This year marks the 10th anniversary of Raeburn, a designer that brilliantly fuses high fashion with genuine sustainability. Stating “we need to evolve or die”, Raeburn unapologetically challenges and disrupts the industry.

Only 100 pairs are made every week in this factory in the Welsh town od Cardigan, which was opened by The Hiut Denim Company to bring manufacturing back to a town full of skillful jean makers, so this is slow fashion at its finest.

Rapunai is an all-round very cool brand – adventurer Sir Ranulph Fiennes wore one of its hoodies en route to the Antarctic and it’s also received the seal approval from Sir David Attenborough.

It sells essentials – T-shirts, jumpers, pants and socks – and even offers them in bundles to make shopping super simple. At the forefront of innovation, the designs are also easily customisable online.

Rapunai is especially great because of the way it operates. It’s a social enterprise on the Isle of Wight that actively helps to combat youth unemployment. The factory on the island is solely powered by renewables and another of their factories in southern India is powered by wind and solar energy. The closed-loop water system for dyeing clothes filters water so well it’s good enough to drink.

"Cleaning out the closet has never been a simple task, just ask anyone who is currently obsessed with Marie Kondo. But all that tidying up is complicated by the negative impact fashion waste has had on the environment.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency reported that, in 2015, 10.5 million tons of discarded textiles ended up in landfills. That’s a lot of wasted material. And while hoarding everything isn’t likely an option – do you really need the shirt that hasn’t fit right in decades? – it’s useful to think about how items in your closet can be repaired, reworked into your outfit rotation or recycled as another household item. Maybe your clothes need a repair or a new purpose to “spark joy” in you again.

Erin Han owns Chinatown’s East/West Shop with her husband Dennys. The two spent years working in the fashion industry before forging a more sustainable style path. At East/West Shop, they sell vintage items as well re-made vintage items and new pieces made from surplus materials. They collaborated with Sanrio for Earth Day, where Han also led a mending workshop.

Niki Livingston Tsukamoto is a Chinatown-based artist who work incorporates the traditional Japanese fabric dyeing technique shibori. In addition to her multiple art and fashion projects, she occasionally teaches workshops on indigo and natural dye workshops. Both offered tips for extending the life of some of the items in your wardrobe.

1. Make repairs

Don’t let a few small tears keep you from the clothing you once loved. “If it’s just a small part of the garment, the rest of the fabric is still sturdy, then there are many things you could do,” says Han via email. She also points out that “small breaks in seams can be easily repaired by hand or machine” and that replacing missing buttons is another quick fix.

Other repairs can take a bit more skill and creativity, but are doable. Patches have had a resurgence in popularity in recent years; scroll through Etsy and you can find everything from video game characters to political messages to sew on worn jackets. But Han points out that you don’t have to go the pre-made patch route. You can use fabric to repair a garment as well. One method she uses is sashiko, which originated in Japan. Han has led sashiko workshops and has a tutorial on East/West’s website.

Darning is an option for repairing small holes in sweaters and other woven or knit items. “This can be done with a simple thread tack on smaller holes or with a yarn darn on larger holes,” says Han. You don’t need to be precise about matching colors either. “You can even use a contrast yarn and make your repair noticeable,” she adds. “This can look really cool.”

2. Modify items that no longer fit your style

Sometimes, all it takes is a hem to refresh a piece of clothing. Says Han, “Hemming is simple and cheap if something is too long or if the length is not flattering or outdated.”

Or maybe, it’s the color of a piece that no longer suits you. “With traditional dyeing, people would typically bring their clothes back and they would be re-dyed again,” says Tsukamoto. When she teaches dye classes, Tsukumoto tells students to bring in their items. “They can bring it in and they can refresh it and it becomes something new, so it’s something that can go back in circulation in their wardrobe, something that they actually want to wear.”

Tsukomoto also does commission work. She recalls one woman, who brought in a coat to have dyed. “I indigo over-dyed it and now it’s her favorite thing in the world,” she says.

Dye isn’t just for clothes though. Tsukumoto says that people have taken sheets to her for fresh color too. Plus, she adds, remnants of fabric can be dyed and turned into items like cloth napkins.

3. Learn how to hide stains with dye

Sometimes, a dye job can cover up small stains. If you’re going the natural dye route, which is used for fabrics made of natural fibers, Tsukumoto has some tips. Using natural dyes to cover stains might be a bit tricky. “If you just want a flat, even color, then natural dyes will typically bring the stain up even more, specifically if it’s a protein-based stain,” she says.

Tsukumoto studied shibori, a traditional Japanese technique of resist-dyeing fabric, and says that this and similar methods can be useful to camouflage stains. “You just hide the stain within the pattern,” she says. Tsukumoto says that she’s even worked on blood stains. “We just get really crafty,” she says. “We can make it look like it’s part of the pattern.”

4. Know that your worn T-shirts have other uses

First, Han says, a T-shirt with holes might still be good enough to donate. “Many people love shirts with holes,” she says. “If it’s a good shirt graphic, donate it.”

If your T-shirts are just too tattered and visually unappealing for the second-hand market, don’t fret. There are still ways that you can use them. “You can also cut an old shirt into rags to remove your need for paper towels,” says Han. Rag rugs are another option for repurposing old T-shirts. “We do this with our unusable shirts from our shop,” says Han.

5. Work towards building a more sustainable wardrobe in 2019

If you want to avoid adding to the global pile of fashion waste, Han says, “find a way to prevent adding to it in the future.”

She adds, “Let your family and friends know you don’t want cheap clothes for your holiday gifts…Clean your closet out in a healthy way and start to fill it with the things you love. And then maintain those items. Repair and mend them when they need it and be conscious about anything you are adding in the future.”"
"RIO DE JANEIRO (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The 20 biggest fashion retailers in Brazil - where slave labor is a major problem - scored poorly on an index assessing their social and environmental practices, with almost half failing to disclose any information, UK-based campaigners said on Thursday.

Brazilian retailers scored an average of 17 percent in Fashion Revolution’s first survey of the textile industry in Latin America’s biggest economy, with German clothing retailer C&A winning top place with 53 percent.

Eight out of the 20 brands scored zero because their websites and reports did not reveal any information and they did not respond to a questionnaire focused on five areas, including supply chain traceability, governance and policies.

“Information about supply chains is often hidden on websites, or hosted on external websites that are difficult to find, in annual reports of more than 300 pages or simply not available,” said Fashion Revolution Brazil’s Eloisa Artuso.

“How can we make better decisions about what we buy, when information is either totally absent or presenting in such varied and long winded ways?” the project manager asked.

A labor ministry spokeswoman declined to comment because she had not seen the survey but said the ministry has rescued more than 1,200 workers from slave-like conditions this year.

The index comes as businesses face growing consumer pressure to ensure their global supply chains are environmentally-friendly, slavery-free and pay their workers fair wages.

Brazil has the world’s fourth largest garment production industry, with 1.5 million direct employees, mostly women, Fashion Revolution said.

The textile industry is fragmented and informal, with thousands of immigrant subcontractors from Bolivia and Paraguay sewing clothes in sweatshops for well-known national retailers.

Sweatshops in Brazil producing clothes for the Spanish store Zara - which came third in the index - were raided in 2011 after a supplier was accused of slave labor.

Brazil officially recognized the use of slave labor in 1995 and started launching raids which have freed about 50,000 people from slave-like conditions, often in logging and sugarcane work.

“We are in favor of global transparency, not only in the textile industry but in all sectors,” said Fernando Pimentel, head of the Brazilian Textile and Apparel Industry Association.

“Transparency is crucial ... to avoid informal business prevailing over formal business.”

Fashion Revolution started the Global Fashion Transparency Index of 150 big brands in 2016. The average score in this year’s edition was 21 percent, with Sportswear giant Adidas and its subsidiary Reebok taking first place.

The index is funded by the C&A Foundation, which partners with the Thomson Reuters Foundation on its human trafficking coverage."
"It’s time to forget the ‘fast fashion’ ethos we’ve become used to and take small steps to buying local or choosing brands with open policies, writes Paula Burns.

It was while scrolling online for some holiday pieces that I was struck with the stark realisation of the vastness of the clothes available. This is ‘fast fashion’ at its finest, or should I say bleakest. Do we really need so much choice?

Buzzwords like ethical fashion, sustainability, and transparency have caught the sartorial zeitgeist. But what do they mean? For me, it means shopping with a conscience.

Taking small steps towards buying investment pieces that will transcend the fashion seasons is a way to make ‘slow fashion’ the norm. By buying local or brands that have open policies, you are making a difference. It’s about bringing our buying habits back to basics. Luckily for us, there are a number of Irish brands committed to making beautiful ethical pieces that are sure to satisfy any fashion hungry appetite.

The Ethical Silk Company

Exactly as it says. Passionate about all things silk, Eva Power has brought a family tradition alive. Inspired by her mother’s love of sleeping on silk scarfs (sent from family in India), Eva took a chance to explore the idea of making silk pillowcases, which soon evolved into loungewear.

Varanasi Blue Eye Mask, €30, theethicalsilkco.com

Finding an eco-friendly silk along with keeping the production ethical was something Eva wanted from the beginning. “You need to do something you can stand over. Climate change and workers rights are so important and need to be considered.”

With this in mind, the sumptuous loungewear made, with the finest mulberry silk, is produced in a Fairtrade tailoring unit in Jaipur, India.

Not only has India been the inspiration for Eva’s beautifully crafted silks, her trips there incited her to give back a portion of profits to charity.“I saw first hand at the Jeevan Jyothi Aids Centre in Theni the tireless work done with limited funding and conditions. I wanted to help so I pledged to donate 5% of profits to the centre,” says Eva.

“Another 5% goes to Focus Ireland because I fully believe in the work that they do.”

In a throwaway culture, Eva has created a company she hopes encourages people “to be more selective when buying and to love what they choose to wear”.

Being ethically conscious in business gives her peace of mind.

Theo + George

An ethical label proving that “sustainable” doesn’t have to mean ugly. From founder Katie O’Riordan’s “high quality, low volume” ethos to her cashmere athleisure trackpants, beauty is prevalent here. Comfort and street fashion are at the core of her design inspiration. Wearing ethical has never looked so cool.

Pink Cashmere Ella Sweater, €159, theoandgeorge.com

When launching her label, US-born Katie was adamant that “sustainability and transparency would sit at the forefront”. In a world of fast fashion, Katie has succeeded in making trans-seasonal, wearable pieces.

“We don’t overproduce so we aren’t disposing of clothes that we can’t sell. Being small is sustainable in itself,” says Katie.

It’s obvious that waste and the volume of textile production throughout the world and its effect on the

environment are never far from her thoughts. Because of this, Katie believes a change in mindset is needed from consumer and fashion business.

“Fast fashion is hugely damaging to the environment,” explains Katie. “With a quarter of a million tonnes of clothes being thrown away in Ireland every year, I think it is something that is going to have to change.”

Her commitment to creating an ethical brand doesn’t stop there.

“We don’t work with sweatshops. It is important that all of our workers are paid a fair wage,” explains Katie.

The Tweed Project

This company is bringing Irish fashion back to the future. Best friends and design duo Triona Lillis and Aoibheann McNamara have combined their love of Irish indigenous fabrics to create modern design.

Local craftsmanship mixed with a remarkable contemporary approach to working with tweed and linens is the soul of this label.

Red Scarf with Star Styling, €515, thetweedproject.com

Through sourcing the tweed from Aoibheann’s hometown of Ardara in Co Donegal to ensuring their linen is weaved in Ireland, the pair are making their stance in the world of ethical fashion.

Each collection has a message bigger then the product. Their ‘Fucking Made in Ireland’ range screams transparency.

An advocate for sustainable and conscious shopping, Aoibheann believes in “spiritual consumerism”.

“I am very careful about what I purchase. I invest in pieces that will last and so when I buy something I know I will have that forever,” she explains.

Waste in fashion is another ethical aspect the pair are conscious of.

“I’m still pulling left over fabrics from four years ago, thinking of things we can make from it. Nothing goes to waste. We make cushions and hot water bottles from the offcuts,” says Aoibheann.

Pushing the boundaries of where tweed can go is the basis of their

designs. Adding textures through tassels and print gives a modern twist to the traditional fabric. And while inspiration is taken from travels to places such as Morocco and the Middle East, Ireland is at the heart of The Tweed Project.

Grown

When they’re not saving lives as fire-fighters for Dublin Fire Brigade, the design trio of Grown are doing what they can to save the environment.

Stephen O’Reilly, Neil McCabe, and Damien Bligh brought their love of fashion together to set up an ethical clothing brand.

Their goal was simple: Create change. Sustainability is the core of this label. Winning the green product of the year and small green business award this year can only be a testament to their impact. Thanks to their Biodiversity Project, guilt-free shopping is a reality. Not only are you buying quality, 100% Fairtrade

cotton, but the lads will plant a tree in the Burren too.

“We started Grown with a goal to create change,” explains Stephen. “At Grown, we believe that clothes shouldn’t cost the Earth. We have an environmental backbone and a passion for simply doing it right.”

He continues: “All our garments are traceable from seed to garment. Everything we make, every action we take, and every system we have goes through rigorous life cycle and sustainability auditing.”

A love of the ocean is evident with the surfer vibe collection of cotton tees and hoodies. This is a label for those who love to wrap up in a cosy hoodie after a day at the beach."

Mending Matters; Stitch, patch, and repair favourite denim and more by Katrina Rodabaugh. This book explores sewing on two levels: First, it includes more than 20 hands-on projects that showcase current trends in visible mending that are edgy, modern, and bold — but draw on traditional stitching.

It does all this through just four very simple mending techniques: exterior patches, interior patches, slow stitches, darning, and weaving.

In essays that accompany each how-to chapter, Rodabaugh explores mending as a metaphor for appreciating our own naturally flawed selves, and she examines the ways in which mending teaches us new skills, self-reliance, and confidence, all gained from making things with our own hands.

Canadian cities are discovering a new energy source: Food waste

Water usage around the world

Fast fashion: Not a good look for the planet

Canadian cities are discovering a new energy source: food waste

(Peter Bromley/City of Hamilton)

It can be hard to imagine household food waste producing anything more than a putrid odour. But it's also a potential energy source.

In Canadian municipalities with green bin programs, household organics are collected at the curb and sent to a central facility where they are broken down by microorganisms. One result of this process is something called raw biogas.

A growing number of these cities are upgrading that biogas (from a methane concentration of 55 to 60 per cent to 90 per cent or more) to produce what is called renewable natural gas (RNG). RNG is similar in quality to conventional natural gas and can be injected into a natural gas pipeline to heat buildings and fuel vehicles.

The City of Toronto, for example, is getting into the RNG business by expanding and upgrading one of its organics processing facilities. Once the equipment is installed this year, the biogas will be ""purified"" to RNG and injected into Enbridge's natural gas grid.

""It seems like such a no-brainer, in my mind,"" said Carlyle Khan, a director in Toronto's solid waste management department. ""I don't understand why other municipalities aren't doing it.""

According to a 2013 study by the Canadian Biogas Association, capturing biogas from all potential sources (agriculture, landfill, wastewater and municipal organics) could produce 2.42 billion cubic metres of RNG annually and reduce Canada's greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by 37.5 million tonnes — the equivalent of removing 7.5 million cars from the road.

Biogas harvested from residential organic waste alone could produce 140 million cubic metres of RNG and reduce GHGs by 2.2 million tonnes.

RNG is still very much an emerging field. According to Jennifer Green, executive director of the Canadian Biogas Association, there are only about 12 RNG facilities in operation or due to come online in Canada.

Green said the City of Hamilton was the first Ontario municipality to use its wastewater treatment facility to generate RNG. In 2006, it installed a 1.6-megawatt cogeneration unit at the Woodward plant to produce electricity and heat facility buildings.

Meanwhile, Surrey, B.C., has been processing the 65,000 tonnes of organic material it collects annually from residences and apartment buildings at a new facility that opened last spring. Harry Janda, Surrey's solid waste manager, said the city is using RNG to fuel its garbage trucks and is on target to reduce its carbon footprint by about 22,000 tonnes a year.

And then there's Stratford, Ont. It's embarking on a $15.5-million RNG project in partnership with its wastewater treatment plant operator, Ontario Clean Water Agency, which is set to open in 2020-21. Ed Dujlovic, Stratford's director of infrastructure and development services, said his city is in the final stages of inking a 20-year deal to sell RNG in Ontario to FortisBC Energy on the West Coast.

Dujlovic said as soon as the deal is done, it ""gives the roadmap for everyone else.""

Old issues of What on Earth? are here .

The Big Picture: Water consumption

Water is one of our most important resources, but not everyone has equal access to it. According to the advocacy group Water.org, more than 800 million people worldwide can't get safe drinking water and 2.3 billion don't have access to a toilet . But for many of the dwellers of this planet, particularly in the West, this is an invisible issue. Here's a look at the biggest users, per capita, of water in the world , according to 2016 figures.

Hot and bothered: Provocative ideas from around the web

The growing move to decarbonize the world economy is of increasing concern to oil and gas companies like Shell and Exxon Mobil. Know what else has them worried? The global push to drastically reduce plastic — much of which, of course, is made from petroleum.

Speaking of which … in a bid to dissuade visitors from buying water in disposable plastic bottles, Iceland's government has launched a tourism campaign touting the deliciousness of its tap water . The fact that it's ""pure glacial water filtered through lava for thousands of years"" certainly helps.

Since we started this newsletter last October, many of you have written in to express your ambivalence about air travel, given its rather large (and growing) carbon footprint. This essay in the New York Times captures that tension of wanting to see the world while knowing the environmental cost of doing so .

Fast fashion: Not a good look for the planet

(Jude Domski/Getty Images)

For everyday fashion shoppers, it is pivotal to stay on top of trends – for the right price, of course. But for the planet, it's a major sustainability issue.

In the last few decades, there has been a growing move toward ""fast fashion,"" defined as inexpensive, trendy clothes that copy the latest catwalk designs and bring them to consumers through major retailers like H&M, Zara and Topshop.

According to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a non-profit organization that helps businesses become more sustainable, the fast fashion industry is worth 1.3 trillion US . But there are serious questions about how the clothes are made, how much we buy and how we dispose of it.

""Shopping will make you feel better — momentarily,"" said Anabel Maldonado, a fashion psychologist based in London, England. But there are risks to over-consumption.

A study in the journal Nature Climate Change said fast fashion has caused a spike in clothing consumption and waste over the last two decades. The consultancy McKinsey reports that consumers, on average, are buying 60 per cent more clothing textiles compared to 2000 , but keeping clothes for only half as long.

Textile production primarily uses non-renewable resources, including oil, to create synthetic fibres, fertilizers to grow cotton and chemical colour dyes. It's not uncommon for fast fashion textiles to be made from blends of different fabrics, which makes recycling garments much more difficult. Not only that, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation reports that in 2015, the fashion industry produced 1.2 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases .

Maldonado said that because fast fashion is so cheap, it can lead to compulsive buying. And that doesn't bode well for the planet.

Fashion historian and designer James Fowler said consumers, on the whole, are not aware of the hidden costs. ""The new generation has been given fast fashion, and they don't realize the end result is problematic,"" said Fowler. ""We are hooked on the idea that we can go out and buy a T-shirt for eight dollars.""

Major players in the fashion industry have begun making conscious efforts to be more green – Nike and Central Saint Martins, for example, created a sustainability manual for designers . It suggests using low-impact materials ( limiting the use of toxic and hazardous chemicals ), designing with recyclability in mind and minimizing manufacturing waste.

H&M and Zara have also launched sustainability initiatives. H&M named its sustainability line the Conscious Collection . Zara's parent company, Inditex, has an eco-label called Join Life .

Consumers obviously play a big role in the demand for fast fashion. Maldonado said the solution to over-buying cheap, environmentally unfriendly clothing is self-knowledge.

""The conscious consumer knows themselves,"" said Maldonado, and won't be tempted to ""buy everything and every trend.""

"""There are a growing number of people who are concerned with the provenance of the textiles and materials in their vehicle,"" he says. The new interiors are meant to attract those consumers for whom the highest form of luxury aligns with their eco beliefs.

The marque's proprietary Eucalyptus Melange, for example - a textile produced from eucalyptus fibres - uses significantly less water than traditional materials such as plastic and Alcantara and can be dyed to match any colour of the spectrum. It also uses a durable wool blend, from textile company Kvadrat, that feels like a soft wool sweater.

Dinamica Suedecloth is a flameproof and extremely durable, suede-mimicking microfibre made from recycled plastic bottles - 53 per vehicle, on average, according to Land Rover. Taken together, they provide a vegetarian, if not fully animal-product-free, option for the conscientious affluent.

A wool blend like this helps reduce the amount of water used in the manufacturing process. Nick Dimbleby

Other car makers are also adding eco-conscious options to interiors. Volvo has said at least 25 per cent of the plastic-like surfaces in its vehicles will come from sustainable materials, as opposed to oil, by 2025. Toyota makes seat cushion material that uses glycol from renewable sugar cane rather than glycol derived from petroleum. Hyundai sources ground-up volcanic rock to form the support pillar coverings for its sedans; Ford developed a seat foam from soybeans; and Faraday Future has toyed with using rock fibres and cotton from discarded garments to line its cars.

Luxury brands have intensified the allure. In the heady world of $US250,000 SUVs and six-figure hybrids, it's only fitting that the interiors are both plush and sustainable. In this arena, the medium is the message.

The entire car is vegan

""This is part of a bigger global trend that we see continuing to grow,"" says Filip Brabec, Audi's vice president for product management. ""It has to do with consumers understanding more and more the implications of how we inhabit the environment, and how and what we eat.""

Synthetic leather alone will make up a $US45 billion industry by 2025, according to business consulting firm Grand View Research, with automotive applications predicted to be the second-largest use for renewable textiles, after home furnishings. In this landscape, ""responsibly sourced"" and ""premium alternatives"" are the biggest buzzwords.

Audi has developed sustainable and even carbon-neutral materials for its electric vehicles. The seats of the Q4 e-tron SUV are made from recycled plastic, and the e-tron GT offers an interior option of synthetic leather and recycled microfibres, including a deep-pile Econyl yarn floor carpet made from used fishing nets. The entire car is vegan.

In its Aicon concept, Audi presented seat covers made from Climatex, a dual-layered fabric with a polyester top and pure wool bottom. It was developed in a way so the two layers could be separated by type and recycled at the end of the vehicle's life. Although it isn't going into production, these sorts of solutions indicate the way Audi foresees the future of interiors.

""We have had some nice firsts,"" Brabec says. ""We see this as a big opportunity for us, and we are busy developing even more.""

That's not to say there isn't still plenty of business to be had in the old-fashioned world of burled walnut and buckskin. Just ask the folks at Bentley.

But Land Rover is anticipating a larger change in consumer tastes. It's introducing eco-conscious textiles in the Evoque, a model that, though not the company's biggest seller (that would be the long-popular Range Rover Sport), takes the lead in marketing Land Rover as an upscale, aspirational addition to the garage. Last year it sold 9917 of them in the US; when the Evoque was introduced, 85 per cent of customers who bought one were new to the brand altogether.

Better yet, Frascella says, the materials don't carry an additional price premium over traditional textiles - unless you count the premium of the additional pleasure they give their Earth-minded users.

RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct 11 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The 20 biggest fashion retailers in Brazil - where slave labour is a major problem - scored poorly on an index assessing their social and environmental practices, with almost half failing to disclose any information, UK-based campaigners said on Thursday.

Brazilian retailers scored an average of 17 percent in Fashion Revolution's first survey of the textile industry in Latin America's biggest economy, with German clothing retailer C&A winning top place with 53 percent.

Eight out of the 20 brands scored zero because their websites and reports did not reveal any information and they did not respond to a questionnaire focused on five areas, including supply chain traceability, governance and policies.

""Information about supply chains is often hidden on websites, or hosted on external websites that are difficult to find, in annual reports of more than 300 pages or simply not available,"" said Fashion Revolution Brazil's Eloisa Artuso.

""How can we make better decisions about what we buy, when information is either totally absent or presenting in such varied and long winded ways?"" the project manager asked.

A labour ministry spokeswoman declined to comment because she had not seen the survey but said the ministry has rescued more than 1,200 workers from slave-like conditions this year.

The index comes as businesses face growing consumer pressure to ensure their global supply chains are environmentally-friendly, slavery-free and pay their workers fair wages.

Brazil has the world's fourth largest garment production industry, with 1.5 million direct employees, mostly women, Fashion Revolution said.

The textile industry is fragmented and informal, with thousands of immigrant subcontractors from Bolivia and Paraguay sewing clothes in sweatshops for well-known national retailers.

Sweatshops in Brazil producing clothes for the Spanish store Zara - which came third in the index - were raided in 2011 after a supplier was accused of slave labour.

Brazil officially recognised the use of slave labour in 1995 and started launching raids which have freed about 50,000 people from slave-like conditions, often in logging and sugarcane work.

""We are in favor of global transparency, not only in the textile industry but in all sectors,"" said Fernando Pimentel, head of the Brazilian Textile and Apparel Industry Association.

""Transparency is crucial ... to avoid informal business prevailing over formal business.""

Fashion Revolution started the Global Fashion Transparency Index of 150 big brands in 2016. The average score in this year's edition was 21 percent, with Sportswear giant Adidas and its subsidiary Reebok taking first place.

The index is funded by the C&A Foundation, which partners with the Thomson Reuters Foundation on its human trafficking coverage.

"Tariffs haven’t hit them yet, but that’s cold comfort to clothing manufacturers who proudly display the “Made in America” label.

Rick Helfenbein, president of the American Apparel & Footwear Association, told Bloomberg News that the multibillion-dollar industry remains “deeply concerned” about the threat of Chinese retaliation for the Trump administration’s tariffs announced in June.

China has imposed a 10 percent tariff that was expected to increase to up to 25 percent at the beginning of next year. Finished apparel so far has not been added to the list.

Alen Lahiji, owner of Solid Fabric Textile and Islands Fabric in Los Angeles, told Apparel News that his cotton and poly/cotton blends are sourced from China and that he has seen a rush to import fabrics before the end of the year. “All the containers have been booked right before January. Everyone is ordering as much as they can,” he said. He also is finding new suppliers in other countries.

The industry was given a 90-day reprieve early this month as President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping called a truce to try to work out a deal, though many analysts are skeptical.

Billy Reid, whose clothing brand is known for “worn luxury,” said his company also has been preparing for the trade war. “It’s scary,” he told The Washington Times in an email interview. “The open transportation of raw materials and finished garments are vital to the costing model of our business.”

According to a 2015 survey in Consumer Reports, 8 out of 10 Americans would rather buy products that are made in the U.S. than imported goods and are willing to pay up to 10 percent more for the label. “There’s a noted quality to made in the USA garments, such as tailored clothing and denim that our customer believes in,” Mr. Reid said. “And there’s still something personal to many customers who want to buy into those special items made in America.”

Mr. Reid said his customers “appreciate hidden details, built in quality and timeless pieces.” L.L. Bean, Allen Edmonds and American Giant are among other fashion labels that still produce goods domestically.

As for Billy Reid, “We don’t claim to make everything in America. it would be impossible as many manufacturing capabilities do not exist in the United States.”

Instead, he said, “it takes the whole world for us to develop and manufacture our collection. In many cases, a fabric such as selvedge denim is milled in Japan, then shipped to San Francisco for cutting and sewing, and finished in Los Angeles and Alabama. At times, we are developing textiles in France and Italy and assembling in New York City.”

The Trump administration largely spared Chinese apparel and shoes from tariffs, along with most of the equipment and machinery needed to make them, but Mr. Reid said other drastic changes in the works would be a disaster. “The raw materials we are importing are being used to make garments here domestically and keep factories busy. Adding extra tariffs would make the ‘made in USA’ equation tough as the majority of luxury raw materials are mostly produced in Europe and Asia,” he said.

The National Council of Textile Organizations disagrees and said the tariffs don’t go far enough. It issued a statement saying the tariffs should be applied to clothing and high-performance fabrics to slow the flow of Chinese imports that it claims are hurting the industry.

In response to Mr. Trump’s announcement in June, Auggie Tantillo, president and CEO of the trade group, said, “The Trump administration is to be commended for taking decisive action against China’s unfair trade practices. Section 301 tariffs deter trade cheats.”

Trump supporters aren’t the only ones wearing their patriotism on their sleeves. Liberals and environmental activists also have reasons for buying products closer to home. Among them: to lower their carbon footprint, to create less pollution and to ensure more regulated human rights.

Mr. Reid said, “The world is linked together, and we can’t isolate ourselves. As an American designer working with the world to make products, I’d prefer to play nice and make friends.”

How to extend the life of clothing

Climate change is seeping into the White House

In praise of small gardens — and how to make them greener

Rethinking your wardrobe: How we're extending the life of clothes

(Georges Gobet/AFP/Getty Images)

The apparel industry is one of the most resource-intensive industries in the world. The production of crops and fibres used in fashion is responsible for 10 per cent of global carbon emissions, and it's estimated that 17 to 20 per cent of global industrial water pollution comes from the dyes used to colour clothing.

As consumers, we contribute to this global problem — especially given our love of new clothing. According to the Recycling Council of Ontario, North Americans direct 9.5 million tonnes of clothing to the landfill in 2019— this despite the fact that 95 per cent of those items could be reused or recycled.

Beyond merely seeking more sustainable materials, observers say that we as buyers need to think differently about clothing: what we want to wear and what we do with the garments once they're no longer wearable.

The Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a non-profit organization that promotes a circular economy, has written that by ""designing out waste and pollution, keeping products and materials in use, and regenerating natural systems we can reinvent everything.""

Signs of such a shift in thinking are already evident. When it comes to extending the life of our textiles, people's attitudes and behaviour are changing on both a small and large scale.

One simple thing is learning to repair existing garments, which is one of the workshops offered under the city of Toronto's Long Term Waste Management Strategy .

Individuals are also ""upcycling"" more, which means taking old garments and repurposing them. Instead of buying new clothes, you can create your own fashionable pieces. In many cases, you don't even need to know how to sew to pull it off. For those who do know their way around a sewing machine, there are endless possibilities: Revamp your old jackets or make a denim skirt out of some oversized jeans .

You don't have to stop at creating wearable items. For example, you could take that T-shirt you were going to throw out and turn it into a produce bag .

Value Village and Diabetes Canada take old clothing for reuse and recycling (although there is concern that some of it ends up in landfill ), and initiatives such as one in Markham, Ont., will make sure your old textiles are recycled and made into new fibres. (Some even end up becoming insulation in housing .)

The idea of reduce/reuse is also reflected in the growing popularity of clothing rental businesses. The entrepreneurs behind businesses like Rent Frock Repeat , Reheart it and Fresh Fashion Library have discovered that people are happy to don snappy outfits without feeling the need to own them. And it's not just everyday items — the U.S. company RealReal , for example, offers ""luxury consignment items."" Founded in 2011, RealReal had revenues of $207 million US last year, and is now trading on the stock market .

The Big Picture: Flooding in D.C.

During his campaign for the U.S. presidency, Donald Trump memorably called climate change a hoax. Indeed, during his time in office, he has attempted to undo many of the environmental protections his predecessor, Barack Obama, put in place. This week, amid flash flooding in Washington, D.C. — which scientists see as a product of a changing climate — the basement of the White House flooded (as seen in the photo below). Whether or not the president still scoffs at the idea of climate change, Mother Nature is already seeping into his house.

Hot and bothered: Provocative ideas from around the web

Earlier this week, U.S. President Donald Trump presented a speech touting the country's environmental record. As critics point out, it was filled with falsehoods and wishful thinking .

Cognizant of the environmental cost of air travel, Dutch carrier KLM is doing the unthinkable: It's asking people to fly less . Their slogan is actually ""Fly responsibly,"" but the message is that if consumers want to preserve the world for their children and grandchildren, consumers should consider taking the train or teleconferencing when possible.

Last week, a group of scientists reported that planting a trillion trees across the globe could be the cheapest and most effective way to remove carbon from the atmosphere. This ""solution"" naturally excited quite a lot of people, but an undertaking of this magnitude size has many challenges , including land ownership, cost and the potential for more forest fires.

Last week, a mysterious fire aboard a Russian nuclear submarine killed 14 sailors. In a development that didn't seem to get nearly enough attention, a naval officer this week said the officers ""saved the lives of their colleagues, saved the vessel and prevented a planetary catastrophe."" A planetary catastrophe? No other details were forthcoming, and Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov downplayed the assessment.

In praise of small gardens — and how to make them greener

(Taylor Logan/CBC)

Following up on our recent stories on alternative gardening , we thought we'd address a challenge for a lot of homeowners: a small backyard.

How can a small space have environmental benefits, while still being a spot you where can just lounge and chill? Here are some tips and tricks for creating just such a place.

Plant a clover or moss garden. It's easy to grow, with little to no maintenance. Plus, it's soft underfoot. For lawns, plant Dutch white clover . It is low-growing, tolerates close mowing and outcompetes other weeds that can ruin the esthetic of your garden. It requires no fertilizer, little to no watering, not to mention that its flowers will bring bees to your backyard. For shadier yards, consider planting moss instead — no mowing or watering required and good for high-traffic areas.

Grow out small sections of your lawn. Or plant perennials around the perimeter or other areas of your yard. Even a small area of turf-free ground will do some good.

Use the space to your advantage. If you don't want to get rid of a traditional lawn but want to bring wildlife back to your yard, try vertical gardening , hanging pots , living walls or add plants to already existing pergolas.

Planting perennials, tall and thin trees (such as magnolia, cherry, maple or even bamboo) or a garden around the edges of your yard is perfect for people with low foot traffic who want a lower-maintenance, green backyard.

Try replacing all or parts of your lawn with "" square-foot"" gardens . Through the use of grids, square-foot gardens (typically 122-by-122 centimetres or 122-by-244 centimetres in size) pack crops closely together, creating a high production of food and low production of weeds in a small area. This is ideal for gardeners with limited space and uses only 10 per cent of the water a regular row garden would need, without the use of fertilizers, pesticides or machinery.

Remember, when it comes to a more environmentally friendly yard, every bit counts.

"Image copyright Saitex Image caption Jeans, such as these at Saitex's factory in Vietnam, can now be made without waste water being released into the environment

As consumers become ever more concerned about environmental and ethical issues, pioneers in the global denim industry are cleaning up its act.

Blackhorse Lane Ateliers, which describes itself as a ""craft jeans maker"", has an open-door policy.

""Anybody can walk in here, even without an appointment,"" says Han Ates, the founder of the London-based small business. ""Through that we create transparency.""

Transparency has become a buzzword in fashion of late, with labels keen to show their best practice, both in terms of how well they treat staff and how environmentally friendly they are.

By opening up its doors, Blackhorse Lane Ateliers is able to show potential customers that its factory is clean, the 20 employees are happy, and that the jeans are worth keeping - rather than throwing away at the end of each season.

Image copyright Visual Marvelry Image caption Hans Ates says that members of the public are welcome to come and see how his company makes jeans and other denim products

Visitors to the workshop can even get a bite to eat, as it is home to a pop-up restaurant at weekends. ""When you are connected to your local community, then you become accountable,"" adds Mr Ates.

More importantly, Mr Ates says that his company sources all its rolls of denim from mills in Japan, Italy and Turkey that he has personally visited to ensure their commitment to environmental and social responsibility. This is vital for any jeans company that wishes to be ethical, because the manufacture of denim can be heavily polluting.

Textile industry consultant and expert Andrew Olah says that making jeans can carry a steep environmental toll, because the dye used to give them their usual blue shade - indigo - does not easily stick to the raw cotton.

""To get the dye on, we have to dye the fabric multiple times,"" he says. ""And by dying it multiple times, obviously we need to use more water and more energy.""

Then a jeans-maker may wash and bleach the jeans many times to lighten the colour, creating even more waste water. By some estimates it can take thousands of gallons of water to make one pair of jeans. ""The industry use a huge amount of water, and a huge amount of energy,"" adds Mr Olah.

Image copyright Saitex Image caption Jeans are a staple clothing item that most of us own and wear

In many denim mills and jeans factories the used water - which contains the dye, plus bleach and other chemicals - is simply released as waste water. Thankfully a growing number of producers are now eliminating waste water altogether.

Saitex International, a jeans manufacturer based in Vietnam, is one such business. Its factory, located 30km (19 miles) outside of Ho Chi Minh City, now recycles 98% of the water it uses. For the remaining 2% it has an evaporation system, making it a zero discharge facility.

Owner Sanjeev Bahl says that before setting up the factory in 2010 he ""started looking at sanitation, or inadequate sanitation, globally, and the lack of clean drinking water"".

""Morally it pushed us to start looking at water as a very valuable resource.""

With 5,000 employees, Saitex makes denim clothing lines for brands including J Crew, G-Star Raw and Everlane. Mr Bahl says it took the company just six years to earn back the money it invested in the water recycling technology.

Image copyright Visual Marvelry Image caption Jeans made to a high environmentally friendly standard are often more expensive

""What we realised is that it's not just mission orientated,"" he says. ""If you do it right, it can be financially beneficial as well.""

Some of the big name jeans firms are also working hard to reduce their environmental impact. None more so than Wrangler, whose owner Kontoor announced last month that it was introducing a new technology allowing it to dye denim without using any water.

The company says it is able to do this by using a foam instead of water, and that the process also reduces energy use by 60%.

Global Trade

More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:

""We're proud to have helped pioneer a technology that has the potential to revolutionize sustainability standards for denim,"" says Tom Waldron, Wrangler's global brand president.

Amy Leverton, a denim industry consultant based in Los Angeles, says she hopes that such examples of best environmental practice and transparency become wider known.

""That's really, really important,"" she says.

Image copyright Amy Leverton Image caption Amy Leverton says it is pleasing to see the jeans industry reduce its impact on the environment

Richard Lim, chief executive of UK-based consultancy Retail Economics, questions what percentage of shoppers are currently happy to pay the higher price tag that more ethically sourced jeans often carry. At Blackhorse Lane Ateliers, for example, its most expensive jeans cost £260.

""With some of the research that we've done, when you ask consumers about what their primary motivations are for purchasing in apparel, then it's about price, it's about convenience, it's about range, quality of product,"" says Mr Lim.

""And actually, sustainability - and ethical sourcing - doesn't necessarily sit within the top three of what's important for consumers when thinking about purchasing for apparel goods.""

But he says that the situation is changing, with rising demand for more ethical clothing being led by young people.

""They've become a lot more focused about the societal impact that they're having, whether that's on the environment, the economy, and other areas as well,"" he says."
"A flood of cut-price fashion and homewares brands into the mainstream has encouraged many of us to adopt a 'there's plenty more where that came from' mentality.

The cheaper it is to buy, the easier it is to replace, so clothing, bedding and many other day-to-day items have become 'disposable'.

But the tide is changing, as evidenced by a ongoing surge in the demand for more expensive eco-friendly fabrics, like organic cotton.

A wall of towels made at the Felpinter factory in Portugal - the family run business has been expanding into organic cotton for its towels and other fabrics as demand rises

I've never been a keen follower of fast fashion, and I'm certainly not the kind to discard of a dress that's been worn only once. But admittedly, I have cut costs on things like duvet covers and sheets in the past.

During my 20s, I didn't once question how the sheets or towels I bought were made, let alone what impact that process was having on the planet.

How much damage can the contents of one's airing cupboard do? (NB: I don't have an airing cupboard.)

So, a whistle-stop tour of several textiles factories in Guimaraes, Portugal, proved an eye-opening experience.

As I discovered, it takes a long series of arduous (and loud) processes to transform bundles of raw cotton into made-to-order, labelled and packaged towels.

When raw cotton is transported from farms, it is dirty so first needs to be cleaned, and then blended

Forget everything you know about Sleeping Beauty, this is what spinning wheels look like now - turning the cotton into yarn

At the family-run Felpinter factory, raw cotton is imported from around the world, blended, cleaned, spun, woven, dyed, stitched, labelled and wrapped before being distributed – one design at a time – to numerous UK and global chains.

The loud weaving process: The cotton yarn is then woven and turned into fabric

Row after row of machines weaving fabric at the Felpinter fabric plant in Portugal

End to end, the process (which doesn't even include the growing of the cotton in the first place) requires 500 full-time employees.

It also requires thousands of gallons of water which, in adherence with Portuguese laws, is extracted from the river, cleaned and replaced - at a hefty cost to the factory.

Felpinter has its own water-cleaning process. After the yarn or fabric is dyed, the water is cleaned and put back in the river

The same can't necessarily be said for the rest of the world as the regulations around water wastage vary wildly.

While Portuguese textile makers are known for being ecologically responsible, one factory boss candidly shared that, 'in Asia, they care nothing.'

What about organic?

The process is more complex than that however because in recent years, demand for organic materials has taken off, driving factories to introduce that into their processes too – following the painstaking guidelines to prevent contamination.

Felpinter said that, two years ago, organic represented one per cent of everything it produced. Now, it's more like 10 per cent, and growing all the time.

One of the many UK-based businesses to have cottoned on to this trend is online furniture firm Made.com.

It is working with a handful of these factories in Portugal now to create its new 'responsibly sourced' textiles range.

'Our customers are more conscious in their home furnishings than ever before,' says Made's product and sourcing boss Suzanne Beechey, 'and we wanted to integrate a choice of more responsible options within our textile collections.'

As is the norm for all organic products, the 'responsibly sourced' range will come with a heftier price tag than most standard cotton products.

But is it worth it?

There are pros and cons to splashing out on organic. While it is better for the environment in some ways, it can be harmful in others.

The main selling point for the firms that offer it - John Lewis, West Elm, Made and Debenhams to name but a few - is that the crops aren't treated with pesticides, insecticides, herbicides and genetically modified organisms.

Organic cotton must be stored separately from standard cotton - here it is wrapped in green

These toxins can cause harm to workers, consumers and wildlife. They have resulted in serious health problems for those who have been heavily exposed to the chemicals, and reduced soil fertility too.

The organic process is also less likely to contribute to acidification - a decrease in the PH of the globe's oceans.

But there are pitfalls to the organic option, specifically that it requires more resources than the alternative (which is why it tends to be more expensive in shops).

Organic cotton is derived from plants that are not genetically modified, so to extract the same size yield as conventional cotton, farmers need a lot more plants.

This means more space and, essentially, more water. A standard cotton top requires more than 1,000 litres of water, but an organic cotton equivalent needs more like 2,500 litres.

Growing cotton uses a huge amount of water - with organic cotton requiring more

With water becoming scarce in many parts of the world, it's certainly a factor worth thinking about.

Made has said that, above and beyond its foray into organics, it will continue to explore other 'responsible' materials, as it monitors the impact the business is having worldwide, at part of a sustainability report out later this year.

Clearly as an online retailer, it has lots of other things to consider too, such as reducing the impact of delivery vehicles and the amount of packaging it uses to fulfil these.

The pressure is on all the mainstream retailers, especially those in the fast-fashion field, to do the same - take action now to stem some of the damage being done and, alongside Governments, help in the development of more sustainable solutions.

As for consumers, is it necessary for all shoppers to be splashing out on organic bedding and towels? Perhaps not.

But, for those who can afford to, it is a step in the right direction, and one that will remind businesses that if they want to protect their profits in the long run, they need to help protect the planet too."
"From today public bodies, including schools and hospitals, are no longer allowed to purchase single-use plastics such as cups, cutlery and straws, writes Joyce Feegan.

The government-wide ban, which was announced in early January and comes into effect today, aims to reduce single-use plastics in our environment.

A spokesman from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment explained to the Irish Examiner, where exactly the public can expect to see this ban in effect.

“Regarding the government-wide ban, all government departments are expected to have stopped purchasing plastic cups, cutlery and straws, from the date of the announcement (January 4).

“All public bodies were given a bit more time, as outlined in the announcement but from this week, all public bodies, including schools, should no longer purchase the named single-use plastic items. ‘Public bodies’ includes hospitals, schools and government agencies,” the spokesman said.

The public bodies are now banned from purchasing single-use plastic cups, cutlery and straws for use on their premises.

The development follows a new EU directive on single-use plastics, which will ban straws, cotton bud sticks made from plastic, plastic plates and cutlery, plastic coffee stirrers and plastic balloon holders.

Both the European and Irish moves follow the public documentation of plastics in marine life, from the digestive tracts of whales to the respiratory systems of turtles. There is also a growing body of evidence showing that plastics have entered the human food chain.

Aside from killing wildlife and entering our food chain, the problem with plastics is that they are non-biodegrabale and will sit in the earth for 400 years. Furthermore, only 8% of plastic is being recycled globally.

The spokesman from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment also stated three other plastic-reducing initiatives the government has committed to.

These include a commitment to a 90% plastic bottle collection target and a 55% plastic recycling target. The government has also commissioned a review to establish the best way to reach a 90% collection target for beverage containers.

While there has been a huge increase in public awareness around the environment in recent months, tackling our plastic use is just one hurdle in tackling climate change.

Irish universities, businesses and social entrepreneurs have also found innovative methods of plastic reduction.

Tap map shows where you can re-fill on the go

Refill Ireland

Two and a half million plastic water bottles are generated in Ireland every day, with people buying single-use bottles of water on-the-go, as opposed to carrying a refillable container.

But Irish people were backed into a corner in a sense, explained Barry O’Connor, founder of Refill Ireland, because we have so few external public water fountains in Ireland, compared to the rest of Europe.

Barry, an environmental scientist, set about investigating why and set up Refill Ireland as a result — it has recruited 710 private businesses and public enterprises to allow people refill their water bottle on their premises. You can see where to fill up your water bottle on their ‘tap map’ on refill.ie. An app is in development.

There are 710 re-filling points across the country and they can be found by checking the Tap Map on Refill.ie.

“We set up in early 2017 as a not-for-profit social enterprise.

“We wanted to understand why there was a lack of external public drinking water points in Ireland.

“There are a lot in Europe, where countries maintained their external water points,” said Barry.

“We used to have thousands of water hydrants in Ireland and they were taken out after demand for them dropped when piped water became readily available in the 1950s and so on. The hydrants were neglected and vandalised.

""They were made from cast iron so they needed a lot of repair work. Local authorities let the iron corrode and the pump mechanism got rusty,” added Barry.

He said people in Ireland were then “forced into a corner where there are very few public water points” and they are “too embarrassed to go in and ask to fill up a bottle for free in a coffee shop or pub”.

Barry heard about the Refill project in Bristol, where 200 businesses had signed up to allow the public fill up their water bottles there for free.

“When I saw it I thought, why can’t we do that here?

I am an environmental scientist. Two and a half million plastic bottles are generated in Ireland every day.

“Refill Ireland is a waste prevention project. When waste is prevented, there is no waste management problem later on,” said Barry.

“We want to eradicate the need for single use plastics bottles, someone can still have a choice and buy one and we’ve no problem with that, but we want to provide an alternative to having to always use a single-use plastic bottle,” he added.

While working full-time as an environmental scientist, Barry worked is as a volunteer alongside four other volunteers and one part-time staff member, whose salary of which is covered by the Regional Waste Authority.

Barry explained how they developed the ‘tap map’ and how the public can refill their water bottles when out and about in Ireland.

The ‘Tap Map’ is a network of locations around Ireland where the public can refill for free. They can refill in private business or public locations, getting filtered or unfiltered water and it can be self-serve or staff can serve.

""There are butchers, bike shops, bookshops, B&Bs, doctors’ surgeries and receptions in office blocks that have signed up.

“It’s been good for businesses, it helps them promote a positive welcoming image and a business that is promoting waste prevention.

“We have 710 water-filling points, and 550 of those are in private businesses. The rest are on-street points or in airports.

“We recruit businesses by asking local Tidy Towns groups or other community groups to ask businesses in their area. We also approach people directly and businesses also come to us,” he said.

“You will know by checking our Tap Map on refill.ie or by a shop having a sticker on its window. Not all businesses have stickers as they might be a professional office that has a no-sticker policy,” he added.

Refill Ireland has several other strings to its environmental bow.

“We also do sporting events so we were at a 5k run with 1,000 people and provided tanks of filtered water at the event and saved 6,000 plastic bottles entering the waste chain. The organisers were able to say they have a zero-waste event,” Barry said.

“We are also in talks with Cork County Council to provide filtered water tanks at the final stages of the city marathon, in addition to water being provided in plastic bottles. It’s all moving in small steps in the right direction,” he added.

Compostable packaging good for food and wallets

Down2Earth Materials

Cork-based and family-run business, Down2Earth Materials supply a wide range of compostable food packaging to more than 2,000 Irish delis and cafes. Their sales have doubled year-on-year for the last three years, from €2m in 2017, to €4m in 2018 and they expect to see sales pass €6m in 2019.

Director Chris Murphy, told the Irish Examiner about the boom their business has seen in the last two years.

“Down2Earth Materials started in 2009, so we are celebrating 10 years in business this year.

""It was a challenge to engage with people in 2009 with regards compostable packaging, but in the last two years we’ve seen significant interest,” Chris said.

Compostable cups have been a popular item of theirs.

Take-away coffee cups are traditionally lined with plastic. We supply cups made from plant-based linings and use vegetable-based inks.

“We have over 2,000 customers throughout Ireland from local delis and cafes to well-known brands such as Bewleys, Java Republic and Frank & Honest,” said Chris.

“One in four cups in the Irish market is now compostable. We proudly supply over 60% of those,” he added.

Another popular item Down2Earth Materials supply is compostable food boxes for take-aways.

“Take a chipper, if you get curry chips in a polystyrene container, the food sweats in this synthetic container and it’s soggy to eat.

""The alternative we have is made from bagasse, made from the leftover waste material from the sugar cane industry, it keeps food warm and crisp and it’s compostable too.

“With barely a few cent in the difference between the two types of containers, bagasse is great for your food and the environment,” he explained.

Compostable cup and compostable food container made from bagasse, alternative to polystyrene and made from left over waste from sugar cane industry.

Chris has seen firsthand how the market is evolving when it comes to plant-based food packaging, with customers asking their local coffee shops, delis and supermarkets for sustainable packing.

While sustainable alternatives have never been associated with being low-cost or profitable, the experience of Down2Earth Materials proves otherwise.

“In terms of price our products aren’t expensive, you’re talking a couple of cent in the difference between a plastic-lined container and a compostable one.

“This year we’re on target to have €6m in sales, that is €2m growth each year since 2017. Job growth wise, we’ve gone from seven employees in 2017 to 14 in 2019,” explained Chris.

He believes the education sector and the work of broadcaster David Attenborough have both helped to shift people’s thinking.

I’ve been in the industry for the last decade. I’ve seen the demand for compostable and recyclable products start in the education sector, move to the business sector and now it’s penetrated the masses and the demand has gone mainstream.

""Change has been coming for a long time. Consumers are actively seeking brands that use environmentally-friendly packaging,” said Chris.

However, it is the change in the last two years that has been the most rapid.

“In the early years, we knew change was coming and required but we thought people would adapt faster. In the last two years we have seen interest beyond our expectations. I would definitely say Blue Planet and David Attenborough and the viral turtle video were turning points which started people to question traditional packaging,” said Chris.

UCC goes plastic-free with new Bio Cafe

University College Cork

UCC is home to Ireland’s first plastic-free cafe. Not just metal knives and forks, but behind the scenes too, from how food is delivered and stored.

The Bio Cafe in the BioSciences Institute opened in September 2018, and has attracted interest from all over Ireland and abroad as to how it achieved its plastic-free status.

It’s not just a plastic-free cafe that UCC can boast, the university is aiming to remove single-use plastics from its campus completely and it has been working towards this for some time.

UCC’s Sustainability Office, Maria Kirrane, told the Irish Examiner how the cafe came about.

Our plastic free movement in UCC started in September 2017. We ran a campaign in the library as we noticed there were a lot of single-use cups in the bin and contaminated waste.

“We wanted to tackle that culture of using something once and throwing it out. We did two things, we banned the library building and KSG, who have the catering contract on campus and offered a 15c discount for people who brought reusable cups for their coffee. Sustainability is part of their contract and they sit on our green forum,” said Maria.

“That was in September 2017 and then in September 2018, the students’ union gave reusable cups to every incoming student,” she added.

It was from here that the Bio Cafe came about.

“Then we started thinking how can we bring this further. We decided to take one site, one cafe and make it single-use plastic free. We did this in the Bio Cafe in the Biosciences Institute. They were going to be upgrading that cafe anyway. That launched in September 2018 and both front of and back of the house is plastic free.

“We had to go through the entire supply chain and change where products were sourced and we got more local suppliers so the bread comes in in brown paper now,” said Maria.

Alan Hayes and Faye Mercy launch Ireland’s first plastic-free cafe.

In terms of how it functions, the sustainability officer said it simply runs in the “old school” way.

“The cutlery and condiments, everything is old school. The mayonnaise is in a jar, the salt and pepper are in shakers. It’s gone back to the way things use to be.

“You can refill your water there. You can bring in your own takeaway container for food or sit in and you can get your coffee in your reusable cup.

It’s become a destination cafe on campus, a lot of people would take meetings there.

""It’s soups and sandwiches, so you can get your lunch there,” said Maria.

Outside interest focused mainly on how they achieved a day-to-day functioning that didn’t rely on plastics, as well as how this worked with suppliers.

The success of the cafe has now spurred UCC to further up its green game.

“We are looking at what worked there and aiming to roll it out everywhere on the campus. Our goal, taking into consideration we are a research institution with labs, is to be a single-use plastic free campus,” said Maria.

UCC has been working towards these projects for several years, having had a green campus committee and green forum in situ for a long period of time.

Organic fashion challenges our throwaway culture

Organic Movement

Fast-fashion is another major contributor to plastics and waste in our environment, with polyester being non-biodegrabale and our throw-away culture when it comes to cheap clothing.

Cork woman Emylou Hurley, is the CEO of Organic Movement, which sources and imports organic cotton and ethically made yoga wear. Having spent 10 years working in retail, and knowing the supply chain inside out, Emylou went travelling to India for three months.

Seeing life in India and with her professional background as a buyer, she was perfectly poised to start a business in sustainable clothing, and for an eager community of people who care about the environment.

Last year after travelling to India for three months, I watched for the first time a film called True Cost. I became a conscious consumer overnight.

""I had always been aware of the supply chain, having worked in retail for over 10 years, and as a buyer for three. But my time in India, opened me up to a whole other world of consumerism and showed me the importance of ethical sourcing,” said Emylou.

“Having practised a lot of yoga in India I wanted to buy more sustainable yoga wear made from natural materials. I didn’t want to wear anything synthetic. After a few failed attempts, an opportunity presented itself in August 2018. I found a supplier of yoga wear with a collection made from organic cotton. The range included leggings, sports bras and tank tops,” she added.

Emylou started selling the products at pop-up events in order to test the market and find her customer base. The response was immediate and positive.

“To test the market, I sold the collection at the Ballymaloe Craft Fair in October 2018, and again at the Dublin Flea Christmas market in December 2018. There was a great reaction.

“Customers not only liked the high waisted leggings and the comfort of the organic cotton, they were passionate about supporting a brand that sourced ethically,” explained Emylou.

While working for herself had been a motivating factor, doing work that contributed to sustainability was also a driving force.

Emylou is in the process of setting up on online shop and has plans to get OM stocked in yoga studios and shops across Ireland.

“My ethos is ‘ethical, sustainable and organic’. I avoid using synthetic garments as they are a huge contributor of micro plastic pollution in the oceans. Polyester is not only non-biodegradable, it takes a lot of energy to produce (70 billion barrels of oil are used each year),” said Emylou.

“Cotton can have its own disadvantages, as a lot of water is required when farming the crop. But with organic cotton, less water is consumed and no pesticides are used. This prevents water contamination, creates a safer environment for farmers and conserves biodiversity. It is also a biodegradable, natural, soft and breathable fabric,” she added.

Business wise, Emylou is in the process of setting up on online shop and has plans to get OM stocked in yoga studios and shops across Ireland. She is currently on the entrepreneurial and business management programme ran by Springboard. She will also be taking part in the Fashion Revolution Week 2019, at D-Light Studios, in Dublin on April 27, as well as at the Mind Body Experience festival in the RDS in May.

Like the other businesses, the environment is what motivated her to create her clothing brand.

What motivates me is trying to create awareness of the environment, and what impact we are having on it.

""Plastics are so harmful for the environment but the ethics and supply chain of the garment industry are also hugely important to me,” she said.

“The awareness around sustainability is just growing and growing. Consumers are becoming more conscious and want to take action on how we can protect our planet and oceans,” she added.

Making a difference — one toothbrush at a time

VirtueBrush

While takeaway coffee cups, with their plastic lining, and throwaway water bottles have come under the bright environmental spotlight in recent times, another daily item coming under scrutiny is the humble toothbrush.

With people going through between six and 12 toothbrushes a year, and with the handle and brush made from plastic, bamboo has emerged as an alternative material for the product.

One man making them is Dylan Regan, CEO of VirtueBrush.

“Our main product is a bamboo-handle toothbrush,” he said.

The idea emerged in 2015, we wanted to create a plastic-free toothbrush. But we settled on a bamboo handle and nylon bristles for the brush, which is dental grade. We’re the only Irish brand doing this.

“It represents a 97% reduction in plastic, as the bristles account for 3%. It is not 100% perfect, but we are talking with a research group to create and use bristles made from non-petroleum nylon. We hope to have that on the market in 2019.

“The crux is — if we say: ‘it’s just one plastic toothbrush’ or ‘just one plastic bag’, but if everyone keeps making that decision, all that plastic adds up.

“This brush is not the silver bullet, it’s symbolic of a sustainable lifestyle and a positive step in the right direction. When you’re holding the brush in your hand twice a day, it makes you think what else you could do.”

‘When you’re holding the brush in your hand... it makes you think what else you could do.’

The VirtueBrush is sold in Ireland through health food stores, but the entrepreneur hopes that his business will have a more mass market effect.

“These little items as insignificant as they might seem, are of major significance. It creates a market and the greenest one wins, it spurs this virtuous circle and a race to the top,” said Dylan.

“These products are positive disruptors. They’re making big companies wake up and smell the coffee.”

His own market has grown considerably since the business launched and like similar entrepreneurs, Dylan cites David Attenborough’s work for helping to shift public consciousness.

“The David Attenborough episode on plastics on Blue Planet was a watershed moment for people.

""A lot of people who would have dismissed that plastics is a problem saw that it was killing marine life, and everyone trusts David Attenborough,” he said.

Another tenet to his business is a charitable donation.

We are partnered with Trees of the Future, so a tree is planted for every brush sold. Forest gardens are grown and it lifts families out of poverty.

""It also cancels out our carbon emissions,” explained Dylan.

While he is an entrepreneur, the environment is his driving force.

“The plastics industry plans to increase its supply five-fold over the next 10 years. It has to become a movement of people across society not using plastic. Collective action can have a positive impact,” he said.

Cork trio turn ocean’s plastic waste into eye-catching watersports tops

Rash’r

Rash’r, another Cork-based business, hit international headlines in March, for its colourful rash vests made from recycled ocean plastic.

Its CEO Tom Cotter told the Irish Examiner that sustainability became a key issue for the sportswear brand when starting out.

Sourcing eco-friendly materials for stretchy clothing put 18 months on their open-for-business date, but having grown up around nature, Rash’r’s co-founders were adamant that they wanted to do things right.

“We started three years ago — myself, and Alex Musgrave and John Downey are the co-founders. We had all grown up around the water, either surfing, sailing, or scuba diving.

""Rash vests were the one garment we had in common, but you could only get them in blue, black or red. Like most watersports people, we were naturally eco-conscious,” said Tom.

We started going to trade shows and there was a massive focus on sustainability. We had no idea how bad the fashion industry was in terms of its plastics use and waste.

""The challenge at this one trade show was to make your business as sustainable as possible. This put 18 months on our business getting started,” he added.

The entrepreneurs had already settled on a fabric that was not sustainable, but stepped back and reconfigured in order to find one that was.

CEO Tom Cotter.

“We couldn’t find any eco-friendly fabrics at first. Then we met one guy who was in testing mode with a sustainable fabric and we stayed in touch with him,” said Tom.

Explaining the fabric they finally settled on, Rash’r CEO details how its made.

“For the rash vest, we use fabric made from recycled ocean waste. The company that we get our fabric from go around the Mediterranean and they have contacts with the marine fishing industry.

They collect damaged nets and plastics that have been dumped at sea and they also collect post-consumer goods that would otherwise go to landfill.

""That is all shredded and turned into pellets and that goes to a mill where it’s spun into yarn and made into fabrics of different weights,” said Tom.

The vests still require Spandex, but the firm is now looking for a sustainable alternative to that.

When they hit international media headlines for their innovative use of recycled ocean plastic, the colour and prints on their rash vests also drew attention.

“We had various graphic designers working on our prints and we found a multimedia student (Dave Marshall) who was looking for work and we asked him to try his hand at the designs, and he designed our first graphic.

“There’s just nothing else like it on the market, when you’re on the water it’s about having fun and not taking yourself too seriously. When we did our market research, we found people loved colour. You can be fun while being eco-friendly,” said Tom.

The brand sells all across the world from Ireland to the UK and from the US to Australia.

But sales and fun aside, the entrepreneurs are serious about the environment.

“This can’t be a trend for six months. We’re not even getting to the top of the iceberg now. In 10 years there will be no coral reef left, we may be able to reverse it, but we need to take severe action,” said Tom.

“We had no idea how bad the fast fashion industry was. What we’re aiming for is biodegradable products and we are waiting on the technology,” he added."
"A London fashion brand has seen a 400% increase in visits to its website after the Duchess of Sussex inadvertently wore a dress with the tag still attached.

Self-Portrait, based in Mayfair, said its first unit of the £345 red outfit Meghan wore quickly sold out after photos of the fashion faux-pas were published.

It claimed sales have since increased by 35% in the UK, and in the US they have jumped 41%.

Other brands worn by the Duchess during the current royal tour have also said they have seen a boost in interest as a result.

Meghan, travelling with her husband Harry, began the tour in a white shift dress by Australian designer Karen Gee – an outing which marked her first public appearance since it was announced she is pregnant.

The resulting surge in people seeking out the £977 “Blessed” dress prompted the company’s website to crash.

Meanwhile, French designer Martin Grant said sales had “hugely” increased after Meghan wore a range of items from the brand, including a beige trench coat and a maxi sundress.

And there was a spike in Google searches for “Emilia Wickstead” shortly after she wore a custom-made black outfit by the designer at the opening of the Anzac Memorial in Sydney.

Other fashion highlights during the Duke and Duchess’s tour so far include a navy Stella McCartney cape dress, a grey plaid blazer from Serena Williams’s clothing collection, and a white pearl dress by Australian label Zimmerman, matched with a Stephen Jones hat and Aquazzura “Denzure” black bow pumps.

"One of the UK's biggest online fashion retailers has been accused of caving in to vegan protesters after banning the use of wool in any of its clothes.

Boohoo.com, which also owns brands PrettyLittleThing and Nasty Gal, has become the first UK mainstream retailer to ban wool by the autumn due to animal welfare concerns.

However, analysis of the brands' websites by this newspaper suggests that none of them currently sells any items containing wool, which raises questions over whether the move is a simply a PR stunt.

It comes after People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) released exposés of 99 sheep-shearing facilities across four continents, including in the UK, finding what it described as ""systemic"" abuse. It also claims the wool industry damages the environment.

But John Royale, head of livestock at the National Farmers' Union, said: ""Wool is the most sustainable of all fibres and is far better for the environment than creating plastic fibres, which create pollution. Shearing sheep stops them getting heatstroke.

""Farmers that shear are properly trained. There was one group of professional sheep shearers exposed for bad practice by Peta and that is probably why Boohoo has caved in to this.""

Yvonne Taylor, Peta's director of corporate projects, said: ""Peta is toasting Boohoo group's compassionate, business-savvy decision to scrap wool."""
"Extinction Rebellion (XR) is one of the most remarkable grassroots movements of the 21st Century. Spurred on by dire warnings about climate breakdown, it has mobilised thousands of people who are willing to get arrested, or even face prison, to make their voices heard.

How is it that in our supposedly democratic society so many feel compelled to break the law to make such an overwhelmingly reasonable point: that we shouldn’t destroy the environment on which all life depends?

The answer is that our broken democracy leaves little choice. XR may be a global movement, but a glance at their map of local groups reveals just how heavily weighted their activity is towards the UK – the only European country that still uses the antiquated first past the post voting system.

Germany has eleven local XR groups. Norway has two. The Republic of Ireland, four.

The UK, on the other hand, has over one hundred and thirty local XR groups – each consisting of dozens or hundreds of otherwise law-abiding citizens; citizens so desperate for their politicians to listen that they are willing to go to jail. And in second and third place globally for number of XR groups are the US and Canada – the only other two major developed countries to use first past the post.

This makes perfect sense. Our first past the post voting system has systematically denied representation to the people who care the most about the protecting the natural world. In 2015, over a million people voted for the Green Party and their policies aimed at averting climate disaster. In 2017, despite the hundreds of Green candidates standing down in the hope of unseating Tory MPs, they still received half a million votes. Yet at both elections they won just a single MP.

The rebels have tried playing by the rules by turning out and voting in their hundreds of thousands. And what impact has it had on parliament? None. Our electoral system silences them almost as if they’d never voted at all.

It’s obvious why XR is nowhere near as big anywhere else in Europe. Almost all other European countries use some of proportional representation – so seats match votes and all votes count equally. When a party wins a million votes, it picks up a lot of seats in parliament. It’s then able to represent the views of its voters, shape the debate and influence legislation.

Some Germans are just as worried about climate breakdown as their British equivalents. A few are even willing to risk arrest. But in Germany, every climate activist could instead choose to spend their time campaigning to elect environmentally friendly MPs – and their efforts will be rewarded in proportion to votes they win.

Indeed, the Germany’s Green Party has surged in national and regional elections in response to rising concern about climate breakdown. It’s not surprising that most European activists decide the parliamentary approach has a much better risk/reward ratio than getting arrested.

First past the post doesn’t merely make people feel unrepresented; it stops vital change from happening in response to public demand. There’s a wealth of academic evidence showing that countries with proportional representation far outperform those with winner-takes-all systems like first past the post when it comes to climate action and environmental protection.

Countries with PR slowed their greenhouse gas emissions faster, perform significantly better on the Environmental Protection Index, ratified the Kyoto Agreement faster, and have deployed significantly more renewable energy.

Most countries have still done nowhere near enough. But there is hope in countries with PR – because these democracies are responsive to rising public demands and are able to build consensus in order to address these serious long term threats.

Compare this to the depressing situation in the UK. In 2017, most people voted for parties promising to ban fracking for shale gas (no surprise given overwhelming public opposition to the idea). Yet our voting system handed a majority of seats to two parties that shared just 43 per cent of the vote; the only parties in parliament that are pro-fracking. Together the Conservatives and DUP are rushing to create a whole new fossil fuel industry: something no other country in Europe is doing and – according to the scientists – something the planet cannot afford to happen.

For the UK, the climate crisis is a crisis of democracy – and as much as anything else Extinction Rebellion is a rebellion against the way crucial voices are systematically shut out of our politics. To create a democracy capable of addressing the most urgent challenges of our time, we need proportional representation. As the chant goes, ‘Change the system, not the climate!’

If you agree then, whatever else you do to make your voice heard, join the movement to Make Votes Matter and help us win PR.

A London fashion brand has seen a 400% increase in visits to its website after the Duchess of Sussex inadvertently wore a dress with the tag still attached.

Self-Portrait, based in Mayfair, said its first unit of the £345 red outfit Meghan wore quickly sold out after photos of the fashion faux-pas were published.

It claimed sales have since increased by 35% in the UK, and in the US they have jumped 41%.

Other brands worn by the Duchess during the current royal tour have also said they have seen a boost in interest as a result.

Meghan, travelling with her husband Harry, began the tour in a white shift dress by Australian designer Karen Gee – an outing which marked her first public appearance since it was announced she is pregnant.

The resulting surge in people seeking out the £977 “Blessed” dress prompted the company’s website to crash.

Meanwhile, French designer Martin Grant said sales had “hugely” increased after Meghan wore a range of items from the brand, including a beige trench coat and a maxi sundress.

And there was a spike in Google searches for “Emilia Wickstead” shortly after she wore a custom-made black outfit by the designer at the opening of the Anzac Memorial in Sydney.

Other fashion highlights during the Duke and Duchess’s tour so far include a navy Stella McCartney cape dress, a grey plaid blazer from Serena Williams’s clothing collection, and a white pearl dress by Australian label Zimmerman, matched with a Stephen Jones hat and Aquazzura “Denzure” black bow pumps.

"Swedish mass fashion retailer H&M recently launched its Conscious Collection offerings for spring, an assemblage created as a reaction to the persistence of the megabrand’s impact on the environment. A few pieces – cowboy boots and a co-ordinating moto jacket – were instantly intriguing thanks to a novel fabrication element: Pineapple leather.

Evoking thoughts of sunny climes and the warm-fuzzies associated with pina coladas and shopping sustainably, this faux leather is formally called Pinatex and is made of fibre from by-product pineapple leaves. It’s just one of the many forward-thinking fabrications fashion’s biggest names are banking on to curb the damage caused by the seasonal consumption habits the industry has nurtured over the past 50 years.

We so often hear of the dismal statistics attributed to the manufacturing of fashion goods. It’s been named as the second-largest polluter in the world, a statistic that was called out by fashion editor Vanessa Friedman at the close of last year for being hyperbolically untrue – yet with the acknowledgment that the industry does largely contribute to the environmental crises we’ve witnessed in recent years. In response to the continual urging of organizations and shoppers to step up and innovate, you’ve likely noticed more brands flaunting fabrics that resonate with the “reduce, reuse, recycle” mantra or adhere to “ethical” production practices. But just what is vegan suede or Orange Fiber, and how is it better than the conventional fabrics that came before? Here’s what to know for the next time you shop.

Story continues below advertisement

Leather/Suede Substitutes

Non-animal-derived fabric alternatives have long been desired by consumers, but not only because of their cruelty-free pedigree; the environmental damage caused by animal agriculture is well documented in the fashion industry. High-end designers, most notably Stella McCartney, have capitalized on the production of faux (often called “vegan”) leather and suede to make luxe garments and accessories. Most of these non-animal alternatives are made using various polymers, from polyester to polyurethane, but a few are fabricated from things such as cork (or pineapple). Depending on a brand’s manufacturing practices and partners, the creation of such materials can be very wasteful and toxic; many faux leathers are made with plastics and require a lot of oil to be produced, and they do not degrade the same way animal leather products do – meaning they’ll be on the planet for a longer time. Biotech company Modern Meadow introduced Zoa, its biofabricated materials offering, in 2017, although it’s not technically vegan since it uses animal matter in its composition.

Organic cotton

One of the more established textile terms on this list, organic cotton is used in everything from t-shirts to tampons. The cultivation premise is similar to that of food, in that the fields where the cotton is grown is held to the same standards of unadulterated agriculture practices (with the exception of say, natural pesticides being used instead of chemical ones). The primary difference in advantage lies in organic cotton producing at a smaller volume and therefore requiring more acreage and water than “traditional” cotton in its farming stage. Today, many brands including Toronto’s Kotn have built their business around the use of organic cotton and its appeal to the sustainably-minded; keep in mind that knowing how the cotton was dyed will impact its ultimate eco-friendliness.

Biodynamic and peace silk

These swish silk alternatives are slowly worming their way (sorry) into fashion’s collective conscious. One type describes the way in which the silkworms are raised (“biodynamic” or “mulberry” silk), in a method that uses fewer resources and can be done in conventionally inhospitable terrains for other types of farming. The other, termed “peace,” “non-violent” or “ethical” silk, gets its name from the fact that the silk is extracted through means that don’t result in the silkworm dying. Amour Vert, an emerging brand based in San Francisco that uses mulberry silk, was featured in Forbes last month – a testament to the appeal of these unique methods of material creation. Its price points, which are similar to that of major brands such as Reiss and J. Crew, also prove that sustainable fashion is becoming more democratic in pricing.

Orange Fiber

In a similar concept to that of the zesty pineapple’s leaves being used in clothing manufacturing, the humble discarded peels from oranges used in juice production have been elevated to haute status. Fashion house Salvatore Ferragamo launched a capsule collection in 2017 made of a silky twill composed of a polymer derived from the reused natural product, marking it as the first brand to utilize the textile. Orange Fiber was launched by an Italian company of the same name in 2014 and produces three other materials in addition to the twill: a poplin, a jersey and a white jersey.

Recycled plastic

This is perhaps the most talked-about sustainable material on the market right now – brands such as Patagonia, Lane Bryant, Adidas, Ralph Lauren and Montreal-based Frank and Oak have harnessed the power of recycled plastic to make items such as outerwear, polo shirts and sneakers. The benefit of this process is that it limits the need for oil used in garment manufacturing, and also makes use of the billions of plastic bottles thrown away each year. But as with all the other fabrics on this list, the sustainability element of the material is lessened depending on other processes, such as dyeing, that it goes through.

From the lounge room of her Farrer home, fashion designer Kelli Donovan has spent more than a decade leading the conversation on ethical and sustainable fashion. And now she's ready for the world stage. Donovan is the creative force behind Pure Pod - a label that cares just as much about its impact on humans and the earth as it does about keeping women looking gorgeous. Donovan works primarily with Global Organic Textile Standard certified textiles and many of her garments are made by a Fair Trade certified manufacturer in India. Pure Pod's workflow has been designed to ensure a small carbon footprint across the entire design and manufacture process - from the planted organic cotton seed to the fabric to the finished garment. Donovan's excited, she says, to see the world catching up on the ""slow fashion"" conversation. ""Just as we have fast food we also have fast fashion: mass-produced, super cheap products whose origins and manufacturing processes are questionable,"" Donovan says. ""There's this huge momentum globally around slow fashion. Big companies and corporations are now starting to listen and look deeply into their supply chains. ""Ethically-produced fashion is not just an issue for fashion people but for everyone who wears clothing in the world. We're all responsible for our clothing. "" A Canberra native, Donovan studied fashion at CIT before travelling the world as fashion designer and product developer for a number of fashion houses in Melbourne. She became disenchanted with the industry, and was mortified when she read that fashion is in the top three biggest polluters on the planet when it comes to global greenhouse gas emissions. ""After working in the mainstream fashion industry for many years I saw the devastating impact fashion manufacturing has on the people working in it and on our environment,"" Donovan says. ""I needed to find a connection between my creativity and the environment, and it just felt natural to do my own ethical and sustainable label."" The slow fashion revolution took centre stage at New York Fashion Week this week, and also at Neonyt Fashion Week in Germany and London Fashion Week. Donovan has just spent three days in sales mode at the Fashion Exposed industry trade fair in Sydney, promoting Pure Pod to buyers for traditional bricks and mortar stores, department stores locally and internationally and online global stores. The label has also been selected to feature at Melbourne Fashion Week, in a show called Identity. It's going to be a big year for Pure Pod, and Donovan admits her days are a combination of thinking ""big and small simultaneously"". ""We really want to scale up this year so we're working with Red Hat Impact with our current investor strategy,"" she says. ""One minute we'll be working on how to get the backing to get Pure Pod on to the world stage and next minute my phone will ring and I'll suddenly be talking to a contact in India about working with marginalised women on the hand embroidery for our new summer collection. ""That's the thing with slow fashion - the world is ready for it, but it's about achieving social, economical and environmental impact slowly, garment by garment."" To get to Melbourne Fashion Week this year, Pure Pod will need sponsors. If you're interested or know someone who might be head to the contact form on the Pure Pod website.

"Back away from those jeans! Click off of that frilly blouse! Sure new clothes are nice but our fast-fashion addiction is killing the planet.

Keeping up with the runway is toxic. Our good intentions to shop responsibly have increased, but it hasn’t lessened how much we buy and how much we throw away. Experts report that our landfills overflow with textile waste — stats from the Recycling Council of Canada reports the average person throws out 81 pounds of textiles annually.

And Fashion’s Dirty Secrets, a documentary from the Passionate Eye, reports that we produce over 100 billion new garments from new fibres annually.

No better day than tomorrow, Earth Day, to lessen your impact on the planet — and not just tomorrow, but from here on out, by throwing away fashion’s throwaway culture! Don’t just pay lip service to the world’s largest environmental event — and do more than the 3 Rs. Besides reduce, reuse, recycle, also research, repair, rent and re-purpose.

Your clothes say a lot more about you than you think. “The clothes we wear reflect both how we view the world and how we want the world to view us, so let your clothing choices reflect your commitment to social and environmental justice,” says Kelly Drennan, founder of the sustainability non-profit fashiontakesaction.com.

Skip the fast fashion upgrades — your closet needs an ethical upgrade. Before you buy, wear the change you want to see by checking up on the brand, label, designer by downloading the Good on You ethical app (goodonyou.eco).

Adds Drennan: “If a brand is doing something sustainable, you can bet they will be proudly promoting it on their website or in social media.” Find out where they make their clothes, what they pay their workers, what materials they use and how they are dealing with waste.

Build a sustainable wardrobe and become more conscious shoppers with these tips:

• Go thrifting. Since 2016, buying second-hand clothing for environmental reasons has increased by nearly 23%, reports the 2018 Ethical Consumers Market Report. Keep it going — check out Value Village and Goodwill, consignment stores, and online marketplaces, such as eBay, says Camille Kowalewski, of eBay Canada.

• “Choose sustainable fabrics that are made with natural fibres and require minimal chemical fertilizers like wool, organic cotton, linen, and hemp,” she adds. Research online for the fabrics and methods the brand uses.

• Don’t add to the landfill! Upcycle your now unloved but like-new items by donating to a charity shop or sell them online at sites such as Kijiji or eBay or trade on Bunz.com.

• Buy less. “We now consume 60% more clothing than we did 20 years ago, and we keep our clothes for half as long. So reducing the amount we buy will make a huge difference with respect to water and waste,” says Drennan.

• Clothing swaps are a great way to give new life to unwanted clothing, says Drennan.

• Repair garments to extend their life. “Grab a needle and thread and sew a button on or the hole in the toe of your sock,” adds Drennan.

• Rent instead of buying a fancy gown or suit for your next big event. “Rental companies have designer clothes at a fraction of the cost, and the best thing is that they won’t be single wear items because someone else will rent it after you.”

ECO-CONSCIOUS SCHOOLS

Staples Canada is powering young minds to think sustainably. Ten eco-conscious schools across Canada received $20,000 in new technology products from Staples as part of the 2019 Superpower your School Contest.

The contest, held annually by Staples and Earth Day Canada, recognizes Canadian schools with youth participation in environmental protection. “We hope the new technology allows these schools to amplify their efforts as environmental leaders within their communities,” says David Boone, CEO of Staples Canada.

The winners, five elementary and five secondary schools, were chosen from close to 500 applications submitted across the country. “The winning schools are emerging leaders in green living,” adds Deb Doncaster, president of Earth Day Canada.

“From school-wide commitments to compost and recycling to student-run greenhouses and gardens, these student-led initiatives are inspiring and motivating. We are proud to partner with Staples Canada to ensure that these programs are supported with the technology needed to offer students new engaging ways of teaching others.”

One winning school found that 60 to 80% of items deemed garbage were compostable materials. Another collected 80 kilograms of garbage and 20 kilograms of recycling from a local creek.

Make Earth Day every day at home. Natural health expert Jodie Pappas, of cleankissorganics.com, offers up these simple home hacks to make your space a whole lot healthier:

• Plastic containers can leach harmful chemicals into your food, so re-purpose glass jars from sauces and jams and use them for leftovers. Need something smaller? “Clean out those little jars that once held your night cream. Plastic-free, no waste, and totally healthy,” says Pappas.

• Ditch the toxins and still have shiny floors. Fill a bottle with 1/4 cup of white vinegar, warm tap water, and a few drops of lemon and orange essential oils.

• Ditch the deodorant stick that contains aluminum. A natural plant-based deodorant eliminates the odour and still lets your body to sweat when it needs to.

• Make your own dryer sheets by cutting up a few old dish rags into quarters, place inside a glass jar with a lid, add 1/4 cup of white vinegar and 25 drops of your favourite essential oil.

• Have sweet dreams by filling a glass spray bottle three-quarters with distilled water, add a blend of essential oils such as lavender, rosemary, peppermint, vetiver and ylang-ylang. Spray on your pillow and sleep better.

• Add some green to your colour scheme! Houseplants help detoxify and purify the air we breathe, great for our physical and mental health.

• Sick of swatting mosquitoes? Blend coconut oil, cedarwood, lavender, lemon and citronella oils to keep these pests at bay.

A TOAST TO MOTHER NATURE



Toast Earth Day with something organic and sustainable. And you might even forgo the wine headache. Unnecessary sulfites are a preservative commonly used in conventional winemaking.

A glass of Bonterra’s Cabernet Sauvignon anyone? “Rather than spraying our vines with chemicals, we use natural partners like bees and sheep to build a vibrant ecosystem,” says Elizabeth Drake, regenerative development manager at Bonterra Organic Vineyards. Its organically farmed wine omits pesticides from its vineyards, and no sulfites to their wines.

Drake recommends looking for shops and restaurants that specialize in organic and green wines — “these folks have tasted and done their research to offer what matters most to you: wines that align with your values and taste great.”

When shopping on your own, look for organic certification on labels to verify responsible practices."

"The BBC is promoting a sustainable lifestyle through the launch of a new eco-friendly fashion brand.

The new brand, which will launch at London Fashion Week in partnership with Mother of Pearl, will target Blue Planet and Planet Earth viewers who have been inspired into making more sustainable choices with the future of the planet in mind.

The BBC has previously been able to increase public understanding of the issues affecting the planet through its documentaries narrated by David Attenborough - and hopes to now bring this awareness to shopper’s lives.

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.

Julia Kenyon, global brand director of BBC Earth, said: “We have seen the power of BBC natural history documentaries to pierce public consciousness and spark global awareness of the biggest issues affecting the future of our planet.

“All of us have a responsibility to care for the world we share and BBC Earth is seeking to partner with trailblazers who are providing solutions to how we consume so we can empower people to make informed choices that will help to forge a sustainable future.”

To launch the collection of sustainable clothes, and to encourage a discussion about consumption of fashion and its environmental impact on the planet, BBC Planet and Mother of Pearl will show a short film created by BBC Studios Natural History Unit during London Fashion Week.

“The very creativity that we desire in fashion, the colours, patterns and textures, are inspired by the natural world, and yet our supercharged approach to fashion is placing our planet under threat,” said film narrator Liz Bonnin.

“The solution lies with all of us and I hope this film will not only raise awareness of the issues, but also empower people to transform both their relationship with fashion and how they choose to treat this beautiful home of ours.”

The collection will feature clothing made using a dyeing process that uses 10 times less water than other methods and will be available later this year on Net-a-Porter.

In 2017, the Blue Planet series, which showed the harmful effects human choices are having on marine life, was viewed by an average of 10.3m live viewers."
"Would you like some Filipino designer FASHION with your pizza?

Philippines Designers is a curated peek into the idiosyncratic local aesthetic in the heart of Poblacion.

Filipino fashion designers Twinkle Ferraren and Tipay Caintic are bringing their signature fusion of street with traditional and ethnic from their artisan and tribal collaborators throughout the Philippine islands to all over the world, and now, to literally where the party is, in Poblacion, Makati.

Phl Designers’ late-afternoon-to-late-night fashion pop-up inside a food and lifestyle compound The Social on Ebro is a fitting addition to the independent and experimental energy of the gentrified neighborhood; surrounded predominantly by food and drink concepts, independent local and ethical fashion are right in the middle of the action.

In the face of today’s e-commerce shift, Twinkle and Tipay are braving the demands of a brick-and-mortar space to better articulate the narratives of their creations. Presenting their creations abroad (Tipay has shown in London Fashion Week) and responding to the way customers would interact with their pieces, they were convinced that this is a necessary platform.

""Constellations"" fabric bib made with Inabel Iloko designed by Twinkle Ferraren.

“Internet and social media are good, but it is still a different experience when you see the clothes up close and listen and feel the material stories,” Twinkle explains. “For example, my pieces use natural and indigenous textiles.” Her constant choices for fabric are piña, 100 percent Philippine silk, piña silk, piña-abaca-cotton-silk, a blend of abaca-cotton from Davao that she made, and weaves from Ilocos. Her accessories integrate abaca fibers, coco and natural beads and T’boli brass.

Twinkle’s flowy silhouettes contrast with Tipay’s more sculptural pieces, yet are complementary in their organic aesthetic. They are the first of a series of independent designer pop-ups in the months to come.

“Both our brands have some art base in it. Tipay draws her prints and executes them in embroidery or digital. It’s the same with me and my other collections,” Twinkle notes.

""Unicorn"" beanie by Tipay Caintic in collaboration with Ken Samudio.

Twinkle is inspired by her art dreams and her heritage journeys, research and encounters with artisans and tribes from around the Philippine Islands, creating ethically- and ethnically-sourced and sustainably-made clothing, textiles and accessories that take the wearer from day to night.

Tipay describes her line as “cheeky designer clothing ethically made with love in the Philippines.” She uses bold prints, 3D knits, up-cycled and hand-woven local fabrics, and in-house embroidery fused with modern takes on classic silhouettes.

Upcoming featured designers are Stephverano, Orias Essentials, Bryan Peralta, Randolf and Harvic Dominguez.

"Every year, we trawl through the archives and republish a few of the standout business stories from the last year. This is essentially a mix of the most popular, topical or insightful pieces published in 2018. Here's one that made the cut.

Leonardo DiCaprio may be an investor in $2 billion woollen shoe company Allbirds, but he isn't on first-name terms yet with the company's New Zealand co-founder.

Tim Brown, the former All Whites captain who is now co-chief executive of San Francisco-based Allbirds, says DiCaprio stumbled across the company himself.

""I wouldn't say he's a friend, that might be overplaying it,"" says Brown, laughing.

Advertisement

""He's one of the pre-eminent environmental spokespeople and he found the brand rather organically ... through one of his cousins, randomly enough, and he has become an investor and backed us, which has been pretty neat.""

Though the size of DiCaprio's investment isn't known, it hasn't gone unnoticed. The star made his backing public knowledge when he told his 18.9 million Twitter followers.

""[DiCaprio] is selective in the companies he backs so it was pretty cool to be able to get that across the line,"" Brown says.

""Hopefully, we can continue to use him to help tell [our] story.""

At $2b, Allbirds' value has been assessed at twice that of space powerhouse Rocket Lab and way more than merino clothing company Icebreaker, which was valued at $288m when it sold in April. That valuation follows Allbirds' announcement last month that it had raised US$50m ($72.5m), a price which would value the entire company at US$1.4b ($2.03b).

Brown dreamed up the idea behind Allbirds in Wellington in 2009, when he was playing professional football for the Wellington Phoenix.

""This business was born as a curiosity project ... and was really a reaction to the free shoes I used to get as an athlete - from one of the major sportswear companies that shall not be named - in the belief it was very hard to find simple sneakers,"" the 37-year-old says.

Brown harboured the idea of a simple shoe for a long time before partnering with San Francisco local, long-time friend and Allbirds co-founder Joey Zwillinger in 2015.

The pair had met through their wives, who were room-mates in college. Together, they set out to create a simple trainer that wouldn't harm the environment.

""This was a bad idea for a long time before it was a good one,"" Brown laughs.

Allbirds launched in March 2016 and in its first 14 months, the business sold only one pair of shoes.

Brown says being eco-friendly and sustainable was ""non-negotiable"" and the reason he and Zwillinger founded the company in the first place.

""We think of Allbirds as a sustainable raw material innovation company more than a footwear company or wool company. People don't buy sustainable products, they buy great products, so we've tried to focus on great design and making shoes that are comfortable, with a view to work backwards ... to make the shoes as sustainable as possible.

""Sometimes when you hear the word sustainability, certainly in fashion, you assume you are paying more for something that is less good. There's a perception issue, and it requires a bit of a re-think for businesses and brands to [curb] that.""

Allbirds uses materials that aren't common in the footwear industry: wool, a eucalyptus fibre and a by-product of sugar cane.

On Thursday it released its first trainer - the ""Tree topper"" - that features its SweetFoam™ sole, derived from sugar cane.

Allbirds began developing the carbon-negative ethylene-vinyl acetate foam, derived from sugar cane sourced from southern Brazil, in 2016, and hopes the invention will revolutionise the global footwear industry, which churns out an estimated 25 billion pairs of shoes a year.

""The cool part about it is, we made the materials open-source - so it's available for the rest of the footwear industry to use, which is not traditionally how the footwear world operates,"" he says.

""[Sustainability] is not something we're going to solve as an individual company; it's more a collective movement.""

Allbirds' NZ wool shoes are made in Korea and its ""tree"" shoes are made in Shenzhen, outside Hong Kong.

Brown has worn hundreds of shoe prototypes, and says the first designs looked like ""something you wear when you have a medical problem"".

Fast forward two and a half years, and Allbirds has a range of seven shoe models, including a jandal. In March the company sold its millionth pair.

The company now has a team of 170 people based in San Francisco. Head designer Jamie McLellan is an Aucklander.

""I read about the challenges of the wool industry in a magazine in New Zealand when I was playing soccer, which kicked off this whole idea,"" Brown says.

""New Zealand used to have 80-odd million sheep in the 80s and now it's less than 30 million and no one's growing up dreaming about being a sheep farmer ... [it is a] remarkable fibre which has done a pretty poor job of marketing itself.""

Retail stores are a big part of Allbirds strategy - but not a chain of stores in every city in every market.

[It] was a bad idea for a long time before it was a good one.

The retailer has flagship stores in San Francisco, New York and most recently in Covent Garden, London, which opened last month.

""It will be select retail stores in important markets,"" Brown says. ""I don't think this is a Starbucks story ... it is about the intersection between online and offline business.

""The largest part of our business is online but we're finding offline retail stores are really important places to tell the story and teach people about our materials.""

Brown says the US stores have been successful and he hopes to open a New Zealand store soon, though he can't say when or where.

""The dream is to do a store in New Zealand one day soon, so we're working hard on that.

I'm from Wellington and it's got a special place in my heart; Auckland is probably the biggest city, so who knows - we'll see if I can exert my influence.""

Allbirds is also looking to Asia, including China, for international expansion.

Brown was born in Ascot, England, and moved to New Zealand aged 3. His father is English and his mother a Kiwi.

Brown attended Wellington College and had a short stint at Victoria University, where he studied architecture before accepting a football scholarship to the University of Cincinnati.

He retired from professional football after 10 years, following the 2010 World Cup, to go to the London School of Economics to do a masters degree in international management.

Allbirds' 'Tree Topper' shoes are the first range to use its SweetFoam sole derived from sugar cane.

It was at there the idea for Allbirds became serious.

""I had a window of time to sort of take this idea that was very much a prototype and see if it was a business,"" he says.

""If I didn't have that time, I probably wouldn't have [started] it.""

Now based in San Francisco with his American wife and 14-month-old daughter, Brown gets back to New Zealand every year for a holiday, and at every opportunity he gets.

This week, he's back to give a talk at an enterprise bootcamp – a two-day seminar for entrepreneurs using natural products who want to break into the US market, and will catch up with his friend and fellow wool advocate Jeremy Moon, founder of Icebreaker.

Brown says Icebreaker put New Zealand's merino wool industry on the global stage.

""Talking to some of the farmers down south that make our fibre, wool is having a moment, certainly in the States ... There's enormous potential for the wool industry to continue to grow and do great things in different categories.""

There's no better time to be a merino wool farmer, he says.

""The synthetics industry is being challenged as the singular way to make fashionable products. I think wool has worked out how to tell its story a lot better and part of that is the South Island, the prettiest part of the world that you could imagine.""

So far, Allbirds has raised US$75m in investment funding. Investors include former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz and global investment firm Tiger Global.

""It's a really interesting time for New Zealand businesses and New Zealand brands in America,"" Brown says.

""Many Americans have never been to New Zealand and don't know where it is, but love it nevertheless, and I think there's an enormously big opportunity for businesses or brands to go there and tell the story of a part of the world that looks after the environment and cares about the way products are made.

""The core of what Allbirds is, is sustainable material innovation, and we want to double down on trying to find new ways to make better products because we believe there is a real problem to solve within the fashion and footwear industry.""

"Press Release – Bayley’s Real Estate

An established and successful fashion and homeware store that is highly active in face-to-face retail and has the support of an online store clothing is now on the market for sale.An established and successful fashion and homeware store that is highly active in face-to-face retail and has the support of an online store clothing is now on the market for sale.

The business known as DECODE Ltd – located at 13 Camp Street in the heart of Queenstown’s central business district retail precinct – has been operating for 14 years.

Clothing is the core product of the store, with a high turnover rate of stock. The curation of selected homewares, jewellery, soft furnishings, and accessories has created a unique experience for customers. DECODE’s clientele is predominantly woman aged between 35 – 65-years-old.

Responding to demand from clients based in and around the Otago region, greater New Zealand and a growing international clientele, DECODE launched its online store at the end of 2017. The online store currently processes 3.5 sales per week.

Over the years, DECODE founder Maree Cross has built a brand profile of her retail store through networking and some advertising, but mostly through meeting the needs of her clients with excellent customer service partnered with unique and quality product.

DECODE has always been active in the community. For many years it was a major supporter of the famous Queenstown Winter Festival. DECODE has always contributed to community fundraising projects and philanthropic projects – both short and long-term. In 2015 DECODE was encouraged to enter the NZ Retail Awards, and was runner-up in the Best independent Store category.

The business employs a full-time owner/operator and five part-time staff. DECODE

tenants a 144 square metre town centre premises, and is currently on a year lease running through to 2021 – with two further six-year rights of renewal maturing in 2033. The landlords are extremely established in commercial real estate and are excellent to work with,

Now the DECODE business is being marketed for sale as a going concern by deadline private treaty through Bayleys Auckland and Bayleys Queenstown, with offers closing at 4pm on March 6.

Bayleys Auckland business brokers Paul Dixon and Caroline Hanson said DECODE ran its retail operations six days a week from 10am – 6pm. And between 10am and 5pm on Sundays.

“DECODE has made the transition from being purely a physical trading entity with a prominent location in the heart of bustling Queenstown, to embracing on-line trading as an adjunct to its business,” Mr Dixon said.

“The online store has been operational for just over a year and contributes to the shop’s annual turnover which exceeds $1.2 million – delivering a healthy bottom line,” added Mr Dixon.

“The ethos of the store has been to create an authentic, pleasurable and relaxed retail experience for clients. By providing a selective range of clothing blended with jewellery, homeware and desirable accessories, DECODE has not only added value to the client’s experience, but has also increased revenues. Stock is beautifully showcased in a visually and spatially-pleasing environment.

“Street frontage and exposure to the market is extremely sought-after in Queenstown, and DECODE has secured a very high-profile position.”

Ms Hanson said the store offered an alternative to the mass-produced high street fashion labels. She said garments were sourced from both international and New Zealand designers – some of which were still manufactured in New Zealand, which was a rarity these days.

“The product is of high quality in both design integrity and production. The European brands offer fashion forward collections and textiles that have limited availability in New Zealand,” Ms Hanson said.

“The new owner will most likely have an interest in women’s’ fashion and home styling, however the running of the business can be learnt. DECODE founder and current owner Maree Cross is available to assist any new owner through the

transition period, and will support and mentor them for an agreed period of time – giving them the greatest opportunity to continue thriving,” she said.

“There is the opportunity for a new owner to grow and expand both the retail and on-line stores or concentrate on one aspect of these. The store is constantly approached by up-and-coming designers and new brands, so there is potential to develop product further.

“As the current owner is now looking to retire, DECODE Ltd is on the market for sale.”

"An Innerleithen firm specialising in environmentally-friendly outdoor clothing is set for national recognition after being shortlisted for this year’s Scottish Environment Business Awards.

Active lifestyle brand Findra, based in the town’s High Street, is one of five firms shortlisted for the product Scotland accolade at this year’s Vibes awards.

Formerly known as the Vision in Business for the Environment of Scotland awards and still called the Vibes for short, they focus on inspiring companies to play their part in helping Scotland become to be a world leader on tackling climate change.

Findra was founded by keen cyclist Alex Feechan five years ago after she struggled to find suitable, stylish and comfortable exercise clothes.

Deciding to create them herself, Alex’s firm has since gone from strength to strength since its launch in 2014.

Its shop and design hub opened in Innerleithen’s High Street in 2017 and new retail space was established in Edinburgh last year.

Alex’s workforce is now into double figures.

And these awards could be about to showcase the firm’s recognisable brand, which uses only natural, sustainable and recycled materials, on a national stage.

Founder Alex, a former head of design at Peter Scott’s old knitwear factory in Hawick, said: “This is our first time being shortlisted for an award like this, so we are delighted.

“It’s great to be recognised in the product category as a small business as we are working hard to produce products that are natural and sustainable.

“The brand is for people who love being outside and, as we love the outdoors, we want to protect the environment with the products we make.

“We are committed to producing clothing which combines natural or recycled raw materials with innovative manufacturing, such as our pioneering seamless performance technique which sees our 100% Merino wool garments created with zero waste.

“It’s an honour to be shortlisted for this award and to rub shoulders with other fantastic and inspiring business.”

As part of this year’s 20th anniversary celebrations, a special award will also be presented to a past winner which has demonstrated an ongoing contribution to sustainable development by embracing new practices and constantly reviewing its systems so that it remains environmentally focused.

Bob Downes, chairman of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and head of the Vibes judging panel, said: “The scale of environmental challenges facing humanity is enormous, with a real urgency to act.

“The successful businesses of tomorrow will be those who embrace the economic opportunity of sustainable solutions to environmental challenges.

“I would like to congratulate all the finalists who have been recognised by the Vibes Awards, and I look forward to announcing the winners in due course.”

This year marks the 20th anniversary of the awards and finalists have been selected across 11 categories which recognise the various ways sustainable best practice can be implemented.

The winners will be announced at a ceremony on Thursday, November 14, at the Doubletree by Hilton hotel in Glasgow."

Last year, a law came into force banning microbeads - the tiny plastic particles used in products like facial scrubs - because they were being ingested by marine life, and the beauty industry patted itself on the back for a job well done.

Of course, eliminating microbeads was a step in the right direction, but take a look at the average bathroom shelf and you'll discover there's still a long way to go, with manufacturers heavily dependent on plastic packaging to house all those lotions and lipsticks.

The UK uses 13 billion plastic bottles each year, according to the House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee report, so, clearly, we need to reduce the amount of single-use plastic we use and send to landfill while also increasing the amount we recycle - and fast.

While it may sometimes seem that the beauty industry is doing more harm than good in the battle against plastic pollution, there are a number of companies taking steps to improve their packaging and environmental impact.

Lush, which has a long history in environmental and animal activism, has just opened its first 'Naked' shop in the UK, with the Manchester store selling only plastic packaging-free products, such as shampoo bars and solid cleansers.

French brand L'Occitane has announced a commitment to use 100% recycled plastic for its packaging by 2025, while Urban Veda has partnered with Plastic Oceans Foundation UK, pledging 10% of all online sales to support the charity in its fight against plastic pollution.

For some firms, change will take time, but plenty of others are already making strides towards a plastic-free future, from small independent names to cosmetics giants.

Want to do your bit? Here are 11 brands that can help make your beauty routine more green...

1. Lush

Natural World argan oil shampoo

""Did you know that plastic bottles take 450 years or more to decompose?"" asks Michael Eggerton, director at Brodie and Stone, where bottles are made from 100% recycled plastic, with bio-based labels made from sugar cane.

Eggerton admits that making the move to a recycled material wasn't easy. Because the new plastic comes from a mix of sources, it has a grey tint, rather than being completely clear.

""We also faced the challenge of shininess, as the final bottles come matte, so we need to educate the consumers who think the product has gone off because as the packaging is not a bright as usual.""

"Ms Toh Lay Ngoh, 60, of Singapore Press Holdings' Chinese Media Group, donated seven bags of clothing at SPH's Earth Day 2019 event yesterday, after rallying her family and colleagues over the past week.

She was doing her part for the event's first textile donation drive, which aimed to collect 350kg in used textiles to mark media giant SPH's 35th anniversary this year.

The annual event took place at the SPH Auditorium in Toa Payoh and also featured upcycling workshops and an eco-bazaar.

""I told my colleagues to go do some spring cleaning, and specially told my family to see if they have any old clothing to donate and recycle,"" said Ms Toh, a senior corporate services manager.

She also bought vegan cakes from Well Dressed Salad Bar & Cafe at the event, which she packed into her reusable container.

She said she tries her best to avoid animal food products as she wants to be compassionate towards animals and also stay healthier at the same time.

The Straits Times travel writer Lee Siew Hua donated about 5kg in textiles, saying she donates clothes once every 18 months. She has also stopped using plastic straws to help reduce plastic waste.

At the end of the event, about 500kg in textiles were collected, exceeding the target of 350kg.

SAY NO TO PLASTIC Each of us is playing a part. If everyone simply refused plastic in the first place, it would make a huge difference. MS PAULA MIQUELIS, co-founder of sustainability group Green is the New Black.

Related Story Take action to beat eco-anxiety, and spread the word

To raise awareness of the impact of plastic waste on the environment and to encourage the public to use less single-use plastic, Keppel Land and Keppel Reit Management joined hands to organise the display of an artwork made with debris from Singapore's shores.

Named Ayer Ayer Project Table, the interactive artwork is an 8m-long table in the shape of Singapore's Punggol beach coastline. The public, together with facilitators and tenants, can co-create the artwork by removing microplastic fragments found in the debris of the artwork.

This seeks to highlight the issue of plastic pollution, as studies have shown that microplastics are entering the human food chain.

The artwork is on display at Ocean Financial Centre from now till April 26; Marina Bay Financial Centre from April 29 to May 3 and Keppel Bay Tower from May 6 to 10.

To also encourage people to be more conscious about using and avoiding single-use plastic, Dentsu Singapore and Green is the New Black, a sustainability group, created the Plastic Salt campaign.

Dentsu Singapore used recycled plastic to print 3D miniature items such as straws, cups and bottles. These were then placed in salt grinders in eateries across Singapore to raise awareness.

""Each of us is playing a part. If everyone simply refused plastic in the first place, it would make a huge difference. Wherever possible, we need to help to raise awareness of these issues - we need to educate more people and fast,"" said Green is the New Black co-founder Paula Miquelis."
"Pop CBR owners and local makers Gabe Trew and Mikhaila Pennell, have seen a boom in business.

Activewear brand SKINS has filed for bankruptcy; Gap has left Australian shores; Kmart sales are down; the Avon lady is no more.

Across Australia the retail sector is suffering, but in Canberra there is a glimmer of hope.

Retail spending increased more in the ACT than anywhere else in the country in November last year, and experts said it was the growing interest in local products, sold in pop-up stores and at markets, proving Canberrans still loved to shop.

The ""maker to market"" movement has cemented itself in Canberra's retail scene as the ideal way, not only to connect with local businesses, but to shop sustainably, simply, and with heart.

""I think Canberra is at the forefront of this renaissance,"" Gabe Trew, co-owner of Pop CBR in New Acton's Nishi precinct, said.

Initially set to open just for the month of December to make the most of the Christmas trade, Pop CBR proved such a hit with Canberrans that they extended their lease.

""There was essentially a real push from people saying 'we don't want you to close, we want somewhere to go to be able to buy all those local things',"" Mr Trew said.

""There's a strong community of local artists and makers who have been able to mobilise their businesses through markets, and through a community that is really conscious of their buying.""

'People are looking for uniqueness'

Russell Zimmerman, from the Australian Retailers Association, said Canberrans were not alone in altering their buying habits.

""As a community, generally we are becoming more conscious,"" Mr Zimmerman said.

""What we're seeing at the moment is that consumers want to buy things that are ethically sourced, and local makers — artisans — fill a very niche market.

""We're seeing a lot of growth in that area. They can assure customers, for example, that there's no slave labour, or that the coffee is fair trade.

""They go out of their way to ensure the product is high quality, and you get a product you can trust.""

Mr Zimmerman said in the lead up to Christmas and in the post-Christmas sales, people actively turned back to small businesses to do their shopping.

""We're seeing it across the board, with anything from a local coffee shop, to a clothing retailer. People are looking for uniqueness,"" he said.

Products that 'spark joy'

If it is uniqueness consumers are looking for, Canberra's local makers provide it in buckets.

Pop CBR is one of several stores across the ACT region devoted to selling local wares, with over 50 brands stocked in the one store alone.

Customers can purchase everything from gin to chocolate to jewellery to ceramics to clothes, with the additional benefit of knowing exactly where their money is going.

""Local products resonate with people strongly,"" Mr Trew said.

""They feel direct value from spending money on a local product; you're buying an object that will, for want of a better phrase, 'spark joy' because of who made it and why they made it, because of the story.""

'They've got an attachment to their clothing again'

The concept of ""sparking joy"" may have been made popular by Marie Kondo, but local fashion designer Kelli Donovan said it was nothing new.

One half of Pure Pod, Ms Donovan launched her latest line Native Pollen in November and has been operational for 12 years.

""Marie Kondo is hitting the nail on the head with something we've been talking about for ages,"" she said.

""People want a connection, they want to love, they want to feel joy in the product, [they] are sick of constantly buying.

""With maker to market, a consumer can go and meet you and talk to you about the product and they've got an attachment back to their clothing again.""

Ms Donovan said Canberrans, particularly, were sick of the big chain stores.

""In Canberra there's a thirst for something that's a bit different,"" she said.

""They are getting sick of cheap fast fashion and all the stories that go behind that.

""There's a lot of pollution and waste, oversupply, over-manufacturing, there's a huge landfill problem. I didn't want to be part of the problem, I wanted to be part of the solution in the fashion industry.

""I understand that people can't always afford small, artisan work, but I think people are becoming more concerned about what's going on with the environment, what's going on with climate change, and they just don't want as much stuff.""

Buying local, sustainable doesn't mean more expensive

But according to Mr Zimmerman, the notion that buying local, sustainable and ethical products meant they were unaffordable was a myth.

""It's actually not that much more expensive,"" he said. ""Not every customer can do it, but there's a big enough slice of the market who can, and we're seeing this more and more.

""The consumer is smart, they don't want to be ripped off, and they're prepared to pay extra to get something good for them and the environment.""

That concept is backed by the business owners themselves.

""We want to say that local shopping doesn't have to be exorbitant,"" Mr Trew said.

""People really like supporting the community, particularly in Canberra, so they'll pay the extra few dollars. If you support the makers and buy local, prices come down."
"New packaging tests will include Canadian QSR firsts – fully re-pulpable cups and fibre lids

TORONTO, June 19, 2019 /CNW/ - McDonald's Canada is on a journey to make its packaging more sustainable as part of its goal to reduce its environmental footprint and source 100 per cent of guest packaging from renewable and/or recycled materials.

To help get there, McDonald's will unveil two ""Green Concept Restaurants"" in London, Ontario and Vancouver, BC. These restaurants will act as incubator locations to test new packaging options and recycling initiatives.

The Green Concept Restaurants will continue using much of the current McDonald's packaging but will also test items with the potential to be rolled out more widely in the future. The first innovations will begin testing in the coming months and include:

A fully re-pulpable cup for cold beverages – a Canadian QSR first

– a Canadian QSR first The cup uses an aqueous coating that is acceptable in recycling streams



A medium size cup will be tested

"Tech giant Google and sustainability champion Stella McCartney are teaming up to help reduce the environmental footprint of the fashion industry.

McCartney has long spearheaded the use of recyclable fabrics, organic cotton and synthetic leathers in her designs, so it seems only natural that Google should look to the 47-year-old to help create a scheme which aims to improve sustainability in the fashion supply chain.

At the Copenhagen Fashion Summit on Tuesday, Google announced that it is building a Google Cloud data analytics and machine learning service that will “give brands a more comprehensive view into their supply chain,” particularly at the level of raw production.

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.

The machine learning technology will be used to help brands estimate the environmental impact of particular items of clothing at the sourcing and design stages, and use this data to help companies take action.

The pilot has been launched in response to the growing environmental impact of the the fashion industry. According to Google, the fashion industry accounts for 20 per cent of wastewater and 10 per cent of carbon emissions globally.

In addition, a recent report from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation – a registered charity that campaigns for economic change – found that clothes account for half a million tons of non-biodegradable microfibers reaching the oceans every year, the equivalent of more than 50 billion plastic bottles.

The pilot scheme will begin by looking at cotton and viscose, which have been chosen due to the scale of their production, the availability of data and impact considerations.

Speaking about the initiative, McCartney said: “At Stella McCartney, we have been continuously focusing on looking at responsible and sustainable ways to conduct ourselves in fashion, it is at the heart of what we do.

“We are trying our best – we aren’t perfect, but we are opening a conversation that hasn’t really been had in the history of fashion.”

Google Cloud head of retail Nick Martin added: “This pilot will enable us to test the effectiveness of the tool on these different raw materials, building out the possibilities for expansion into a wider variety of key textiles in the market down the line.

“We plan to include data sources that allow companies to better measure the impact of their raw materials relevant to key environmental factors, such as air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, land use, and water scarcity.”

Google has confirmed that its work with Stella McCartney is just the first stage of the process and that it is actively working with fashion brands, experts, NGOs and industry bodies in order to create an open industry-wide tool that any company can use.

The scheme comes just months after the Foresight Future of the Sea report revealed that the amount of plastic in the world’s oceans is set to treble in a decade unless action is taken to deal with the problem.

Experts warned that plastic is one of the biggest threats facing the world’s seas, while highlighting other keys issues including rising sea levels, warming oceans and metal and chemical pollution."
"The owner of high street fashion chain Zara has announced that all of its collections will be made from 100% sustainable fabrics before 2025.

Inditex – which was named the world’s third largest apparel company this year by Forbes – said its other brands, including Zara Home, Massimo Dutti and Pull&Bear, will also follow suit.

The commitment to a more responsible future was made on Tuesday at its annual shareholders’ meeting and makes Zara, which accounts for 70% of Inditex’s group sales, the first international high street store to make such a commitment, reports WWD.

It is one of several ambitious targets to be announced. By 2025, 80% of the energy consumed in Zara’s headquarters, factories and stores will be from renewable sources and its facilities will produce zero landfill waste, the company said. By 2023, it promised, the viscose used will also be 100% sustainable.

Pablo Isla, the chief executive of Inditex, said: “We need to be a force for change, not only in the company but in the whole sector.

“We are the ones establishing these targets: the strength and impulse for change is coming from the commercial team, the people who are working with our suppliers, the people working with fabrics. It is something that’s happening inside our company.”

The group was named the most sustainable retailer by the Dow Jones sustainability index from 2016 to 2018, and is owned by Spain’s richest man, Amancio Ortega.

Isla insisted this week that despite Inditex’s presence on nearly every main high street around the world “the opposite of a fast-fashion company”, adding: “We operate with a different model. We make our own patterns, work with our own factories, keep low levels of inventory, have local sourcing and manufacturing and don’t have promotions in stores.”

Last year, annual sales grew 3% to €26.1bn.

Zara and H&M back in-store recycling to tackle throwaway culture Read more

Inditex is already in the middle of a serious sustainability drive. Since 2015 it has collected more than 34,000 tonnes of used stock, after it installed clothes banks in more than 800 stores in 24 regions. A service picking up used clothes from customers’ homes has proved effective in Spain, Beijing and Shanghai and will be extended to London, Paris and New York.

The company has partnered with charities, such as the Red Cross, on redistributing the used stock and is working with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to find feasible ways of fibre recycling. It has committed to disposing of unused items responsibly and has promised that its factories will no longer discharge hazardous chemicals at any stage of the supply chain by 2020.

The promises come as fashion companies are under increased scrutiny from consumers, who are demanding ethical production practices and responsible retailing, particularly concerning excess levels of stock and the disposal of unwanted garments.

The recent news that the UK government rejected parliamentary environmental audit committee proposals, including a tax of 1p per garment to help curb the throwaway culture and mandatory environmental targets for brands turning over more than £36m a year, caused outrage. The government’s report Fixing Fashion also proposed a nationwide ban on incinerating or sending to landfill clothes that can be reused or recycled.

The government said it would consider the proposals by 2025, saying: “We believe that positive approaches are required to find outlets for waste textiles rather than simply imposing a landfill ban.”"

"Raise the selfie stick, strike a pose and … wait! Did you post that outfit already?

With fast fashion brands aggressively marketing new wardrobes for every season and consumers acting as our own Instagram paparazzi, there’s daily pressure to be seen in something new and trendsetting. This summer, news leaked that Burberry burned almost $50 million in old stock just to maintain that pressure and exclusivity.

The British fashion label announced it will stop burning clothes, and though it’s reassuring to see brands respond to criticism, consumers need to make our own changes.

According to one expert, 80 per cent of the clothes we buy don’t get out of the closet much. Studies show we’re consuming 400 per cent more clothing than we did 20 years ago — back when you could wear the same flannel-and-baggy-jean combo for a week and call it ’90s grunge.

“The system is broken and we need to change it,” says Kelly Drennan, founder of the Toronto-based fashion sustainability group Fashion Takes Action.

Drennan practises “slow fashion,” a movement focused on slowing the roll of consumerism throughout the fashion life cycle and at every stage of life. From new parents dealing with the flood of gifted baby clothes, to the teenager who wants a new wardrobe every September, to the newly promoted office manager who needs an apparel upgrade, slow fashion means embracing the seven Rs — not just reduce, reuse, recycle, but also research, repair, repurpose and rent.

Slow fashion means embracing the seven Rs — not just reduce, reuse, recycle, but also research, repair, repurpose and rent.

Research can minimize environmental impact. Check out Good On You, an app that rates the eco-friendliness of apparel for kids and adults, or look for brands like Petit Pli, which uses expanding pleats to makes clothes that grow with your child from newborn to toddler. Drennan also recommends clothing swaps to keep those adorable onesies on cute babies instead of in landfills.

Encourage older kids to mend items or even bring new life to used pieces at a sewing class. Fashion Takes Action offers My Clothes, My World, a school program that teaches kids about slow fashion and culminates with designing handbags out of old T-shirts. What we parents wore in high school is one-of-a-kind vintage now.

For teens and adults, clothing rental services offer a sustainable way to nab more current styles. With Canadian companies like Rent Frock Repeat and Boro, you can rock a designer dress for a third to a tenth of the retail price — all the highs of retail therapy without the crash of the full credit card bill. Bonus: Boro sources its stock from customers’ closets, so you can rent out outfits you don’t wear anymore. And it makes the practice more sustainable.

Fashion bloggers are also embracing the capsule wardrobe, a small rotation of classic, quality pieces you mix and match year-round, and change up with smaller accessories. Each item might cost more, but you’ll buy less and get better mileage overall.

“You’re going to take better care because you paid more for it,” says Drennan.

A signature look made with fewer pieces leads to less trend-chasing.

At every stage of life, there’s more we can do to cut down our fashion consumption from the crib to the catwalk.

"Image copyright Composite Image caption Fast fashion online is a booming industry - how does it affect the environment?

Scrolling through Instagram, you're bound to come across an influencer wearing an outfit from one of the internet's many fast fashion retailers.

Sites like Boohoo.com, Pretty Little Thing and Missguided offer loads of clothes at really low prices - and they update much quicker than the high street.

But how are these online retailers impacting the environment? And what role does social media play in the ""wear it once"" trend?

MPs released a report last week outlining their worries about fast fashion's effect on the environment.

They found that British shoppers are buying twice as many items of clothing as they did 10 years ago and that discarded clothes are piling up in landfill sites.

The fashion industry is a major source of the greenhouse gases that are overheating the planet, said MPs, and they approached a number of high street retailers about the issue.

But one thing missing from the report is the impact of the many online fashion sites popular with young women in the UK.

Patsy Perry, a fashion marketing lecturer at the University of Manchester, said the way these websites are designed encourage people to buy more.

""Some of them might have new products every week,"" she told Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""They really trade on very very frequently renewing collections, more so than many traditional high street retailers.""

'We've got a real crisis in confidence in young people'

As well as the availability of new clothes, the trend of posting outfits on social media makes some women feel like they can't wear the same thing more than once, says Patsy.

""We see celebrities doing that - all the big influencers you barely see them wearing the same thing twice,"" she adds.

Natasha Daniels agrees. She runs a site called Our Daily Thread, which she describes as a love letter to fashion.

The pressure to update your wardrobe all the time is real and needs to be addressed, says Natasha. But she worries that the retailers are being used as an easy scapegoat for an underlying cultural attitude.

""We've got to look at the reasons why people are turning to fast fashion,"" she says.

""I think we've got a real crisis in confidence in young people and when you pair that with the Instagram culture of: 'I don't want to wear the same outfit twice', people buy new clothes in response.""

But the motivation isn't the same for everyone. Shoppers on a budget aren't buying clothes to wear once, they're buying cheap clothes because they can't afford more expensive options, says Natasha.

""For a lot of people, it isn't throwaway and frivolous. For a lot of people, buying clothes from those sites is their clothing budget,"" she says.

""These are the clothes that they wear every day and I think tarring it with the fast fashion brush is a really snobby attitude to have.""

'It doesn't come without a guilty conscience'

There's no doubt that online fast fashion is booming. PrettyLittleThing and Nastygal fashion labels reported a 50% rise in sales in the six months to August 2018.

Boohoo's social media followers have also soared. The brand now has 6.3 million followers on Instagram, a 200% rise in the last 12 months. It has 1.4 million followers on Facebook.

But there is growing awareness among young people that constant clothing consumption is impacting the environment, says Sara McAlpine, ELLE UK's fashion features editor.

Her magazine recently surveyed its readers and found that 9 in 10 wanted to know more about sustainability.

""They are aware that they have an appetite for more but I don't think that comes without a guilty conscience or the awareness that we are accumulating all these things,"" she said.

How to be a sustainable fashion lover

Natasha says we should be encouraging people to buy things they really love, instead of shaming them for buying things at all.

""If you want to buy something from Boohoo and it's £10 - that's fine,"" she says. ""Just make sure it's something you really want that you know you'll wear a lot.""

And when you are finished with a piece of clothing, don't throw it in the bin. ""Give it to a charity shop or put it in a clothes bank,"" says Hannah Carter from Love Not Landfill, a campaign to encourage clothing sustainability.

""Anything that goes into a clothes bank will be recycled, even odd socks, old knickers and stained tops. Nothing will be wasted.""

Hannah also suggests trying to make clothes last a bit longer by looking after them better, by mending a minor tear or sewing a button back on yourself. She even has a tip for the wash cycle: ""Wash on low temperatures and try to avoid tumble drying and dry cleaning as it's tough on the fabrics. Clothes will last longer if they're hung out to dry.""

Changing your shopping habits is difficult, says Patsy, from the University of Manchester: ""It's like fast food, it's easy, you get a quick fix, a buzz when you buy it.""

But the main driver of change would be an ""initiative where people don't feel ashamed of wearing the same thing again,"" she added.

Newsbeat contacted Boohoo, Pretty Little Thing and Missguided for comment, but none were available to talk.

"It's Green Week at the Strategist, where we’ll be talking with eco-living experts and scouring the Internet for the best products that leave a light footprint and solve little household problems. Tees from For Days. Photo: Courtesy of the retailer.

In May, a company with a “closed-loop system” for T-shirts launched. For Days was founded by Kristy Caylor, who created ethical fashion label Maiyet in 2011, to kind of do what Rent the Runway does, but for day-to-day tees. What that means in practice is that For Days will send subscribers either one tee, three tees, six tees, or ten tees, and then, when you’ve finished with them — maybe you stain one, maybe you get tired of them — you can send them back. For Days sends you a brand-new tee and recycles the old one.

All of which is to say that in 2018, buying an ethical, ecofriendly T-shirt is easier than ever. Besides the For Days closed-loop model, there’s Jungmaven (which uses hemp instead of cotton), Alternative Apparel (its shirts are crafted with organic cotton and recycled materials), and Reformation (it makes its garments from rescued dead stock and repurposed vintage), all of which make long-lasting and sustainable shirts that people actually want to wear. To sort through the growing number of ecofriendly options, we asked a group — including journalists, designers, and fashion consultants — to tell us their favorite sustainable T-shirt on the market.

Alternative Apparel Drift Eco Gauze T-Shirt Colleen Coughlin, who teaches classes on sustainability for groups like Debris Free Oceans, likes this slouchy tee from Alternative Apparel. “They do an awesome job of creating ecofriendly, but still fashion-forward apparel,” she says. “They produce 80 percent of their products with sustainable materials and processes. On top of that, their processes include using 60 percent less water on average and completely nontoxic dyes. The company, and the shirt, is pretty rad.” Buy

Kowtow Building Block Oversized Tee Kowtow’s tees are made of fair-trade certified organic cotton, and its packaging, from tags to bags, is made from sustainably sourced, recyclable paper. The brand was recommended by two of our experts. “I love this particular oversize tee from Kowtow,” said Elizabeth Stilwell, the creator of sustainable living blog the Note Passer. “It has a perfect slouchy, lived-in look. Plus, I feel good about buying from them: Kowtow uses 100 percent certified fair-trade organic cotton and lists all of its eco-certifications right in the product descriptions. Everything I’ve ever bought from them is well-made, timeless, and still going strong in my closet.” Coughlin agrees. “Kowtow is leading the way for true sustainability,” she said. Buy

Classic Crew T “Loomstate is the OG of organic cotton T-shirts,” according to journalist Alden Wicker, who covers fashion and sustainability. “They’ve been organic-cotton advocates since way before it was cool. They focus now on uniforms (last I remember, Chipotle was a customer), but you can still buy yourself a solid basic white tee from their online store. Plus, it’s the most usable and basic, and the cut is flattering. And it’s both 100 percent organic and made in a GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard International Working Group)-certified factory.” Buy

For Days Mid Slim Crew “I like For Days tees,” says Jasmin Malik Chua, one of the founding editors of fashion site Ecouterre. “They’re made in L.A., and when you’re done with them, For Days will break down the fibers to make yarn for a new batch of shirts, which means it’s a completely closed-loop model.” Plus, she says, she likes the variety in styles. “You can get a never-gets-old classic crew, and a more au courant boxy mid-mock.” Tara St. James, the designer behind environmentally conscious fashion line Study New York, agreed. “My favorite is the white tee, or any tee, really, from For Days,” she said. Buy

Jungmaven Baja Tee Faye Lessler, the founder of Sustaining Life, recommended a simple white tee from Jungmaven. “They’re the best,” she said. “I’ve had mine for over two years, and somehow it’s still white — which never ever happens.” But the thing she loves most, she said, is the fact that the shirt is made of hemp. “The environmental impact of growing hemp versus cotton is huge,” she says. “It requires about a third of the amount of water. It uses significantly less pesticide as well because hemp naturally repels pests, whereas cotton really, really does not.” Buy

Photo: Arturo Torres/2017 Arturo Torres Amour Vert Valentine Organic Cotton Tee Two of our experts recommended Amour Vert. “There are several reasons I love their tees,” said wardrobe stylist and eco-activist Jennifer Rosson. “The first reason is that they’re just extremely high-quality, and if you buy a poorly made, ill-fitting tee just because it’s sustainable and then never wear it, then that’s the opposite of sustainability. Second, the company uses sustainably harvested trees, and for every tee purchased, they plant a tree. Plus, they’re made here in the USA.” Lauren Faye, who works at Fashion Revolution, a company that campaigns for systemic reform of the fashion industry, agrees. “Plus, they’re inexpensive,” she said. “Which is always good.” Buy

Women’s Recover Local Tee Sustainable fashion advocate Shannon Lohr thinks the most sustainable white tee on the market is by Recover Brands. “They reclaimed scraps from discarded clothing and combine them with discarded plastic bottles to create a yarn that is completely recycled. Most importantly, the process is nearly entirely waterless and does not require any chemicals. That is almost unheard of in the apparel industry. I believe this to be the most sustainable T-shirt on the market because it makes use of materials that would otherwise be sitting in a landfill, it doesn’t require the use of any new materials, it’s nearly waterless, and it’s chemical-free.” Buy

From the lounge room of her Farrer home, fashion designer Kelli Donovan has spent more than a decade leading the conversation on ethical and sustainable fashion. And now she's ready for the world stage. Donovan is the creative force behind Pure Pod - a label that cares just as much about its impact on humans and the earth as it does about keeping women looking gorgeous. Donovan works primarily with Global Organic Textile Standard certified textiles and many of her garments are made by a Fair Trade certified manufacturer in India. Pure Pod's workflow has been designed to ensure a small carbon footprint across the entire design and manufacture process - from the planted organic cotton seed to the fabric to the finished garment. Donovan's excited, she says, to see the world catching up on the ""slow fashion"" conversation. ""Just as we have fast food we also have fast fashion: mass-produced, super cheap products whose origins and manufacturing processes are questionable,"" Donovan says. ""There's this huge momentum globally around slow fashion. Big companies and corporations are now starting to listen and look deeply into their supply chains. ""Ethically-produced fashion is not just an issue for fashion people but for everyone who wears clothing in the world. We're all responsible for our clothing. "" A Canberra native, Donovan studied fashion at CIT before travelling the world as fashion designer and product developer for a number of fashion houses in Melbourne. She became disenchanted with the industry, and was mortified when she read that fashion is in the top three biggest polluters on the planet when it comes to global greenhouse gas emissions. ""After working in the mainstream fashion industry for many years I saw the devastating impact fashion manufacturing has on the people working in it and on our environment,"" Donovan says. ""I needed to find a connection between my creativity and the environment, and it just felt natural to do my own ethical and sustainable label."" The slow fashion revolution took centre stage at New York Fashion Week this week, and also at Neonyt Fashion Week in Germany and London Fashion Week. Donovan has just spent three days in sales mode at the Fashion Exposed industry trade fair in Sydney, promoting Pure Pod to buyers for traditional bricks and mortar stores, department stores locally and internationally and online global stores. The label has also been selected to feature at Melbourne Fashion Week, in a show called Identity. It's going to be a big year for Pure Pod, and Donovan admits her days are a combination of thinking ""big and small simultaneously"". ""We really want to scale up this year so we're working with Red Hat Impact with our current investor strategy,"" she says. ""One minute we'll be working on how to get the backing to get Pure Pod on to the world stage and next minute my phone will ring and I'll suddenly be talking to a contact in India about working with marginalised women on the hand embroidery for our new summer collection. ""That's the thing with slow fashion - the world is ready for it, but it's about achieving social, economical and environmental impact slowly, garment by garment."" To get to Melbourne Fashion Week this year, Pure Pod will need sponsors. If you're interested or know someone who might be head to the contact form on the Pure Pod website.

"City Council Speaker Corey Johnson and his colleagues are trying to put my family’s 60-year-old fur company out of business — and our 150 workers out of their jobs.

The speaker has introduced legislation to ban the sale and manufacture of fur, one of New York’s oldest industries and one that still provides hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue to the Big Apple, through good times and bad.

Johnson has argued that “saying no to fur is fashionable and a symbol of progress. This proposal is about protecting animals.” But what about protecting New Yorkers and their livelihoods? This ban would uproot a venerable industry and create rippling negative economic effects, to which Johnson appears to be oblivious.

I’m 32 years old and a fourth-generation furrier. My great-grandfather came from Poland in 1938, fought in World War II, then came home and started a small fur-trading business in the Garment District.

This business became a family enterprise that passed from my great grandfather to my grandfather, from my grandfather to my uncle and aunt and from my aunt to me.

Today, we are a thriving manufacturer and retailer, working with a diverse array of designers and brands and selling a kaleidoscopic collection of products from scarves, sandals and key chains to hair ties, denim jackets and home accessories.

I’m proud of my trade and where the next generation is taking this industry.

According to the Fur Information Council of America, there are more than 130 fur businesses in New York City, providing more than 1,000 direct jobs. We serve a growing and diverse base of customers, who come from across the five boroughs, the state, the country — and the world.

The council’s legislation would bar all of these businesses from operating in New York. If Johnson cares about what his ideas would mean to the lives of real people, he doesn’t show it.

It would be unprecedented for the City Council to just erase jobs and an entire industry — a legal, sustainable and highly regulated industry at that — simply based on ideology. If the city is willing to ban fur, then other animal products like leather, wool, meat and dairy can’t be far behind. This is a slippery slope. Government shouldn’t be in our closets or our pantries.

Council members claim they are just following other cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco, which have also banned fur. But those towns don’t support the same job base as New York, where we have both retail and manufacturing.

Ban proponents also argue we no longer need real fur because fake fur is a great alternative. Yet fake fur is made from plastic materials and is part of the current trend of expendable fashion that sends 85 percent of all clothing to landfills. Real fur, by contrast, lasts decades and is recyclable and biodegradable. If the council is serious about helping the environment, promoting fake fur is not the way to go.

In October, in support of legislation to control the rents on small businesses, the council speaker tweeted: “When we lose mom and pop shops, we lose a piece of New York City.”

Fur businesses are literally the mom and pop shops upon which New York was built. The beaver is our state animal, in honor of the fur trade that launched New York’s economy. Our industry may be old, but it is still vibrant.

Shutting down small businesses that are providing jobs and tax revenue is the opposite of progressive politics. This industry has sustained families for generations. Whether you choose to wear fur or not, most New Yorkers understand that good jobs should be protected.

"Back away from those jeans! Click off of that frilly blouse! Sure new clothes are nice but our fast-fashion addiction is killing the planet.

Keeping up with the runway is toxic. Our good intentions to shop responsibly have increased, but it hasn’t lessened how much we buy and how much we throw away. Experts report that our landfills overflow with textile waste — stats from the Recycling Council of Canada reports the average person throws out 81 pounds of textiles annually.

And Fashion’s Dirty Secrets, a documentary from the Passionate Eye, reports that we produce over 100 billion new garments from new fibres annually.

No better day than tomorrow, Earth Day, to lessen your impact on the planet — and not just tomorrow, but from here on out, by throwing away fashion’s throwaway culture! Don’t just pay lip service to the world’s largest environmental event — and do more than the 3 Rs. Besides reduce, reuse, recycle, also research, repair, rent and re-purpose.

Your clothes say a lot more about you than you think. “The clothes we wear reflect both how we view the world and how we want the world to view us, so let your clothing choices reflect your commitment to social and environmental justice,” says Kelly Drennan, founder of the sustainability non-profit fashiontakesaction.com.

Skip the fast fashion upgrades — your closet needs an ethical upgrade. Before you buy, wear the change you want to see by checking up on the brand, label, designer by downloading the Good on You ethical app (goodonyou.eco).

Adds Drennan: “If a brand is doing something sustainable, you can bet they will be proudly promoting it on their website or in social media.” Find out where they make their clothes, what they pay their workers, what materials they use and how they are dealing with waste.

Build a sustainable wardrobe and become more conscious shoppers with these tips:

• Go thrifting. Since 2016, buying second-hand clothing for environmental reasons has increased by nearly 23%, reports the 2018 Ethical Consumers Market Report. Keep it going — check out Value Village and Goodwill, consignment stores, and online marketplaces, such as eBay, says Camille Kowalewski, of eBay Canada.

• “Choose sustainable fabrics that are made with natural fibres and require minimal chemical fertilizers like wool, organic cotton, linen, and hemp,” she adds. Research online for the fabrics and methods the brand uses.

• Don’t add to the landfill! Upcycle your now unloved but like-new items by donating to a charity shop or sell them online at sites such as Kijiji or eBay or trade on Bunz.com.

• Buy less. “We now consume 60% more clothing than we did 20 years ago, and we keep our clothes for half as long. So reducing the amount we buy will make a huge difference with respect to water and waste,” says Drennan.

• Clothing swaps are a great way to give new life to unwanted clothing, says Drennan.

• Repair garments to extend their life. “Grab a needle and thread and sew a button on or the hole in the toe of your sock,” adds Drennan.

• Rent instead of buying a fancy gown or suit for your next big event. “Rental companies have designer clothes at a fraction of the cost, and the best thing is that they won’t be single wear items because someone else will rent it after you.”

ECO-CONSCIOUS SCHOOLS

Staples Canada is powering young minds to think sustainably. Ten eco-conscious schools across Canada received $20,000 in new technology products from Staples as part of the 2019 Superpower your School Contest.

The contest, held annually by Staples and Earth Day Canada, recognizes Canadian schools with youth participation in environmental protection. “We hope the new technology allows these schools to amplify their efforts as environmental leaders within their communities,” says David Boone, CEO of Staples Canada.

The winners, five elementary and five secondary schools, were chosen from close to 500 applications submitted across the country. “The winning schools are emerging leaders in green living,” adds Deb Doncaster, president of Earth Day Canada.

“From school-wide commitments to compost and recycling to student-run greenhouses and gardens, these student-led initiatives are inspiring and motivating. We are proud to partner with Staples Canada to ensure that these programs are supported with the technology needed to offer students new engaging ways of teaching others.”

One winning school found that 60 to 80% of items deemed garbage were compostable materials. Another collected 80 kilograms of garbage and 20 kilograms of recycling from a local creek.

Make Earth Day every day at home. Natural health expert Jodie Pappas, of cleankissorganics.com, offers up these simple home hacks to make your space a whole lot healthier:

• Plastic containers can leach harmful chemicals into your food, so re-purpose glass jars from sauces and jams and use them for leftovers. Need something smaller? “Clean out those little jars that once held your night cream. Plastic-free, no waste, and totally healthy,” says Pappas.

• Ditch the toxins and still have shiny floors. Fill a bottle with 1/4 cup of white vinegar, warm tap water, and a few drops of lemon and orange essential oils.

• Ditch the deodorant stick that contains aluminum. A natural plant-based deodorant eliminates the odour and still lets your body to sweat when it needs to.

• Make your own dryer sheets by cutting up a few old dish rags into quarters, place inside a glass jar with a lid, add 1/4 cup of white vinegar and 25 drops of your favourite essential oil.

• Have sweet dreams by filling a glass spray bottle three-quarters with distilled water, add a blend of essential oils such as lavender, rosemary, peppermint, vetiver and ylang-ylang. Spray on your pillow and sleep better.

• Add some green to your colour scheme! Houseplants help detoxify and purify the air we breathe, great for our physical and mental health.

• Sick of swatting mosquitoes? Blend coconut oil, cedarwood, lavender, lemon and citronella oils to keep these pests at bay.

A TOAST TO MOTHER NATURE



Toast Earth Day with something organic and sustainable. And you might even forgo the wine headache. Unnecessary sulfites are a preservative commonly used in conventional winemaking.

A glass of Bonterra’s Cabernet Sauvignon anyone? “Rather than spraying our vines with chemicals, we use natural partners like bees and sheep to build a vibrant ecosystem,” says Elizabeth Drake, regenerative development manager at Bonterra Organic Vineyards. Its organically farmed wine omits pesticides from its vineyards, and no sulfites to their wines.

Drake recommends looking for shops and restaurants that specialize in organic and green wines — “these folks have tasted and done their research to offer what matters most to you: wines that align with your values and taste great.”

When shopping on your own, look for organic certification on labels to verify responsible practices."

"SPARTANBURG, S.C. — Milliken & Company (“Milliken”), a global diversified manufacturer with more than a century and a half of textile expertise, today announced that it signed a definitive agreement to acquire Polartec, LLC (“Polartec”), a strong global brand known for its innovative performance textiles for outdoor and military apparel, from Versa Capital Management, LLC (“Versa”). The acquisition is expected to close in June. Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed.

Milliken & Company to Acquire Polartec from Versa Capital Management

Headquartered in Andover, Massachusetts, the Polartec brand carries a respected portfolio of fabric technologies for outdoor apparel, from performance-driven and consumer-focused textiles, to flame-resistant, workwear and military-grade fabrics. The addition of the Polartec brand—particularly its outdoor and fleece textiles—rounds out Milliken’s comprehensive portfolio, allowing the company to deliver unprecedented access to a range of performance textiles for consumers, industrial workers and military personnel around the world.

“Polartec brings a wealth of new and respected outdoor textile expertise to complement Milliken’s strengths,” shared Halsey Cook, president and CEO of Milliken & Company. “The strategic acquisition broadens our textile capabilities with a product offering to now include fleece and soft-shell outerwear, among others, allowing us to grow in new and exciting spaces.”

“With more than 150 years of textile innovation, Milliken is the best possible ‘natural owner’ of a brand with Polartec’s pedigree. I look forward to supporting the integration,” said Polartec CEO Gary Smith. “I’m grateful to Versa Capital Management for their support in realizing Polartec’s full potential, and I’m extremely proud of the global Polartec team for their dedication and hard work that put the company in the position it is in today.”

“We look forward to growing Polartec’s strong brand at Milliken,” said Jeff Price, president of Milliken’s Performance and Protective Textiles Division. “Polartec expands our regional manufacturing reach and grows our technological expertise, enabling us to further deliver innovative performance textiles to the global market.”

“Milliken provides the perfect platform to ensure the continuation and acceleration of the success of the Polartec brand after years of complex and transformative business repositioning by Gary Smith and his team,” said Greg Segall, CEO of Versa and chairman of Polartec. “It has been a great collaboration with Gary and all of Polartec’s valued employees, and we are proud of all that has been accomplished during Versa’s ownership—notably the feat of reviving an American textile icon and powerful global brand into an enterprise equipped to succeed in today’s highly competitive markets. Milliken is the ideal long-term owner for Polartec, and we look forward to seeing the two companies achieve big things together.”

Versa acquired the assets of the former Malden Mills in 2007 through the then 101-year-old textile manufacturer’s third reorganization. Working with management, the business was transformed, renaming the company Polartec, reorienting it toward a technology- and innovation-led growth strategy, and revamping the company’s leadership, operations, manufacturing footprint and customer relationships.

The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions.

Versa and Polartec were advised by Lazard Middle Market and Sullivan & Cromwell LLP. Milliken & Company was represented by Jones Day.

"From the moment the Duke and Duchess of Sussex touched down in Sydney on October 15 for their royal tour, a fashion phenomenon dubbed 'The Meghan Effect' has been hurtling across Oceania.

From jeans and eco-friendly flats to organza ball gowns and laid back espadrilles, it seems Meghan Markle truly has the Midas touch when it comes to style as every garment she wears flies off the shelves (or rather, from online stores) faster than retailers can restock.

One of the lucky brands to reap the benefit of being worn by Meghan was Maggie Marilyn, an Auckland-based sustainable label designed by 24-year-old Maggie Marilyn Hewitt who was 'honoured' when the Duchess sported her 'Leap of Faith' dress on a visit to the Courtenay Creative in Wellington.

Speaking to FEMAIL, Ms Hewitt discussed her passion for ethical fashion and how life has changed since Maggie Marilyn was thrust into the international sartorial spotlight.

Meghan Markle wore Maggie Marilyn's Leap of Faith blazer dress (pictured) for a visit to the Courtenay Creative in Wellington during the Sussexes' royal tour

Ms Hewitt described seeing Meghan Markle wear her design as an 'honour'

'Meghan's team reached out to request a selection of pieces she was interested in - I was so excited!,' Ms Hewitt said.

Maggie Marilyn is designed by Auckland-based 24-year-old Maggie Marilyn Hewitt (pictured)

'In particular, they wanted our 'Leap of Faith' Blazer Dress to be custom made without the sleeves. Of course we dropped everything to make this happen! I'm just so honoured she chose to wear one of my designs.'

In terms of how life has changed since Meghan sported the customised piece, Ms Hewitt said the online response has been staggering.

'I wouldn't say it's possible to see the overall effect on our business yet, but we have had an incredibly positive response on social media and a huge volume of congratulatory emails pouring in!

'Meghan wearing our blazer dress is definitely an incredible moment for the brand.

'Her royal tour has highlighted her commitment to supporting sustainability in fashion, I think this is truly admirable and shows the positive impact a platform like hers can have.'

Meghan's team requested the blazer dress to be custom made without sleeves

'Meghan wearing our blazer dress is definitely an incredible moment for the brand'

But Meghan's endorsement was not the first time Maggie Marilyn has been worn by a global celebrity.

Kardashian matriarch Kris Jenner wore a fuschia striped dress from Maggie's most recent collection in June, while her supermodel daughter Kendall was photographed last year wearing Maggie Marilyn's $114 Game Changer jeans on an outing in New York City.

US model Karlie Kloss is another long-time fan of the brand, as well as feminist poet and activist Cleo Wade and Zosia Mamet from hit series Girls.

'I feel honoured to dress these women and call them friends of the brand,' Ms Hewitt said of Wade and Mamet.

Ms Hewitt is an ardent feminist and environmentalist, and based her label on these principles.

Asked about her favourite piece from the current collection, Ms Hewitt admitted she had a special fondness for the Leap of Faith dress before it was worn by the Duchess.

'It's a staple piece and something that has really resonated with our customers.

'We're running the style in other colours next season based on the incredible customer response.'

She is also extremely passionate about ensuring her brand stays true to its sustainable ethos.

'One of the fundamental problems in the fashion industry is how incredibly disconnected consumers are from where the garment comes from' - Maggie Marilyn Hewitt in her studio

'We manufacture our beautiful pieces in New Zealand and are proud to be building a community of amazing makers and artisans'

'One of the fundamental problems in the fashion industry is how incredibly disconnected consumers are from where the garment comes from, and the effects these products have on nature and the culture of our society.

'Consumers must remember that human hands have touched everything we wear. This is really where my core values stem from, bringing back the 'humanness' to fashion.

'It wasn't negotiable when I started this label that I would have a completely transparent supply chain, to understand how every single person was impacted and are they being impacted through my brand in a positive way.

'We manufacture our beautiful pieces in New Zealand and are proud to be building a community of amazing makers and artisans. To us knowing and building a strong bond with our manufacturers is far more rewarding and important than a larger margin for the business through manufacturing overseas.'



The current collection can be purchased directly from Maggie Marilyn's official site."

What's the oldest item of clothing in your wardrobe?

Chances are you may struggle to top a 70-year-old dress - which happens to be Hannah's pride and joy.

""It was passed down from my grandma to my auntie, then cousin, then me. There are so many amazing dresses like that, built to last.""

Radio 1 Newsbeat has been talking to sustainable fashion blogger Hannah about fast fashion - as MPs say clothing brands and retailers should pay to fund a clothing recycling scheme.

Hannah's been giving us her tips on helping to protect the environment and revive the items in your wardrobe.

Only buy things you really love or need

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption More than 3,700 litres of water are used in the full lifetime of some pairs of jeans

Do you see yourself wearing that item at least 30 times? If the answer is no, then put it back on the rack.

Hannah says the more items that factories have to produce - the more damage is done to the environment.

""Commit to wearing clothes more than just once or a handful at times. It also ensures you don't waste your money on things that you don't actually love.""

Swap with friends

Call up your bestie or organise a meet-up via the group chat.

""Your friends might have some clothes that you may like and vice versa. Swapping wardrobes might also stop you from wasting money on something new.""

Upcycling

Bored of that pair of jeans? Hannah says changing them into something new is a good option.

Hannah says: ""Around 11 million items of clothing go into landfills every day in the UK which is just a crazy amount.

""If you're just a bit bored of the length of a pair of jeans sometimes I cut the hem off a bit just to give it a bit of a refresh. This keeps my clothes in my wardrobe for years longer.""

Get out the needle and thread

Image copyright Education Images

""Mend your clothes,"" Hannah advises.

""I find that if I have got a hole in a jumper or a pair of jeans with a broken zipper, I just fix them.""

Wash on lower temperatures

""Washing clothes on 30° rather than 40° and not using tumble dryers is definitely better for the environment,"" Hannah says.

Washing machines and tumble driers can also age your clothes faster.

""There are lots of websites that give great tips on how to wash different fabrics and different bits of clothing so you can wash your clothes more sustainably.""

Don't bin it

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption What a waste: In the UK, hundreds of millions of items of clothing are sent to landfill each year

People in the UK send 235 million items of clothing to landfills each year, according to the most recent figures.

Hannah says rather than throwing them away - often these items could be given to second hand or charity shops for a new lease of life.

Philadelphia-based clothing retailer Urban Outfitters Inc., whose family of brands sells trendy apparel that is particularly popular among college students and other young people, is making its foray into the clothing rental business with a service called Nuuly, expected to launch this summer.

The retail chain, created by college friends Dick Hayne, Scott Belair and Judy Wicks as part of a school project, launched in 1970 as a used clothing and furniture store catering to University of Pennsylvania students. It now has 245 stores, including dozens in Europe and Canada.

Its latest experiment in reuse is, in a sense, a return to the company's roots as a sustainable purveyor of clothing and home goods as the company, which also owns Anthropologie and Free People, explores new revenue paths.

Chief digital officer David Hayne, the son of one of the founders, will run the new service, which he expects will attract 50,000 subscribers and earn more than $50 million in revenue in its first year in business, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Shoppers can rent up to six items at a time for $88 per month from Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie and Free People. Other offerings include clothing from Levis, Reebok and Fila. Customers can choose pieces from more than 100 third-party brands, including clothing and accessories that aren't for sale at any of the stores under the Urban Outfitters corporate umbrella.

The service will allow customers to infuse ""freshness and variety into their wardrobes,"" the company said in a press release. Shoppers who fall in love with rental items have the option to purchase them. It's meant to diversify the company's revenue streams, not replace sales.

""We certainly don't think the customers are just going to stop purchasing,"" Hayne told the Wall Street Journal. ""Purchases make sense for things you know you're going to use often; rental makes sense for things you would like to try,""

Social media platforms like Instagram are helping drive the market for rented clothing -- which makes sense for influencers who plan to wear an outfit just once, for a post, before burying it in the back of their closets.

Rent the Runway, which was founded in 2009, is a pioneer in the clothing rental market, which is expected to be valued at $2.5 billion by 2023, according to GlobalData. It rents high-end clothing and accessories from well-known designers including Diane Von Furstenberg, Proenza Schouler and Rag & Bone, and earlier this year said it was valued at $1 billion. Memberships start at $89 per month and an unlimited plan, which costs $159 per month, allows fashionistas to select four or more styles from more than 600 designers and make unlimited clothing swaps at their own will. New items are delivered within two days.

Millennials in particular prize both variety and environmental sustainability and services like RTR and Nuuly, in theory, deliver both.

Urban Outfitters, in its announcement, acknowledged the rise of the sharing economy and increased interest in subscription services -- a shift that's ""driven by the young generation's hunger for newness while embracing sustainability,"" according to a Business of Fashion report on the state of the industry.

Indeed the apparel and footwear industries combined account for more than 8% of global climate impact, greater than all international airline flights and maritime shipping trips combined.

""We have 25 million pounds of clothing thrown out in the U.S. per year, and most of it has not reached its usable life. So these companies are capitalizing on that,"" Elizabeth L. Cline, author of ""The Conscious Closet: The Revolutionary Guide to Looking Good While Doing Good,"" told CBS MoneyWatch last month.

""Viewing fashion as a service -- as something we access instead of own -- is going to be a really important part of solving the environmental crisis that is fashion,"" she said. ""Think about a generation of people expecting to be able to turn their closets over and follow fashion trends. Renting lets people kind of have it both ways."""

"Management ‘actively evaluating opportunities’ as collapse of the store would be a significant, symbolic blow to retail

This article is more than 1 month old

This article is more than 1 month old

As manifestations of materialism go, few embody New York over the last two decades better than Barneys, the 250,000 sq-ft fashion emporium elevated to almost spiritual status by the designer-obsessed, shopaholic stars of Sex and the City.

But last week reports emerged that Barneys might be headed toward bankruptcy, a fate partially triggered by a hike on its $16m a year lease to $30m.

Asos issues second profit warning in seven months as shares fall Read more

In a statement, the store’s management said it was “actively evaluating opportunities” – options that might include seeking chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, seeking new investment and renegotiating leases across its 22-store network.

But in a retail environment characterized by changing consumer habits, greedy landlords and online competition, the survival of a store dedicated, or “curated” in retail speak, to the taste of a wealthy international clientele is now in doubt. Barneys’ collapse would come as a significant, symbolic blow in a retail environment littered with them.

Ahead of an anticipated cash crunch, designer brands have reportedly withheld shipping new orders to the store, a sharp turnaround to years when designers petitioned purchasers to include their wares included in the store’s luxury-living inventory.

Outside the revolving doors last week, shoppers, many of them out-of-towners, said a visit was still a part of any tourists checklist. But New Yorkers? Not so much.

“I’m not coming here as much,” said Olivia Shoy, a 28-year-old shopper standing outside the Madison Avenue store. “Often they don’t have the sizes or variety so I go online or places like The RealReal [a secondhand designer goods site] for vintage stuff.”

“Barneys built their business on brands and people are no longer brand loyal, so the store is not what it was, and hasn’t been for a long time,” said another shopper, brand developer Steven Feinstein. “For New Yorkers to walk in and pay a fortune when you can shop at a hundred other places doesn’t make much sense.”

Most people buy in-store for the experience, but Barneys definitely “doesn’t have energy”, said Jared Lease, 19, visiting from Washington DC.

Landlords raising Barneys’ annual rent to $30m, debt and an outdated business model are not its only burdens. Retail experts point to a fundamental shift in ecology-conscious fashion consumers who now prefer to shop online or through authenticated luxury consignment or “recommerce” stores such as The RealReal, Rebag and Reformation.

“Customers are no longer buying fashion season-to-season just to stay relevant,” says luxury retail analyst Hitha Herzog. “They want to buy things that last for years, especially when they know fashion is having a major environmental impact.

“Consumers are being a lot more frugal and sustainable and that’s proving to be a disaster for luxury companies,” Herzog adds. “No one wants to buy brand new luxury handbag at $2,500 and then discard it. Consumers are more conscious.”

Heat rises as New York tempers flare over subway suspension Read more

That shift has also paved the way for resellers. The RealReal recently raised $300m in a public offering, giving it a market capitalization of $2.39bn.

In a letter to investors, the company said a majority of customers cited environmental impact or extending the life cycle of luxury items as a key reason for using the service. For the company’s environmentally-conscious millennial consignors, that figure was 64%.

Bad press about sustainability – the fashion industry is estimated to account for 10% of global carbon emissions – is now finally forcing change. Even Vogue last week acknowledged the business has taken “far too long to realize the role that the manufacturing and shipping of fashion plays in global warming”.

According to The RealReal’s Michael Groffenberger, luxury resale is a complement to shopping at department stores, not a replacement. “Our focus on extending the life cycle of luxury and keeping pieces in circulation through resale offers a more sustainable way to shop luxury,” he told the Guardian.

“People can shop – whether online or in-store – the way they actually dress: mixing brands, price points and seasons. In a traditional department store, you wouldn’t see that range of pieces together all on one floor. Our inventory is coming from consignors and we don’t have the same restrictions around brand display.”

No one wants to buy brand new luxury handbag at $2,500 and then discard it. Consumers are more conscious Hitha Herzog

If Barneys goes under it won’t be for lack of expertise in management or creative direction – it is run by some of the most knowledgeable people in the business. It has been a mirror of the economy since it was founded as a cut-rate men’s store in 1923. In the 1970s it added a women’s department, and became the store for Wolf of Wall Street types in the 1980s.

In the 1990s it went bankrupt, before flourishing again in the Sex and the City era.

“The shift is that fashion just isn’t hot anymore,” argues cultural writer Kim Hastreiter. “The system kind of ate itself.”

“It may be a morality thing about sustainability but I don’t think the kids are that into fashion,” she says. “The luxury conglomerates have had the upper hand for a long time but they don’t necessarily connect to the culture, and culture has become more important than fashion. And you’ll never find culture in a department store.”

But some consumers are already questioning just how sustainable shopping online really is.

Outside Barneys last week interior designer Rosemary Hallgarten said she would stick with tradition. “I don’t think online is that sustainable. You get a huge box and filled with packaging for one tiny item, so it’s far more sustainable for me to walk into a store.”

Plus, Hallgarten said, she likes to be helped – something you can hardly get online. “It’s curated, they know me and they know my demographic. So I’m a big fan.”"
"Every year, we trawl through the archives and republish a few of the standout business stories from the last year. This is essentially a mix of the most popular, topical or insightful pieces published in 2018. Here's one that made the cut.

Leonardo DiCaprio may be an investor in $2 billion woollen shoe company Allbirds, but he isn't on first-name terms yet with the company's New Zealand co-founder.

Tim Brown, the former All Whites captain who is now co-chief executive of San Francisco-based Allbirds, says DiCaprio stumbled across the company himself.

""I wouldn't say he's a friend, that might be overplaying it,"" says Brown, laughing.

""He's one of the pre-eminent environmental spokespeople and he found the brand rather organically ... through one of his cousins, randomly enough, and he has become an investor and backed us, which has been pretty neat.""

Though the size of DiCaprio's investment isn't known, it hasn't gone unnoticed. The star made his backing public knowledge when he told his 18.9 million Twitter followers.

""[DiCaprio] is selective in the companies he backs so it was pretty cool to be able to get that across the line,"" Brown says.

""Hopefully, we can continue to use him to help tell [our] story.""

At $2b, Allbirds' value has been assessed at twice that of space powerhouse Rocket Lab and way more than merino clothing company Icebreaker, which was valued at $288m when it sold in April. That valuation follows Allbirds' announcement last month that it had raised US$50m ($72.5m), a price which would value the entire company at US$1.4b ($2.03b).

Brown dreamed up the idea behind Allbirds in Wellington in 2009, when he was playing professional football for the Wellington Phoenix.

""This business was born as a curiosity project ... and was really a reaction to the free shoes I used to get as an athlete - from one of the major sportswear companies that shall not be named - in the belief it was very hard to find simple sneakers,"" the 37-year-old says.

Brown harboured the idea of a simple shoe for a long time before partnering with San Francisco local, long-time friend and Allbirds co-founder Joey Zwillinger in 2015.

The pair had met through their wives, who were room-mates in college. Together, they set out to create a simple trainer that wouldn't harm the environment.

""This was a bad idea for a long time before it was a good one,"" Brown laughs.

Allbirds launched in March 2016 and in its first 14 months, the business sold only one pair of shoes.

Brown says being eco-friendly and sustainable was ""non-negotiable"" and the reason he and Zwillinger founded the company in the first place.

""We think of Allbirds as a sustainable raw material innovation company more than a footwear company or wool company. People don't buy sustainable products, they buy great products, so we've tried to focus on great design and making shoes that are comfortable, with a view to work backwards ... to make the shoes as sustainable as possible.

""Sometimes when you hear the word sustainability, certainly in fashion, you assume you are paying more for something that is less good. There's a perception issue, and it requires a bit of a re-think for businesses and brands to [curb] that.""

Allbirds uses materials that aren't common in the footwear industry: wool, a eucalyptus fibre and a by-product of sugar cane.

On Thursday it released its first trainer - the ""Tree topper"" - that features its SweetFoam™ sole, derived from sugar cane.

Allbirds began developing the carbon-negative ethylene-vinyl acetate foam, derived from sugar cane sourced from southern Brazil, in 2016, and hopes the invention will revolutionise the global footwear industry, which churns out an estimated 25 billion pairs of shoes a year.

""The cool part about it is, we made the materials open-source - so it's available for the rest of the footwear industry to use, which is not traditionally how the footwear world operates,"" he says.

""[Sustainability] is not something we're going to solve as an individual company; it's more a collective movement.""

Allbirds' NZ wool shoes are made in Korea and its ""tree"" shoes are made in Shenzhen, outside Hong Kong.

Brown has worn hundreds of shoe prototypes, and says the first designs looked like ""something you wear when you have a medical problem"".

Fast forward two and a half years, and Allbirds has a range of seven shoe models, including a jandal. In March the company sold its millionth pair.

The company now has a team of 170 people based in San Francisco. Head designer Jamie McLellan is an Aucklander.

""I read about the challenges of the wool industry in a magazine in New Zealand when I was playing soccer, which kicked off this whole idea,"" Brown says.

""New Zealand used to have 80-odd million sheep in the 80s and now it's less than 30 million and no one's growing up dreaming about being a sheep farmer ... [it is a] remarkable fibre which has done a pretty poor job of marketing itself.""

Retail stores are a big part of Allbirds strategy - but not a chain of stores in every city in every market.

[It] was a bad idea for a long time before it was a good one.

The retailer has flagship stores in San Francisco, New York and most recently in Covent Garden, London, which opened last month.

""It will be select retail stores in important markets,"" Brown says. ""I don't think this is a Starbucks story ... it is about the intersection between online and offline business.

""The largest part of our business is online but we're finding offline retail stores are really important places to tell the story and teach people about our materials.""

Brown says the US stores have been successful and he hopes to open a New Zealand store soon, though he can't say when or where.

""The dream is to do a store in New Zealand one day soon, so we're working hard on that.

I'm from Wellington and it's got a special place in my heart; Auckland is probably the biggest city, so who knows - we'll see if I can exert my influence.""

Allbirds is also looking to Asia, including China, for international expansion.

Brown was born in Ascot, England, and moved to New Zealand aged 3. His father is English and his mother a Kiwi.

Brown attended Wellington College and had a short stint at Victoria University, where he studied architecture before accepting a football scholarship to the University of Cincinnati.

He retired from professional football after 10 years, following the 2010 World Cup, to go to the London School of Economics to do a masters degree in international management.

Allbirds' 'Tree Topper' shoes are the first range to use its SweetFoam sole derived from sugar cane.

It was at there the idea for Allbirds became serious.

""I had a window of time to sort of take this idea that was very much a prototype and see if it was a business,"" he says.

""If I didn't have that time, I probably wouldn't have [started] it.""

Now based in San Francisco with his American wife and 14-month-old daughter, Brown gets back to New Zealand every year for a holiday, and at every opportunity he gets.

This week, he's back to give a talk at an enterprise bootcamp – a two-day seminar for entrepreneurs using natural products who want to break into the US market, and will catch up with his friend and fellow wool advocate Jeremy Moon, founder of Icebreaker.

Brown says Icebreaker put New Zealand's merino wool industry on the global stage.

""Talking to some of the farmers down south that make our fibre, wool is having a moment, certainly in the States ... There's enormous potential for the wool industry to continue to grow and do great things in different categories.""

There's no better time to be a merino wool farmer, he says.

""The synthetics industry is being challenged as the singular way to make fashionable products. I think wool has worked out how to tell its story a lot better and part of that is the South Island, the prettiest part of the world that you could imagine.""

So far, Allbirds has raised US$75m in investment funding. Investors include former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz and global investment firm Tiger Global.

""It's a really interesting time for New Zealand businesses and New Zealand brands in America,"" Brown says.

""Many Americans have never been to New Zealand and don't know where it is, but love it nevertheless, and I think there's an enormously big opportunity for businesses or brands to go there and tell the story of a part of the world that looks after the environment and cares about the way products are made.

""The core of what Allbirds is, is sustainable material innovation, and we want to double down on trying to find new ways to make better products because we believe there is a real problem to solve within the fashion and footwear industry.""

It's wedding season and virtually everyone you know is getting hitched.

You've already forked out for the three-day hen do and the closest hotel to the venue is £100 a night.

Then there are the baby showers, engagement drinks and birthdays. It's an expensive business having friends.

But for every event, you need an outfit. And in a world of Facebook and Instagram, you don't feel as though you can wear the same dress twice.

Enter Hirestreet, the UK's first-ever high-street fashion rental service offering a lifeline to people on a budget.

The website allows shoppers to hire a dress for as little as £7 - and it sorts the dry-cleaning for you.

Hirestreet stocks major high-street brands including Zara, Topshop and French Connection, as well as Instagram-favourites such as Dancing Leopard and Never Fully Dressed.

The hire price ranges from £7 to £25 while the retail price ranges from £25 to £269.

For a special event, you can hire a £100 boutique dress for a tenner. And there isn't a catch.

The company's Instagram, which reads ""save money, save wardrobe space, save the planet"", has almost 3,000 followers and its online reviews are glowing.

Instead of sticking to a ""safe"" black bodycon, shoppers feel like they are able to choose something a bit more adventurous.

And the outfits arrive with a small, pre-paid, sticky-top package so sending items back is a breeze.

PR account manager Georgina Childs, 30, shocked ITV viewers earlier this year when she appeared on This Morning to reveal she had lost her home after spending £13,000 attending friends' weddings.

A survey by Provident found wedding guests pay an average of £1,015 to attend someone else's nuptials.

The research factored in pre- and post-celebration additions including hotels, wedding gifts, hen/stag dos and, of course, the outfits.

Hirestreet's founder Isabella West, 25, launched the company in May after discovering more than 50% of 16 to 30-year-olds only wore outfits once or twice.

""We found potential customers were spending over £500 a year on occasion outfits,"" she said.

""If each of those outfits was rented as opposed to bought they could save themselves nearly £400 - that's a holiday.""

Isabella says renting fashion is bigger in the US and Australia, whereas in Britain we have a cultural focus on ownership.

But millennials and Generation Renters are readjusting their priorties.

""For us, it's about memories over materials,"" Isabella says. ""Plus young people are becoming more conscious of how the fashion industry is harming the planet.""

Earlier this year, MPs released a report outlining their worries about fast fashion's effect on the environment.

Boohoo.com, Pretty Little Thing and Missguided are just some of the fashion brands offering tonnes of options through online influencers.

But the House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee says there is a basic problem with an industry fuelling a ""wear it once"" trend.

Discarded clothes are piling up in landfill sites, fibre fragments are flowing into the sea and greenhouse gases from the fashion industry are overheating the planet.

Hirestreet could be the answer to sustainable fashion as well as your ever-growing outgoings.

"A fashion designer has released a range of clothing printed with wonky veg in the hope of encouraging sustainable eating.

Sophie Dunster founded London-based label Gung Ho in 2016, using her designs to champion social and environmental causes.

Her latest range, called Food for Thought, is made up of sweatshirts, dresses, and jumpsuits covered in colourful produce prints.

She hopes the collection will provoke conversations around food waste and educate people about sustainability in a way that isn't 'shouty'.

London-based fashion brand Gung Ho's latest collection features wonky veg prints (pictured) in the hopes that it will encourage Brits to think more carefully about food waste

The Food for Thought range also features prints centring around eating seasonally and the greens vegans get their protein from (pictured)

Sophie Dunster, who founded the label in 2016, hopes the collection will provoke conversations about eating sustainably in a way that isn't 'shouty'

Talking to FEMAIL after the launch of the SS19 collection, Sophie, 27, said: 'Instead of being on somebody's wall where nobody sees it, it becomes a walking talking point.

'If you wore something that represented who you were, and what you were about, the next time somebody complimented what you were wearing, instead of just saying ""oh it's got pockets"" you can actually talk about something that meant something to you.

'It's not shouting about it, it's not in your face, if nobody ever asks you about it that's fine. It's like a natural conversation starter, it's not shouty, it doesn't offend anyone, it's just an interesting way to spark a conversation.'

Gung Ho focus on a different cause every year, with previous collections centring around plastic pollution in the oceans, and British insects and pesticides.

Alongside starting conversations, the brand also donate 10 per cent of its profits to a charity related to their current cause.

While Sophie herself isn't vegan, she only eats meat on special occasions, and hopes her clothing range will invite people to think about how sustainable their diets really are.

Last month scientists announced a 'planetary health diet' that involves cutting your meat consumption down to just 7g a day and eating three times as many vegetables, beans, nuts and soya in a bid to save the environment.

Previous studies have also shown meat uses 83 per cent of the world's farmland while providing only 18 per cent of calories.

'Instead of being on somebody's wall where nobody sees it, it becomes a walking talking point,' Sophie told FEMAIL. 'It's like a natural conversation starter'

Alongside starting conversations, the brand also donate 10 per cent of its profits to a charity related to their current collection

Sophie added: 'There are people who do what we do, but they do it in a much more obvious way that I hate. So they do things like, for example, a vegan will just have the T-shirt that says ""vegan"" on it.

'But nobody is going to go up to that person and say ""oh, are you vegan?"" and start a conversation about that. It doesn't provoke a conversation, it's just a statement.'

The T-shirts and sweatshirts are made from organic cotton at a Fairtrade certified factory in Bangladesh, before being embroidered in Oxford.

Gung Ho's blouses, dresses and jumpsuits are made from a mix of tencel, which is eucalyptus fibre, and silk.

The fabrics are created in China or India, then printed in Gloucestershire, before being put together at a small factory in Stratford, east London.

The designs cost between £35 for a T-shirt and £325 for a jumpsuit.

Sophie hopes other brands will follow her in abandoning fast fashion designs that aren't built to last, and help Brits fall back in love with their clothing.

"Retailers have faced criticism in recent years for disparity in clothing size labelling from store to store - and now a new documentary demonstrates how women may find themselves slipping into a size 10 from one shop, and struggling to squeeze into a 12 in another.

An investigation by Channel 5's consumer show Shop Smart Save Money for Christmas, which airs tonight, uncovered remarkable differences in measurements among leading high street shops.

The research, conducted by production team True North, revealed the disparity across clothing sizes from six leading fashion brands – Next, M&S, Topshop, H&M, Primark and ASOS - sending three models, one size 8, one size 12 and one size 16, into the shops to try on similar items.

The fittings indicated variations of up to four centimetres in the measurements of items of clothing with the same UK size on their labels.

According to the team M&S clothes were the most generous in terms of fit, followed closely by Next.

Channel 5's Shop Smart Save Money for Christmas conducted research that discovered the differences between sizes at leading high street brands. Pictured, the ASOS outfit

The researchers bought similar outfits from each retailer in sizes 8, 12, and 16 to see how they measured. Next (pictured) was tested alongside other brands with a fashion expert looking to see the fit quality

M&S were also part of the fit test, with their sizes fitting generously for each model. Fashion expert Sam Hudson-Miles suggested shoppers visit the store for a looser fit

With no legally set guidelines for clothes sizes in the UK - although there are EU guidelines - brands are free to use their own measurements; which most publish online using centimetres and inches.

The exception is Primark which sells clothes in three categories; small 10/12, medium 12/14, or large 14/16.

EUROPEAN CLOTHING STANDARDS IN CM There are no legally set guidelines for clothes sizes in the UK - although there are EU guidelines - brands are free to use their own measurements. EU CLOTHING STANDARDS: SIZE 8: waist 68cm, hips 92cm, bust 84cm SIZE 10: waist 72cm, hips 96cm, bust 88cm SIZE 12: waist 76cm, hips 100cm, bust 92cm SIZE 14: waist 80cm, hips 104cm, bust 96cm SIZE 16: waist 84cm, hips 108cm, bust 100cm SIZE 18: waist 88cm, hips 112cm, bust 104cm

European clothing standards list size 8 waist as 68cm, hips 92cm, and bust 84cm; a size 12 is waist 76cm, hips 100cm, and bust 92cm; for a size 16 the waist is 84cm, hips 108cm, and the bust 100cm.

To explore the differences, the show enlisted three models to try on a similar outfit – jeans, a white shirt and a fitted blazer - in their different sizes from each shop.

Sam Hudson-Miles, the fashion programme leader at Leeds Arts University, was on hand to mark the clothes, looking at different areas of the item to check the quality of the fit.

She pointed out things to look out to identify a poor fit, including gaps across the chest where buttonholes sit, jacket lapels that gape, and jeans that are too tight or too loose.

'Also something to look for is across the back, if [the jacket] is pulling,' Sam said.

Another high street brand on the list Topshop (pictured) were assessed on the fit of their items in three different sizes. Since filming they have altered their sizes for a better fit

The results showed the differences in sizing across size 8, 12, and 16 with a difference of up to four centimetres between some brands

The results uncovered big differences in measurements between brands.

A size 16 from ASOS allows for a bust measurement of 103cm - compared to 99cm in a size 16 from Next.

Size 8 bottoms from Topshop have a 3.8cm smaller waist than those from H&M, but H&M's hip measurement is 92cm - compared to 88.5cm at both Topshop and ASOS, a 3.5cm difference.

Sam recommended that shoppers head to M&S and Next for a generous fit, or Topshop, H&M or Primark for the tightest, with ASOS falling in middle.

Responding to the experiment a spokesperson for ASOS said: 'We aim to provide our customers with a frictionless experience that makes shopping with us as easy and as convenient as possible. Sizing is one of our top priorities and we work hard to ensure the fit is right every time.

'Each day, our design teams work with ""fit models"" fitting and adjusting products across a wide variety of sizes and product styles. This knowledge feeds into how we size our products and present and describe them online.'

During the jeans test for H&M the size 16 was a considerably tighter fit than any other high street stores, with Sam recommending elsewhere for a looser fit

Sam Hudson-Miles, the fashion programme leader at Leeds Arts University, said things to look for when it comes to poor fit, gaps across the chest where buttonholes sit, jacket lapels gaping, too tight fitting jeans or too loose

In the ASOS jacket the size 8 and 16 gaped across the buttonhole. Sam said this was a tell-tale sign that the fit wasn't right

ASOS also explained that along sides this they have recently launched the 'Fit Assistant' which uses customer purchase history and short, optional questions about fit preferences to help customers find the right size, first time.

'And, of course, if things still aren’t right, we offer free returns, as standard.'

An H&M spokesperson said the brand would be taking the results on board: 'Following customer feedback, we are taking the steps to change our womenswear measurements to be in line with UK sizing, for example the previous measurements and fit of a size 12 will now be the measurements of a size 10.

'This will be a gradual process whereby customers will experience a transition period and are encouraged to use our sizing guides online or ask our store staff for advice when shopping.

Sam praised the fit of the Primark jacket in a size 8 (pictured) but as the sizes increased they became tighter fitting

'We believe this transition will improve our overall customer experience for the UK and we hope our customers will feel encouraged we have listened to their valuable feedback.'

A spokesperson for Primark said: 'Consistency of fit is extremely important to Primark and our measurements are comfortably in line with Size UK Data.

'We run a robust quality assurance process which reviews the fit and fabric suitability of garments at least twice before production starts.'

Topshop has altered its sizes since the filming of the show took place, but fashion expert Sam said it would not have changed her opinion on the fit.

"Scientists at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego are working to understand plastic degradation in the ocean, particularly smaller particles called microplastics and related microfibers.

Marine biologist Dimitri Deheyn, associate researcher at Scripps, is working on a two-fold approach to these micromaterials. He and postdoctoral researcher Sarah-Jeanne Royer are monitoring microfibers around the world to better understand how these fibers enter and spread in the environment, while also partnering with industry to identify possible avenues to limit plastic pollution and develop remediation strategies.

While cotton is a natural fiber, the majority of microfibers are synthetic and many are petroleum-based, making them a form of microplastic. Because of their ability to absorb larger amounts of water and unique chemical binding properties, they can be found in many textiles, including clothing and cleaning cloths, and are defined by their ultrafine nature (thinner than even a strand of silk). These fibers shed into the environment when textiles are washed and through everyday wear, and are becoming a growing concern among scientists and environmentalists.

"With trade tensions increasing between the US and China, the Indian textile manufacturing industry is eyeing a share of China’s lost business. Can Indian players make use of this big opportunity? BusinessLine caught up with Prabhu Damodaran, Convenor, Indian Texpreneurs Federation (ITF), a textile entrepreneurs association that works towards improving the competitiveness of the Tamil Nadu textile sector. Excerpts:

Following the US-China trade war, do you see Indian traders getting more orders from China for cotton? Will our quality grades — in terms of consistency in fibre and purity — match the requirement of China?

China always prefers contamination-free cotton, and its first preference will be Brazilian and Australian cotton. Moreover, with Indian cotton prices being high at the moment, India is in a disadvantaged position to export cotton. So, not much of a shift is happening. In terms of quality, Indian cotton matches with that from the rest of the world. But in the process of farming and ginning, man-made contamination introduced to cotton is high in India. For example, India offers cotton with 3 per cent trash; whereas Australia offers it with 1.5 per cent trash; even West Africa offers the same. Apart from less trash and contamination-free quality, these countries’ cotton also have better fibre maturity and uniformity. This leads to higher level of yarn realisation for yarn manufacturers. We need to catch up a lot, in terms of quality of cotton, to gain similar preference like that for Australian cotton in China.

US has slapped 25 per cent duty on cotton fabrics and yarn imported from China. So, will Vietnam and Brazil take it all or does India stand a chance to take a share of that business?

At present, of its total textile imports, the US buys 36 per cent from China and around 7 per cent from India. But we see an increase in Indian textile exports to the US in the coming months as the US buyers want to spread risk, and are looking for alternative destinations to buy textiles from. The government should also, at this point, encourage our textile industry. Support to the textile manufacturing sector will create jobs and address the job creation challenge our economy is facing. If, for instance, ₹500 crore is invested in the textile and apparel sector, it will create about 40,000 jobs. A similar investment in a heavy engineering factory would create only 1,000-1,500 jobs. So, the new government that will come (into power) has to take some proactive steps to engage with the US government and explore opportunities.

Do you think Indian textile manufacturers have some advantages over players from countries such as Bangladesh and Vietnam?

We had some advantages in the past, such as low-cost skilled workers, good raw material availability, etc. But over the years, other countries such as Bangladesh and Vietnam have not only built a strong manufacturing ecosystem, but have also improved their operational efficiency. Today, they also boast of better innovation, scale and a bouquet of products in different fibres. So, we need to work with new models suitable to the changing dynamics of the global market.

India lacks competitiveness in the global market. How do you think the textile industry can work around this and attract more buyers for its products?

Indian manufacturers need to make more blended products instead of focussing on cotton-based products. They also need to make more value-added products to earn higher value per garment, by focussing on design innovations. On the process front, there is a need to incentivise large-scale projects with flexible labour laws and see how manufacturing efficiency can be improved at the factory level.

To attract global buyers, India needs to highlight its brands and the sustainable manufacturing ecosystem it has in textile manufacturing. There are many buyers outside who are looking for environmental-friendly products. For example, the Tamil Nadu textile industry operates under the ZLD system (zero liquid discharge refers to a waste water management system that ensures there is no discharge of industrial waste water into the environment), and almost 70 per cent of the State’s textile industry runs 100 per cent on renewable energy.

What changes need to made in the textile industry, and what role should the government play in this?

For the long-term good, we need to address some fundamental issues. First, the government has to bring a fibre-neutral policy — bringing all raw materials under one tax rate is the best way to encourage blended textiles. Second, apart from continuing our efforts on the India-EU free-trade agreement, we need to quickly complete the India-Eurasia free-trade agreement to enter into the lucrative Russian market. Our current market share is just 1 per cent of Russia’s total import of textiles.

Further, there should also be efforts to diversify our markets. To do this, we need to use our embassies in trade promotion activities. South Korea is a great example on how to effectivey use of embassies for trade promotion. The government and the industry should also work together to design a new incentive scheme within the framework of the WTO (World Trade Organization) to encourage the textile sector."

"Magazine that started in a laundry is making people rethink their fashion footprint

Posted

While many magazines struggle to stay afloat, one publication focusing on sustainability is going from strength to strength and celebrating 10 years in print.

Peppermint, a nation-wide magazine that educates people about sustainable clothing trends, originated from the curiosity of a former fashion designer.

Kelley Sheenan started the magazine from a desk in her laundry while her son was only 18 months old, during a time when sustainability was rarely spoken about.

She said the idea came after she began looking at the fabric she was using for her clothing.

""I wanted to know where it was made, and the more I started to find out about it, the more I knew I didn't want to be part of the industry ... I didn't want to be contributing to the problem,"" Ms Sheenan said.

""I stopped making clothing and was watching documentaries at the time and thought, if I, as a designer, didn't know where my fabric was from, then how on Earth was the public supposed to know?""

She said she combined her skills of graphic design, photography and fashion to create the magazine as a way to educate people.

""I wanted to get the information out to the public in a way that was palatable and fun,"" she told ABC Radio's Maria Hatzakis.

Starting from a laundry

In the early days, Ms Sheenan said she would push her son in a pram while making calls and then work through the night when he slept.

Her office was in a laundry hallway with only a small desk and a computer.

""It was a frantic mash of being a mother and about nine months of research before I slowly morphed into it.

""I became intensely passionate about making it [the magazine] happen by finding writers and photographers to contribute.""

Ms Sheenan said she didn't want the magazine to be judging people or pointing fingers but knew she wanted it to be ""fun and stylish"".

""I wanted people to think it looked interesting and cool, while also learning underneath it all it was about sustainability — that was part of our mission.

""It was important that people learnt that it wasn't about wearing hessian sacks and sandals.""

The first edition of the magazine was given away for free to introduce people to sustainable fashion and outline what sustainable living was.

""After the first magazine I was suddenly inundated with emails asking me when the next one was coming along,"" Ms Sheenan said.

""The first time I was called an editor, I had to google exactly what an editor did — I was doing all of that.""

Keeping a magazine 'sustainable'

It was important for Ms Sheenan and her team to keep the magazine as sustainable as they possibly could.

""We're producing a product so there's definitely a footprint that goes with it.

""We do use paper that has 50 per cent recycled content, it's carbon neutral paper and made in Australia.

""The whole magazine itself is carbon neutral and we've donated more than $20,000 to charity over the past 10 years.""

'It's all been about 1,000 per cent effort'

Her team of four works closely together and Ms Sheenan credits their passion as part of their success.

""We sit alongside magazines which are all owned by major publishing companies,"" she said.

""It's all been about 1,000 per cent effort and working hard.""

She said creating a hardcopy version of the magazine had also been key to their success, which was different to many other magazines in the industry.

""It's a tough industry but I think the reason we've managed to stay afloat is that our readers want to switch off and they're the ones that don't want to be online all the time,"" she said.

""Because we're about slowing down and living a more sustainable lifestyle, it works well with what our readers want.""

Ms Sheenan said she hoped the magazine would continue for other 10 years as she'd yet to feel like she had made it.

""I don't think you ever really feel like you've made it,"" she said.

""I do feel successful, but I wouldn't say I've reached the point where I'm done now or that I've had all the success in the world.""

"Almost three years after the reopening of the Embassy of Sweden in Manila, Ambassador Harald Fries is enthusiastic to speak about the healthily growing relationship between Sweden and the Philippines. This flourishing bilateral relationship built on collaboration is the highlight of the Swedish National Day celebration today, June 6.

With the core tasks of enhancing trade, updating Sweden’s image, and increasing people-to-people exchange, he sees a vibrant future between the two countries.

Fries has a particularly long history with the Philippines. His affinity to the country dates back to more than 30 years when he first met his would-be Filipina wife in Sweden. He was later appointed a junior diplomat in the early ‘90s in the embassy in Manila.

“I can compare with how it was at that time. Then, we only had large Swedish global companies here, but now we also have many small and medium Swedish companies that have established presence in the Philippines. That is a very healthy, positive change because it shows that not only the big players who can establish everywhere in the world have confidence in doing business here, but also smaller companies that don’t have as much resources,” the ambassador shares in an interview in his Swedish-Filipino-inspired home.

“It was clear when we reopened the embassy in 2016 that interest among Swedish companies in finding business partners here has increased significantly in recent years. The large Philippine population with a growing middle class, good economic growth, and business-friendly reforms are key factors that attract Swedish companies.”

In connection with the reopening of the embassy in 2016, the biggest-ever Swedish business delegation came to the Philippines.

The Embassy of Sweden was closed from 2008 to 2016, but Team Sweden never left the country. From IT and BPO to transportation and fashion industries, an increasing number of Swedish companies continued doing good business here. These include Scania, Atlas Copco, Swedish Match, Ericsson, Electrolux, Volvo Cars, Buses and Trucks, SKF and Transcom. Recently global brand names such as H&M, Saab, Epiroc, and IKEA have entered the Philippine market.

“Our Swedish businesses in the Philippines represent the core Swedish values of innovation and sustainability. They are all members of Team Sweden and they help us in our promotions work,” Fries adds.

To further enhance trade in the Philippines, Business Sweden, a partly government-funded agency tasked to help Swedish companies to do business abroad, opened up an office in Bonifacio Global City in 2017.

“Another positive development is that the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry has established a Philippine-Sweden Business Council a year ago, with the mission to connect Philippine companies with Swedish companies. That is yet another sign of our increasing business ties, and this one is from the Philippines’ side,” Fries says.

“I hope you sense that we are very happy to be back in the Philippines with the embassy. Now the Swedish government would very much welcome a decision by the Philippine government to reopen its embassy in Stockholm. That would significantly contribute to further strengthen our bilateral relationship, not least through the promotion of Philippine business in Sweden. I am hopeful that this will happen during my time here,” the ambassador furthers.

On youth and shared advocacies

One factor boosting the European country’s reintroduction to Filipinos—and vice versa—is the young generation’s global mindset. For one, the young ones are eager to spend some time in Sweden to go for graduate studies or exchange programs.

Many of the Swedish companies that have set up business here are in the IT sector, hiring well-educated young Filipinos, many with strong engineering background, high proficiency in English and a high level of ambition. In the same way, quite a few young Swedes have chosen to work in the Philippines to take advantage of the start-up scene here.

The ambassador notes that the Filipino youth, to a large extent, share core values with Swedes: human rights, gender equality, freedom of speech, environmental protection, and fighting climate change.

“These are areas where my government is very active globally. And we like to advocate these matters also here in the Philippines. I appreciate that it’s easy to find partners in advocating our priority concerns. The embassy is often organizing events together with civil society organizations, private companies, and government agencies. The civil society in the Philippines is very vibrant,” he expresses.

For instance, the embassy and Business Sweden is working with the Philippine government in developing New Clark City, which Fries describes as “a fantastic possibility of building a new city from scratch and making it right from the beginning.” Last year, the embassy together with Business Sweden hosted the “Philippines-Sweden Smart Cities Collaboration” in Clark, where Swedish companies presented their innovative and sustainable solutions.

“I think the most important contribution we can do is to introduce Swedish know-how and technology to the Philippines. In Sweden, we have worked hard for several decades to take care of our environment and reduce climate change,” says Fries.

“So, Swedish companies have developed innovative technologies to make their products and systems sustainable both in terms of minimizing the negative effect on the environment and offering long-term, high-quality solutions.”

99.5% of all household waste in Sweden get either recycled or transformed into energy. Only half a percent go to the landfill or used as materials in building roads.

“The Philippines has a long way to reach 99.5% of recycling waste, but we can offer the know-how and technology to make progress in that area,” says Fries.

H&M, a Swedish fashion brand, is also spreading its sustainability efforts across its stores in the country by offering boxes where mall-goers can donate their old clothes—including unbranded clothes—in exchange for 15% discount on their next H&M purchase.

H&M has also partnered with the embassy to launch an exhibit called Fashion Revolution: The Future of Textiles to showcase how the fashion industry can become more environment-friendly.

On a similar note, the embassy has delved into #RespetoNaman, a campaign against gender-based violence, with an exhibit titled Don’t Tell Me How to Dress, which features the clothes that women and girls wore when they were sexually abused.

What the team thought would just be a week-long campaign in November last year is now a one-year campaign, touring around malls and universities, in and outside Metro Manila, in partnership with the Office of the Vice President, UN Women and Spark Philippines.

#TeamSweden: Celebrating the National Day of Sweden

It wasn’t until 1983 that Sweden had an official national day and not until 2005 that it became a non-working holiday. Now, Swedes are getting used to commemorating their national day—a day off from work, a day to celebrate that they are Swedes and be happy about their country.

“We don’t really have strong national day traditions. We have other days like Walpurgis Night and Midsummer Eve where we have older traditions, and we have specific things to do, specific food and activities and so on. The national day celebration is still quite new,” shares Fries.

“Here in the Philippines, the embassy wants to use the national day to promote Sweden and to update the image of Sweden as an innovative and progressive country—and we like to do it with our Swedish private sector.”

Since the embassy came back to the Philippines, it has partnered with the Swedish private sector in several projects and events. That is the basis for this year’s theme: #TeamSweden: A celebration of Swedish collaboration and values.

Today, the Embassy of Sweden, Business Sweden, the Philippine-Sweden Business Council and the Swedish companies in the Philippines gather with their Philippine partners to celebrate the Swedish National Day.

A number of companies who are proud members of Team Sweden have partnered with the embassy for the celebration.

Among them are Scania, which is known for its sustainable road transport solutions and services; Epiroc, a trusted name in the global mining and civil industry; Transcom, the biggest Swedish employer in the Philippines and a leading BPO company that uses Virtual Reality Training to its more than 12,000 employees; Volvo Cars, known to be the manufacturer of the world’s safest cars; Volvo Bus, a frontrunner in developing sustainable buses and shaping the future of transportation in the Philippines; and Atlas Copco, a supplier of industrial tools and equipment in the Philippines.

In addition, the embassy is delighted to partner with Banco de Oro, a strong advocate of climate-smart projects and sustainability.

“We celebrate with Swedish food and music. The Swedish companies will showcase their innovative and sustainable products and solutions. We will introduce Floorball, a sport that is spreading like wildfire around the world. The fundamental idea of our celebration is to emphasize the #TeamSweden spirit,” Ambassador Fries concludes."
"VANCOUVER — Colourful, inexpensive and trendy clothing is so accessible that Joanne Renfer couldn’t resist.

She’d buy it while grocery shopping or online and when it didn’t fit or she didn’t like it, she just tossed the clothes in the donation bin with the tag still attached.

“It’s been almost way too convenient and cheap,” she said. “I wouldn’t even bother to try it on. I would just buy it and take it home. It’s not even worth returning them if you don’t like them.”

But then Renfer learned about how much energy and water was used to make the clothes, and where the clothing went when people were done with it.

That textile waste is clogging British Columbia landfills, nearing 20 million kilograms a year from Vancouver residents alone, say statistics from the Metro Vancouver regional district.

The district launched a campaign Monday to push people to think not just twice but three times before tossing out their clothing.

Karen Storry, senior project engineer for Metro Vancouver’s Solid Waste Services, said a 2016 waste composition study showed residents throw out about 40,000 metric tonnes of textile waste a year and about half of that is clothing.

“So if you translate that into per person amounts it’s 17 pounds, which doesn’t sound like a lot but it’s the weight of 44 T-shirts,” she said in an interview.

People are buying three times more clothes than they did in the 1980s, wearing them less often and a lot of it ends up in the trash, Storry said.

While clothing made with natural materials eventually breaks down, those that have plastic or plastic products in them “just sit in the landfill for who knows how long,” Storry said.

About 60 per cent of the material fibres have plastic in them, including jackets, T-shirts and sweaters, she said.

“If you see anything with polyester, it has plastic and it’s a pretty common fibre in our clothing these days,” she said, noting that apart from taking up landfill space, clothes use a lot of energy and water to produce.

Metro Vancouver’s campaign, “Think Thrice About Your Clothes,”promotes greener options for reducing, repairing and reusing textiles, as well as tips on how to make smart choices when buying new clothes, or even purchasing second-hand or renting clothing.

Renfer remembers a time when an outfit was an investment and now she said she’s gone back to that mindset.

“I thought a lot about it and I spent what was to me a lot of money. I didn’t have as many outfits and I really looked after them,” said the 61-year-old Vancouver real estate agent.

Now she only throws away socks and underwear, then donates her unused clothing at least three times a year.

She used to buy something almost once a week and was excited about clothing that was “cheap and cheerful.”

Now she said she’s been trying to be more mindful of her purchases.

“And it was sort of sad to find out that it was a bad thing,” she said.

“We have to rethink how we buy clothes.”"
"Independent fashion and design boutique placed on the market

An established and successful fashion and homeware store that is highly active in face-to-face retail and has the support of an online store clothing is now on the market for sale.

The business known as DECODE Ltd - located at 13 Camp Street in the heart of Queenstown’s central business district retail precinct – has been operating for 14 years.

Clothing is the core product of the store, with a high turnover rate of stock. The curation of selected homewares, jewellery, soft furnishings, and accessories has created a unique experience for customers. DECODE’s clientele is predominantly woman aged between 35 – 65-years-old.

Responding to demand from clients based in and around the Otago region, greater New Zealand and a growing international clientele, DECODE launched its online store at the end of 2017. The online store currently processes 3.5 sales per week.

Over the years, DECODE founder Maree Cross has built a brand profile of her retail store through networking and some advertising, but mostly through meeting the needs of her clients with excellent customer service partnered with unique and quality product.

DECODE has always been active in the community. For many years it was a major supporter of the famous Queenstown Winter Festival. DECODE has always contributed to community fundraising projects and philanthropic projects – both short and long-term. In 2015 DECODE was encouraged to enter the NZ Retail Awards, and was runner-up in the Best independent Store category.

The business employs a full-time owner/operator and five part-time staff. DECODE

tenants a 144 square metre town centre premises, and is currently on a year lease running through to 2021 - with two further six-year rights of renewal maturing in 2033. The landlords are extremely established in commercial real estate and are excellent to work with,

Now the DECODE business is being marketed for sale as a going concern by deadline private treaty through Bayleys Auckland and Bayleys Queenstown, with offers closing at 4pm on March 6.

Bayleys Auckland business brokers Paul Dixon and Caroline Hanson said DECODE ran its retail operations six days a week from 10am – 6pm. And between 10am and 5pm on Sundays.

“DECODE has made the transition from being purely a physical trading entity with a prominent location in the heart of bustling Queenstown, to embracing on-line trading as an adjunct to its business,” Mr Dixon said.

“The online store has been operational for just over a year and contributes to the shop’s annual turnover which exceeds $1.2 million – delivering a healthy bottom line,” added Mr Dixon.

“The ethos of the store has been to create an authentic, pleasurable and relaxed retail experience for clients. By providing a selective range of clothing blended with jewellery, homeware and desirable accessories, DECODE has not only added value to the client’s experience, but has also increased revenues. Stock is beautifully showcased in a visually and spatially-pleasing environment.

“Street frontage and exposure to the market is extremely sought-after in Queenstown, and DECODE has secured a very high-profile position.”

Ms Hanson said the store offered an alternative to the mass-produced high street fashion labels. She said garments were sourced from both international and New Zealand designers – some of which were still manufactured in New Zealand, which was a rarity these days.

“The product is of high quality in both design integrity and production. The European brands offer fashion forward collections and textiles that have limited availability in New Zealand,” Ms Hanson said.

“The new owner will most likely have an interest in women’s’ fashion and home styling, however the running of the business can be learnt. DECODE founder and current owner Maree Cross is available to assist any new owner through the

transition period, and will support and mentor them for an agreed period of time – giving them the greatest opportunity to continue thriving,” she said.

“There is the opportunity for a new owner to grow and expand both the retail and on-line stores or concentrate on one aspect of these. The store is constantly approached by up-and-coming designers and new brands, so there is potential to develop product further.

“As the current owner is now looking to retire, DECODE Ltd is on the market for sale.”

"Makati Shangri-La holds specific memories to me. I remember how in the mid-‘80s, when I was still painting actively, the hotel was expanding its Philippine footprint in Mactan and Boracay.

The hotel purchased a number of my paintings, and two large paintings were commissioned by its foreign interior designers. Fast forward to today. When Makati Shangri-La called for a meeting to discuss possible ideas for March to celebrate Women’s Month, I went to meet them. Since last year, I had been thinking of what to do this March for GREAT Women. The hotel’s call was the answer: a perfect institutional hotel partner for activities to “celebrate the GREAT in women.” Aside from the hotel’s spirit of understated elegance, and the stand for sustainability, it was out to champion women, artisan crafts and anything proudly Filipino. Suddenly, “responsible luxury” was a natural shared value.

At the center of what GREAT Women brand platform is inclusive business. The platform draws in small women producers to have active business participation and access to niche, specialty, global markets. Or would never have a chance to get there without the platform trying to close the gaps of the supply chains.

So literally at the center of the hotel’s circular lobby is an exhibit installation of handwoven textiles — paralleling traditional ones with new innovations that the communities have come up with. This circular showcase is at the heart of it all. In it I see the circular economy symbolized by this installation at the hotel’s lobby. The showcase supports the attempt of revitalizing traditional textiles while keeping our living culture sustainable from a livelihood perspective. GREAT Women collaborated with designer Kitty Bunag with this simple but elegant installation. We agreed on a spiral form. As visitors move from outside to see the new innovations of the textiles and come to the center, this center space should have brought visitors to a space of inspired awe at looking at the textiles closely. I challenged Kitty to create a meditative walk and she so successfully visualized the concept.

GW Fashion beige two-piece.

All of March at the Lobby Lounge, there is afternoon tea being served using ingredients from micro-women producers whose products are sold at ECHOstore. When Makati Shangri-La executive chef Nicola Canuti and team went to the store, they were so excited to try all the different community produce and now, these are served leveled-up with the help of the chefs!

By end of the month, hotel guests will also see an ECHOstore pop-up corner with all the bottled and packed food products from women food producers. Our green inclusive business brand that started our journey of social entrepreneurship likewise celebrates women, being one of the Top 50 women-led enterprises in the APEC and ASEAN region.

The highlight of all these “value-adding, leveling-up” is a professional fashion show, a GREAT Women first! This inaugural collection highlights Panay region’s patadyong and hablon fabrics from weaving groups we have been working with in the past two years. And the beauty of this collaboration is there is no one designer highlighted but a professional team of fashion-retail-design personalities who have quietly worked together behind the scenes.

It took us two years to complete the textile supply chain into a remarkable highlight of this event come March 30 at the hotel’s Lobby Lounge. Everyone supporting our women advocacy cause has been so generous. My friend Mercedes Zobel offered to foot the photography bill and Las Casas Filipinas de Acuzar sponsored the stay of the production crew. We are doubly excited because through this fashion show, we are helping bring back the hotel’s unique highlight, of having been a center for fashion shows in the past.

Beige skirt and top.

Other designers and brands collaborating with GREAT Women platform will also have a special three-day lifestyle trunk show sale from March 29 to 31 at the hotel’s Makati B function room.

Meanwhile, Olivia Limpe-Aw of Destileria Limtuaco came forward to create a GREAT Women cocktail for the hotel’s Sage Bar. I believe the brand has become a natural magnet to give meaning to the month of March.

This Women’s Month, I am empowered and happy, because, really, it becomes a celebration of collaborations. Perhaps this is what is so great about it — the happy energies with no egos around, people honestly wanting to help make this a success, two brands of Makati Shangri-La and GREAT Women standing together with shared values with all of us mindful that in the end, it’s really not about us but the small women weavers and producers we give a hand up to."
"Twenty-two large employers commit to Recycling Collection Drive during Waste Reduction Week

TORONTO, Oct. 16, 2018 /CNW/ - Today being #TextileTuesday of #WasteReductionWeek, 22 organizations from the industrial, commercial and institutional sector and municipalities in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) will be participating in the third annual Recycling Collection Drive, a campaign that helps reuse and recycle clothing and household textiles. Through this campaign, organized by Partners in Project Green, up to 30,000 employees will be encouraged to bring clothing and household textiles to 65 collection locations at their work place during Waste Reduction Week, October 15th to 21st, 2018.

"Fashion needs to get this right because clothing is such a big way for consumers to express their personal identity. With the rise of social media, particularly Instagram, there are signs this relationship is under threat: what individuals do, where they go, and what they eat can say as much about them as their outfits. That's both a threat to luxury, and an opportunity for the brands to reshape their images.

The industry can get it right. Guccil has embraced a diversity of races and ages in its marketing. This nimbleness may well have helped to fuel the brands's extraordinary growth in recent years.

Loading

For some time, the industry has featured older models. It was a canny move. Not only did it demonstrate a broader appeal, it spoke to a sub-sector of shoppers with money to spend. But increasingly it is younger consumers who are driving luxury growth – and they have different views on the world. According to a recent study from Bain & Co., generations Y and Z – consumers under 35 – will account for all of the growth in the luxury market this year, compared with 85 percent in 2017.

More inclusive fashion will represent about 20 percent of women's ready-to-wear this year, according to Bain. Luxury brands are producing more one-size garments, targeted at curvy or plus-sized consumers, larger sizes and clothing with a looser fit. Increasingly some consumers want clothing that isn't as revealing of the body as much traditional designer fashion. So-called modest fashion will account for 40 percent of luxury womenswear in 2018. This includes Muslim-specific garments, as well as items that cover more of the body."
"When the lights go up at Christopher Raeburn’s 10th anniversary show at London fashion week men’s on Sunday, the world can expect to be presented not just with a clothing collection but – as the designer puts it – “a manifesto for change”.

In the decade since he started his fashion label, the Royal College of Art graduate has become to the menswear fashion industry what Stella McCartney is to womenswear – the leading advocate of sustainability and responsibly sourced style. His brand’s “remade, reduced, recycled” ethos permeates everything that comes out of his design studio in Hackney Central and has done from the start.

Utilising used fabrics – including kites and vintage parachutes and other military stock – his designs have taken on a utilitarian-meets streetwear aesthetic. He is now looking to see how he can “push things further than ever before”.

“It’s our opportunity to say, ‘hey, that’s been an amazing first chapter for the business and now we’re building on our learning from the last 10 years’,” says Raeburn. His team has been “mulching, shredding and making our own insulation from the off-cuts of materials that are being made in our atelier in east London and then making them into Puffa jackets” for today’s collection.

There’s never been a better time to be leading the charge. Last year the United Nations launched a fashion industry charter for climate action and the Commons environmental audit committee announced it was investigating the sustainability of the fashion industry. Burberry pledged to reuse, repair or recycle products after the shocking revelation that it had destroyed £28.6m of stock in 2017.

But 36-year-old Raeburn has been driving fashion in a responsible direction since he was discovered by the industry expert Susanne Tide-Frater in 2009. Asked by the British Fashion Council to mentor a new ecological brand, she chose Raeburn, having identified his “radically different vision from what was then considered recycled”.

“When I first met Christopher, his vision immediately exceeded other designers in his segment,” says Tide-Frater, currently board director of Browns Fashion. “In fact, I have always considered him a creative entrepreneur rather than a fashion designer predicting or chasing the next trend. It was really just at the start of a very personal journey [for him], which at times has been challenging.”

One of the main challenges facing sustainable design is dispelling the scepticism surrounding the “homespun” aesthetic. A major part of Raeburn’s success has been his belief that covetable design and responsible infrastructure are not necessarily incompatible.

“I’ve always approached my business from a design-led perspective first,” he says. “Our obligation as a company and for me as a designer is to make sure I’m embedding good design with really considered choices around the way the materials are made, who’s making them, where that item is made and what happens to it afterwards. If you’ve ticked those boxes and something is fully recycled and recyclable, it becomes unquestionable.”

Another challenge is keeping financially afloat while retaining creative control. “Where other designers expanded and took on major investment, Christopher self-financed and was always independent,” says Tide-Frater.

Collaborations with brands including Eastpak, Umbro and most recently Timberland (where he has since taken on global creative director duties) must be mutually beneficial in this respect, as well as pushing the brand’s message into the mainstream. “Not connecting with him would have been a big miss as he cares passionately about the overall ‘making it better’ concept which motivates Timberland’s world, environment, design and products,” said a spokesperson for the US brand.

Recognition came in 2016 when Raeburn was named breakthrough designer at the GQ Men of The Year awards and the appetite for his designs and approach is picking up pace. His recent pop-up in London’s new Coal Drops Yard development proved so successful that he is hoping to open a larger permanent space there in the spring, while the #buynothing campaign he launched on Black Friday “as a challenge to the industry” went viral.

“With this race to the bottom of selling products at increasingly discounted rates, you have to really question where that’s going to end up and we, within the industry, have an obligation to question ourselves,” says Raeburn, who refused to sell anything that day.

“It’s really important for designers like Christopher to make a stand against over-consumption and to lead the way for a more responsible fashion industry,” says Tamsin Blanchard, who works closely with the not-for-profit reform movement Fashion Revolution. “By disabling his online shop for Black Friday it was a way for him to protest against the insidious culture that is constantly nagging away at us to buy more, buy cheaper and buy it now.”

A decade in, Tide-Frater predicts a happy birthday for the designer. “His time may have finally come,” says Tide-Frater. “I strongly believe that only authentic designers and personalities like Christopher will give weight and credibility to the topic of sustainability which now has to be all our top priority.”"

"A designer has created a line of sustainable 'paper' handbags, with photos of designer bags on them.

Stefan Cooke, a London designer, created the line of sustainable biodegradable paper fibre bags for Matches, but they come with a hefty price tag of £405.

The white carriers are designed to look just like paper bags, with a rectangle shape and handle. But they also come fully lined with an embossed handle, magnet fastening and metal feet.

Despite the cost, Matches fans love the bags with many commenting about how beautiful they are.

The sustainable bags are popular with fans, with many commenting on the brands Instagram page. One said: 'Saw these bags on the weekend in Carlos Place, they are super cool. Love.'

While others simply expressed how much they liked them, by saying 'All the love' and 'Nice bag'.

Stefan Cooke designed the biodegradable paper fibre bags with designer Jake Burt - who is his partner in the fashion brand.

"The dark days of denim are coming; but the question is when?

Fall runways around the world showed flared, wide-legged and skinny jeans all in the sophisticated palette. In typical New Jersey fashion, designers here are interpreting this subdued trend in their own way: by also incorporating sustainable business practices and concern for the environment.

""Ripped up, distressed denim is taking a backseat in the fashion industry, allowing more clean, streamlined garments to be the main focus of the season,"" says Angelina Rose Decker, the 20-year-old Roxbury native behind Rose & Wilde.

Decker translates the trend by reworking dark and light vintage denim into fresh pieces, using techniques such as color blocking and patchwork. ""Consumers and companies are slowly starting to realize the impact that fast fashion has on the world,"" she says.

Decker sources inventory from local nonprofit thrift stores, which then keeps money flowing back into the community. ""Instead of creating more waste, reworking clothing or shopping secondhand is a great way to be sustainable,"" Decker says.

In East Rutherford, Todd Shelton designs and manufactures his eponymous men's and women's lines for customers looking for something classic: a quality jean with a perfect fit.

""As far as dark washes and more sophisticated washes, I think that's ahead of trend for women. That's coming (to New Jersey), but I'm not sure it's coming this fall,"" he says.

His customer is aware of trends, but focused more on quality and the perfect sizing. The designer sends a ""fit guide"" to each customer before cutting the fabric, eliminating extraneous waste, and creating a made-to-measure jean.

""The inventory business model, which almost every brand operates under, is highly wasteful,"" he says. ""People are over-manufacturing in epidemic levels, knowing they can mark it down and get rid of it.""

Shelton takes pride in being sustainable, which is good for the environment and also for the state.

""We are a factory in New Jersey and what we are doing is really unique,"" he says. ""I'm not sure there's anybody doing what we're doing.""

Best Bet for Fall: Capes

Conjure up your inner superhero!

""It's official. Capes have replaced the traditional trench coat for something a bit more romantic this fall,"" says Lynette Lashawn, owner of Off the Hanger. A cape is a way to update your wardrobe. Throw one on and you're instantly transformed for day or night -- no phone booth required.

"(Yicai Global) Sept. 4 -- Hong Kong has gotten its first environmentally friendly cotton mill since a five-decade business hiatus for opening any new mills that weave the staple fiber. The factory already has its first client.

Taipo Eco-friendly Cotton Mill was set up in Tai Po Industrial Estate, Chinese newspaper Ta Kung Pao reported today. The plant will adopt the textile recycling techniques developed by The Hong Kong Research Institute of Textiles and Apparel, and set up three production lines based on the reuse of polyester-cotton. The daily production capacity will reach three tons of fiber while the future goal is ten tons per day, according to Edwin Keh, chief executive of HKRITA.

The first client of the mill is Swedish fashion chain H&M, with hundreds of orders of clothes, Keh said, adding that the delivery will be in November. The reduction in the cost of yarn is nearly 30 percent due to the new techniques.

Promoting the return of cotton mills to Hong Kong is an inspiration toward a ""re-industrialization of Hong Kong,"" Carrie Lam, chief executive of Hong Kong, said during a speech in the opening ceremony yesterday. In 2016, the waste of textiles in the region was over 120,000 tons, she said. The development of the bay area of Guangdong province, Hong Kong and Macao will provide opportunities for Hong Kong's firms and factories to enter the market of China's mainland, she added.

The process of the first production line involves the five steps of ozone disinfection, removal of the non-fiber parts such as buttons, sorting by color through robotic arms, distribution of materials with an intelligent storage system, and finally processing the fiber to yarn. The daily capacity of this line is one ton of yarn with a demand for six workers.

"For the first time in 30 years, Newage Group, a Bangladesh-based garment manufacturer, is sensing an opportunity to sell in the U.S. And it has President Donald Trump’s battle with China to thank.

Newage, a supplier to Hennes & Mauritz AB, has been doing business with European companies for three decades but is now getting inquiries from Macy’s Inc. and Gap Inc., Asif Ibrahim, vice-chairman of Newage Group, said in an interview. Rival Viyellatex Group forecasts its annual exports to the U.S. will more than double to $25 million in the year that began July 1, buoyed by rising orders, according to Chairman David Hasanat.

About 30% of Viyellatex’s clients, including PVH Corp.—the owner of American fashion labels Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein—are from the U.S., compared with 20% a year ago.

The South Asian nation of Bangladesh, the world’s second-largest garment exporter, has seen the value of its overseas sales rise to a record $40.5 billion in the year ended June 30, coinciding with Trump boosting tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods to 25% from 10%. The tit-for-tat trade war has seen American and Chinese orders for more than half of the 1,981 tariffed products so far being re-routed to other countries, including Vietnam and Malaysia.

“The rate of inquiries has gone up by 30%,” Newage’s Ibrahim said. “Tariffs are being imposed unilaterally by one person at this point in time. That made some retailers a bit nervous. They are shifting their orders to this country to lower their business risks.’’

Macy’s said in May the company has been working for a “number of months, and really for a couple of years, about moving production out of China,” while the same month Gap said it has been migrating sourcing out of China for the last several years.

For Bangladesh, which aims to double total exports to $72 billion by 2024, snaring part of the $41 billion of the clothing business that goes to China will provide a fillip to an economy that the Asian Development Bank forecasts will expand a record 8% for the next two years. Bangladesh’s garment industry, which employs 4 million people, accounts for 13% of gross domestic product.

A potential boon for Bangladesh, Vietnam

Finished clothing has so far been excluded from the list, but should talks fail and Trump raises tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese products in the next round, textiles will be hit. Bangladesh and Vietnam are well-positioned as apparel manufacturing hubs and will be obvious choices as retailers with exposure to the U.S. move their production out of China, Fitch Solutions said in a report.

To tap rising demand, Newage, which has an annual revenue of about $100 million, tied up with a Chinese investor to set up a $20 million garment factory in Kaliakoir on the outskirts of the capital Dhaka. The unit expects to start production in four months.

“There’s a huge potential to further expand investment” in the garment industry, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said in a speech to Chinese businessmen in Beijing on July 4. “We highly value the huge interest demonstrated by the Chinese investors in our country and as such we are setting up a special economic zone for the Chinese Investors.”

Infrastructure impediments

But for Bangladesh companies there’s a roadblock to winning more orders from Western firms. With its infrastructure ranked at 103 in the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index, compared with 29 for China, Bangladesh needs to improve its supply chain, modernize its garment factories, build highways and reduce red tape at ports to lure more buyers.

Prime Minister Hasina opened two four-lane bridges on the highway to the Chittagong Port in May and another bridge earlier in March, cutting travel time to the nation’s main port by almost half. The government has also been accelerating construction of highways. Still it takes 168 hours for exporters in the nation to ship from Dhaka, while it takes just 23 hours in Shanghai, according to the latest Doing Business report by the World Bank.

“Of course, we are not as good as Hong Kong or China,” said Khalid Quadir, co-founder and chief executive officer of Brummer & Partners Asset Management (Bangladesh). “There’s congestion at the port, but congestion may be the function of more and more containers going there. Our ports aren’t ready.”

Exporters also need to improve productivity, said Fahmida Khatun, executive director of Dhaka-based Centre for Policy Dialogue. “In order to increase productivity, we need to go for technological upgrade and automation in the garment industry. There are some companies that have adopted automation, but it has to be done across the sector,” she said.

Then there’s the price advantage. China exports garments at about $2.3 a piece, compared with $2.79 for Bangladesh and $2.52 in Cambodia, according to Rubana Huq, president of Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association. China’s price dominance over other nations along with technological superiority may keep exports from the north Asian nation resilient, she said.

"The beauty industry is often portrayed as a glittering, glamorous world of lotions, potions and brightly coloured bottles on bathroom shelves… but it has an ugly side.

Last year, Zero Waste Week, an annual awareness campaign, reported that more than 120 billion units of packaging are produced every year by the global cosmetics industry, most of which are not recyclable.

Often beauty products will be packaged in swathes of cellophane, cardboard, tissue paper and boxes, which look pretty for the five minutes before they are thrown in the bin.

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.

Plastic and its impact on the environment has become a big talking point recently, but since David Attenborough urged the world to reduce its plastic use to protect oceans last year, it’s more important now than ever before.

His BBC documentary Blue Planet II graphically revealed the catastrophic effects of plastic pollution on marine wildlife, with evidence showing plastic in ocean waters thousands of miles from land and birds feeding microplastics to their young.

Researchers now estimate that more than 8.3 billion tons of plastic has been produced since the 1950s and about 60 per cent of that has ended up in either landfill or the natural environment.

The UN has predicted that if the rate of waste production continues, by 2050 our oceans will carry more plastic than fish and an estimated 99 per cent of seabirds will have ingested plastic. Earlier this year, the UN declared our current situation a “planetary crisis”.

Despite its challenges though, attitudes are changing in the beauty world. Consumers have been turning their gaze to non-toxic, sustainable ingredients and are also paying attention to eco-brands whose mission statements promise to limit waste.

One brand leading the force is Aveda, a botanical hair and skincare brand, which has made sustainability a priority when it comes to packaging. Aveda was the first beauty company to use 100 per cent post-consumer recycled polyethylene terephthalate, and now more than 85 per cent of its casings, bottles and jars contain 100 per cent post-consumer recycled materials. Instead, these bottles are made from bioplastic.

Bioplastic is a bio-polyethylene derived primarily from sugar cane. Bagasse is the fibrous byproduct that remains after the sugar cane stalks are crushed for sugar production. The bagasse is used for fuel for the production of ethanol, the main ingredient used to produce polyethylene. Sugar cane is quickly renewable and thus a sustainable source – but not if you cut down rainforests to ­­grow it, like palm oil.

“Bioplastics very soon will provide viable alternatives to virgi­­n-petro-based plastics. Today it’s possible to use sugar-based bioplastics that do not disrupt the recycling stream,” Edmond Irizarry, executive director of package development at Aveda, told The Independent. “In the very near future, we will be able to utilise agricultural waste (in other words, cow poo) to make new forms of plastic that today are not commonly recycled.”

Other companies, such as British-owned Neal’s Yard Remedies, which packages its products using glass bottles, jars and 100 per cent post-consumer recycling plastic, plans to use 100 per cent recycled plastic bottles by 2025.

Louise Green, head of sustainability at Neal’s Yard Remedies, said she’d love the industry to encourage people to work together more. She notes that while the company’s mission statement strives to use sustainable packaging, like its iconic apothecary glass bottles, plastic is often the choice when it comes to certain products.

“Plastic isn’t always the worst choice to make because it is lightweight and sometimes glass is heavy to transport. We start out with glass but we use plastic where this is a safety issue. You don’t want glass in the shower or glass used for baby shampoo.

“What it is about is using the right material in the right instance, but nothing should ever get released into the environment.”

But are alternatives costly? Compare and contrast Johnson’s Cotton Buds: £1 for 100

Cotton and Bamboo Cotton Buds by Hydrophil: £2.25 for 100 (plastic-free alternative)

Head and Shoulders shampoo: £1

Lush Shampoo Bar: £7.50 (plastic-free alternative)

Neal’s Yard Remedies has been at the forefront of the sustainability debate, yet Green believes consumers are the ones who need to make smart changes.

“Awareness and intent has increased hugely over the last couple of years. But there is a choice. As a consumer, I personally believe much more thoughtful consumerism is needed. Choosing more expensive things over throwaway items, like buy one get one free products that are often wasted. It can’t just be about privilege, we need more education.”

According to a poll conducted by The Independent, 62 per cent of voters said they would prefer to pay extra for the eco-friendly bamboo cotton buds, whereas 38 per cent stayed firmly in Johnson’s camp.

When asked if they would purchase a Lush shampoo bar at £7.50 each, instead of a £1 bottle of Head and Shoulders shampoo, 41 per cent said yes. Interestingly, when asked whether they knew how their recycling was being managed, 82 per cent said no.

Social media polls do show a shift in consumer behaviour, with eco-friendly products coming out on top, but is it reflected in their spending habits?

A study commissioned last year by consumer goods giant Unilever revealed a third of consumers are now buying from brands that make their sustainability credentials clear. The report also found higher expectations for brands to have a positive and environmental impact.

At the time, Keith Weed, Unilever’s chief marketing and communications officer, said sustainability was now imperative and not just a nice-to-have business.

“To succeed globally, and especially in emerging economies across Asia, Africa and Latin America, brands should go beyond traditional focus areas like product performance and affordability.”

Recent research commissioned by Garnier showed more than half of people admitted to not recycling all of their bathroom items, while data from TerraCycle, a US-based recycling company, showed 4.5 million Brits simply find recycling bathroom waste inconvenient.

Garnier partnered with TerraCycle to launch the Personal Care and Beauty Recycling Programme, the UK’s first free recycling scheme for bathroom waste.

Lush, which recently launched “Naked Shops” in Milan and Berlin offering packaging-free cosmetics, currently have no plans to sell their products wholesale to large retailers, such as Tesco, Waitrose or Sainsbury’s.

Speaking to The Independent, a spokesman said: “The long supply chains that conventional retailers have just do not suit naked beauty products. They should focus on their core business and drop cosmetics, leaving it to the specialists.”

When asked whether it would drop their prices to appeal to customers buying out of convenience, or those with a lower socioeconomic background, the spokesman said the brand invests in staff to advise customers on the right product for them.

“If people bought what was appropriate for them, only bought what they require and not be duped by special offers and two-for-ones, that are then discarded, this would have a hugely positive effect on our environmental problems.”

Some 250 of the world’s business giants, who between them account for 20 per cent of all plastic packaging in the world, have teamed up with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation to pledge to end plastic waste. Businesses including SC Johnson, PepsiCo, H&M, Colgate-Palmolive Company, L’Oreal, Selfridges, Johnson and Johnson Consumer Inc and Unilever have committed to eliminating plastic when it’s unnecessary, and to shift to reusable packaging in some cases. By 2025, they plan to make all plastic packaging either reusable, recyclable, or compostable.

Governments are also getting involved, pledging to make sure that plastic that is “recyclable” actually gets recycled, and to build the infrastructure that is needed.

In October, environment secretary Michael Gove said: “I am proud that today we have signed up to the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment. Plastic waste is one of the greatest environmental challenges facing the world. It is a global problem requiring a global situation.”

The shift in the UK is noticeable. The debate has reached fever pitch since the 5p plastic bag levy was introduced in October 2015, the appearance of advertisements discouraging the use of single-use plastic bottles and the ban on microbeads last summer.

In his 2018 Budget chancellor Philip Hammond announced a new tax on plastic packaging that will affect manufacturers and importers who use less than 30 per cent recycled plastic; yet he stepped back from the “latte levy” – a tax tackling the country’s disposable cup waste, which amounts to 2.5 billion cups being thrown away each year.

The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) welcomed the pledges to the Global Commitment, but also said the big companies that produce the plastic should be taking responsibility.

Lyndsey Dodds, head of UK marine policy at WWF, agrees. “We believe that producers – the big brands who create and sell plastic in the first place – should take more responsibility [for the material] that is choking our oceans and killing our wildlife.

Key events in the history of plastic 1862 – Alexander Parkes introduces the first manmade plastic to the public at the Great International Exhibition in London 1869 – American inventor John W Hyatt makes the first successful plastic product, celluloid. It entered production in 1872. 1908 – Jacques E Brandenberger, Swiss textile engineer, invented cellophane, which is a clear and protective packaging plastic. It is still widely used today. 1929 – Leo Baekeland invents bakelite, the first fully synthetic plastic to be mass-produced. 1935 – Wallace Carothers invents nylon, a synthetic silk, used during the war for parachutes, ropes, body armour, helmet liners and more. 1954 – Polystyrene foam was introduced by Dow Chemical Co. 1977 – The plastic bag is introduced to the grocery industry as an alternative option to paper.

“The New Plastics Economy Global Commitment is a positive step in the right direction to help ensure we eliminate unnecessary single-use plastic and any remaining plastic we create is reusable or recyclable.”

Greenpeace points out how the leading consumer brands involved have no plans to reduce their overall plastic output. Louise Edge, UK senior oceans campaigner, said: “The sheer number and size of the companies behind this pledge shows the industry is responding to people’s concern about the impacts of plastic waste, but the individual commitments being made by companies to date just don’t go far enough. Making packaging more recyclable is a step forward, but making more recyclable packaging isn’t.

“The problem is that leading brands are already producing more plastic waste than our recycling systems can cope with, with the overflow being dumped in southeast Asia or burnt in incinerators. Just because something is recyclable doesn’t mean it will be recycled.”

An investigation by Greenpeace’s Unearthed – the organisation’s investigations project – published last week also shows how plastic recycling from the UK and many other western countries has ended up in illegal waste sites in Malaysia, which has become the world’s main destination for plastic waste after China banned imports last year.

“The main progress so far on tackling plastic waste in this sector has come through government bans on microbeads in personal care products. As ministers plan to ban bigger single-use plastic items like cotton buds, the beauty industry should take the opportunity to get ahead of the curve and move to eliminate superfluous plastic packaging before it is pushed to do so,” Edge adds.

But it’s not only packaging that can harm the environment. Harmful skincare ingredients including BHA (butylated hydroxytoluene) and BHT (butylated hydroxanisole), which are popular preservatives often found in moisturisers and makeup, as well as food products, have been linked to potential environmental harm. BHA is listed as a chemical of potential concern by the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Northeast Atlantic, because of its tendency to bioaccumulate and its toxicity to aquatic organisms.

Oxybenzone, a chemical often found in sunscreen, was found to contribute to the destruction of coral reefs. A study published in the journal Archives of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology discovered that the chemical has toxic effects on young coral that causes endocrine disruption, DNA damage, and death, among other problems. Oxybenzone also exacerbates coral bleaching, a process by which coral rejects symbiotic organisms and loses their colons.

The attitude towards single-use plastic has shifted considerably in the past few years, and while consumers are slowly turning their gaze away from using face wipes, cotton buds and plastic bags, corporate businesses still need to do better. With profits the main concern for global beauty brands, we’ve seen only a relatively minor change in the way companies are tackling sustainability and actively finding alternative packaging materials.

Richard Thompson, professor of marine science at Plymouth University, says the interest in the issue is positive, but there needs to be enough evidence to prove new materials will be sustainable long-term. “There’s a high level of interest in the problem and people are looking for rapid solutions, but we need to be cautious about making substitutions that, at face value, could seem better.

“It is clear that there isn’t one solution to how we match materials to particular products and applications and the geography where those products are sourced from. But that all depends on whether we have an advanced waste management infrastructure. We are fortunate enough to have that in the UK, but other countries do not.”

He added that over time products have not been designed with end of life in mind. “The labelling system we have is not really fit for purpose for what we need in terms of consumer information; whether the product is recyclable in theory, but not in practice,” he said. “What we need is labelling on where the product is viable to recycling locally, a waste stream, at the moment.”

UK businesses such as Boots, which houses more than 400 beauty brands, carries the On Pack Recycling Logo and other recycling guidance, and works with focus groups to ensure consumers engage with recycling plastics.

It has also committed to reducing single-use plastic and has welcomed the UK Plastic Pact (a collaboration working towards best practice, packaging redesign and recycling options). For its Botanics range, for example, Boots uses 25 per cent post-consumer recycled plastic for sleeves and bottles, as well as paper packaging made from sustainably managed forests for its recently introduced Just Water.

Other companies offer incentives to customers with recycling systems, such as MAC’s Back to MAC Programme that allows consumers to return six primary packaging containers in exchange for a free lipstick.

Aveda is something of a recycling veteran, as is Stila Cosmetics. They have paved the way for luxury brands such as Chanel, which has invested in Sulapac, a Finnish startup specialising in producing sustainable packaging products.

Perfumerie Le Labo encourages customers to bring their empty bottle to the store for a refill and in return they receive 20 per cent off, while skincare giant Kiehl’s rewards customers who bring back 10 empty, full-size containers with a free travel-sized Kiehl’s product. Makeup brand Hourglass has launched its first refillable lipstick, while Dior has launched a now sold-out holiday set featuring a refillable version of its Rouge Dior Lipstick.

These incentives are positive and do drive change, especially since research by Garnier found over a quarter of Brits would be more inclined to live a sustainable lifestyle if they were incentivised by a reward.

The use of alternative materials will always look positive on the face of it, but not when it is putting pressure on another habitat, country or ecosystem. Using sugarcane to produce a biodegradable plastic is fantastic, but all the positive change can be undone if this isn’t implemented responsibly. If sugarcane plastic starts to become mass-produced in the way plastic is now, someone else will suffer and become a victim to capitalism.

So what should we do and how can we make a positive change going forward?

Sander Defruyt, a lead for the New Plastics Economy at the Ellen MacArthur Foundation believes changes can only be made if corporations and governments recognise the problem. “People around the world are changing how they shop and what they buy to help tackle the plastic pollution crisis, but can only act within the plastics system that is in place,” he said.

“Thankfully, through the Global Commitment and other efforts, we have seen more and more companies and governments recognise this, and have started to design products and systems that will help stop plastic from becoming waste and pollution in the first place.”

Matthew Scott Savoca, a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University, agrees. “If corporations don’t move away from these products they risk losing business as they are replaced and outpaced by more environmentally friendly options,” he says. “Corporations should try to move away from non-recyclable, non-biodegradeable plastics as quickly as possible.”

Rachelle Strauss, founder of Zero Waste Week, goes further: “Like other industries, the cosmetics sector needs to meet consumer demand for more sustainable packaging. While it can be argued that customers who purchase high end products expect beautiful packaging, there is no reason why beauty and sustainability cannot go hand in hand.

“Refills are available for washing up liquid and fabric conditioner, why not shampoo and conditioner? Some coffee shops offer 25p off if you take your own reusable cup, let’s do the same for cosmetics.”

Businesses respond to consumer behaviour all the time. For example, the rise of e-cigarettes forced major corporations to commit to phasing out cigarettes altogether and entering the smoke-free market instead.

The rise in veganism is another great example of how consumers can change the way businesses behave. Supermarkets across the country have scrambled to offer vegan-friendly groceries to meet the rise in demand. Ditto bars and restaurants, and even the fashion industry has made sustainability a priority.

If other industries can make drastic changes over a couple of years, what is holding the beauty industry – one of the largest contributors to plastic pollution – back? We’ve seen the positive change we can make in a short space of time, so why don’t we start now?

"The homegrown yarn, as well as the handcrafted finish, set Araminta Campbell’s textiles apart

Araminta Campbell, a young Scottish textile designer, specialises in handwoven alpaca accessories and bespoke tweed and tartan design.

Pebble Narrow Scarf, �850, Minta Allium Blanket in grey and white, �680, Minta Herringbone cushion, �180''Pictures: Gerarardo Jaconelli

From her studio in Leith, Edinburgh, Campbell was inspired to work in alpaca because her mother is allergic to wool. She now creates scarves, throws, accessories and tweeds. Raised in the North East, the 30-year-old is inspired by the Scottish landscape, passionate about celebrating traditional weaving techniques and craftsmanship, and delighted that alpacas come in 22 shades. She has just launched a Signature Collection of four handwoven designs, each of which can take up to ten days to produce on a heritage loom and is completely unique.

What do you do?

Our textiles studio specialises in one off-luxurious British alpaca accessories, handwoven here in our Edinburgh workshop. Our MINTA collection is a contemporary designer interiors range of cushions and throws. Signature is a curated collection of scarves, shawls and blanket wraps. Heritage is a bespoke tweed and tartan service, which allows our clients to create entirely unique designs for interiors, clothing, accessories and so on.

What is your training/background?

Pebble Shawl, �1,400

I trained as an embroidery artist and graduated with a degree in fine art textiles from Manchester Metropolitan University in 2011. I’d always had a passion for textiles, nature and the outdoors, I grew up in the countryside and that’s where the inspiration for my designs comes from.

I’m self-taught in weaving, although it didn’t grab me initially, it frustrated me. Ironically, it’s a craft that now drives me. I began learning in the final few weeks of my degree, but it wasn’t long before I was completely captivated.

I started out selling handwoven artworks to collectors. Alpaca fibre came into the frame when I began designing and weaving a scarf as a gift for my mother. She’s allergic to wool, so I decided to research alternatives. Alpaca fleece is completely hypo-allergenic. It’s beautifully soft, comes in 22 natural colours and is the only luxury fibre you can source from UK farms. Cashmere and silk have to be imported, which is why I work with alpaca – sustainability is extremely important to me.

This was a personal project but with the inevitable word of mouth, I ended up selling all of the scarves. However, I’m happy to say every time we produce a new collection, my mother’s always keen to have the first viewing.

Pine Cone Stole, �1,500

Why did you decide to set up the company?

After finishing up an internship in a large corporate weaving company, I realised it really wasn’t for me. There just wasn’t enough of a connection between the design element and the weaving process. I really wanted more freedom, to push boundaries creatively and to create designs that were both technically challenging and imaginative.

What is your aim?

I’m building our brand to be a destination luxury brand; to be acknowledged internationally for the artistry and quality of our designs.

Staffa Blanket Wrap, �2,500

We want to nurture and grow the weaving industry, encourage people to appreciate the artisan craftsmanship behind their investments, the passion and provenance behind the brand.

It’s important that we also create an environment where we can support and attract talent and employment opportunities in the Scottish woven textile industry. The industry has suffered from decline in the past but it’s on an upward trajectory, I believe there is a growing demand for Scottish produce and items. It’s important that traditional skills are passed on to the next generation in a forward-thinking and progressive way.

What’s different about your product?

Our Signature pieces are individual, completely exclusive and handmade. No two items are the same. Our story is also at the heart of everything, pieces of art that look and feel wonderful – whether it is a bespoke tweed that tells a story of the landscape or a handwoven scarf that has been woven from a single alpaca fleece from a farm in the Scottish Borders.

When did you start the company?

I set up my weaving workshop in Aberdeenshire then moved to Edinburgh and founded Araminta Campbell Limited in 2014.

Sycamore Blanket Wrap �2,500

What challenges have you faced?

It has been a challenge being a young woman in male-dominated industry as well as the pressures of establishing and growing a business from scratch. There have been times where we’ve been put under pressure to change course, but we have remained true to our brand values.

What was the biggest surprise along the way?

Having worked for a number of years on my own, the biggest surprise was when I started to pull together a team – it showed me how much further we could grow. Bringing in other people with their own distinct skills and ideas will always help you build far more than you can do on your own.

What is the fun part of your business?

Creating new designs and speaking to clients and seeing them get really excited about something you have made. Fundamentally, that’s what drives me forward every day. I also love getting stuck into a new design challenge. It’s exciting to work with a client and help them create something very personal and unique for their families, businesses or personal use.

How has it evolved?

If you go back three years, it was just me in a tiny studio, now we have a team of five all working from a beautiful weaving workshop and studio on the shore in Edinburgh. We used to make products to sell at shows, but now we focus on clients and bespoke commissions with many clients coming to visit our studio and showroom. It is a much more intimate and creative process where our clients get to see the process first-hand and can appreciate the care and craftsmanship.

What have you learned?

To stay true to your passions, even if you encounter resistance. If you persevere and work hard it is amazing what you can achieve.

What is your most popular product?

Our Signature handwoven Blanket wrap. It is currently the largest item in our handwoven collection, and it definitely makes a statement. It’s hugely versatile, can be worn on its own as a coat, over the top of a light jacket for extra warmth, for formal wear or to just snuggle up on the sofa. Looks and feels incredible!

Who are your customers?

We work with a variety of customers, from hotels such as the Fife Arms in Braemar, which re-opens later this year, to Savile Row tailors, such as Featherstone London, and Country Estates, including Ballogie and Glen Tanar, with our bespoke tweed and tartan. We also work with retailers including Studio 104 in New York and interior designers with our MINTA interior accessories.

Which items do you have at home from your range?

There’s my own handwoven alpaca shawl, which I wore on my wedding day. It was the first time I had allowed myself to keep something I had made, and it felt special that every time I later wore it I would be reminded of that day.

It’s perfect for keeping me warm during an Edinburgh winter, but light enough to throw round my shoulders for a drinks party in the summer.

I’ve also got some of my MINTA soft cushions on my bed and I’m just about to have some furniture upholstered with my own tweed.

What’s your style philosophy?

Choose timeless, quality pieces that transcend fashion. Invest carefully. I love finding unique things, pieces that you won’t see elsewhere. I love grey too. The classics, not fashion.

Where are your products made?

All of them are made in Scotland.

Who has influenced your style?

I have never been particularly influenced by the world of fashion, but I have been excited to see young brands like Le Kilt doing new things with Scottish traditional dress. It’s helping to expand the way people see these historic designs.

Who are your style icons?

Coco Chanel – impeccable style, elegant but practical, and she was incredibly inventive with Scottish tweed. And I always think Amal Clooney looks incredible…

Who are your favourite designers?

Stella McCartney. Her style is cool and classic. I have such admiration for the way she has raised the bar for ethical luxury fashion.

What is your inspiration?

The Scottish landscape has always been my chief inspiration – probably because that is where I am happiest. A walk or drive through the wilds of the Highlands or an afternoon at home in Royal Deeside is always inspiring, and I am constantly seeing ideas for a new design or combination of colours.

The row over Dolce & Gabbana’s video campaign, which showed a Chinese model struggling to eat spaghetti with chopsticks, shows how far luxury brands still have to go to respond to the cultural sensitivities and changing attitudes of consumers. Thousands of the Italian fashion house’s goods have been pulled from China’s biggest shopping websites after the video campaign was branded racist and insensitive.

As an own-goal, it was remarkable, but the company isn’t alone in struggling to recognize this shift — the whole industry will need to adapt or risk alienating customers. Luxury and premium fashion brands will have to embrace a more inclusive outlook if they are to continue to tempt customers to spend on their handbags, shoes and watches. That means not just greater diversity and cultural sensitivity in their marketing, but also providing garments for different ages, body shapes and those who want less revealing fashion.

Some firms’ messages are increasingly jarring. At Victoria’s Secret Lingerie — where parent L Brands Inc. recently installed a new CEO as it battles declining sales — its Amazonian models sporting skimpy underwear look incongruous with the broader narrative around empowering women. Other labels have recognized the need to change. Breitling, the watch brand acquired by private equity firm CVC Capital Partners last year, has ditched its dated ads featuring male pilots being fawned over by attractive women.

Fashion needs to get this right because clothing is such a big way for consumers to express their personal identity. With the rise of social media, particularly Instagram, there are signs this relationship is under threat: what individuals do, where they go, and what they eat can say as much about them as their outfits. That’s both a threat to luxury, and an opportunity for the brands to reshape their images.

The industry can get it right. Kering SA’s Gucci label has embraced a diversity of races and ages in its marketing. This nimbleness may well have helped to fuel the brands’s extraordinary growth in recent years.

For some time, the industry has featured older models. It was a canny move. Not only did it demonstrate a broader appeal, it spoke to a subsector of shoppers with money to spend. But increasingly it is younger consumers who are driving luxury growth — and they have different views on the world. According to a recent study from Bain & Co., generations Y and Z — consumers under 35 — will account for all of the growth in the luxury market this year, compared with 85 per cent in 2017.

More inclusive fashion will represent about 20 per cent of women’s ready-to-wear this year, according to Bain. Luxury brands are producing more one-size garments, targeted at curvy or plus-sized consumers, larger sizes and clothing with a looser fit. Increasingly some consumers want clothing that isn’t as revealing of the body as much traditional designer fashion. So-called modest fashion will account for 40 per cent of luxury womenswear in 2018. This includes Muslim-specific garments, as well as items that cover more of the body.

The stakes could not be higher for luxury brands. After two years of strong growth, investors are becoming more concerned about a slowdown in sales. At the top of the worry list is China, which has turbocharged demand since it recovered from the lean years of 2015 and 2016. Consumers there account for a third of all luxury spending, according to Bain.

Dolce & Gabbana’s blunder therefore looks particularly ill-timed."

This story is part of ""Smart Creativity,"" a series exploring the intersection between high-concept design and advanced technology.

Fashion has a water problem. A 2017 report found that the industry consumed almost 79 billion cubic meters of water in 2015, enough to fill 32 million Olympic-sized swimming pools. And according to the World Bank, 17-20% of all industrial water pollution is caused by the dyeing or treatment of garments.

But design researcher Natsai Audrey Chieza, who presented a TED talk on pollution and fashion in 2017, is looking to change that.

""When you take a designer and place them in a biological, scientific environment, that's when you get a new way of thinking that can catalyze this kind of innovation,"" she says.

The future of fashion? Stunning textiles dyed with bacteria

Chieza would know. For eight years, she have been at the forefront of the burgeoning biodesign field, finding natural alternatives to unsustainable industrial processes.

Most recently, as a designer-in-residence at the University College London's Department of Biochemical Engineering, she's been developing dyes from Streptomyces coelicolor, a bacteria typically found in the roots of plants.

""Bacteria produce pigment. They either seep it out of their cell walls or they hold it within their cell walls,"" she explains. ""I became very interested with microbes that seep it out because that seemed like a very low-tech way of actually accessing that color.""

To apply these natural dyes, textiles are placed in a petri dish with live Streptomyces coelicolor. After an incubation period, the textiles take on the rich blue, purple and red tones, depending on the pH of the environment where the bacteria are grown.

Because these pigments are derived through the natural excretion process, Chieza says, they can dye textiles with about 500 times less water than traditional dyeing, while cutting the use of harmful synthetic chemicals.

""There have always been artifacts that are sort of beyond 'This material that might look nice.' They tell us about where we are with our technology,"" Chieza says. ""There are new spaces opening up for designers to invite this interdisciplinary sharing of ideas. I think that's where creativity has an amazing space to expand.""

Watch the video above to find out more about Natsai Audrey Chieza's bacterial dyes, and how technology informs her practice."

Breakfast at Tiffany’s star Audrey Hepburn has been hailed as the most iconic fashion innovator of the last 100 years, it has emerged.

A global study taking the opinions of 6,000 women from the UK, USA, Italy, Australia and Japan, revealed the enduring appeal of the late British movie star’s style, 25 years after her death in 1993.

Double Oscar winner Hepburn, who also starred in My Fair Lady and Roman Holiday was well known for her black roll-necks, cropped trousers and ballet pumps, all of which have become modern day wardrobe staples.

She famously accessorised with a collection of silk scarves and cat-eye sunglasses and helped to raise the profile of the ‘Little Black Dress’ to a must-have style staple.

Hepburn topped the polls in the UK, Australia and Italy, and was only pipped to first place in the US by a former First Lady, Jackie Kennedy.

British fashion journalist Karen Kay said: “Women of all ages across the world cite Audrey Hepburn’s gamine style as aspirational and one that has shaped modern wardrobes.

''Hers is a style that adapts to suit women of all ages and is flattering on different body shapes, translating across different cultures and climates.”

The study was conducted by DHL, the global experts in fashion retail and logistics.

The British royal family’s high profile and sartorial sensibilities also proved to resonate with global fashion culture.

The late Diana, Princess of Wales appeared in second place in the UK and Australian polls, and third in Italy and the US.

Princess Diana helped to popularise a number of trends, including garments with a ‘power shoulder’ silhouette, pastel-coloured suits and midi dresses.

She also experimented with colour and patterns, with a fondness for polka dots and colour-blocking – where colours which are considered opposites on the colour wheel are paired together for a striking effect.

As well as pinpointing the global style innovators of the last 100 years, the study, conducted by OnePoll, also explored the shopping habits and concerns of women around the world.

Of the countries surveyed, shoppers in the UK were most likely to consider the ethics of the places they buy from, while those surveyed in Japan prioritise the quality of the garment above all else.

Fifteen per cent of respondents read labels to identify where an item is manufactured and find out more about the garment’s supply chain with regards to environmental protection and impact.

And a quarter wants to know that a company is looking after its staff in terms of their working conditions before making a purchase.

Shoppers in Italy are most clued-up about where their clothes come from, with 41 per cent looking into the supply chain or the brands they buy from.

Italians are also most likely to take care to buy clothes which are bio-degradable and will have a minimal impact on the environment when they are eventually thrown away.

Karen Kay added that we are becoming more discerning about our fashion choices.

She said: “There is a growing awareness, especially amongst millennials, of the environmental and social impact of the clothing industry.

“Many are challenging brands to be more transparent about the provenance of their garments before making purchases, so they can make informed choices based on the ethical status of a business.”

(Image: DHL/SWNS.COM)

Deutsche Post DHL Group’s Ken Allen, CEO of E-Commerce Solutions, said: “Online clothing and footwear shopping has moved from being a curiosity 20 years ago to a huge £4.48 billion global industry.

“Our survey results found many consumers have very high standards for service.

''Speed of delivery and ease of return are real drivers for customers and businesses that offer quality delivery services are often the preferred option.”

Deutsche Post DHL Group’s Arjan Sissing, Senior Vice President Group Brand Marketing, added: “DHL commissioned this survey to explore key fashion trends and to reference the influence the business has had as the leading global logistics provider to the world of fashion.

“No other industry is so marked by continual change, the spirit of the times, trends and global exchange and, in recent years, the fashion industry has been both influenced and supported by DHL’s global reach, precision, reliability and speed.”"
"Victoria Stapleton, Brora

WHEN I started Brora what was missing from the marketplace was beautiful, quality cashmere in fabulous bold colours. All the cashmere was very safe, in camel, navy, black or ivory. So I went to the best mill, the most high-end cashmere mill I could find that made for people like Chanel and I worked with them to develop pinks and reds, turquoise and greens. To this day, 26 years later, we are still renowned for doing these incredible colours.

What I have learned over the years is how adaptable cashmere is and how incredible it is when woven into different textures and when mixed with different weights; you can make very different designs. With textiles I’m still learning; it’s such a complex minefield. They all work differently on different products.

My father was an incredible entrepreneur but he also had an artistic side, and my mother was very creative and had a wonderful eye for colour. I wasn’t very good at working for anyone else. I’m better at working for myself.

I was brought up in a very female family [I have three sisters] and we had a very strong father who was an amazing businessman and he taught us a lot. We’re all very business-like about what we do. In a way, he pushed us into that, and I’ve never been fearful about being a woman in the fashion industry.

I never considered my sex to be an issue one way or the other and I don’t think anyone I worked with has. I found it a bonus being a woman in business. I never think of myself as anything but what I am: I’m a wife, a business woman, I’m a designer, I wear very many different hats and I just get on and I do what I do.

Now, I’m looking more and more into sustainable fabric. We are very aware of our carbon footprint. Linen is a prime example of sustainable fabric. We are very renowned for beautiful linen that we make in the summer months and linen is an incredibly sustainable product. It doesn’t use a lot of water and you use a lot of the fibre in what you make. There’s not a lot of waste and whatever waste there is, amazingly it is used for the inside of, say, tennis racket handles. I only know all this because I went last year on an incredible trip to see the linen being grown, being harvested, being processed and then it being dyed and woven. I think it is the most environmentally friendly fabric you can buy. I think 70 percent of our dresses in the summer collection will be made of linen.

I didn’t set out to create a fashion brand, but today Brora is not only a cashmere brand but a head-to-toe fashion brand. And I think in that area we still have more work to do. I like to design small collections. Every single piece is really thought-through with immaculate detail. We’re really into producing small collections of very special pieces that when you buy, you feel that you’re going to have them in your wardrobe for many years to come.

ANTIGONI MARKITANI"
"MILAN — Fashion industry experts say luxury consumers are expressing a willingness to spend more for garments whose production doesn’t harm the environment or exploit workers, a sign they said of a new era of sustainability in fashion.

McKinsey & Company consultancy said at an Italian Fashion Chamber round-table Tuesday that 70 per cent of consumers were willing to pay some premium for items produced sustainably, based on responses of 90 department store buyers in 25 countries responsible for 50 billion euros in annual purchases.

The significance of the trend was underlined by projections that the global garment industry will expand by two-thirds by 2030, while be responsible for one-quarter of the global carbon footprint by 2050, up from 2 per cent in 2015.

The round-table brought together experts in ethical finance and labour practices alongside industry players and innovators in sustainable technologies in the fashion industry, which is recognized as the second-most polluting sector in the world after the oil industry.

Environmental, social and governance issues were identified as key drivers defining luxury brands’ commitment to sustainability, but speakers also pressed the need for diversity in fashion boardrooms and creativity teams. The diversity call was against the backdrop of recent consumer backlashes against Prada and Gucci for producing items that recalled blackface, and against Dolce & Gabbana in China after one of the designers made insulting remarks.

Livia Firth, creative director of the Eco-age consultancy, said that despite the fashion world’s global nature, a recent report found that ethnic minorities held just 11 per cent of board seats on the 15 largest publicly traded fashion companies.

Firth said the case for making the fashion industry more inclusive was moral and ethical, but also made business sense, citing reports from Harvard Business Review and McKinsey that found that “the most technically and culturally diverse boards are significantly more likely to deliver higher profits and generate more sales.”

While the fast-fashion industry is considered the main driver in the rapid expansion of the textile industry, Kerry Kennedy, president of the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights foundation said that the luxury industry could help raise standards that would put “downward pressure” on fast-fashion.

She called on fashion houses to publishes on their websites the factories where their items are made and to create a “rigorous” best-practice program for garment factory inspectors, which she said still does not exist despite a global outcry after the 2013 collapse of the Rana Plaza building in Bangladesh killing more than 1,300 garment workers.

“I think sustainability would also benefit from a clarity over terms,” she said.

She also called on investors in the industry to make sustainability part of their criteria.

“Sustainability is about corporations or their investors asking themselves this question: What is the impact of environmental degradation, human rights violations or corruption on investment outcome for shareholders,” she said. “If you make an investment and you fail to consider these issues, you are investing in a ticking bomb and at some point that bomb is going to explode.”"

"LVMH will enter a partnership to develop the Stella McCartney fashion brand as luxury companies race to show consumers and regulators their commitment to reducing their environmental impact.

McCartney, whose namesake line is known for snubbing animal products like leather, fur, and feathers, while pioneering eco-friendly designs like glue-free sneakers, will maintain majority ownership of the brand. The move follows her decision to buy back a 50% stake in her label that was owned by LVMH’s rival, Kering, last year.

“We are convinced of the great long-term potential of her house,” LVMH Chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault said in a statement, adding that McCartney’s focus on sustainability and ethical issues had been decisive. “Stella will help us further increase awareness on these important topics.”

Concerns about sustainability in apparel has shifted from fast-fashion makers like H&M and sportswear giants like Nike to the luxury industry, with its reliance on animal-based materials like leather and cashmere. Prada SpA pledged last month to transition to recycled nylon for its iconic belt bags and backpacks, while Kering chief Francois-Henri Pinault—whose company owns Gucci and Saint Laurent—is spearheading an effort to get fashion makers to commit to new sustainability targets.

Officials in the French environment ministry have said it hopes to ban the practice of destroying unsold goods, widespread among luxury goods makers that don’t want to be seen discounting their products.

An LVMH spokesman declined to say how much the company would invest in the McCartney brand as part of the deal, the details of which are set to be outlined in September.

In many ways, Haute Couture Fashion Week in Paris feels like a bubble full of embroidery, feathers and acres of tulle ruffles, a showcase of incredible handmade designs that could sell well north of $100,000.

However, at the Autumn-Winter 2019 shows, though the focus remained very much on offering escapism through exquisite fabrics and elaborate craftsmanship, some couturiers also provided touches of realism. At a time when consumers are increasingly conscious of the impact the fashion industry has on the environment, many couturiers are keen to highlight how craftsmanship can elevate upcycling to new heights.

Sustainable futures

Over the past several months, luxury ready-to-wear labels and high street brands alike have announced changes to their business practices in the name of sustainability. And now it seems that the push for sustainability has seeped into the world of haute couture.

Dutch designer Ronald van der Kemp, who has long been a champion for sustainable fashion, said that 98% of his new collection was made using repurposed fabrics and materials, including overstock from past collections and factory waste.

He also made a statement against faux fur, which is usually made from petroleum-based materials, by presenting a ""fur"" coat and a leopard-print stole made from silk tubes stuffed with recycled down. (Elsewhere, Jean Paul Gaultier offered a similarly clever alternative to faux fur, presenting coats with trompe l'oeil prints of animal pelts.)

""Couture in its heyday set the tone in fashion. With my sustainable couture I want to inspire girls out there to experiment with their wardrobes and with vintage clothes; to teach them to enhance their personalities and be conscious about buying clothes,"" van der Kemp said.

""I also want to show the world that it's possible to make couture with existing materials, dead stock, high-end leftovers, vintage fabrics, and that sustainability can be glamorous, sexy and high-fashion.""

Driving home that message, Viktor & Rolf created colorful patchwork dresses from vintage garments. They also collaborated with Dutch artist and textile designer Claudy Jongstra on a series of coats made from the wool of Drenthe Heath sheep she raises and shears herself. The designers told WWD they aimed ""to cast a positive spell that says things can be done.""

Meanwhile, on the fringe of couture, Philipp Schueller and Rens de Waal, the Dutch duo behind the label Schueller de Waal, staged an eco-minded alternative to the traditional fashion show. Instead of renting a venue, they had models, dressed in upcycled garments, pick up litter in front of the town hall in the 15th arrondissement as part of a ""cleaning action"" organized in partnership with two local NGOs.

New beginnings

Chanel is always one of the hottest tickets in town and this season was not different. The industry had been eagerly waiting to see the house's first couture collection under newly crowned creative director Virginie Viard, who took charge following the death of Karl Lagerfeld in February.

Chanel's presentations, staged at the Grand Palais, have always been associated with the grandest of grand sets -- a space shuttle, a replica of the Eiffel tower, a Mediterranean villa complete with palm trees and giant pool -- so this season's two-story circular library seemed a little tame by comparison, but it was a fitting tribute to Lagerfeld's and founder Gabrielle ""Coco"" Chanel's irrepressible love of books.

With this show, the longtime collaborator of the great designer confirmed the maison was in good hands, sending out a polished collection with her vision of the Chanel allure: Slender and elongated silhouettes walking hands deep into pockets and wearing comfortable flats, even with an evening gown.

""I dreamt about a woman with nonchalant elegance and a fluid and free silhouette; everything I like about the Chanel allure,"" Viard said in a press release.

In another debut, Texan designer Daniel Roseberry unveiled his first couture collection for Schiaparelli, having taken over from Bertrand Guyon in April. Unlike his predecessors, the 33-year-old didn't delve into the archive of Elsa Schiaparelli, deciding that her signature shocking pink was no longer shocking, but still brought a dash of surrealism to his collection, with oversized, cloud-like silhouettes and dreamy accessories.

Couture goes tech

Lace, tulle and beading remain the hallmarks of haute couture, but some designers are pushing their use of materials in new directions.

As always, Dutch designer Iris Van Herpen is leading the way. This season she collaborated with kinetic sculptor Anthony Howe on the finale ""Infinity"" dress, a skeleton of aluminum and stainless steel with a delicate layer of feathers that seemed to fly around the model at its center.

In a press release, the designer explained her overall collection reflected ""the beauty and complexity of our environment, exploring the patterns and structures within its fragile landscape."" And in sending models through and around Howe's portal-like sculptures in layers of organza that moved fluidly around their bodies, she offered one of the most memorable (and Instagrammable) moments of the week.

Elsewhere, Lebanese designer Tony Ward presented a dress from material that had been entirely 3D-printed using tulle and 33 pieces of biodegradable TPU (an eco-friendly plastic that decomposes in soil within five years). Ward said the dress was completely recyclable. ""Even though couture is all about the 'fairy hands,' I had the curiosity to integrate this technique and mix it with our know-how,"" Ward said in an email."
"Get ready to see ""Living Coral"" in your clothing, tech gadgets, home decor and more come 2019.

The Pantone Color Institute recently announced its 2019 ""Color of the Year,"" called Living Coral (16-1546).

Since 2000, the Institute has chosen a ""Color of the Year."" Experts look at trends in all facets of daily life, such as the entertainment industry, emerging artists, fashion, technology and more, to decide on the winner for the upcoming year.

What does this mean for you, though? Typically this color is utilized by brands, designers and other consumer-focused companies in their latest batch of products. Remember when everyone was head over heels for ""millennial pink""? Well, you can thank Pantone's 2016 Color of The Year, Rose Quartz, for that.

The 2019 winner was chosen for its ""animating and life-affirming"" hue which ""energizes and enlivens with a softer edge,"" according to the official site. And it seems to us no coincidence that this year's color evokes the beauty and fragility of our marine life and oceans. It's a subtle reminder that coral, which is bright and lively, is only possible if it's surrounded by a healthy environment. Some of our favorite brands have been making efforts to help clean our waters, replant trees in areas affected by deforestation and minimize their carbon footprints.

To us, Living Coral feels like that fresh, vibrant hue that we're all looking for to kick off the new year, especially when we're trying to escape from the cold dreariness of winter. Plus, it doesn't hurt that it works well in your home, wardrobe, beauty cabinets and office spaces.

Ahead, we've compiled some of our favorite Living Coral products that will help you feel energized for 2019.

"A group of top models and influencers, including Tess Holliday and Sonny Turner, are urging high street stores to cater for plus-size women.

Laura Capon, a beauty and fashion journalist at Cosmopolitan UK, published an open letter to the British high street on the women’s magazine website earlier today.

Penned in response to a recent survey of 8,700 women who wear a size 16 or over, which found that 83 per cent do not feel represented by the high street, the letter calls for brands to make plus-size women a priority.

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.

“Dear the British high street, as a size 22 woman, we haven’t always had the best relationship,” Capon writes.

“I’ve called you out for failing plus-size women and you’ve made it virtually impossible for me – or the average British woman who is a size 16 - to buy clothes that aren’t office-inappropriate kimonos. But I’ve heard that you’re going through a hard time and I wanted to reach out.”

Capon goes on to reveal that despite regularly visiting Oxford Street, which is littered with more than three hundred stores, there are just three she can actually buy clothes from.

“There’s a reason why 45 per cent of plus-size shoppers buy their clothes online,” she adds.

“I don’t want to have to tell the entire internet that it’s a genuine struggle for me to buy clothes. I just want to have a wardrobe as good as my smaller sized friends.

“So I’m asking if you can finally make plus-size women your priority, instead of an afterthought.”

Capon’s candid letter has since won the support of 14 plus-size models and influencers including blogger Grace Victory who says stores that don’t make clothes in bigger sizes are fat phobic.

“The average size woman in the UK is a 16 and at my smallest, which was a 16, I still struggled to find items of clothing on the high street that were stylish and cut correctly - especially jeans,” she tells The Independent.

“We come in all different shapes and sizes and plus size women deserve the basic need of adequate clothing. It isn’t hard to make clothes in bigger sizes, therefore brands are deciding to alienate a huge amount of women.

“It’s prejudice and extremely fat phobic and plays into the narrative that fat women should be invisible and cease to exist”.

Fashion influencer Lottie L’Amour agrees, adding that the British high street needs to catch up with the times.

“Plus size fashion has come on in leaps and bounds since I was younger, but despite a growing market, advances in fashion options and more representation in the form of plus size models and influencers, we’re still forced to shop online,” she tells The Independent.

“Plus size bodies are more confident than ever, and our shopping experiences shouldn’t be confined to our homes or to shapeless, soulless items crammed into the back of a store.

“It was important for me to lend my voice to this because I’m a consumer, I’m a plus size woman and I’m gunning for change! This is a rally cry to the British high street to catch up with the times - we’re here, we have money to spend and you’re missing out!”

Sonny Turner, a 19-year-old curve model from Birmingham, says that she backed Capon’s letter because brands “need to know that plus-size fashion is here to stay”.

“It is not just a trend,” she tells The Independent. “It is people’s daily lives and we deserve representation and fashionable clothing just as much as thinner women.""

The open letter follows the launch of a documentary called Curvy Girls Stripped Bare which goes behind the scenes at one of the UK's biggest modelling agencies, Milk Management.

Airing on Channel 5 last night, the first episode followed Turner and her fellow Curve Wall models Felicity Hayward and Hayley Hasselhoff as they discussed the impact modelling has had on their lives.

Daniel Pearl, commissioning editor for Channel 5, said: “There has been a remarkable shift in opinion and backlash against ‘traditional’ model body shapes and diet culture in recent months.

“I am pleased that we have been able to commission this two-part series which will celebrate women of all shapes and sizes.”

The documentary has since been praised online by women on social media with many calling it “inspiring” and “beautiful”.

“I loved the show! Very inspiring. Well done to all the girls,” one person tweeted.

“If you have not already watched Curvy Girls Stripped Bare on @channel5_tv then you NEED to!! It's so important for the fashion industry to acknowledge diversity and to embrace it!!” another added."
"The row over Dolce & Gabbana’s video campaign, which showed a Chinese model struggling to eat spaghetti with chopsticks, shows how far luxury brands still have to go to respond to the cultural sensitivities and changing attitudes of consumers. Thousands of the Italian fashion house’s goods have been pulled from China’s biggest shopping websites after the video campaign was branded racist and insensitive.

As an own-goal, it was remarkable, but the company isn’t alone in struggling to recognize this shift – the whole industry will need to adapt or risk alienating customers. Luxury and premium fashion brands will have to embrace a more inclusive outlook if they are to continue to tempt customers to spend on their handbags, shoes and watches. That means not just greater diversity and cultural sensitivity in their marketing, but also providing garments for different ages, body shapes and those who want less revealing fashion.

Some firms’ messages are increasingly jarring. At Victoria’s Secret Lingerie – where parent L Brands Inc. recently installed a new CEO as it battles declining sales – its Amazonian models sporting skimpy underwear look incongruous with the broader narrative around empowering women. Other labels have recognized the need to change. Breitling, the watch brand acquired by private equity firm CVC Capital Partners last year, has ditched its dated ads featuring male pilots being fawned over by attractive women.

Fashion needs to get this right because clothing is such a big way for consumers to express their personal identity. With the rise of social media, particularly Instagram, there are signs this relationship is under threat: what individuals do, where they go, and what they eat can say as much about them as their outfits. That’s both a threat to luxury, and an opportunity for the brands to reshape their images.

The industry can get it right. Kering SA’s Gucci label has embraced a diversity of races and ages in its marketing. This nimbleness may well have helped to fuel the brands’s extraordinary growth in recent years.

For some time, the industry has featured older models. It was a canny move. Not only did it demonstrate a broader appeal, it spoke to a sub-sector of shoppers with money to spend. But increasingly it is younger consumers who are driving luxury growth – and they have different views on the world. According to a recent study from Bain & Co., generations Y and Z – consumers under 35 – will account for all of the growth in the luxury market this year, compared with 85 percent in 2017.

More inclusive fashion will represent about 20 percent of women’s ready-to-wear this year, according to Bain. Luxury brands are producing more one-size garments, targeted at curvy or plus-sized consumers, larger sizes and clothing with a looser fit. Increasingly some consumers want clothing that isn’t as revealing of the body as much traditional designer fashion. So-called modest fashion will account for 40 percent of luxury womenswear in 2018. This includes Muslim-specific garments, as well as items that cover more of the body.

The stakes could not be higher for luxury brands. After two years of strong growth, investors are becoming more concerned about a slowdown in sales. At the top of the worry list is China, which has turbo-charged demand since it recovered from the lean years of 2015 and 2016. Consumers there account for a third of all luxury spending, according to Bain.

Dolce & Gabbana’s blunder therefore looks particularly ill-timed.

"Make this a sustainable Christmas

Make this a sustainable Christmas with your free second hand shopping guide!

Planning to give a Christmas gift this year that makes you and the planet feel good too? Make sure you get your hands on the latest My Vintage Town Auckland guide. Featuring the best op shops, secondhand and vintage stores in the region, the My Vintage Town guide makes it incredibly easy to shop secondhand and give presents this year that don’t cost the earth.

Showcasing over 80 vintage and antique stores, 30 retro cocktail bars and traditional pubs, 15 heritage accommodation options, 50 op shops, 15 vintage markets, 20 heritage sites, 7 secondhand bookshops, 6 high tea hangouts and 1 vintage railway there is something to interest everyone!

The free handy handbag sized guide perfect as a sustainable shopping companion or a stocking stuffer this Christmas will launch at K Road’s famous street party, First Thursday’s, on the 6th December. Following the launch, it will be available from vintage retailers, boutique hotels, cafes and heritage houses around the Auckland region just in time for the festive season.

Published by The Metropolitan Club, the My Vintage Town series of guides were borne from a love of op-shopping and providing a sustainable alternative to fast fashion and mass produced goods. Publisher, Rose Jackson, says;

“We are so fortunate to share these fantastic independent businesses through our guides that care about our environment, about reusing and recycling, and about providing retail options that don’t involve mass production or harm to people. We love promoting them and providing an ethical and sustainable option for Christmas gift giving!”

The United Nations Environment programme has recently released figures about the global fashion industry which claims it produces 20 per cent of global wastewater and 10 per cent of global carbon emissions, and according to The Formary, a Wellington based textile research and development company, New Zealanders spend $4 billion on domestic clothing each year.

It’s clear from these statistics that consumers need to radically alter patterns of consumption to ensure the survival of the planet. If consumers made the decision to shop secondhand even 50% of the time, it would have an incredibly positive impact on the environment and reduce the need for so many resources to be diverted into the manufacturing process.

Aside from the obvious environmental benefits that come with secondhand shopping, it’s also hugely fun and far more rewarding to treasure hunt for unique, oneofakind presents for loved ones, and for yourself! Be a conscious consumer this Christmas and get your hands on a My Vintage Town Auckland guide today.

"Youthful determination inspires candidate for Paekawakawa



Sustainable business champion Laurie Foon has launched her campaign for Wellington City Council’s Paekawakawa/Southern Ward as a Green party candidate.

She says a “youthful determination for change” is behind her decision to stand – that of the next generation.

“I have two daughters who are strong advocates for the environment. They are among the climate change debate and their passion and resolve, along with that of their peers, was what inspired me to stand for council.

“I feel like if I’m in a position to make a change then I should do it not just for my family but for my community.”

After polling high in the 2017 Southern Ward by-election, Foon has made the decision to restand on the Green party ticket, following David Lee’s decision to stand down after six years on council.

Foon says the Greens’ local election campaign for a future for our children and their children and a promise to make Wellington one of the greenest cities in the world aligns closely with her own values and vision, and she is privileged to have the opportunity to fill Lee’s shoes.

Lee says that in standing down, he is proud to back Laurie Foon as Paekawakawa/Southern Ward candidate.

“Laurie is that rare blend – she works constructively alongside people of all stripes, offers a solid business focus and is a strong advocate for sustainable practice. She’s a hard worker and brings great energy, passion and heart to all that she does. Laurie will be an exceptional councillor for Wellington City.”

A resident of Berhampore for 20 years, Foon founded iconic New Zealand fashion label Starfish in the 1990s, running the business for 20 years as a pioneer of eco-friendly conscious fashion. She is currently Regional Manager for the Sustainable Business Network.

Foon says she holds tight to her vision for Wellington as the coolest little sustainable capital in the world and her priorities for council reflect this.

“We need to transition to a low carbon future that cares for people, supports local businesses and regenerates the environment.”

That means working towards zero waste by creating circular systems to reuse resources not create landfill says Foon.

“Let’s make organic waste kerbside collection by council a reality and divert that waste to urban farms to grow food not landfill. And let’s become a single-use plastic free city, starting with stopping single-use plastic at council facilities, venues and events.

A low carbon economy is also a focus, with Foon calling for greater council investment in social enterprises, local and sustainable businesses, and support through buy local and sustainable procurement policies.

Foon is passionate about future-proofing Wellington by ensuring urban growth integrates energy efficiency, water sensitive design, urban greening, safer cycling, EVs and car sharing.

“I’m standing for a future I want our children to inherit. Let’s make good things happen.”

"MPs are demanding a 'fast fashion' tax on retailers such as Boohoo and ASOS to help deal with waste generated by the industry thanks to a throwaway clothes culture.

The charge would amount to 1p per item and would fund the collection and recycling of the £140million worth of clothes discarded by Britons every year.

Politicians also want schools to teach children how to make and repair garments in a return to the 'make do and mend' approach from the Second World War.

Rubbish dumped on a road in between Merthyr Tydfil and Cwm Bargoed in South Wales

They hope lessons on designing and fixing clothes would help encourage children to keep wearing old clothes and help anxious teenagers be creative.

The MPs across all parties on the Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) told how they want pupils to be 'taught the joy' of how to repair their own clothes.

The report says: 'We recommend that lessons on designing, creating, mending and repairing clothes be included in schools at Key Stage 2 and 3.

'The creative satisfaction of designing and repairing clothing can offer an antidote to the growing anxiety and mental health issues among teenagers.'

Experts estimate the levy could raise £35million a year towards the cost of dealing with this vast mountain of fast fashion waste thanks to throwaway clothes.

Politicians want a return to the 'make do and mend' approach from the Second World War

The MPs say the tax system should be reformed to reward companies offering clothing repairs and using sustainable materials such as wool.

Britons buy around 1.1million tons of new clothing each year – equating to 26.7kg per person – in a fast fashion culture fuelled by online retails such as Boohoo and ASOS, which sell dresses for as little as £5.

Around 430,000 tons is thrown in household bins, most of which goes to landfill, while many fast fashion items – from socks to dresses – are made from plastic and shed billions of polluting particles into sewers, rivers and seas when washed.

The Daily Mail has led the way in highlighting the scourge of global plastic pollution with its Turn The Tide On Plastic campaign and next month's Great British Spring Clean, which has already recruited 95,989 volunteers to help clean up Britain in a nationwide litter-pick.

Boohoo did not comment on the idea of a fashion tax, but said it supports recycling. A publicity photo for its clothing is pictured

Chairman of the EAC, Mary Creagh MP, said: 'Fashion shouldn't cost the earth.

Labour MP Mary Creagh, who chairs the Environmental Audit Committee, is demanding a 1p tax on each item of clothing

'Our insatiable appetite for clothes comes with a huge social and environmental price tag. Carbon emissions, water use, chemical and plastic pollution are all destroying our environment.'

Just this week, ministers announced a consultation on a scheme that would hit companies using packaging that is difficult to reuse or recycl with fees under what is called the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) system.

Miss Creagh said this same principle should be applied to clothing, adding: 'Fashion retailers must take responsibility for the clothes they produce.'

Boohoo did not comment on the idea of a fashion tax, but said it supports recycling. A spokesman said: 'We continue to consider how best we can ensure our businesses operate in a way that promotes the sustainability of fashion.'

Alan Wheeler, of the Textile Recycling Association, backed the levy, saying: 'By putting a levy of 1p on each garment sold in the UK, we could raise £35million annually, which could fund much-needed research and development projects.'

Lee Lucas, principal of the Fashion Retail Academy, told MailOnline: 'It's important that retailers are taking steps to cut back on their carbon footprints.

'Schemes that incentivise customers to return to stores with used clothes, such as M&S offering vouchers for secondhand garments, are helping to change the psychology around how we shop.'"
"Plastic can holders and shrinkwrap are to be removed from multipacks of Guinness, its owner, Diageo, will announce on Monday.

Diageo is phasing out plastic packaging from multipacks of its Guinness, Harp, Rockshore and Smithwick’s beers and replacing it with 100% recyclable and biodegradable cardboard packs.

The new packaging will appear on shelves in Ireland in August, followed by the UK and other international markets in 2020. Individual cans are already fully recyclable, including the widget inside cans of Draught Guinness that creates its creamy head.

Diageo said it is investing £16m to reduce the amount of plastic used in its beer packaging as part of a drive to create more sustainable packaging in the war against single-use plastics. Less than 5% of its packaging is plastic and the company said the move would further reduce usage by more than 400 tonnes annually, the equivalent of 40m 50cl plastic bottles.

“For 260 years Guinness has played a vital role in the communities around us,” said Mark Sandys, the global head of beer at Diageo. “We already have one of the most sustainable breweries in the world at St James’s Gate [in Dublin] and we are now leading the way in sustainable packaging. This is good news for the brand, for our wider beer portfolio and for the environment.”

Plastic pack rings, known in the industry as hi-cones or yokes, are connected rings used to hold together multipacks of canned drinks, particularly beers. A standard packaging device for more than 50 years, they have become an environmental scourge by contributing to growing ocean plastic pollution and posing a threat to marine life.

Last year, in a quest to find an alternative, Carlsberg announced plans to replace the rings with recyclable glue. It is phasing in a “snap pack”, which it said will reduce the amount of plastic used in traditional multipacks by as much as 76%. In the UK the change will initially involve Carlsberg Export but the company said the pack will eventually be used across its entire drinks portfolio, including Tuborg and San Miguel.

Meanwhile, the beer brand Corona has started piloting plastic-free six-pack rings made from plant-based biodegradable fibres. They will be introduced in its home market of Tulum, Mexico, followed by the UK.

Plastic waste has become a pressing issue, with TV programmes such as Blue Planet II exposing its impact on the oceans. Regular warnings are also made about the dangers of a global plastic binge.

Dr Sue Kinsey, a senior pollution policy officer with the Marine Conservation Society, said: “These kinds of can yokes are regularly found in small numbers on our beach cleans. During last year’s Great British Beach Clean we found around 100 over one weekend. They are a hazard to wildlife, which can get entangled in them. Any steps taken to stop the flow of plastics to our oceans are to be welcomed.”

David Cutter, Diageo’s chief sustainability officer and president, global supply and procurement, added: “Great packaging is essential for our products. Consumers expect our packs to look beautiful, be functional, and sustainable. I am proud to announce this investment, through which we have been able to combine all three.

“We have been working tirelessly to make our packaging more environmentally friendly and I’m thrilled with this outcome for Guinness and our other global beer brands.”

"The National Trust is seeking alternatives to the fleeces worn by its 10,000 employees, amid rising concerns over the shedding of plastic microfibres and their harm to the environment.

Recent studies have shown that garments made from polyester, including fleeces, shed hundreds of thousands of tiny fibres every time they are washed, polluting waterways and ending up in the digestive systems of birds and aquatic animals.

These plastic fibres have also been found in common food items, from seafood to table salt and honey.

Under review: The National Trust is reviewing the use of fleeces worn by its staff amid rising concerns over the shedding of tiny plastic microfibres which are harming the environment

Now the conservation charity, which also sells fleece items to its 5 million members, is reviewing the use of these potentially polluting materials.

In a statement, the National Trust said: 'As a conservation charity we're committed to finding ways to help our members and supporters reduce their environmental impact.

'We have responsible sourcing standards for all our products – which set out what we expect on quality, packaging, environmental management and social responsibility, as well as material specific standards - and we work with suppliers to ensure that sustainable and well managed standards are in place.'

The National Trust fleeces are worn by 10,000 staff, while fleece items are sold in 17 shops

A study by Italian scientists published last December found that up to 300 fibres per litre escape in the waste water from family washing machines and that synthetic clothing is 16 times more damaging for the environment than microbeads.

The Italian National Research Council also found that just one 5kg (11lbs) load of washing can create 6 million to 17.7 million plastic microfibres.

Part of the solution, say experts, is to use liquid detergents which cause less friction and break off fewer fibres, and to put on shorter washes at lower temperatures.

Ahead of this week's meeting at the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Melik Demirel, professor of materials science at Penn State University, laid out the dire effects of microplastics on the environment.

Speaking to The Times, he said: 'Microplastics are harmful to our ocean and aquatic life.

'Ingesting them can prevent animals from consuming their natural prey, leading to starvation and even death.

'We have to minimise the use of polyester.'

Waterways are being polluted by millions of tonnes of plastic, including tiny microfibres

More than 1,500 companies represented by the the European Outdoor Group (EOG), and the Outdoor Industry Association (OIA), including fleece manufacturers such as North Face, Jack Wolfskin and Patagonia, said in a joint statement:

'We believe it is our responsibility to support and facilitate a unified effort among our member companies – as well as among other key industries and sectors, including the fashion industry, the textile industry, chemical manufacturers, the home appliance industry, and water treatment facilities – to drive the collection of data that is necessary to better understand the sources and causes of microfibre release, and to implement appropriate solutions that are based on sound science.

'As such, the global outdoor industry is working collaboratively to coordinate its actions on the microfibre shedding challenge...to gather the data needed to make more informed decisions about the fabrics and fibres being used to make products.'"
"South Asian Fashion Week

When: March 1-3, 2019

Where: Plaza of Nations, Vancouver

More info: www.safw.ca

Who says Indian fashion is just about a lehenga anymore? The transition and fusion of South Asian fashion from Bollywood to Hollywood, and some designers gaining an edge on the global platform, has opened doors for everyone.

Come March, Vancouverites will have a chance to have a closer look at what Indian, Pakistani and local South Asian designers have to offer the fashionistas here at the South Asian Fashion Week.

Running from March 1 to 3 at the Plaza of Nations, the opening event will fire up the runway with a gala featuring Indian luxury fashion brand Falguni Shane Peacock, according to a news release.

“Priyanka Chopra, Lady Gaga, Rihanna, Beyoncé and many Bollywood celebrities have worn couture pieces by Falguni Shane Peacock,” said SAFW cofounder Cindy Khella. “At SAFW, our goal is to showcase the versatility of South Asian fashion.”

Chopra is known to have rocked Falguni Shane Peacock bridal couture at a reception following her nuptials with Nick Jonas, while Beyoncé looked dazzling in a biscotti-hued gown by the designers at a private concert in India during Isha Ambani’s wedding celebrations.

“We invited the designer duo behind Falguni Shane Peacock to open the runway show because of their seamless ability to blend Western cuts with Indian embellishments,” said Khella. “We’re honoured to host the brand’s first runway show in Canada.”

The three-day event will feature creations by local South Asian designers and brands, as well as Pakistani designer Deepak Perwani. Guests will also be able to enjoy some South Asian food at the cafe or purchase local, independent clothing, jewelry and beauty brands during the event.

“Visible representation matters, and clothes are one of the best ways to showcase a touch of culture,” said SAFW cofounder Farah Hasan. “We feel so proud when we see South Asian clothing on people from various cultural backgrounds.”

“By celebrating South Asian fashion on the runway, we hope that our non-South Asian friends will feel inspired to add South Asian pieces to their wardrobes from local designers and boutiques.”

Here’s a list of the designers who will showcase their collections at the SAFW:

• Falguni Shane Peacock (India)

• Deepak Perwani (Pakistan)

• Armaan DBG

• Bombay Couture

• City Lux

• Don’t Doze MIL

• Heran Design

• House of Raina

• In Vogue Fashion Haus

• Lux Collection

• Market Clothing

• Maynn Men

• Mehnaz Fine Jewels

• Wellgroomed

• Sim & Saara"
"MPs are demanding a 'fast fashion' tax on retailers such as Boohoo and ASOS to help deal with waste generated by the industry thanks to a throwaway clothes culture.

The charge would amount to 1p per item and would fund the collection and recycling of the £140million worth of clothes discarded by Britons every year.

Politicians also want schools to teach children how to make and repair garments in a return to the 'make do and mend' approach from the Second World War.

Rubbish dumped on a road in between Merthyr Tydfil and Cwm Bargoed in South Wales

They hope lessons on designing and fixing clothes would help encourage children to keep wearing old clothes and help anxious teenagers be creative.

The MPs across all parties on the Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) told how they want pupils to be 'taught the joy' of how to repair their own clothes.

The report says: 'We recommend that lessons on designing, creating, mending and repairing clothes be included in schools at Key Stage 2 and 3.

'The creative satisfaction of designing and repairing clothing can offer an antidote to the growing anxiety and mental health issues among teenagers.'

A compactor moves rubbish on a landfill tip in Dorset as the UK faces a mounting problem

Experts estimate the levy could raise £35million a year towards the cost of dealing with this vast mountain of fast fashion waste thanks to throwaway clothes.

Politicians want a return to the 'make do and mend' approach from the Second World War

The MPs say the tax system should be reformed to reward companies offering clothing repairs and using sustainable materials such as wool.

Britons buy around 1.1million tons of new clothing each year – equating to 26.7kg per person – in a fast fashion culture fuelled by online retails such as Boohoo and ASOS, which sell dresses for as little as £5.

Around 430,000 tons is thrown in household bins, most of which goes to landfill, while many fast fashion items – from socks to dresses – are made from plastic and shed billions of polluting particles into sewers, rivers and seas when washed.

The Daily Mail has led the way in highlighting the scourge of global plastic pollution with its Turn The Tide On Plastic campaign and next month's Great British Spring Clean, which has already recruited 95,989 volunteers to help clean up Britain in a nationwide litter-pick.

Boohoo did not comment on the idea of a fashion tax, but said it supports recycling. A publicity photo for its clothing is pictured

Chairman of the EAC, Mary Creagh MP, said: 'Fashion shouldn't cost the earth.

Labour MP Mary Creagh, who chairs the Environmental Audit Committee, is demanding a 1p tax on each item of clothing

'Our insatiable appetite for clothes comes with a huge social and environmental price tag. Carbon emissions, water use, chemical and plastic pollution are all destroying our environment.'

Just this week, ministers announced a consultation on a scheme that would hit companies using packaging that is difficult to reuse or recycl with fees under what is called the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) system.

Miss Creagh said this same principle should be applied to clothing, adding: 'Fashion retailers must take responsibility for the clothes they produce.'

Boohoo did not comment on the idea of a fashion tax, but said it supports recycling. A spokesman said: 'We continue to consider how best we can ensure our businesses operate in a way that promotes the sustainability of fashion.'

Alan Wheeler, of the Textile Recycling Association, backed the levy, saying: 'By putting a levy of 1p on each garment sold in the UK, we could raise £35million annually, which could fund much-needed research and development projects.'

Lee Lucas, principal of the Fashion Retail Academy, told MailOnline: 'It's important that retailers are taking steps to cut back on their carbon footprints.

'Schemes that incentivise customers to return to stores with used clothes, such as M&S offering vouchers for secondhand garments, are helping to change the psychology around how we shop.'"

HOW MUCH RECYCLING ENDS UP IN LANDFILL? Every day, millions of us drop a plastic bottle or cardboard container into the recycling bin - and we feel we’re doing our bit for the environment. But what we may not realise is that most plastic never gets recycled at all, often ending up in landfill or incineration depots instead. Of 30 billion plastic bottles used by UK households each year, only 57 per cent are currently recycled, with half going to landfill, half go to waste. Most plastic never gets recycled at all, often ending up in landfill or incineration depots instead. Around 700,000 plastic bottles a day end up as litter Around 700,000 plastic bottles a day end up as litter. This is largely due to plastic wrapping around bottles that are non-recyclable. Every year, the UK throws away 2.5 billion ‘paper’ cups, amounting to 5,000 cups a minute. Shockingly, less than 0.4 per cent of these are recycled. Most cups are made from cardboard with a thin layer of plastic. This lining keeps your coffee warm and stops the cardboard going soggy, but also makes the cup almost impossible to recycle.

"Hats are hip. And we’re not just talking about athleisure-approved baseball caps.

Bold, structured styles are making a comeback thanks to imagery-heavy online brands and social media influencers. And, one such brand behind the return of these toppers is Heirloom Hats.

The Montreal-based company creates chic styles that are meant to be worn now — and then passed on to future generations. From trendy turbans to wide-brim fedoras, the handmade creations mix traditional styles with luxurious materials, each one with a slight twist (think: bold electric-blue hues and faces embroidered on pillbox styles).

We caught up with Samantha-Tara Mainville, the founder and milliner, behind the brand to learn more.

Q. When and why did you start Heirloom Hats?

A. I’ve been sewing since the age of eight, and for as long as I can remember, I’ve always wanted to one day have my own fashion brand. I did a one-year stint in fashion design at Lasalle College, and then did a pattern design class at Metier des Faubourgs. I felt like the fashion clothing market was saturated and decided to try jewelry making. I started a class, and realized that I had a profound love for textiles and that I needed to work with textiles rather than metal and stones. However, I really enjoyed working on a smaller piece, as opposed to clothing. I’ve always loved hats, and had been collecting them for a long time and suddenly it made sense. It was like an epiphany, and I decided to look into millinery and fell in love with the process instantly. It took me four years to feel comfortable enough to finally start Heirloom in September of 2015.

Q. Is there a story behind the name?

A. Making hats the traditional way is an art form. I wanted the name to reflect what the end product is. A good hat is something that becomes a part of you and that you can pass on to the next generation. A hat that will stand the test of time.

Q. What makes it different from other hat companies?

A. It depends if you are comparing it to mass-produced, versus other handmade hats. I think that my hats are quirky, yet simple — I don’t like to embellish too much. I focus on the shape of the hat, the textures, and making it long-lasting. I’m a little rough with my own things, so I basically make them for me!

Q. And who is your target customer?

A. I would say that my target customer is a young professional working in a creative field. Someone that isn’t afraid to look different, and that can do so by doing a job that offers that kind of liberty.

Q. Where are your hats designed/made?

A. I make every single one of my hat with my own two hands.

Q. And where can people check them out?

A. Through my website at heirloomhats.com, as well as at a few stockists listed on my website.

Q. What’s the price range for your designs?

A. It can vary between $78 and $450.

Q. Do you have any plans to branch out beyond hats?

A. I have collaborated with Montreal Designer Noemiah on a clothing collection coming out next fall. Aside from that, I don’t have any plans to, but you never know.

Q. Lastly, what do you love most about hats?

A. They are the first thing you see when you meet someone, and they are almost always and conversation starter.

"Hong Kong Fairs for Houseware, Home Textiles, Gifts in April

April is one of the peak seasons in Hong Kong for exhibitions and sourcing, with the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) presenting four major international trade fairs in the latter half of the month. The HKTDC Hong Kong Houseware Fair and HKTDC Hong Kong International Home Textiles and Furnishings Fair will be held from 20 to 23 April at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre (HKCEC). They will be followed on 27-30 April by the HKTDC Hong Kong Gifts & Premium Fair, also held at the HKCEC, and the Hong Kong International Printing & Packaging Fair, jointly organised with CIEC Exhibition Co (HK) Ltd and held at AsiaWorld-Expo. Some 7,400 exhibitors from 35 countries and regions will present their products and services at these signature promotion and sourcing platforms.

Enormous potential in houseware and gifts

According to figures published by research institute Statista, global revenue in the furniture and homeware segment is expected to top US$226.5 billion in 2019, with a projected annual growth rate of 10.6% until 2023. The global figure is expected to climb to US$338.3 billion by 2023, with Mainland China becoming the largest market, generating approximately US$78.7 billion. Hong Kong's exports of houseware products reached HK$351.1 billion in 2018, up 24% on the previous year, with the United States, the mainland and Japan continuing as the city's largest export markets. In the gifts and premium segment, Hong Kong's exports totalled HK$161.2 billion in 2018, up 6% on the previous year. The long and illustrious history of the Houseware Fair and Gifts & Premium Fair is a testament to Hong Kong's pivotal position in the global houseware, gifts and premiums industries.

Asia's leading show of its kind, the Houseware Fair will feature 2,160 exhibitors from 27 countries and regions this year, while the concurrent Home Textiles Fair will bring together about 310 exhibitors from seven countries and regions. At the Gifts & Premium Fair, the world's largest event of its kind, a record 4,380 exhibitors from 30 countries and regions will attend. The Printing & Packaging Fair, held in parallel with the Gifts & Premium Fair, will welcome nearly 500 exhibitors from six countries and regions. In addition, the HKTDC will organise 300 buying missions, comprising more than 14,600 companies from around the world, to visit the fairs. The four fairs will offer an ideal trading platform for industry professionals looking to expand their footprint in the mainland and global markets.

All eyes on the Startup Zones, where local innovations go global

Innovation and technology (I&T) has been made a cornerstone of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area development, and nurturing start-ups is an integral part of the process. Startup Zones have become an important element of the HKTDC's fairs.

Benjamin Chau, HKTDC Deputy Executive Director, said: ""The power of Asian start-ups should not be underestimated. Start-ups in Hong Kong have blossomed over the past two years. With an aim to promote entrepreneurial innovation and the sustained development of corporations, the HKTDC will continue to support start-ups and set up Startup Zones at nine of its large-scale events, including this year's Houseware Fair and Gifts & Premium Fair."" During the two fairs, the HKTDC will organise multiple Startup, Smart Launch sessions at which start-ups can introduce their businesses concepts and products to industry professionals to generate more business opportunities.

This year's Houseware Fair will see 28 start-ups from Hong Kong, the mainland, Indonesia and the Philippines. They include Hong Kong's SPACEPLAN, an online platform that provides one-stop interior design solutions and encourages local interior designers and young designers to launch their own businesses. At the Gifts & Premium Fair, 34 start-ups from Hong Kong, the mainland, Indonesia, the Philippines, the Netherlands and Taiwan will be on site. One Taiwanese start-up, Muherz, will introduce its Cubiio Portable Laser Engraver, the most compact device of its type which can be controlled by an app.

Smart and stylish solutions to enhance quality of life

Smart technologies are now becoming part of our daily lives. At the Houseware Fair, an exhibitor from the mainland will present its KIGI Food Storage Container. The product comes with an app that reminds consumers of the use-by date of the food in the container and will even offer recipe suggestions using that type of food as an ingredient. A Hong Kong exhibitor, meanwhile, will showcase its SmartBowl for pets, which enables owners to keep track of their pets' daily calorie consumption. At a 23 April seminar, speakers from IKEA and Euromonitor International will share their insights on trends and developments in smart and eco living.

L.I.F.E - affirming products on show at Houseware Fair

This year's Houseware Fair will continue to adopt the main theme of L.I.F.E. - representing ""Lifestyle"", ""Interior"", ""Feast"" and ""Enrich"". ""Lifestyle"" will cover exquisite dining, home decor and eco-friendly houseware products. ""Interior"" refers to elegant interior designs, and will see the debut of a Candles and Scenes zone. An array of cooking and dining tools will be featured under the ""Feast"" theme, while ""Enrich"" will spotlight such quality-of-life-enhancing products as pet supplies, baby products, gardening supplies and beauty and healthcare products.

To highlight the four themes, the HKTDC has teamed up with WGSN, a world-renowned trend forecasting authority, to set up an on-site display featuring new concepts and highlighting key lifestyle and interior trends for Spring/Summer 2020. WGSN will also host a seminar to examine the upcoming colours, fabrics, shapes and moods.

Home Textiles Fair showcases quality Asian products

Multiple pavilions will dot the fairground of the Home Textiles Fair, including those presented by three of India's largest chambers of commerce for the textiles industry - the Handloom Export Promotion Council (HEPC), Export Promotion Council for Handicrafts (EPCH) and the Carpet Export Promotion Council (CEPC). The pavilions will be dedicated to showcasing fine home textiles products from across South Asia. In addition, Zhejiang, one of Mainland China's major home textiles manufacturing bases, will present two pavilions to display Zhejiang's traditional quality bedding products provided by companies from the town of Zhouquan and Pujiang county. A total of seven thematic zones will be featured at the fair, including the Hall of Glamour, Bathroom & Kitchen Textiles and Baby & Bedroom Textiles.

World of Beauty, Fitness & Well-being zone added to Gifts & Premium Fair

The world's largest Gifts & Premium Fair will see the World of Beauty, Fitness & Well-being zone make its debut. The zone will feature close to 40 exhibitors from the mainland, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, India and New Zealand showcasing cosmetics, skincare, health and spa products. Highlight zone the Hall of Fine Designs will display more than 140 brands from around the world, including Team Green, a Hong Kong brand that specialises in eco-friendly 3D puzzles; Kokuyo, a revered Japanese stationery brand; and Pininfarina, an Italian brand known for its creative stationery. In addition, the Hong Kong Exporters' Association, the co-organiser of the fair, will present a pavilion with three zones - Isle of Originality, Brand Oasis and Smart Design HK - featuring more than 170 quality Hong Kong gift exporters. Other pavilions include those from the mainland, Taiwan, India, Korea, Thailand and the United Kingdom. Multiple seminars will also be held during the fair, covering topics that include the new retail trends in the US and the mainland, and data-driven brand-building strategies.

Printing & Packaging Fair spotlights eco-friendly products and new materials

Held at AsiaWorld-Expo, this year's Hong Kong International Printing & Packaging Fair will feature four major thematic zones - De Luxe, Green Printing & Packaging Solutions, Printing & Packaging Solutions for Fashion & Accessories and Innovative Retail Display Solutions - and will also mark the debut of the World of Advertising and Signs zone to showcase creative visual communication and promotion approaches. An exhibitor, Hong Kong Media By Phone Co, will showcase its Droptix display panel, which can enhance displays, packaging, posters and POS (point-of-sale) items with an eye-catching 3D (three-dimensional) effect.

The emphasis on corporate social responsibility in recent years has spawned an assortment of eco-friendly materials. Taiwanese exhibitor Haurtyi Paper Bag Co Ltd will display its Stone Paper Bag made using a new mineral powder that's more environmentally friendly than traditional paper.

A series of seminars will also be organised during the Printing & Packaging Fair, including sessions entitled ""Embrace Opportunities in Greater Bay Area: Certification and Training Services in Hong Kong's Graphic Arts Industries"" and ""New Development and Application of Wide Gamut Colour Printing"".

"“When you think about it, polyester is a manmade yarn, and what we use is manmade, too,” says Yan. “Sustainability is important to us, of course, but first and foremost we are a performance brand. Our clothing has to do its job and make people feel good when they’re going for a run or going to the gym. We’ve found that sweet spot.”

So too has Running Bare, the veteran Australian activewear brand that this year celebrates its 36th birthday.

Yolanda Powell, creative director of Running Bare and daughter of company founders Brian and Corin Powell, pioneered the use of seaweed in activewear in Australia. Like Nimble, Running Bare has long used recycled PET bottles in its products, but in 2018 the company began using RB Seacell, a fibre made with 70 per cent recycled polyester (from PET bottles), 24 per cent seacell (a fibre derived from seaweed harvested in Iceland) and 6 per cent elastane.

“Our factory in Taiwan told me about the seaweed yarn,” says Powell. “I was immediately like, ‘show me, show me!’ They hadn’t used it in activewear, but I thought we have to try. It’s great because there are a lot of rules about harvesting the seaweed and using it; you can only cut it at a certain time, every three or four years, and at a certain point in the plant, so it can regenerate, and then when it’s dried out, they don’t use any chemicals.

“We decided to make it even more complicated by combining it with recycled polyester because I always think we can make things better and more sustainable. The leggings feel beautiful and they’ve been really popular.”

First introduced in Running Bare’s 2018 collection, they’re now a core part of the range.

Traditionally activewear is pretty bad for the environment,” says Powell. “There are plenty of easy, cheap alternatives you can use, like Lycra. Most activewear is polyester-based and that uses a lot of oil, water and dyes.”

Running Bare – which produces 70 per cent of its wares in Sydney – is “all about the fabric"", she says. “If you don’t get that right from the beginning there’s not much point in doing anything else.”

The newest player in the sustainable activewear game is MORE Body, founded by Melinda O’Rourke, who has spent her career working in luxury fashion for the likes of Chanel, Yves Saint Laurent and Prada. A Pilates devotee and qualified teacher, O’Rourke noticed a gap in the market for high-performing, luxury Pilates and yoga wear made of sustainable materials.

MORE Body’s range is made largely of Econyl and bamboo. Econyl is a stretchy fabric – perfect for activewear – that is manufactured with recycled nylon from reclaimed fishing nets and carpet tufting. You might already wear it – it’s the same fabric Nike uses to create its signature Flyknit sneakers. Bamboo, as with like cotton, is soft and moisture-wicking, but uses far less water during production.

O’Rourke hopes her range, which will be stocked online, at David Jones and Mode Sportif in Sydney, will educate customers about the importance of buying well.

“My experience in luxury fashion has shown me that people will pay for beauty,” she says. “And if they like it that first time, they’ll come back for it.” She plans not to discount, as it “goes against my ethos of sustainability. If I’m really true about sustainability, I don’t want to be pushing things out to people every day.”

O’Rourke also has an end-of-life strategy for the clothes. “I’ve asked my factory to keep all the fabric offcuts, and I’m working on a product that will incorporate them,” she says.

Customers will also be encouraged to send back old or damaged clothing, which O’Rourke hopes to transform into patchwork-style bags. As well as Econyl, O’Rourke is looking into sustainable materials made with corn and hemp. Though these raw materials are “like, double” the cost, she remains committed to them. It’s a different kind of luxury, she says, to be able to use materials that are sustainable and better for the planet.

Another Sydney brand, Bella Eco, produces underwear and singlets for yoga and Pilates from the world’s first sustainable nylon, Amni Soul Eco, which breaks down in just five years (as opposed to 200), decomposing into biomass and biogas in the same way cotton does. It too, is far more expensive than traditional nylon, but for founder Michel Schuhmacher, it’s well worth the cost.

Bella Eco produces underwear and singlets for yoga and Pilates. Supplied

“The material is high-performing, comfy and best of all, doesn't slip,"" says Schuhmacher. ""They’re perfect for being active and they’re good for the planet. Why wouldn’t I pay that little bit more?”

For these brands, packaging is another issue. Most online retailers ship their clothes in plastic, which is not an option for eco-minded suppliers. Nimble’s products arrive in biodegradable packaging while Bella Eco’s come in chic cardboard envelopes. MORE Body products are shipped in recycled tissue, with a sticker made of biodegradable resin, packed in a compostable cornstarch bag (if you don’t have a compost bin, just throw it on your garden and watch it break down).

Of course, the fashion industry, which is often called out for its destructive effect on the planet, will never truly be “sustainable” – and that’s something each of these business owners is aware of. After all, as Schuhmacher says, “The only way to be truly pure is to grow your own cotton, and nobody’s doing that.”

It’s a feeling echoed at Nimble. “As a company we are not truly sustainable,” says Yan. “We have a long way to go. But we have goals. And ideas. And that’s a start.”"
"I'm talking, of course, about the move to a more sustainable and earth-friendly way of living. Everything from how we clean, heat and light our homes to how we decorate them is changing. There's no need to feel the weight of saving the world on your shoulders or feel guilty for enjoying the odd frivolous purchase. But implementing a few small changes now can not only make your home and living space look better but can save you money too.

Siobhan Elsom runs earthmother.ie, an online store for all sorts of sustainable goods. She says, ""There are some easy swaps that people can make in the kitchen to save a multitude of clingfilm and tin foil going to landfill, like the Stasher bag - a reusable Ziploc bag made from 100pc pure silicone that can be used for storing food in the fridge or freezer, can also be used for cooking, microwaving and packing lunches or for snacks on the go.""

But one of her recommendations is particularly surprising. ""I think the biggest and healthiest swap people can make to their home environment is to cut down on toxic cleaning products that aren't good for people or the planet.""

Irish Mammies and Daddies whose worst fear is leaving the immersion on would be wise to research Hive Home's selection of products. By installing smart switches, you can control your lighting, heating and security settings from the Hive Home app on your smartphone.

This means less energy wasted and, instead, a sophisticated home energy system that makes sense for the environment as well as your pocket.

Many of the large-scale interior brands such as IKEA, H&M and new online store SODA are making changes to their production lines and manufacturing products that are more eco-friendly, but so too are smaller domestic companies.

Take Dublin-based interior shop Home|Lust, founded and owned by Diana Valentine: ""I've made a conscious decision to move away from trendy, fast interiors and concentrate on sourcing versatile furniture made from durable materials, ideally products that can be recycled or re-purposed down the line.

""Some of our bestsellers are hanging and lounging chairs made from ethically-sourced Indonesian rattan harvested from FSC-certified sustainable sources.""

When it comes to making more conscious choices for your interiors, look to natural materials, suggests Diana.

""Rattan, like bamboo, is a fast-growing, renewable, multi-purpose wood that is light, durable, flexible, and also suitable for outdoor use. It's like nature's plastic.""

Whether you make energy-saving investments, clean up your act when it comes to detergents and bleaches or treat yourself to a new bamboo toothbrush, it's the small but meaningful changes to living that are really 'in' this season.

"Major brands’ refusal to use sustainable materials is having a devastating impact on forests and climate, new report says

We’re all becoming more aware about the damage single-use plastics and fast fashion has on the environment. Yet there is one product we all throw away every single day that, so far, has not been a major part of conversations about sustainability: toilet paper.

The new household rules: ditch your toilet brush and wash much, much more Read more

But America’s heavy use of toilet paper – particularly the pillowy soft kind – is worsening climate change and taking “a dramatic and irreversible toll” on forests, especially the Canadian boreal forest, according to a new report by two major environmental groups, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and Stand.earth.

The boreal forest covers almost 60% of Canada and is home to 600 indigenous communities. Its huge size means it can absorb large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, the equivalent to the annual emissions of 24m cars each year.

The report found that major brands’ refusal to switch to sustainable materials in toilet paper is having a devastating impact on forests and climate. About 28m acres of Canadian boreal forest have been cut down since 1996, an area the size of Pennsylvania. Virgin pulp, the key ingredient in toilet paper, accounted for 23% of Canada’s forest product exports.

Americans are particularly to blame for this crisis. They make up just over 4% of the world’s population, yet account for more than 20% of global tissue consumption. The average four-person household in the US uses over 100lb of toilet paper a year.

Major toilet paper brands have refused to use more sustainable materials, the report says, because Americans tend to more concerned than the rest of the world about ideal toilet paper texture in their homes, largely due to decades of marketing around toilet paper softness.

Previous reports into the environmental impact of toilet paper have found American desire for super-soft multi-ply toilet paper to be “worse than Hummers” for the environment.

Are there any options out there to prevent this destruction? Well, in ancient Rome they used a sponge on a stick, which they would then leave in a pot of vinegar to be used again. The Talmud, the central text of Jewish law, prescribes a handful of gravel, with stones to be “the size of an olive, a nut and an egg” for greatest effectiveness.

Fortunately, we are unlikely to have to resort to such measures. Not all toilet paper is equally damaging and many manufacturers are already making more environmentally friendly products using recycled materials.

The authors offer a scorecard system to rate the brands that have the biggest environmental impact. It’s mostly the big brands of quilted paper that score badly, with Charmin Ultra Soft, Kirkland Signature and Angel Soft all receiving F grades because they contain little or no recycled material. Brands that use recycled paper, such as Seventh Generation and Natural Value, received an A grade.

Notably they say that “recycled materials are more commonly used in away-from-home tissue brands, like those found at offices or airports, where marketing for softness is less crucial”. So next time you’re greeted at the departure gate by toilet paper with a texture similar to a handful of gravel, you can take solace in the fact you’re saving the forests.

• This article was amended on 5 March 2019. Twenty-eight million acres of Canadian boreal forest have been cut down since 1996, not annually, as an earlier version said."
"“I always planned to go to university to do photography,” says Ryan Saradjola, a London-based photographer. Despite considering himself not to be very academic, he persevered through college, building a portfolio that landed him a place at the prestigious London College of Fashion (LCF). But after a year at LCF, Saradjola opted out of higher education entirely. Offered the opportunity to work alongside the famous fashion photographer Rankin, he took the leap. “It was an amazing experience,” he says. “I learned so much from that year and a half. Working with his clients, seeing how he worked – the whole process was eye-opening.”

Graduates trapped in unpaid internships, study finds Read more

Saradjola’s hands-on approach led him to further internships, studio work and assisting opportunities. But while industry experience was the foundation of Saradjola’s career, he concedes that it’s not the right route for everyone. “I always wanted to do more hands-on work and get involved straight away, but other people need more time in the studio,” he says.

With nearly half of all young people going to university, it’s clear that for many, it is still a vital part of their creative education. But with the growth in the student population comes academic inflation. Jobs list having a degree as an entry requirement, yet in reality, a degree alone is not a sufficient qualification for many “entry level” jobs. Over a quarter of university graduates have done an unpaid internship in order to “get a foot in the door”, according to the Sutton Trust – and 86% of arts internships are unpaid.

“The issue we have is that there are so many courses – so many graduates – that it’s really hard for employers to identify the ones that are really good and proactive,” says Lesley Peacock, a senior fashion lecturer at Liverpool John Moores University. “If a company advertises an internship, they are awash with applications.”

Some companies are wise to the necessity of internships to bulk up graduates’ CVs. Some take advantage of the abundance of free labour at their disposal, occupying a grey area where employment laws are concerned. As one fashion marketing student currently undertaking a “sandwich year” at a luxury fashion brand says: “I was just rearranging store cupboards, scanning in returns, doing really menial work. And if I ever took a day off, all hell would break loose. They were understaffed so they were using us interns to get the stuff done that nobody else wanted to do.” With only basic expenses covered sporadically, the student was advised to leave the company after explaining they simply couldn’t afford to pay rent in London anymore.

Graduate Helena’s experience in fashion publishing was similar. “There were three other girls interning at the magazine,” she says. “They would get a fresh batch of interns every four weeks. We would be in a tiny little fashion cupboard surrounded by endless samples and returns. It was a lot of work and it made me realise that the magazine couldn’t survive without interns.”

The clothing industry harms the planet. What can fashion students do? Read more

More than ever, students fear for their job prospects and are willing to stretch themselves to gain the contacts they need to progress within the industry. Much like fashion itself, the landscape is varied. Some students return with stories of mistreatment and exploitation. Others recall diligent mentors and invaluable insider experience. But a lack of pay is the common thread, and that fosters an environment which welcomes those with the financial means to work for free and spurns those without.

Could saving on tuition fees and going straight into industry be the solution? While some might be able to secure an internship without a degree – subject to hard work and financial sacrifice – many more would struggle. As Peacock says: “For the 15 years that I’ve worked across textiles, fashion communication and fashion design, all of the graduates that have done really well undertook placements and internships.”"
"Hats are hip. And we’re not just talking about athleisure-approved baseball caps.

Bold, structured styles are making a comeback thanks to imagery-heavy online brands and social media influencers. And, one such brand behind the return of these toppers is Heirloom Hats.

The Montreal-based company creates chic styles that are meant to be worn now — and then passed on to future generations. From trendy turbans to wide-brim fedoras, the handmade creations mix traditional styles with luxurious materials, each one with a slight twist (think: bold electric-blue hues and faces embroidered on pillbox styles).

We caught up with Samantha-Tara Mainville, the founder and milliner, behind the brand to learn more.

Q. When and why did you start Heirloom Hats?

A. I’ve been sewing since the age of eight, and for as long as I can remember, I’ve always wanted to one day have my own fashion brand. I did a one-year stint in fashion design at Lasalle College, and then did a pattern design class at Metier des Faubourgs. I felt like the fashion clothing market was saturated and decided to try jewelry making. I started a class, and realized that I had a profound love for textiles and that I needed to work with textiles rather than metal and stones. However, I really enjoyed working on a smaller piece, as opposed to clothing. I’ve always loved hats, and had been collecting them for a long time and suddenly it made sense. It was like an epiphany, and I decided to look into millinery and fell in love with the process instantly. It took me four years to feel comfortable enough to finally start Heirloom in September of 2015.

Q. Is there a story behind the name?

A. Making hats the traditional way is an art form. I wanted the name to reflect what the end product is. A good hat is something that becomes a part of you and that you can pass on to the next generation. A hat that will stand the test of time.

Q. What makes it different from other hat companies?

A. It depends if you are comparing it to mass-produced, versus other handmade hats. I think that my hats are quirky, yet simple — I don’t like to embellish too much. I focus on the shape of the hat, the textures, and making it long-lasting. I’m a little rough with my own things, so I basically make them for me!

Q. And who is your target customer?

A. I would say that my target customer is a young professional working in a creative field. Someone that isn’t afraid to look different, and that can do so by doing a job that offers that kind of liberty.

Q. Where are your hats designed/made?

A. I make every single one of my hat with my own two hands.

Q. And where can people check them out?

A. Through my website at heirloomhats.com, as well as at a few stockists listed on my website.

Q. What’s the price range for your designs?

A. It can vary between $78 and $450.

Q. Do you have any plans to branch out beyond hats?

A. I have collaborated with Montreal Designer Noemiah on a clothing collection coming out next fall. Aside from that, I don’t have any plans to, but you never know.

Q. Lastly, what do you love most about hats?

A. They are the first thing you see when you meet someone, and they are almost always and conversation starter.

"Surprise, there’s fantastic shopping in Halifax! However, I’m not talking about popular clothing brands whose chain stores are located in malls such as Mic Mac Mall and the Halifax Shopping Centre, I am talking about fashion boutiques that could rival ones in New York and Paris. Here are four amazing stores and one pop-up that will have you saying “walk, walk, fashion baby” as you swing your shopping bags.

RCHMND (1869 Granville Street)

RCHMND offers an exquisitely curated selection of fashion brands such as Comme des Garçons Play, Acne Studios, and Y-3. The brainchild of Kristi Smith and Pete MacDonald, who met while working in Toronto, the store, is more cultural hub meets art installation. After all, it was designed by award-winning Canadian architecture firm Omar Gandhi. Though minimalism is the theme at RCHMD, you can easily spend hours in the all-white space that is, in a word, inspired.

OZ Shoes (1887 Granville Street)

Located a stone’s throw from RCHMND is OZ Shoes — a treasure box of women’s footwear. Michele Giffin opened this store just a year and a half ago, and in that time it has become a destination for Halifax’s well-heeled women. Stocking sought after brands such as Kenzo, Isabel Marant, and Doc Martens alongside in-the-know brands like Senso (beloved by fashion editors) and MSGM, OZ has something to delight even the most discerning shopper. Let it be your stomping ground while visiting the city.

NSKD (1876 Hollis Street)

Around the corner from OZ and RCHMND (I once said that this should be called the Granville Shopping District) is another fashion store whose name is in all-caps. NSKD (an acronym meaning Nova Scotia Kids) is a hypebeast’s dream come true. This streetwear fashion emporium stocks new and consignment items from labels such as Supreme, Bape, and Anti Social Social Club. If you have to Google any of those, then maybe, just maybe, this store is too cool for you. Notwithstanding, it’s staffed by a group of affable young people, and NSKD even has an eponymous clothing line.

Wildflower Clothing (5431 Doyle Street, Unit 103)

Located off Halifax’s main shopping high street Spring Garden Road is the tranquil Wildflower Clothing. The well-appointed space created by Jill Strong, who was once voted Halifax’s Best Dressed Woman, gives serious LA vibes. And in a good way! Well-merchandised brands like Velvet Tees, Eberjey and Lilla P beckon seductively to you to touch, try on and purchase.

The Bounty

This plus-size pop-up store defies fashion tropes and illustrates that it’s not that hard for the fashion industry to be size-inclusive. Krista Kirby and Stevie Fort created The Bounty to make it easier for women who wear size 16 to 28 to thrift and swap clothes with each other. This Bounty manifests a number of times a year via pop-ups but, don’t be dismayed it is also located inside the Lost & Found Store.

Today, the textile industry of Uzbekistan is part of the intangible cultural heritage, which has preserved the traditions of ancestors in the production of textile products - the manufacture of fabrics, clothing, carpet weaving.

Uzbekistan attaches priority importance to further strengthening the strategic partnership with China. Expanding cooperation between the two countries in all areas is based on the principles of mutual benefit, consideration of interests and equality.

The delegation of the Association ""Uztextileprom"" and domestic manufacturers of the textile, garment and knitwear industry take part in the International Exhibition of Textile Fiber, Yarn Expo Spring 2019 in Shanghai (China), the press service of the Association Uztextileprom reports.

The Uzbek delegation visited an exhibition in order to expand export deliveries to the countries of Southeast Asia, as well as to establish direct contacts with potential consumers and to conclude export contracts with them, on March 12-14.

Yarn Expo is an important sourcing platform where suppliers from Asian and European countries showcase their latest collections of fiber and yarn, including natural (cotton, wool, silk, linen, ramie), artificial, blended, reconstituted, as well as speciality products.

For foreign suppliers, it is an opportunity to strengthen trade relations in the region and increase its presence in the Chinese market.

Such companies as Textile Technologies Group Surxon Teks and Global Textile Solutions, as well as a number of domestic companies in the industry, took part in the exhibition.

During the exhibition, meetings and negotiations with potential investors were organized and the parties discussed issues of further expanding cooperation in the textile and garment and knitwear industry.

In parallel with Yarn Expo Spring 2019, four more exhibitions will take place: the leading exhibition of apparel fabrics and accessories Intertextile Shanghai Apparel Fabrics,"" the exhibition of home textiles InterTextile Shanghai Home Textiles,"" the exhibition of knitted clothing and knitwear PH Value"" and the fashion exhibition CHIC, in which delegation of the Association Uztextileprom will participate.

These exhibitions are an ideal opportunity to gain access to the leading suppliers of textile raw materials in China. They help to strengthen the trade relations of domestic manufacturers of the textile and garment and knitwear industry in the region and increase their presence in the Chinese market.

Diplomatic relations between Uzbekistan and China were established on January 2, 1992.

The trade turnover between the two countries totalled $ 6.43 billion in 2018. Of this amount, $ 2.869 billion is Uzbek exports, as many as $ 3.559 billion is imports.

China received $ 2.1 billion due to an increase in construction in Uzbekistan. With this money, Uzbekistan has acquired special construction equipment from China.

"Women's clothing chain Dressbarn is closing all of its stores, including 23 in the Carolinas. The Wichita Eagle

Longtime women’s clothing chain Dressbarn is going out of business, according to a news release from its parent company.

The franchise has begun a “wind down” that will result in the closing of all 650 Dressbarn stores across the U.S., according to a news release from Ascena Retail Group shared by BusinessWire.

That includes eight stores in South Carolina, and 20 in North Carolina.

There is no word on when the Dressbarns in the Carolinas will permanently shut their doors, but until they do the stores will conduct business as usual, which includes normal “return, refund, or gift card policies,” Ascena said in the news release.

SHARE COPY LINK Stores that have been staples of the American shopping tradition for decades are closing in large numbers. Take a closer look at the reasons why it’s so hard for retailers to stay open.

“During the wind down process, we will continue to provide our customers with the same great experience both in-store and online, offering them even better deals and value,” Chief Financial Officer Steven Taylor said in the news release.

About 6,800 employees work across the country at Dressbarn stores, which Ascena said have not been meeting an “acceptable level of profitability in today’s retail environment,” CBS News reported.

By closing Dressbarn, Ascena will “focus on its more profitable brands,” which include Ann Taylor, LOFT, Lane Bryant, Lou & Grey, Catherines, Cacique and Justice, according to NPR.

“For more than 50 years, Dressbarn has served women’s fashion needs, and we thank all of our dedicated associates for their commitment to Dressbarn and our valued customers. This decision was difficult, but necessary,” Taylor said, per USA Today.

A financial analyst said Ascena was responsible for Dressbarn’s shortcomings.

“Ascena really never invested in Dressbarn and let it stagnate to the point where it has become completely out of touch with the needs of modern shoppers. Even the name now feels old fashioned and dull,” GlobalData Retail analyst Neil Saunders said, according to CBS News.

When it was founded in the 1960s, Dressbarn was marketed as a place where women “could find fashion at a value,” NPR reported.

“We’re proud that Dressbarn has been a fashion destination for so many generations of women for 50+ years,” the clothing store posted on Facebook.

"In the 1800s, consumption was the name of a terrible, yet weirdly chic, wasting disease later known as tuberculosis, glamorized in both society and the arts. “I should like to die from consumption,” the romantic poet Byron reportedly said. The novelist George Sand said of her lover, the composer Frédéric Chopin, that he “coughs with infinite grace.”

Ever since, the term consumption has been shorthand for many of our own seductive worst impulses — including the desire to jam our wardrobes full of stuff — along with apparent disregard for the reality of our situation. Once upon a time, consumption generally implied death for a person; today, it has begun to imply death for the planet.

And yet, when it comes to clothes, we tend to overlook the fact that people (and moths) are not the only consumers around, and the act of consumption is not just about purchasing.

Sometimes, for example, it’s about microbes. They’re the Next Big Thing (or next teeny-tiny thing) in an approach to clothing that focuses not just on the materials we use to make what we wear, but what happens to those materials when all the wearing is done. Especially when those materials happen to be the sort of materials currently demonized as part of the ocean plastics crisis. Which is to say: polyester."

The ever-growing fashion industry sees many fashion enthusiast opting for international brands while neglecting their very own.



This was realised by WEAR SA, and University of Western Cape (UWC) with the purpose to revolutionise the local fashion industry, by encouraging the youth to support local brands in order to make a fashion statement while promoting entrepreneurial possibilities.





Trendy: Looking all fabulous in Rich Mnisi. Picture: Instagram.





This vision will be fulfilled through the “Awear SA fashion show,” which will be spearheaded by students who were trained during a 2-day boot-camp about event management, staging and matching budding designers with those who can stitch a dream together with the purpose of unlocking their entrepreneur skills.





The students do not only hail from the Fashion industry but were selected from different study fields and are inexperienced but have the potential of discovering tomorrow's hottest fashion labels.





Glamour: Fashion forward in Hazelbirdstyl kimono.





Inspired by President Cyril Ramaphosa’s speech “Thuma mina,” these students are determined to promote this message to the SA youth.

"Carbon fibre used to be the ultimate symbol when it came to showing just how much money you could spend on your car's interior.

An expansive dash, custom-carved door panels and Nappa leather seats demonstrated to anyone who cared to look that this was an expensive, sporty and unique vehicle.

But now it's time for plants.

""Fifty years ago, a leather couch was the height of luxury,"" says Massimo Frascella, Land Rover's creative director, who is a vegan. ""Now in the best hotels and homes you would never see that. It's a similar process with cars. Going forward, sustainable design is providing the framework for change.""

Frascella was in Manhattan during the New York auto show last month to unveil Land Rover's new line of leather-free, fully vegan materials developed to outfit its 2020 Range Rover Evoque, Range Rover Velar and Jaguar I-Pace SUVs.

""There are a growing number of people who are concerned with the provenance of the textiles and materials in their vehicle,"" he says. The new interiors are meant to attract those consumers for whom the highest form of luxury aligns with their eco beliefs.

The marque's proprietary Eucalyptus Melange, for example — a textile produced from eucalyptus fibres — uses significantly less water than traditional materials such as plastic and Alcantara and can be dyed to match any color of the spectrum. It also uses a durable wool blend, from textile company Kvadrat, that feels like a soft wool sweater.

Dinamica Suedecloth is a flameproof and extremely durable, suede-mimicking microfibre made from recycled plastic bottles — 53 per vehicle, on average, according to Land Rover. Taken together, they provide a vegetarian, if not fully animal-product-free, option for the conscientious affluent.

Other automakers are also adding eco-conscious options to interiors. Volvo wants at least 25% of the plastics used in every newly launched model it launches by 2025 to be made from recycled materials. Today the percentage is about 5%. In February Volvo subsidiary Polestar touted that its first volume model, the Polestar 2, would have a vegan interior.

Toyota makes seat cushion material that uses glycol from renewable sugar cane rather than glycol derived from petroleum. Hyundai sources ground-up volcanic rock to form the support pillar coverings for its sedans; Ford developed a seat foam from soybeans; and Faraday Future has toyed with using rock fibres and cotton from discarded garments to line its cars.

Luxury brands have intensified the allure. In the heady world of $250,000 SUVs and six-figure hybrids, it's only fitting that the interiors are both plush and sustainable. In this arena, the medium is the message.

""This is part of a bigger global trend that we see continuing to grow,"" says Filip Brabec, Audi's vice-president for product management. ""It has to do with consumers understanding more and more the implications of how we inhabit the environment, and how and what we eat.""

Synthetic leather alone will make up a $45bn industry by 2025, according to business consulting firm Grand View Research, with automotive applications predicted to be the second-largest use for renewable textiles, after home furnishings. In this landscape, ""responsibly sourced"" and ""premium alternatives"" are the biggest buzzwords.

Audi has developed sustainable and even carbon-neutral materials for its electric vehicles. The seats of the Q4 e-tron SUV are made from recycled plastic, and the e-tron GT offers an interior option of synthetic leather and recycled microfibres, including a deep-pile Econyl yarn floor carpet made from used fishing nets. The entire car is vegan.

In its Aicon concept, Audi presented seat covers made from Climatex, a dual-layered fabric with a polyester top and pure wool bottom. It was developed in a way so the two layers could be separated by type and recycled at the end of the vehicle's life. Although it isn't going into production, these sorts of solutions indicate the way Audi foresees the future of interiors.

""We have had some nice firsts,"" Brabec says. ""We see this as a big opportunity for us, and we are busy developing even more.""

That is not to say there is not still plenty of business to be had in the old-fashioned world of burled walnut and buckskin. Just ask the folks at Bentley.

But Land Rover is anticipating a larger change in consumer tastes. It's introducing eco-conscious textiles in the Evoque, it's best-selling model in Europe, to promote Land Rover as an upscale, aspirational addition to the garage. Frascella says the materials do not carry an additional price premium over traditional textiles."
"Carbon footprint is a phrase that’s being thrown around so often so let’s break it down.

In terms of climate change, footprint is a metaphor for the lasting impact that something has on the environment. Carbon is a shorthand for all the different greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming because the dominant man-made greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide (CO2), writes Mike Berners-Lee and Duncan Clark in the Green Living Blog.

Addressing climate change will require fundamental societal, organisational and behavioural changes on a global scale, according to the Greenhouse Gas Management Institute. But luckily there are also smaller lifestyle changes that individuals can make to reduce their carbon footprint.

Recycling is one of the easiest ways to reduce your carbon footprint because throwing things away is a waste of the energy and the resources taken to make the product, according to Carbon Footprint Ltd.

A perfect example of someone who is turning waste into wealth is 25-year-old Reabetswe Ngwane, co-founder of Kreamfields (Pty) Ltd and Atyre. Reabetswe and her team work with discarded tyre material to create, among other things, mine bags and handbags. Their goal as a recycling entity is to reduce and eradicate the disposal of tyre waste to landfills, and to be a force to reckoned with in the industry, as young black females.

“We (Atyre) are committed to continually innovating the craft of bag making, to not only be ecologically friendly and sustainable, but also socially inclusive by working with local communities to eradicate poverty,” Ngwane writes in a letter on Atyre. Reabetswe was chosen as one of HP’s change makers for their Global Citizen campaign for her sustainable approach to fashion.

In recognition of her efforts to create a sustainable fashion brand that’s ecologically friendly, HP has donated R50 000 in equipment and cash to Reabetswe as a planet change maker.

HP in turn is also encouraging their customers to lower their carbon footprint by helping them to recycle responsibly. More than 80% of HP ink cartridges and 100% of HP LaserJet toner cartridges are manufactured with “closed loop” recycled plastic. They have also used ocean-bound plastic to make Original HP ink cartridges.

The efforts of both Reabetswe and HP speaks volumes of how recycling can be incorporated into businesses. But for individuals it can be even easier to reduce their carbon footprint through recycling. Simply follow these four tips form Carbon Footprint Ltd:

Reduce your energy consumption and the amount of waste you accumulate.

Re-use products for as long as feasibly possible.

Repair things that are broken instead of throwing them away.

Recycle materials than can be recycled because it produces less pollution than making things from scratch.

We can also choose products that lower our carbon footprint and help out our planet.

While we have your attention…

Our world is facing increasingly difficult challenges including inequality, climate change, inadequate access to quality education and healthcare, among others. To overcome these challenges, we must raise the bar, challenge ourselves, and reinvent the industry standards for sustainable impact including driving lasting improvements to the planet, people and communities where we live, work and do business.

As part of their partnership with Global Citizen, HP has launched a campaign to amplify awareness of creating a sustainable impact. Please join the movement in reinventing mind-sets of citizens of the world and be the generation that pushes for a sustainable change.

Take a pledge to support this initiative here and challenge your friends on social media to be the generation of Global Citizens."
"The U.S. footwear industry is one of the biggest victims in an escalating trade war with China.

President Donald Trump on Thursday announced another round of tariffs on the roughly $300 billion of Chinese goods that hadn't already been targeted by American levies. The 10% duties will take effect on Sept. 1, impacting consumer goods such as apparel, home textiles like bedding and shoes.

Shoe manufacturers in particular are bracing to take a major hit, with reality setting in that after months of on-and-off talks between these U.S. and China, these tariffs are set to take effect. A whopping 70% of shoes sold in the U.S. come from China, according to the Footwear Distributors & Retailers of America, an industry organization with more than 500 members, including Walmart, Nike, Crocs and Steven Madden. Footwear imported from China is already being hit with upwards of 67% duties, the group said.

""The consumer won't be able to hide,"" FDRA President and CEO Matt Priest said. ""Even if it's 10%, it's death by a thousand cuts.""

In May, more than 170 shoe retailers and brands — including Under Armour, Ugg and Foot Locker — sent a letter to Trump asking him to not raise tariffs on footwear, saying: ""These tariffs would mean some working American families could pay a nearly 100% duty on their shoes."" (Trump in May was considering a 25% tariff hike.)

FDRA has calculated that a popular type of canvas ""skate"" sneaker could increase in price to $58.69 from $49.99 with an additional 10% tariff. The price of a typical hunting boot could jump to $222.27 from $190. And a popular performance running shoe could rise to $187.50 from $150.

Companies like Nike, Under Armour and Puma have steadily been decreasing their reliance on China, shifting resources to places like Vietnam. Still, the U.S. imported $11.4 billion worth of footwear from China last year, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, making it an industry incredibly reliant on the country for its cheap, skilled labor.

Nike, for example, made 47% of its shoes in Vietnam in fiscal 2018, according to its latest annual report. It made 26% in China and 21% in Indonesia."
"New York (CNN Business) Levi Strauss racked up $5.6 billion in sales last year. But chief executive Chip Bergh has a mission to make Levi's a $10 billion brand one day.

To hit that ambitious target and match up against bigger rivals, Levi's needs a new playbook.

Levi's hopes tapping the public market will fund its efforts to expand in the United States and overseas, make new types of clothing and footwear and acquire hip brands.

The 165-year-old company that invented the blue jean re-entered the public market on Thursday. It was the first time the LEVI ticker was listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 34 years.

Why Wall Street is buzzing about Levi's

Levi's believes it has a path forward by moving beyond jeans.

""We have significant opportunity to grow by expanding beyond our core business,"" the company said in a regulatory filing last month. Levi's wants to ""develop leading positions in categories outside of men's bottoms.""

Pants still make up 68% of the company's sales, but they have been shrinking in recent years as sales of other clothing expand. Levi's wants to sell more shirts, sweatshirts, shoes and cold weather gear, and also double down on women's clothes. Women's sales have increased from 20% of Levi's business in 2015 to 29% last year. Levi's believes it has an opportunity grow even more with women.

""We have a vision of this brand becoming a head-to-toe lifestyle brand, competing in multiple categories,"" CEO Bergh told CNN's Richard Quest in an interview Thursday.

Levi's also hopes to grab a bigger piece of international markets, including China, India and Brazil. It believes it has a huge growth opportunity in China, which accounts for 20% of the global apparel market — but only 3% of Levi's revenue.

Higher costs

Levi's costs have been soaring. It ramped up its advertising spending by 24% last year, and also increased spending on new stores and technology.

Levi's needs sustained investments to build stores, increase marketing and grow its direct sales online. That's why it's going public.

""There's a price of admission to compete digitally,"" said Bill Lewis, director in the retail practice of consultancy AlixPartners.

Levi's is the jeans' market share leader in the United States, controlling 13.5% of the industry, according to Euromonitor International data.

Levi's new life

Levi's will face huge challenges in its new life as a public company.

""This is not the finish line,"" Bergh said Thursday.

JCPenney JCP Despite Levi's transformation, it still gets some sales from troubled retailers likeand Sears. If either retailer goes under, Levi's could take a small hit.

Fashion trends change quickly and boutique jean makers or new brands born online could pressure the company as well.

Walmart WMT Target TGT Andandhave been building out their own clothing brands, sometimes at the expense of their longtime partners. Last year, Target said it would end a popular line for Champion , leaving a huge hole for the brand to fill.

Levi's warned in filings that retailers growing their private label brands posed risk to the company.

Making progress

Levi's still has plenty more to do, but the company has already begun to revamp its business over the past few years to navigate disruption in the market.

The brand used to find growth mostly by selling to outside retailers. But many of the company's largest partners have shrunk or disappeared, forcing Levi's to adjust.

In response, Levi's transformed its traditional distribution model away from struggling department stores and expanded its business by opening new stores and tapping online growth.

Levi's direct sales at its more than 800 stores and its website — which are more profitable for the company than sales through retailers — now make up 35% of its annual revenue. And no single retailer accounts for more than 10% of Levi's sales. That means that Levi's probably won't crater if one of its retail partners suddenly goes belly up.

Levi's has also diversified the brands it sells to partners.

It has introduced lower-priced brands, Signature by Levi Strauss and Denizen, to reach Walmart and Target shoppers, while still improving premium lines at Nordstrom and Bloomingdale's. It built a strategy to sell on Amazon, too.

""They've done a very good of focusing on retail partners that are likely to survive the turmoil in the market,"" said Michelle Grant, head of retailing at Euromonitor International. ""It's particularly important in the current retail landscape."""
"Climate demonstrators blocked roads outside London Fashion Week on Sunday to protest against the “unsustainable” industry.

More than 100 campaigners joined the Extinction Rebellion group’s disruption march as they urged fashion brands to tackle a global “ecological emergency”.

Demonstrations began when a small crowd rallied outside Victoria Beckham’s morning event at the Tate Britain and blocked Fashion Week cars travelling to the show.

One of our swarms blocking the road outside London Fashion Week! #ExtinctionRebellion #LFW pic.twitter.com/PDVkWue98t — Extinction Rebellion ⌛️ (@ExtinctionR) February 17, 2019

A larger group then moved to the event’s main venue at The Strand, in central London, where they blocked several roads carrying a banner with the message “rebel for life”.

Nuala Gathercole Lam, from Extinction Rebellion, said: “We ask the fashion industry, who do you want to listen to, the youth and the future, or the words of our current Prime Minister, whose Government is criminally neglecting the UK’s agreed responsibilities under the Paris agreement in the face of the ecological emergency?

“Now it is time for the fashion industry to hear the call of the youth.” Protesters demanded a more sustainable fashion industry (Yui Mok/PA)

Protester Lucas Spencer, 17, who travelled to London from Leeds, said: “I feel like it’s everyone’s problem.

“The world is being killed, we know it is, it’s not just dying, there are people killing it and if nobody speaks about it nothing is going to change.

“The fashion industry creates a lot of pollution and the chemicals they use create a lot of waste.”

Leaflets handed out by the group said the protest was a campaign against “the catastrophic consequences of inaction”. Climate change activists blocked roads during the demo (Yui Mok/PA)

Fashion fans at the show also said they supported an end to “fast fashion” and throwaway culture.

Speaking outside the main venue, Tatiana Phillips, 34, a personal stylist visiting the show, said: “I’m sure there should be something done, there’s a reason, but I don’t think they should go crazy about it.

“Just yesterday at the festival and today they have been talking about sustainable fashion and how it’s important to move that way.”

Student Holly Cudby, 21, who was also visiting, added: “I think it does need to be more sustainable, fast fashion, even though I buy into it.”

"It's called ""fast fashion"" — cheap and trendy clothing that's made quickly and inexpensively so we can all have the fashion trends of the season.

But it has been criticized for the impact it has on the environment, and the workers who make it.

But a movement called Slow Fashion October is a push back against the fast-fashion industry, and its environmental effects.

Slow Fashion October was started a few years ago in the U.S. by knitters and other clothing makers to acknowledge, and be conscientious about, our clothing consumption.

""Slow Fashion October is a month to celebrate the changes that we've already made and to look at some of the things that can be improved when it comes making decisions about our clothing,"" said Anna Hunter, the owner of Long Way Homestead, a family owned and operated fibre farm and wool mill near Ste. Genevieve, Man. — about 50 kilometres east of Winnipeg.

""It's a celebration of the things that are second-hand, the things that we've made, the things that we've mended,"" she said.

""So many of us don't think about where our clothes come from, how they're made, what sort of resources it takes to even make those clothes and then how quickly we discard them.""

Hunter became more involved in slow fashion after she committed to not buying new clothing for a year.

That same year she moved to Winnipeg from Vancouver, and even with the very different winters, she still didn't spend money on new clothes.

""I found myself stumbling through, trying to sew some ski pants,"" said Hunter.

She also learned that she owned 10 black T-shirts.

""They were all the same and they were all black and I had 10 of them — and it's just really not that necessary,"" she said.

Fast fashion has created an environmental impact that Hunter believes many aren't even aware of.

""We're bombarded with messages that we actually need to have the newest designs and the newest fashion and so we are buying a lot of clothing and then getting rid of it every six months or every season,"" she said.

'Overwhelming' environmental impact

Slow Fashion October is about ""looking at ways in which you can not be constantly be purchasing more clothes, not be purchasing clothes that are cheaply made in ways that are bad for the environment,"" said Bethany Daman, the green-living co-ordinator with Winnipeg's Green Action Centre.

The centre is concerned with how fast fashion is impacting the environment and what they can do to help stop it, she said.

The 2016 documentary RiverBlue highlights that exact problem, said Hunter.

It shows the impact that the clothing industry has on fresh waterways throughout the world, including the synthetic dyes used, the water used for producing and manufacturing cotton, and what then happens with the run-off.

In countries where a lot of clothing is produced, like China, Indonesia and India, you can actually see the dye running into the rivers and changing the colour of the water, Hunter said.

""Sometimes it's overwhelming if you are looking at the blue jeans aisle and you're thinking about how much of that synthetic blue dye has gone into fresh waterways.""

Hunter dyes wool at her farm. 'Using second-hand stores and making your own clothes will help reduce our fast-fashion input,' she says. (Submitted by Anna Hunter)

While we might not see the same environmental impact in Manitoba, we do still have issues here, said Hunter.

""The amount of clothing that goes into landfills, you know, even in Canada, in North America, in Manitoba — it's huge,"" she said, especially when there are better ways to get rid of your unwanted clothing.

There's the option of donating used clothing, or repairing that pair of pants with a hole in them, she said, ""recognizing that most clothes can probably be fixed by a tailor. Using second-hand stores and making your own clothes will help reduce our fast-fashion input.""

Hunter owns a sheep farm and manufactures wool that's all grown and made in Manitoba. Supporting local manufacturers is one of the most important things to keep in mind when it comes to slow fashion, she said.

""Supporting local farms, local producers of textile, local designers, local sewers — that's all a part of keeping that input much more localized."""
"The fashion industry is starting to care about people with disabilities. Popular brands and retailers including Tommy Hilfiger, Zappos, Nike and Target are leading the way in designing apparel, shoes and other products for consumers with non-standard body types, boosting an overlooked population's confidence -- and their own bottom lines.

Americans with disabilities make up the third-largest market segment in the U.S., according to the federal Office of Disability Employment Policy. Collectively, they have disposable income of about $490 billion -- that's nearly as much as the purchasing power of each of the top two segments, African-Americans and Hispanics, according to American Institutes for Research (AIR). Yet many mainstream retailers largely ignore them, leaving medical supply companies as the primary source of so-called adaptive clothing.

Simple clothing alterations, such as magnetic closures that replace buttons, snaps and hooks on shirts and jackets, can benefit people with a range of disabilities, while also expanding their wardrobe with stylish options, designers say. Other innovative design elements include adjustable hems on shirt sleeves and pant legs for individuals with limb differences, as well as openings in the backs of dresses that let individuals dress themselves instead of depending on a caregiver.

Catering to people with disabilities represents a two-fold opportunity for businesses, analysts say. ""They are a vast consumer market for higher quality or innovative products and services, if you look at it through the lens of disposable and discretionary income,"" Michelle Yin, a principal economist at AIR told CBS MoneyWatch.

For apparel makers, offering products for people with disabilities can also have a halo effect on the sales of mainstream products, with consumers becoming increasingly conscious of a brand's ethical reputation.

""[P]eople like buying goods and services from companies that are seen as inclusive. It helps with their marketing and improves the bottom line,"" Yin said.

Molly Kettle, director of Zappos Adaptive, said the online retailer started focusing on the segment in 2017 in response to one customer's struggle to find footwear for her grandson, who has autism and can't tie shoes with laces.

""That sparked something in our employee to say we should be able to serve all our customers,"" Kettle said, alluding to the Zappos worker who spoke with the customer. ""There is the need out there, and this is something that is viable,"" she said of Zappos Adaptive's business.

Zappos has partnered with Tommy Hilfiger, Nike and other brands to carry their lines of clothing and sneakers for consumers with special needs.

""Our primary goal is to serve customers, so if we are able to do so, that certainly represents a business opportunity,"" Kettle said.

Adaptive fashion market expected to grow

An estimated one in five Americans lives with a disability, according to the U.S. Census. A Coherent Market Insights study predicts that the global market for adaptive clothing will approach $393 billion by 2026.

That commercial opportunity will lure more brands into the space, predicted Steve Lamar, executive vice president of the American Apparel and Footwear Association. ""It's a trend that I have had more conversations about in the last 18 months than I have in the previous five years before that.""

Robotic pants could offer mobility for the disabled

People with disabilities tend to spend more money on clothing, according to fashion designer Mindy Scheier, president and founder of Runway of Dreams, a foundation that advocates for greater inclusion in industry. ""They're spending more than the average person on clothing because nine times out of 10, they get their clothes tailored,"" she said.

Clothing specifically designed to meet their needs, on the other hand, is typically cheaper than custom-made items.

""The disability market should be considered a standalone market that businesses can advertise to and design products for, similar to the teenage market,"" Yin said.

Transformative power of clothing

Not even Scheier -- who understands the transformative power of fashion -- knew quite how important it was that her son, who suffers from muscular dystrophy, be able to wear jeans to school. He was used to dressing in baggy sweatpants that fit around his leg braces and one day asked why he couldn't wear the same kind of pants as his classmates, she said.

""That night, I ripped apart a pair of jeans and made modifications that allowed him to dress himself and wear his leg braces by creating an opening at the bottom of the pants,"" she said. ""When I showed them to Oliver the next morning, there was such an immediate, visible change in him. His confidence and self-esteem changed, and I was in awe at the impact these jeans had on him,"" she said.

Even able-bodied consumers see value in some of the innovations that have resulted, like shoes that zip open in the back. Having an eye on the needs of disabled consumers can help companies top their competitors, economists said.

Scheier, who serves as an advisor to Zappos Adaptive, Tommy Adaptive, and other clothing lines, hopes the kind of clothing that suits her son will someday be mainstream. ""My goal is to hopefully never have this conversation because it will just be another fit in industry no different from 'plus size,' 'maternity' and 'petite' because these are just different-shaped bodies that require modifications than what already exists,"" Scheier said."
"Council unites with The Salvation Army for Recycle with Michael scheme to make recycling fun for primary school pupils

We’re helping to divert more clothes from landfill and giving them a new lease of life

North Yorkshire’s Hambleton District Council has partnered with the Salvation Army Trading Company’s national recycling scheme in order to get local primary schools recycling old clothes and shoes, while also raising money.

They joined forces with us to take part in the Recycle With Michael scheme, a fun and informative recycling initiative designed especially for primary school aged children. We provide a colourful clothing bank, which is branded with our recycling champion, Michael, for the school to place somewhere accessible on their property. We give the children lots of recycling bags to take home to their families to fill up with donations. All they need to do next is bring the bags back to the school, pop them in the bank and we’ll do the rest.

One of the clothing banks is located at Romanby Primary School in Northallerton where governor and Hambleton’s Head of Environment, Paul Staines said the children were keen to recycle.

He said: “Textiles are the UK’s fastest growing household waste stream and people sometimes forget that it’s just as important to recycle your old clothes as some of the more obvious items like newspapers and bottles.”

When the banks are full our local collectors come to empty them. The textiles we receive will be reused or recycled wherever possible, with profit from the sale of the donations being given straight towards helping the Salvation Army. The Salvation Army’s trading company will then provide feedback on the weight of donations received from the school so they can then be rewarded with an amount of money – dependent on the weight of donations – as a thank you from SATCoL. This could be spent on new school equipment or in the local community … it’s completely up to the school.

Paul Staines added: “Through this scheme we’re helping to divert more clothes from landfill and giving them a new lease of life, whilst raising money for both the school and The Salvation Army, which does such important work in communities throughout the UK.”

There are also banks at: Swainby & Potto C of E Primary School, Brompton Community Primary School, East Cowton C of E Primary School, Linton on Ouse Primary School, Applegarth Primary School, Alne Primary, Bedale C of E Primary School and Carlton Miniott School.

"Forget lab-grown meat. A US company backed by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka Shing and some of Silicon Valley's leading investment funds is developing lab-grown cow skin in a bid to disrupt the $100bn global leather industry.

Andras Forgacs, founder and chief executive of the US-based company, Modern Meadow, said the new technology would allow real leather to be produced at scale in a factory without having to raise or slaughter livestock.

Instead, the vegan-friendly leather will be fermented using a bioengineered form of yeast which will be brewed to produce bovine collagen, a protein found in the connective tissues of cows which is the basic biological building block of leather.

“The opportunity..."
"Zero waste lifestyle has jumped from a concept to reality, even if it is still just a tiny fraction of the world’s population – mostly women – that have embraced it. Yet, the fact that some of the world’s biggest companies are adopting it shows promise.

In Great Britain, all 950 Starbucks locations are now charging customers an additional five cents if they get their drinks in disposable cups. On the other hand, they get a discount of 25 cents if they bring reusable cups. This helps reduce garbage that gets compacted in landfills.

Some big hotels have stopped providing shampoo, conditioner, and lotion in small disposable plastic containers. Rather, there are bulk dispensers aimed at reducing one of the world’s biggest environment nemeses: one-time-use plastic containers.

Consumer goods giant Unilever has initiated partnerships with other companies to launch a home delivery service using refillable jars of its more popular products, again in response to bringing down the amount of consumer products in plastic packaging.

Other companies jumping onto bandwagon of late are Unilever, Nestlé, and PepsiCo, all announcing their plans to use reusable packaging for certain products to reduce single-use disposables.

There’s also a rising growth in zero waste stores that sell unpacked goods, where buyers bring their own containers and bags to avoid creating more waste that would have to end up in the garbage bins, and ultimately, landfills.

Quixotic dream

Some may scoff at the idea of zero waste as Quixotic, and even the renowned initiator of zero waste lifestyle today, Bea Johnson, admits that even with meticulous planning, she and her family of four still ended with a jar of garbage after a year.

But for Johnson, and the many other people inspired to embrace zero waste lifestyles, what is more important is the awareness and willingness to adopt measures to reduce waste that comes with daily life, usually in upwardly mobile city dwelling.

For most, it starts with bringing your own carry-bags when going to the market or grocery, and doing away with plastic shopping bags. A deepening commitment could mean staying away from single-use plastics for bottled water, one that has been a major source of sea pollution.

A more radical response would be to avoid buying goods packaged in plastics in supermarkets, refraining from food deliveries that come in disposable wares, and patronizing online shopping sites that deliver goods wrapped in plastic.

Many consumers have been able to demonstrate the do-ability of aiming for a zero waste lifestyle, and it just takes a firmer resolve to avoid plastics and disposables that would end up in the garbage bin. End users have the easier task; manufacturers face a tougher decision.

Fast fashion

One aspect of adopting a zero waste lifestyle is having only the most basic essentials needed to live. For many of those who have converted, part of the de-cluttering is keeping one’s wardrobe as Spartan as possible, and if needed, to buy second-hand clothing.

This is because the world’s fashion industry is regarded as the world’s second biggest industrial polluter, next only to oil. It has created a cult that prods people to buy more clothes than they actually need, and to discard these when new fashion styles are created.

Fast fashion, or the desire for cheap on-trend clothes, has lamentably replaced darning and mending as clothing manufacturers ship out millions in metric tons of cheap, wearable items, from T-shirts, coats, shoes, hats, and accessories on an annual basis.

A study by the Ellen Macarthur Foundation has noted that more that $500 billion is lost each year by consumers who buy clothing but under-utilize them, or worse, are not even able to remove the tags as new fashion styles dictate them out of trend.

Total greenhouse gas emission from textiles production is pegged now at 1.2 billion metric tons a year, and that by 2050, the global fashion industry would be accountable for the global carbon budget associated with a two percent Celsius rise in the Earth’s temperature.

The amount of clothes that go through the commercial mill is also draining the world’s water resources, with an estimated 79 billion cubic meters of fresh water used in growing and producing fibers, to dyeing, finishing, and washing of clothes.

Government’s role

The fashion industry, however, is just one of the major causes of wastes. As new landfills open up to accommodate more trash, the pools of plastics in our oceans become bigger and more difficult to corral and clean.

Many governments are already introducing measures that encourage people to rely less on pollutants such as plastics, but because these are more regulatory than outright bans, there is limited success.

In the Philippines, for example, some local governments encourage plastic bag reduction, but still allow consumers to pay for a plastic bag if they opt to. Ordinances are also not strictly enforced at all times, and the practice of using plastic bags creeps back into the system every so often.

Clearly, too, environment laws on plastics – starting from production to its use – are urgently needed given the gravity of the problem. This could seriously threaten the business of manufacturing plastics, and could be challenged in the courts.

In the end, the success of an effective environment protection drive will have to rely on more enlightened people, those who are able to demonstrate that a lifestyle aiming for zero waste is what the world needs, and one that makes sense.

Ultimately, such consumers will dictate the moderation that is needed to curb many of the modern world’s excesses and unnecessary wastes.

"Today, the scrubland that was once the Aral Sea in Central Asia is dotted with camels searching out sparse tufts of grass against a flat, sandy horizon. Only the bizarre sight of boats marooned hundreds of miles inland gives any clue to the area's history. In just four decades, what was once one of the largest inland bodies of water on the globe has shrunk by more than two thirds – an area the size of Ireland – leaving behind a poisonous dustbowl.

And the reason? Our insatiable appetite for cheap jeans – and the rapacious cotton farming that feeds it at almost any cost.

Tomorrow, in a devastating assault on an industry that dictates so much of our high street economy, investigative journalist Stacey Dooley will brand fashion one of the biggest environmental disasters to hit the planet.

Revealed by the BBC's Stacey Dooley in a devastating documentary which brands fast fashion as one of the planet's worst polluters

With Britons buying twice as many clothes as a decade ago – last year we spent £50 billion – there is mounting concern about cheap, disposable fashion sometimes branded 'look and chuck'. Stacey's BBC documentary Fashion's Dirty Secrets will throw this into sharp relief. It reveals that, around the globe, millions of gallons of clean water have either been diverted to growing cotton, or have been hopelessly polluted by the toxic chemicals used for dyes and manufacture. The facts are stark: to grow enough cotton to make a single pair of jeans can take 3,400 gallons or 15,500 litres of water.

But that is only part of the issue – because the fashion industry's pollution problem is also out of control. Factories connected to high street brands have been dumping chemicals from clothes production into Indonesia's Citarum River, says Dooley, threatening the lives of millions.

Serious problems are already evident in the UK, too. The trend for cheap, disposable fashion means more than 300,000 tons of clothing are dumped in landfill in Britain alone each year, which last year worked out at 235 million items.

Meanwhile, microfibres from fleeces and sportswear are now a significant cause of plastic pollution in our rivers and oceans: 700,000 fibres are released in a single domestic wash.

Stacey, who is currently appearing on Strictly Come Dancing, says on the documentary: 'It's impossible to go down any high street without being bombarded by images luring us into buying cheap clothing. But the few pounds we spend on an item of clothing isn't the true cost.

Camels graze next to a rusting ship on land that used to be the Aral Sea in Kazakhstan before water was diverted to grow cotton crops

'It's costing people their livelihoods. It's costing millions of people their health. In fact, it's costing us the earth. It's a situation that needs addressing and fast. There has to be a real sense of urgency now because to be totally honest with you we are running out of time.'

In fact, there is growing momentum on the issue, with many officials now recognising the need for urgent action. Last week, for example, Parliament's Environmental Audit Committee wrote to Britain's ten biggest clothing retailers asking them to reveal their environmental footprint.

They quoted evidence that British shoppers buy far more new clothes than any other European nation. The firms involved, all high street favourites and supermarkets, include Marks & Spencer, Primark, Next, Arcadia, Asda, T K Maxx, Tesco, J D Sports, Debenhams and Sports Direct International. Most churn out hundreds of new fashion lines a year, constantly updating their stock and fuelling trends.

MARY Creagh, chair of the Committee, said: 'Instagram is fuelling this as people are adopting a 'look and chuck' mentality – we've got a lot more fast fashion.

'If you look at Italy's fashion market, there's much more focus on high-end clothing and people tend to save up and buy just one or two garments, like Max Mara coats, which are timeless.

'Ours is much more trend-driven. This year it's yellow, last year it was pink, this autumn it's check – pretty soon you're exhausted. Everyone's doing it, it's Topshop, M&S, H&M, they're all fast-turnaround, high-turnaround, relatively cheap clothing.'

A health crisis has seen an increase in strokes, blood pressure and cancer in the local communities. It is believed to be linked to the toxic pesticides which were dumped in the water by cotton factories

Dooley is clear in the documentary that such cheap fashion amounts to 'consumer catnip'. Its most dramatic illustration comes from Central Asia, a major hub for cotton production. Yet here, it has now become as dangerous to the environment as plastic.

Cotton producers in Uzbekistan – the world's sixth largest cotton producer – have diverted water away from the Aral Sea to giant cotton farms, profoundly impacting the livelihood of farmers and fishermen in neighbouring Kazakhstan. The sea has almost vanished and vast quantities of chemicals were left on the sea bed, poisoning millions of people and farmland.

The loss of water has had a profound impact on the region. Summers are now as hot as 45C, and winters dip to minus 30C. There are no longer trees or plants to stop the wind, and huge dust storms whip up in seconds. An entire ecosystem has died, the fishing industry has been annihilated and thousands have lost their jobs. Equally, it is much harder to grow crops and to farm animals.

In the documentary, Stacey and her guide drive across what was once the sea bed, where camels now roam the landscape. 'I feel like this portrays perfectly what's gone on here,' Stacey says. 'There used to be fish – tens of thousands of tons of fish – and now there's a camel.

'I don't think you understand the enormity of the situation until you're here. It's affected everything. It's affected unemployment. There's been a public health crisis. It's affected the weather. It's affected the seasons. We understand what plastic has done to the earth – we're fed that every day and rightly so – but did I know that cotton was capable of this? Of course I didn't. I had no idea.'

The health crisis has seen an increase in strokes, blood pressure and cancer in the local communities. It is believed to be linked to the toxic pesticides which were dumped in the water by cotton factories. As the water has receded, the pesticides have turned to sediment on the dusty ground, only to be spread into the air by the billowing winds.

'These sandstorms are so vast they can be seen from space,' adds Dooley. 'When the sea first vanished, they contained vast quantities of pesticides which had been washed in to the Aral from the cotton farms and left on the sea bed. They poisoned people and farmland. Millions across the region were affected and the impact is still felt today.'

Meanwhile, chemicals dumped into Indonesia's Citarum River, already one of the most polluted waterways in the world, are causing similar devastation. The local army has spent months trying to clear the sea of plastic floating down the river.

But just as toxic are the levels of mercury, cadmium, lead and arsenic now present in the waters.

As she travels along the Citarum, Dooley discovers that factories are going to extraordinary lengths to avoid detection, dumping their waste at night, or pumping it through underground pipes into the river. The result? Lurid-coloured water, frothy waves, and a lack of oxygen – causing a putrid stench, dead birds and rats and devastation to local families who rely on the water for drinking, bathing and washing their clothes. More than 28 million people have been affected by the polluted water.

'I've seen lots of devastation over the years,' continues Dooley. 'The problem here is the sheer enormity. The scale of what's going on is just breathtaking. It's hard to think the clothes I'm wearing could be causing so much damage. But I can now see how this industry has become such a threat to the planet.

'The documentary points out that where, in the past, there were autumn, winter, spring and summer collections of clothes, retailers now work with more than 50 collections a year.

'To tell people I'm never going to shop again would be completely dishonest,' says Dooley. 'Of course I am. But I do recognise how powerful I am as a consumer and I do want to go back to owning clothes and loving clothes and not consuming them in the way we do now.'

Environment Secretary Michael Gove turned down a request for an interview on the programme.

A spokesman for the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: 'We are interested in any ideas to reduce the impact of waste on our oceans and wider environment. We have already cut waste from plastic bags and microbeads and we are also taking action on plastic bottles, straws, stirrers and cotton buds.

'We are funding research into new ways to deal with micro-plastics but there is more to do.'"
"Gwyneth Paltrow’s lifestyle brand Goop has launched a ‘size inclusive’ clothing collection, which comes in sizes UK 02 to 44.

The collection, which has been created in collaboration with clothing brand Universal Standard, features five pieces including a dress, jumpsuit, peacoat and tuxedo jacket with matching trousers; all of which are available up to a size 44 – the largest female dress size offered in the UK. The pieces range from £187 to £327.

Paltrow debuted her own clothing line, Goop Label, two years ago and the website also sells clothing from various brands, including Joseph and Stella McCartney.

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.

However, this venture marks the first time that the brand has stocked extended sizes. Until now, Goop clothing stopped at size 12.

Paltrow has revealed that the decision to launch the collection was made in order to push the conversation surrounding inclusivity in fashion.

“Goop is a wellness site with self-care at its core. Our focus is helping women make choices that make them feel good and eliminate shame in their lives, whether that’s linked to sexual health, age, or stress,” Paltrow says.

“I believe we're stronger if all archetypes are included, and we're all able to be seen and lift each other up, which is why we partnered with Universal Standard to create this line of beautifully made pieces. We’re excited to work with them in this new capacity, and hope this collaboration continues to push this conversation into the mainstream.”

Co-founder of Universal Standard, Alexandra Waldman added: “Our goal is to bring true inclusivity to every part of the industry.

“For Universal Standard, our mission of fashion freedom shouldn’t be isolated to our brand — we want everyone to embrace the idea that all women, regardless of size, deserve equal access. We’re thrilled to work with Goop to continue manifesting this idea and changing the industry for the better.”

Universal Standard launched in 2015 as a seasonless, direct-to-consumer brand that wanted to bridge the gap between straight and plus size clothing by launching a range of basic items in a vast array of sizes.

Goop isn’t the first brand that it has worked with to help spread its message of size inclusivity though.

In July, Universal Standard joined forces with J.Crew to create a capsule collection of clothing available up to a size 5X.

In fact, the plus-size industry as a whole, which is valued at £6.5bn in the UK, is one that more and more fashion brands are beginning to cater to.

Earlier this year Marks and Spencer launched its Curve range, which offers 100 pieces in sizes 18 to 32, while last year Ashley Graham became the first plus-sized woman to feature on Forbes' highest-paid models list."
"Ask a group of people if they'd like to shop more ethically and sustainably, and few would say ""no"". But ask those same people how much they're prepared to pay extra for their clothing and the answers would vary widely.

This was the experience of an e-commerce personalisation service, Nosto, which surveyed 2000 consumers in the UK and US about their attitudes to sustainable fashion. While more than 50 per cent said they want more brands to act sustainably, only one-third of respondents said they were prepared to pay more to do so.

An earlier survey of more than 7000 people aged 16-75 commissioned jointly by the Changing Markets Foundation and the Clean Clothes Campaign found consumers were prepared to pay up to 5 per cent more for ethical fashion.

Curiously, 62 per cent of respondents to the latest survey said they'd actually like a discount for buying ethical goods."

"Her signature aesthetic of long-hemmed, high-necked, frilled smock dresses fit into what British Vogue last year deemed the global billion-dollar ""modest fashion"" industry. Loading While modest dress is predominantly associated with Muslim and Orthodox Jewish communities (and dates back to the 8th century Islamic Empire) anybody paying attention to the runway in the past few years will have noticed a shift toward covering up. It seems that whatever their religious or cultural background, it's a look that lot of women really want to wear. According to statistics released this month, there has been a 15 per cent increase in demand for modest fashion outside the United Arab Emirates since 2018. Meanwhile there was a 50 per cent increase year-on-year on long-sleeve blouses with a high neckline, and the midi-length hem in skirts and dresses makes up 53 per cent of total skirt styles, retail analytical company EDITED has found. The trend has been bubbling away for some time. The New York Times dubbed it “radical dowdiness” in 2017, but it’s all become rather high-end.

There’s been the pussybow blouses at Gucci, floor sweeping dresses at Valentino and buttoned-up shirting at Christian Dior. A calf-length silk skirt from Sydney designer Lee Mathews has been spotted on many a local fashion editor and Kym Ellery’s signature swathes of fabric and swooshing hemlines at her now Paris-based label Ellery have long fitted the modest aesthetic. Modanisa, a modest fashion e-commerce platform, has launched modest fashion weeks around the world, including in Dubai and London. Then there are the modest fashion influencers, such as Dina Tokio, who has 1.3 million followers on Instagram. Luxury online retailer Net-a-Porter now has a modest category on its website and Nike has released a high performance hijab range. Somali-American model Halima Aden, who has walked for the likes of Italian fashion label Max Mara and was the first hijab-wearing supermodel to feature on the cover of British Vogue, will launch her own line of headscarves at Istanbul Modest Fashion Week this month. Sydneysider Tarik Houchar launched Hijab House in 2011 following a dismal shopping trip with his sister after she decided to wear the hijab (the only person in his family to choose to do so).

Loading “The market was dominated by archaic designs that didn’t reflect her personal taste and her identity as a young Muslim living in the West,” says Houchar, whose brand now has a store in the Sydney suburb of Greenacre as well as an online presence. He's planning further expansion. Houchar says it is an exciting time to be working in the modest fashion industry. “The modest fashion industry is not only growing faster than any other fashion segment, it’s also constantly evolving and changing, making room for new products and ideas on a daily basis."" However, he wants Australian fashion bodies to better recognise modest fashion brands, rather than just applauding other brands for offering the occasional modest style. “It’s great that mainstream brands are capitalising on modesty and the hijab industry, [but] I find it quite problematic to give them full credit for it,” he says.

High necklines at Gucci. “Modest fashion entrepreneurs have been paving the way in the industry for years. And I really want to see modest brands be given the same respect and platform [as] mainstream brands. Unfortunately, institutionally, we’re still quite far away from that point.” Larissa Marriner, who converted to Islam to marry her husband Neish last year, found it relatively easy to find a modest wedding dress for her ceremony, settling on an ankle length, long-sleeve lace one from Australian label Macgraw. “I read after I chose the dress that the designers are two sisters from Sydney – so I appreciated that local connection,” says Marriner, an Australian who lives in Sydney. She adds that she hasn’t had to overly adapt her wardrobe since converting to Islam. There’s also a danger of lumping entire communities across the globe into one segment in the excitement for modest fashion, as influential fashion industry website The Business of Fashion noted recently. “By aggressively attempting to reach one particular segment of the Muslim market, brands may inadvertently lose others who don’t personally identify with modesty wear advertising or the style of certain targeted products,” wrote Nathaniel Plummer. Building a global brand and appealing to women of all backgrounds is something New Zealand fashion designer Maggie Hewitt of Maggie Marilyn has form in. Along with Ellery and Lee Mathews, Maggie Marilyn is stocked on The Modist, a modest fashion website started by Algerian financier Ghizlan Guenez in 2017.

A hot pink dress from Maggie Marilyn. The website stocks a mix of cult, cool and super luxe brands such as Emilia Wickstead (popular with the Duchesses Sussex and Cambridge for her ladylike mid-calf lengths) and Marni, the Italian label often spied on arty-intellectual types. Guenez started the site because she had previously struggled to find clothes that were both modest and fashionable. She says the reaction to the site has exceeded her expectations, saying the luxury fashion market for modest dressers had been entirely ""under-served"". ""We have been heralded as a platform that is innovative in terms of the concept and positioning, as well as our non-denominational approach to modesty and championing of diversity ... We are unapologetic about owning modesty and this space, but also understand luxury fashion and therefore the resonance, I believe, comes from doing both without one happening at the expense of the other,"" says Guenez. ""The brands have also shown much excitement for The Modist. We are a brand that bridges the gap between them and the global modest market ... [and] bring a new aesthetic to the fore, one that shows brands in a new light and renders them more relevant and exciting to modest dressers whilst respecting their DNA and brand integrity."" Designer Hewitt has carved out a niche for her exuberant, and sustainable, brand – all pink ruffles, silk pyjama sets and high necklines (“more is more,” she says). The Modist has become an important stockist, and the Middle East is also one of her most important markets.

“The big Western retailers are cottoning on to what a big market [modest fashion] is,” she says, noting the various markets her brand is available in each have their own preferences. Loading For Hewitt, who says she’s personally drawn to the modest aesthetic (“there’s something so alluring about not showing much skin, in a way it’s more empowering”), there is a parallel between her brand’s commitment to sustainability with a transparent supply chain and using recycled materials, and designing pieces for a broad section of women around the world. “We’ve seen the rise of the conscious consumer and it’s growing so quickly. People buy into brands they’re inspired by … customers email us and challenge us on things we say we’re going to do and brands need to respect how switched on the customer is,"" she says. “A person from any background or culture should be able to buy into a designer and luxury brand and feel on trend and beautiful … I feel proud to cater to so many cultures."""
"Twitter users have accused fashion brands Topman and PrettyLittleThing of “ripping out” labels from other brands and re-selling items with their own tags.

On Friday, one Twitter user — who uses the Twitter handle @katiewaddilove — posted a photograph of a pair of Pretty Little Thing tracksuit bottoms on social media.

“So @OfficialPLT are selling £6-£12 fruit of the loom joggers, cutting the labels out and charging £20 for products they haven't even manufactured themselves?” the Twitter user captioned the photograph.

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.

The image appears to show the remnants of a label belonging to American clothing brand Fruit of the Loom.

The user also posted a product image from Amazon of a pair of men's Fruit of the Loom tracksuit bottoms. The garment is currently on sale for £5.75.

The post has since received over 10,000 retweets and 41,000 “likes” from Twitter users, with several sharing images of clothing from fashion brands they also accuse of replacing others' tags with their own.

One Twitter user, who uses the handle @Joanniee_Louise, posted an image which appeared to show a dress, she claims is sold by PrettyLittleThing, which had the tag of another brand still attached.

“This isn’t the first time...I ordered a dress from them and they just covered the tag with a sticker but kept the other brands tag on. I was told not to return but to bin it,” the user captioned the post.

One user filmed herself cutting out a PrettyLittleThing label from a garment to reveal another label from a different brand underneath.

Photographer Alex Hughes posted a photograph of a white embroidered flag hoodie, sold by Topman, with what appeared to have the remnants of a Fruit of the Loom label.

Speaking to The Independent, Hughes says he came across the label after it started to irritate his skin.

“The first few times I wore it I found the label where it says Topman was quite itchy so I went to cut it out and noticed there was the remains of another label underneath,” he explains.

“After looking further into it I noticed it was the same Fruit of the Loom brand as the one in the tweet!

“Considering the fact that I paid the original price of £30 for it, I don’t think it’s particularly fair that the actual hoody itself is probably worth about £8-12 and then they’ve just embroidered it and inflated the price.

Hughes claims he contacted Topman about the labelling issue but didn’t receive a response.

“I then tried leaving a review of the product online and they took it down because it “was too negative” - which is ridiculous as it is a CUSTOMERS review, not something that they should be able to change because it doesn’t make them look good,” he adds.

Several social media users have expressed their outrage over the images, with some revealing they were boycotting the brands.

“That’s so bad! Companies like these give the industry a bad rep just after money [sic]! No care in the actual design or hard work that goes into the construction...” one user tweeted.

“Never cancelled an order so quick [sic],” added another.

The Independent has contacted PrettyLittleThing and Topman for comment."

A calf-length silk skirt from Sydney designer Lee Mathews has been spotted on many a local fashion editor and Kym Ellery’s signature swathes of fabric and swooshing hemlines at her now Paris-based label Ellery have long fitted the modest aesthetic. Modanisa, a modest fashion e-commerce platform, has launched modest fashion weeks around the world, including in Dubai and London. Then there are the modest fashion influencers, such as Dina Tokio, who has 1.3 million followers on Instagram. Luxury online retailer Net-a-Porter now has a modest category on its website and Nike has released a high performance hijab range. Somali-American model Halima Aden, who has walked for the likes of Italian fashion label Max Mara and was the first hijab-wearing supermodel to feature on the cover of British Vogue, will launch her own line of headscarves at Istanbul Modest Fashion Week this month. Sydneysider Tarik Houchar launched Hijab House in 2011 following a dismal shopping trip with his sister after she decided to wear the hijab (the only person in his family to choose to do so).

Loading “The market was dominated by archaic designs that didn’t reflect her personal taste and her identity as a young Muslim living in the West,” says Houchar, whose brand now has a store in the Sydney suburb of Greenacre as well as an online presence. He's planning further expansion. Houchar says it is an exciting time to be working in the modest fashion industry. “The modest fashion industry is not only growing faster than any other fashion segment, it’s also constantly evolving and changing, making room for new products and ideas on a daily basis."" However, he wants Australian fashion bodies to better recognise modest fashion brands, rather than just applauding other brands for offering the occasional modest style. “It’s great that mainstream brands are capitalising on modesty and the hijab industry, [but] I find it quite problematic to give them full credit for it,” he says.

High necklines at Gucci. “Modest fashion entrepreneurs have been paving the way in the industry for years. And I really want to see modest brands be given the same respect and platform [as] mainstream brands. Unfortunately, institutionally, we’re still quite far away from that point.” Larissa Marriner, who converted to Islam to marry her husband Neish last year, found it relatively easy to find a modest wedding dress for her ceremony, settling on an ankle length, long-sleeve lace one from Australian label Macgraw. “I read after I chose the dress that the designers are two sisters from Sydney – so I appreciated that local connection,” says Marriner, an Australian who lives in Sydney. She adds that she hasn’t had to overly adapt her wardrobe since converting to Islam. There’s also a danger of lumping entire communities across the globe into one segment in the excitement for modest fashion, as influential fashion industry website The Business of Fashion noted recently. “By aggressively attempting to reach one particular segment of the Muslim market, brands may inadvertently lose others who don’t personally identify with modesty wear advertising or the style of certain targeted products,” wrote Nathaniel Plummer. Building a global brand and appealing to women of all backgrounds is something New Zealand fashion designer Maggie Hewitt of Maggie Marilyn has form in. Along with Ellery and Lee Mathews, Maggie Marilyn is stocked on The Modist, a modest fashion website started by Algerian financier Ghizlan Guenez in 2017.

A hot pink dress from Maggie Marilyn. The website stocks a mix of cult, cool and super luxe brands such as Emilia Wickstead (popular with the Duchesses Sussex and Cambridge for her ladylike mid-calf lengths) and Marni, the Italian label often spied on arty-intellectual types. Guenez started the site because she had previously struggled to find clothes that were both modest and fashionable. She says the reaction to the site has exceeded her expectations, saying the luxury fashion market for modest dressers had been entirely ""under-served"". ""We have been heralded as a platform that is innovative in terms of the concept and positioning, as well as our non-denominational approach to modesty and championing of diversity ... We are unapologetic about owning modesty and this space, but also understand luxury fashion and therefore the resonance, I believe, comes from doing both without one happening at the expense of the other,"" says Guenez. ""The brands have also shown much excitement for The Modist. We are a brand that bridges the gap between them and the global modest market ... [and] bring a new aesthetic to the fore, one that shows brands in a new light and renders them more relevant and exciting to modest dressers whilst respecting their DNA and brand integrity."" Designer Hewitt has carved out a niche for her exuberant, and sustainable, brand – all pink ruffles, silk pyjama sets and high necklines (“more is more,” she says). The Modist has become an important stockist, and the Middle East is also one of her most important markets.

“The big Western retailers are cottoning on to what a big market [modest fashion] is,” she says, noting the various markets her brand is available in each have their own preferences. Loading For Hewitt, who says she’s personally drawn to the modest aesthetic (“there’s something so alluring about not showing much skin, in a way it’s more empowering”), there is a parallel between her brand’s commitment to sustainability with a transparent supply chain and using recycled materials, and designing pieces for a broad section of women around the world. “We’ve seen the rise of the conscious consumer and it’s growing so quickly. People buy into brands they’re inspired by … customers email us and challenge us on things we say we’re going to do and brands need to respect how switched on the customer is,"" she says. “A person from any background or culture should be able to buy into a designer and luxury brand and feel on trend and beautiful … I feel proud to cater to so many cultures."""

"Major art museums have realised there is much to learn from clothing that is both religiously coded and fashion forward.

Earlier this year the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, hosted a fashion exhibition inspired by the Catholic faith titled Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and Catholic Imagination. With more than 1.6 million visitors, it was the most popular exhibit in the Met’s history.

And now the de Young Museum of San Francisco has the first major exhibit devoted to the Islamic fashion scene. Contemporary Muslim Fashions (22 September 2018-6 January 2019) displays 80 swoon-worthy ensembles – glamorous gowns, edgy streetwear, conceptual couture – loosely organised by region and emphasising distinct textile traditions. This exhibit is a bold statement of cultural appreciation during a time of heightened anti-Muslim rhetoric.

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.

In studying how Muslim women dress for over a decade, I realised a deeper understanding of Muslim women’s clothing can challenge popular stereotypes about Islam. Here are three takeaways.

1. Modesty is not one thing

While there are scattered references to modest dress in the sacred written sources of Islam, these religious texts do not spend a lot of time discussing the ethics of Muslim attire. And once I started to pay attention to how Muslims dress, I quickly realised that modesty does not look the same everywhere.

I travelled to Iran, Indonesia and Turkey for my research on Muslim women’s clothing. The Iranian penal code requires women to wear proper Islamic clothing in public, although what that entails is never defined. The morality police harass and arrest women who they think expose too much hair or skin. Yet even under these conditions of intense regulation and scrutiny, women wear a remarkable range of styles – from edgy ripped jeans and graphic tees to bohemian loose, flowy separates.

Indonesia is the most populous Muslim nation in the world, but Indonesian women did not wear head coverings or modest clothing until about 30 years ago. Today, local styles integrate crystal and sequin embellishments. Popular fabric choices include everything from pastel chiffon to bright batik, which is promoted as the national textile.

When it comes to Turkey, for much of the last century authorities discouraged Muslim women from wearing pious fashion, claiming these styles were “unmodern” because they were not secular. That changed with the rise of the Islamic middle class, when Muslim women began to demand an education, to work outside the home and to wear modest clothing and a headscarf as they did so. Today local styles tend to be tailored closely to the body, with high necklines and low hemlines and complete coverage of the hair.

A stunning range of Muslim fashions are found in the United States as well, reflecting the diversity of its approximately 3.45 million Muslims. Fifty-eight per cent of Muslim adults in the US are immigrants, coming from some 75 countries. And US-born Muslims are diverse. For instance, more than half of Muslims whose families have been in the US for at least three generations are black.

This diversity provides the opportunity for hybrid identities, which are displayed through clothing styles.

2. Muslim women don’t need saving

Many non-Muslims see Muslim women’s clothing and headscarves as a sign of oppression. It is true that a Muslim woman’s clothing choices are shaped by her community’s ideas about what it means to be a good Muslim. But this situation is not unlike that for non-Muslim women, who likewise have to negotiate expectations concerning their behaviour.

In my book, I introduce readers to a number of women who use their clothing to express their identity and assert their independence. Tari is an Indonesian college student who covers her head despite her parents’ objections. Her parents worry that a headscarf will make it harder for Tari to get a job after graduation. But for Tari, whose friends all cover their hair, her clothing is the primary way she communicates her personal style and her Muslim identity.

Nur, who majored in communications at Istanbul Commerce University, dresses modestly but is highly critical of the pressure she sees the apparel industry putting on Muslim women to buy brand-name clothing. For her, Muslim style does not have to come with a high price tag.

Leila works for the Iranian government and considers her off-duty clothing choices a form of civil disobedience. Monday to Friday she wears dark colours and long baggy overcoats. But on the weekends she pushes the limits of acceptability with tight-fitting outfits and heavy makeup – sartorial choices that might get her in trouble with the morality police. She accepts the legal obligation to wear Islamic clothing in public, but asserts her right to decide what that entails.

Designers have also used clothing to protest issues affecting their communities. The de Young exhibit, for example, includes a scarf by designer Céline Semaan to protest against Trump’s travel ban. The scarf features a NASA satellite image of several of the countries whose citizens are denied entry to the US, overlaid with the word “Banned”.

3. Muslims contribute to mainstream society

A 2017 Pew survey showed that 50 per cent of Americans say Islam is not a part of mainstream society. But, as Muslim models and Muslim designers are increasingly recognised by the fashion world, the misperception of Muslims as outsiders has the potential to change.

Muslim models are spokespersons for top cosmetic brands, walk the catwalk for high end designers and are featured in print ads for major labels.

Today clothing inspired by Islamic aesthetics is marketed to all consumers, not just Muslim ones. Take the most recent collection of British Muslim designer Hana Tajima for Uniqlo. In its promotional materials, the global casual wear retailer described the garments as “culturally sensitive and extremely versatile” clothing for cosmopolitan women of all backgrounds.

To be hip today is to dress in culturally inclusive ways, and this includes modest styles created by Muslim designers and popularised by Muslim consumers. Fashion makes it clear that Muslims are not only part of mainstream society, they are contributors to it.

"A knitwear company based in the Scottish Borders has seen turnover reach £1 million and sales this year show a year-on-year jump of 45 per cent.

Eribe Knitwear bills itself as “eco-friendly”, championing natural yarns, and after being founded in 1986 is still expanding, with new premises in Melrose and a new showroom coming soon.

It is led by chief executive and founder Rosemary Eribe and says it is enjoying its best trading year ever. Sales manager Shona Forrester said: “To date this year we’re 45 per cent up on sales compared to last year. Buying less, buying better quality is what counts.”

The firm is expanding into new markets such as Taiwan, with sales also coming from the likes of Australia, Europe and Japan.

Around 20 countries stock Eribe’s Scottish designs, with more than 20,000 garments sold every year.

Rosemary Eribe said: “It’s very exciting having a young and enthusiastic team led by 33 years of experience. By expanding slowly, it’s given us very strong roots.

“I’ve always seen it like building a house – starting from the bottom and working up. And we haven’t even started the garden yet.”

The firm highlighted challenges faced by the Scottish textiles industry, adding that Brexit uncertainty has been blamed for poor high street retail sales, but businesses such as Eribe are supporting independent boutiques.

She continued: “There is so much doom and gloom on the high street, but our retailers are selling out of Eribe and coming back for repeat orders throughout the year. Our customers are looking to buy something different and new.”

Working closely with spinners from Yorkshire and Scotland, Eribe works with suppliers from the UK. Investment in Scotland includes new machines for in-house production and plans to grow the workforce.

The company also works with a small, family-run manufacturer in Bulgaria. To avoid the negative effects of Brexit, it is setting up a European distribution centre, ensuring orders are processed efficiently for EU markets, and enabling a lower carbon footprint.

In light of its best trading year to date, a new showroom is planned in the Georgian house in the centre of Melrose where the firm is now based.

According to Scottish Development International (SDI), Scotland exports textiles to more than 150 countries. Additionally, the aim is for Scottish textiles exports – which encompass knitwear such as cashmere and lambswool; woven fabrics including tweed; leather for high-end use; and technical and industrial textiles – to reach £500m by 2020, backed by a targeted £3.5m spend on research and development.

SDI stated: “Huge global brands such as Chanel source textiles from Scotland and seek Scottish expertise.”"

Climate demonstrators blocked roads outside London Fashion Week on Sunday to protest against the “unsustainable” industry.

More than 100 campaigners joined the Extinction Rebellion group’s disruption march as they urged fashion brands to tackle a global “ecological emergency”.

Demonstrations began when a small crowd rallied outside Victoria Beckham’s morning event at the Tate Britain and blocked Fashion Week cars travelling to the show.

A larger group then moved to the event’s main venue at The Strand, in central London, where they blocked several roads carrying a banner with the message “rebel for life”.

Nuala Gathercole Lam, from Extinction Rebellion, said: “We ask the fashion industry, who do you want to listen to, the youth and the future, or the words of our current Prime Minister, whose Government is criminally neglecting the UK’s agreed responsibilities under the Paris agreement in the face of the ecological emergency?

“Now it is time for the fashion industry to hear the call of the youth.”

Protester Lucas Spencer, 17, who travelled to London from Leeds, said: “I feel like it’s everyone’s problem.

“The world is being killed, we know it is, it’s not just dying, there are people killing it and if nobody speaks about it nothing is going to change.

“The fashion industry creates a lot of pollution and the chemicals they use create a lot of waste.”

Leaflets handed out by the group said the protest was a campaign against “the catastrophic consequences of inaction”.

Fashion fans at the show also said they supported an end to “fast fashion” and throwaway culture.

Speaking outside the main venue, Tatiana Phillips, 34, a personal stylist visiting the show, said: “I’m sure there should be something done, there’s a reason, but I don’t think they should go crazy about it.

“Just yesterday at the festival and today they have been talking about sustainable fashion and how it’s important to move that way.”

Student Holly Cudby, 21, who was also visiting, added: “I think it does need to be more sustainable, fast fashion, even though I buy into it.”

Transgenic silk garments that emit a neon glow, sartorial burial suits embedded with flesh-eating microbes, and a bouquet of perfume notes derived from the DNA of extinct flora are just a few of the mind-bending works of design presented in ""Nature,"" this year's Cooper Hewitt Design Triennial program.

Hosted simultaneously in New York and at the Cube design museum in Kerkrade, Netherlands, ""Nature"" looks at how designers are responding to human-induced climate change and the impending environmental crisis.

""Our planet and life as we know it are at a critical juncture. This is not just an exhibition: It's a call to action,"" said Cooper Hewitt director Caroline Baumann, citing recent data illustrating the extremes of climate change. Last year was the world's fourth hottest since records started in 1880, according to NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

The museum's transcontinental effort is a timely amplification of ""Broken Nature: Design Takes on Humanity,"" the current Milan Triennial, which opened in March under chief curator Paola Antonelli.

""Even to those who believe that the human species is inevitably going to become extinct at some point in the (near? far?) future, design presents the means to plan a more elegant ending,"" read the curatorial statement in a provocative call to arms.

Looking at the more than 60 projects in ""Nature,"" reflecting work from 22 countries, it seems that many players in the international design community have already taken note. Each of the works are placed into one of seven categories based on strategy, rather than medium -- Understand, Simulate, Remediate, Salvage, Facilitate, Augment, and Nurture -- and the cast of collaborators ranges from scientists, to engineers, farmers, programmers, artists, philosophers, and more.

That a notable number of works offer solutions to temper the industrial fast-fashion complex comes as no surprise. Clothing has been cited as among the top contributors of pollution and waste globally. In 2018, Quantis found that the footwear and apparel industries account for more than 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions, while, according to a 2016 McKinsey study, nearly 60% of all clothing ends up in landfills or incinerators within a year of its production.

The stylish Ultraboost sneaker, produced since 2016 by Adidas and the nonprofit organization Parley for the Oceans, sources and transforms plastic ocean waste into a spun textile used to make the entire shoe. This innovation and others on display, like ethereal textiles dyed by bacteria and rain, show that beauty and environmental consciousness are not mutually exclusive.

Taking sustainable fashion on step further is Coeio's Infinity Burial Suit -- which has popularly been called the ""mushroom death suit"" by online followers. Embedded with flesh-eating microbes to ensure the decomposition of our bodies, as well as the suit itself, it's an eco-friendly alternative to traditional Western burials, which often involve chemicals harmful to both funeral workers and the planet.

Cars -- because of the shocking amount of harmful pollution they produce, and the materials from which they are made -- were also approached in a variety of thoughtful ways. The selected works -- all contemporary, and in several instances, prototypes of ideas yet to be realized -- display an ingenuity of material innovation, suggesting products that drastically reduce environmental harm, or novel ways of responsibly tapping into overlooked resources. Several projects made use of sea algae, which acts as a natural filtration system and could be harvested and farmed at scale to produce a carbon-negative effect.

Painting with pollution

The French tire manufacture Michelin presented a literal reinvention of the wheel with a new concept prototype. Bright blue and 3D-printed from biodegradable materials, with a form and interior structure inspired by coral growth, the airless and durable design would prevent blowouts and allow for simple repair.

AIR-INK, a project by Anirudh Sharma of Graviky Labs, harvests CO2 emissions from fossil fuel-powered cars, then purifies and distills it down into a carbon pigment that can be used to manufacture ink. (Posters printed using that ink are on view at the exhibition.)

Out in the museum's garden, New York-based artist Sam Van Aken gave live grafting demonstrations with his ""Tree of 40 Fruit,"" which bears 40 rare and local species of fruit, some of which have not been agriculturally produced for centuries. His was just one of a handful of poetic investigations for viewers to consider the fragility and beauty of nature.

At the museum's third-floor gallery, visitors were asked to stop and smell extinct flowers in ""Resurrecting the Sublime,"" a project by scent researcher Sissel Tolaas, artist Alexandra Daisy Ginsberg and Christina Agapakis of the bioengineering firm Gingko Bioworks. To create the scent, the team sampled DNA from specimens of extinct plants cataloged at Harvard University's Herbaria, and approximated their properties based on living plants that carry similar biological structures. The resulting olfactory creation is green and floral with notes of ginger -- an enticing and otherworldly concoction that may soon be bottled and sold as a perfume.

""What was essential for us was not just having a smell but trying to kind of imagine being in a landscape we may no longer be familiar with,"" Tolaas said. ""It's about creating and encouraging a global memory of something we need to try to reconnect with and remember.""

In another project, Ginsberg recreated Sudan, the last male northern white rhinoceros, who died last year, as a 3D rendering. In ""The Substitute,"" a video loop begins as a set of primitive, slow-trotting pixels that slowly sharpen into focus and dissolve back again into thin air.

""We are so obsessed with creating new life forms, that we completely neglect existing ones that are fading away. I'm fascinated by the idea that if we were to bring Sudan back through biotechnology, would that white rhino truly be a white rhino?"" Ginsberg said.

""I've never been this close to a white rhino in my life, and now I own one in my server. Rather than trying to bring him back into technology, perhaps this archival copy is all we deserve. Maybe this is less cruel.""

To Andrea Lipps, associate curator of contemporary design at Cooper Hewitt, triennials serve as a litmus test and pulse-check for changing tides within the industry. ""Nature,"" she says, demonstrates how design can act as a hybrid force and a conduit for related industries to enact real change with everyday applications.

""Overall, what we're seeing reflected is our changing relationship to nature,"" Lipps says. ""For quite a long time, the West has held this colonialist idea and relationship to nature as something to be dominated, controlled and tamed, and somehow nature was seen as very wild and irrational. Now we are shifting to an approach of embracing nature and seeing it as something to work with and care for, and that we are ultimately a part of.""

Yet, the curator was careful to assert that despite shifting tides, design alone can't save the world.

""Design itself is not a panacea. There is much action that needs to be taken at a policy and governmental level to really lead us to the place where we need to be,"" she said. ""We have the knowledge of knowing the impact of our actions now. The discussion has gotten a lot further than the greenwashing from just five to 10 years ago, and we're normalizing that conversation that there does need to be some action around it.""

"Festival fashion was once a case of simply squeezing into your jazziest pair of denim shorts, throwing on a crop top and splashing some glitter on your cheekbones.

Now, it’s a fundamental part of the billion-pound fashion industry that demands our attention every spring ahead of Coachella, the Californian music festival that kickstarts a jam-packed season, followed by the likes of Glastonbury, Reading and Parklife.

Over the years, festival dressing has become synonymous with a “more is more” aesthetic propagated by outlandish co-ords, sequin bodysuits, tasselled hot pants and, well, lots of things you’d probably never wear in your daily life.

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.

But this can fortify a fast fashion culture, which sees shoppers shifting their habits to suit an ephemeral trend circuit that promotes cheap, short shelf-life clothes that cannot be easily recycled.

And in a society that is slowly becoming more attuned to the environmental consequences of such behaviours, the idea of buying something glitzy to wear just for a festival seems out of touch with the eco-conscious zeitgeist.

Some festivals have cottoned onto this and have taken action by pledging to ban glitter from their sites as part of a wider outlaw on single-use plastics – yes, glitter contains plastic.

But short of going all draconian and setting a dress code (“you can only enter if you’d wear that outfit in the office”) there’s little else festival organisers can do to encourage attendees to be more sustainable with their clothing choices. Hence, the onus falls on you, the stylish but environmentally-conscious festival-goer.

Ahead of Coachella, which started 12 April – cue swathes of stylish celebrities swanning around the desert in tie-dye and fringing – The Independent spoke to industry experts to find out how sustainability is informing festival fashion trends this year and what you can do to reduce your sartorial footprint.

The rise of the rental

Despite their best efforts, some people really can’t resist the lure of sequin-soaked garb and lavish bohemian robes, ie, the kind of clothing you could only get away with wearing on a muddy field, cider in hand. If this is you, then Hannah Craggs, senior youth editor at fashion retail analysts WGSN, suggests renting your festival fashion wardrobe.

“With consumer awareness and an appetite for sustainable solutions growing, retail rental has emerged as a viable option,” says Craggs.

“Exploring a millennial mindset, the market is now well acquainted with the sharing economy and while renting apparel is not a new concept in the formalwear sector, a number of new platforms, such as Hire Studio and Wear the Walk, are demonstrating a shift towards renting clothes in a wider context.”

It’s time to make the most of these channels when planning your festival wardrobe, says Craggs, especially if you want to wear something a bit more “out there”, because renting gives you an opportunity to do just that but with an eco-friendly twist.

Glitter, but not as you know it

Glitter is set for a sustainability makeover this festival season. While more than 60 UK festivals are planning to ban it from their sites as of 2021 due to it being primarily made from microplastics, fashion experts say it’s time to find environmentally friendly alternatives.

“Glitter face decoration isn’t going away, but more festival-goers will be seeking out planet-friendly versions like the biodegradable versions sold by In Your Dreams and The Gypsy Shrine,” explains Emily Gordon-Smith, director of consumer product at trends intelligence company Stylus.

One company that might be set to experience a surge thanks to a rise in demand for guilt-free sparkles is Eco Glitter Fun, which sells biodegradable glitter made from a cellulose film from eucalyptus trees.

“Consumers have become far more aware of the plastics crisis in the couple of years since we launched,” a spokesperson for the brand tells The Independent. “They demand sustainable alternatives and we are here to provide them. We find glitter is a fun and engaging way to start a discussion of how to reduce plastic consumption in other areas of their lives.”

Vintage clothing

Second-hand apparel sales are booming, says Gordon-Smith, who adds that repair and renew initiatives are currently “capturing the imagination”, which means that upcycled and pre-loved creations will be even more of a focus over generic fast fashion festival attire.

That means that vintage styles are setting the trend agenda this festival season. This theory has already been proven by global fashion search engine Lyst, which has identified some of the major trends for festival season by analysing the shopping behaviours of more than five million shoppers based on global search data and social media metrics.

These include 1990s staples such as bucket hats (searches are up 54 per cent since January), tie-dye (up by 88 per cent) and neon, which has seen a 96 per cent increase in searches in the past three months.

“We are expecting to see hazy nostalgia at play this season with lots of neo-hippy influences coming through,” adds Gordon-Smith. “Tie-dye is one of the biggest print trends for 2019 and is totally festival-ready.” Woodstock-inspired graphic T-shirts are also set to be popular, she adds.

Practical footwear that isn’t wellies

Wellies have become a festival must-have, but if you live in a city, chances are you don’t wear yours more than a handful of times a year.

The good news is that the latest festival fashion footwear trend is much more versatile, and can be worn just as easily on a beach in St Tropez as a grassy patch by the Pyramid stage.

According to Lyst, views of chunky sport-style sandals have been on the rise over the last three months and are currently up 31 per cent year on year, leading the company to believe this is the go-to footwear trend for festival season. In the last week alone, Lyst has seen a search for “Prada velcro sandals” every seven minutes.

“Sustainability is an issue that more and more customers care about on Lyst,” comments Lyst’s insights reporter, Morane Le Caer.

“While this won’t keep attendees from buying a few new pieces for festivals, mentalities are shifting, and festival goers who do decide to shop for new items will undoubtedly be thinking about the long term, investing in pieces that they know they will cherish and re-wear.” Bring on the chunky sandals.

Sportswear that doubles up as festival wear

It’s the best news for style-savvy cyclists since the advent of coloured helmets: cycling shorts and glasses have made the unlikely transition from humdrum sportswear to fledgling festival fashion trend.

Lyst’s data reveals that the former, a style loved by the Kardashian clan, is having a “big fashion moment” across the globe, with searches for “rainbow biker shorts” up by 350 per cent – not exactly the kind you’d expect to see on a pro cyclist darting through the Tour de France.

As for the glasses, typically worn by cyclists to prevent bugs and dirt from flying into their eyes, Lyst states that futuristic and mirror shades have seen a “huge surge in demand” over the last three months.

It’s kooky and unconventional, but the multipurpose aspect of such items makes them environmentally sound too."

This story is part of ""Smart Creativity,"" a series exploring the intersection between high-concept design and advanced technology.

Fashion has a water problem. A 2017 report found that the industry consumed almost 79 billion cubic meters of water in 2015, enough to fill 32 million Olympic-sized swimming pools. And according to the World Bank, 17-20% of all industrial water pollution is caused by the dyeing or treatment of garments.

But design researcher Natsai Audrey Chieza, who presented a TED talk on pollution and fashion in 2017, is looking to change that.

""When you take a designer and place them in a biological, scientific environment, that's when you get a new way of thinking that can catalyze this kind of innovation,"" she says.

The future of fashion? Stunning textiles dyed with bacteria

Chieza would know. For eight years, she have been at the forefront of the burgeoning biodesign field, finding natural alternatives to unsustainable industrial processes.

Most recently, as a designer-in-residence at the University College London's Department of Biochemical Engineering, she's been developing dyes from Streptomyces coelicolor, a bacteria typically found in the roots of plants.

""Bacteria produce pigment. They either seep it out of their cell walls or they hold it within their cell walls,"" she explains. ""I became very interested with microbes that seep it out because that seemed like a very low-tech way of actually accessing that color.""

To apply these natural dyes, textiles are placed in a petri dish with live Streptomyces coelicolor. After an incubation period, the textiles take on the rich blue, purple and red tones, depending on the pH of the environment where the bacteria are grown.

Because these pigments are derived through the natural excretion process, Chieza says, they can dye textiles with about 500 times less water than traditional dyeing, while cutting the use of harmful synthetic chemicals.

""There have always been artifacts that are sort of beyond 'This material that might look nice.' They tell us about where we are with our technology,"" Chieza says. ""There are new spaces opening up for designers to invite this interdisciplinary sharing of ideas. I think that's where creativity has an amazing space to expand.""

Watch the video above to find out more about Natsai Audrey Chieza's bacterial dyes, and how technology informs her practice."
"Today’s clothing retail industry is driven by “fast fashion” — a business model of break-neck production, frenzied trend cycles and ravenous consumption. But the factories producing the clothes are mired in old-fashioned industrial drudgery, and cleaning up dirty working conditions has been a slog. For several years, however, an innovative system for reforming one of the world's bastions of sweatshop labor has slowly plodded ahead, auditing and remediating some of the world's most dangerous factories. Yet, after about half a decade of a steady evolution in workplace safety and protections for workers, activists say the Bangladesh Accord is now at risk of unraveling under political pressure.

To date, the Accord's enforcement system, run by a transnational team of labor auditors, union and worker advocates, has directed the inspection of about 2,000 factories and identified tens of thousands of hazards, from faulty wiring to foundering building structures. The enforcement system has also led safety trainings and developed worker-led watchdog programs. The Accord has received cooperation and funding from multinational fashion brands, oversight from the International Labour Organization, and grassroots labor support from the global federation IndustriALL, SEIU and AFL-CIO, as well as Bangladesh-based unions. The pact has led to major investments in inspecting and renovating factories according to legally binding standards.

Repairs are completed or underway at more than 1,100 factories, with tens of thousands of fire-related and electrical safety repairs already completed. The projects range from remediating fire exits and detection systems to fixing wiring, to providing Accord-approved engineering assessments. According to the safety staff's follow-up inspections, as of late January, roughly 67 to 89 percent of structural, electrical and fire-related safety remediations had either been verified or were pending verification. Outside funding from signatory brands provides further guarantees that bringing the industry up to standard can be both financially and socially sustainable — a potential model for other manufacturing hubs in the Global South.

For the image-conscious signatory brands like H&M, the program provides a major public-relations boost. But the Accord began as a day of reckoning — born in the wake of the 2013 collapse of Rana Plaza, Bangladesh's worst modern-day industrial disaster. Following the preventable deaths of more than 1,100 workers, the industry channeled its public shame into a legally binding global compact to make work safer for workers in Bangladesh factories. Both international human rights groups and local unions and worker advocates have been involved with the development and en­­forcement process, as well as generally ensuring that the Accord provides a platform for workers' self-advocacy on occupational safety issues.

Political standoff

Today, however, the Accord is dangling by a thread in a political standoff with Bangladesh officials and industry, potentially undercutting years of progress on improving workplace protections.

The Bangladesh government ordered the Accord, which was recently renewed with many newly negotiated enhancements, to cease operating through its Dhaka office at the end of last November, while severely restricting the Accord’s staff from conducting basic regulatory functions, including citing safety violations and sanctioning employers who retaliate against whistleblowers who report hazardous conditions. The program is currently ensnared in a legal impasse with the government and owners under a restraining order from the High Court, pending further court proceedings.

Although the transition plan provides for the transfer of duties to the Bangladesh Remediation Coordination Cell of the Department of Inspections for Factories and Establishments (RCC-DIFE), the Accord’s international staff sees the new authority as a vehicle for corporate capture of the regulatory apparatus. The Accord Steering Committee stated in mid-February that “the RCC-DIFE remains at its earliest stages of development and is not yet prepared to adequately regulate building and occupational safety and health at its current base of [ready-made garment] factories.”

Liana Foxvog of the U.S.-based advocacy group International Labor Rights Forum, told In These Times via email, “The highly obstructive constraints that the government is attempting to impose would strip the globally-respected safety initiative of its ability to operate independently of government and employer control.” In other words, the main purpose of absorbing the accord into a business-friendly regulatory regime is to unravel the Accord’s standards and autonomy.

The stakes of the impasse go beyond the regulations of the Accord itself. The garment workforce in Bangladesh may have seen meaningful improvements in hundreds of factories, but the Accord covers just a fraction of the several thousand supplier factories in Bangladesh, including many that feed into the massive stream of apparel exports that flood Western retail markets. Many local factories have participated in a controversial corporate-friendly alternative to the Accord known as the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, pushed by Gap and other brands, which followed a laxer“voluntary” ethical sourcing model and phased out at the end of 2018.

But the gains under the Accord have been significant and paved the way for bolder advancements in both workplace safety and workers' rights.

In a joint statement supporting the continuation of the Accord last October, the unions involved with the Accord stressed that the progress of the program had been unprecedented, but had further to go.

“The Accord inspection programs are ongoing and have not yet completed their purpose. ... It is important both for the safety of workers and the benefit of the industry that the Accord is allowed to continue to function to ensure the factories are safe to work in,” said Amin Amirul Haque, a leader of one of the union signatories of the Accord, the National Garment Workers Federation in the coalition's statement. “Otherwise consumers and buyers in the international market will again lose confidence in the garments produced in Bangladesh.”

For Bangladeshi factory owners, however, the short-term interest in maximizing profit seems to outweigh the social dividend of safeguarding workers’ lives. Garrett Brown, an industrial hygienist who has assisted with the Accord's local safety-training programs, tells In These Times that advocates are mainly concerned that the takeover by the Bangladesh government will undo past progress “for the same reasons that were problems before Rana Plaza, which is that the government is heavily influenced by the garment industry and doesn't want to do anything that would reduce exports.” There is a tension between local suppliers, who are subjected to the rigors of the regulatory process and responsible for making required retrofits, and the brands that use the Accord to hold suppliers accountable—reflecting the growing sensitivity of Western brands over the disturbing pattern of labor abuses overseas.

At the same time, Brown stresses that the fashion brands are keen on upholding the Accord because they see a business case for investing in safety: For image-conscious companies, the Accord has become, ”the goose that laid the golden egg,"" says Brown. ""They don't have to worry about being subject to campaigns by labor rights organizations and concerned consumers.”

Yet, local suppliers stand to lose as well: The Accord's Chief Safety Inspector has warned that, were the Accord blocked from continuing its factory audits, hundreds of under-performing facilities could no longer be monitored, and would subsequently be barred from doing business with signatory brands. Dozens of factories have already been terminated from the system due to failure to meet safety standards. In the future, without independent staff on the ground, labor activists fear that the Accord authorities will lack both the capacity and the will to intervene as forcefully in the future.

An abrupt end to the Accord could stifle Bangladesh’s already embattled labor movement. Despite general hostility toward labor activism by bosses and the government, with frequent crackdowns on strikes and union organizing efforts, the Accord encouraged the formation of autono­­mous worker safety committees, which have provided a rare source of legal leverage on major issues of worker safety.

Kalpona Akter of the Bangladesh Center for Workers’ Solidarity, which has long campaigned for reforms in the global supply chain, stated, “We need the Accord to continue to work. It has made enormous change and made our workers’ lives safer. Now workers have right to say NO to dangerous work. If the Accord would have to leave the country it would mean putting workers lives in danger again and we should not take this risk.”

The threat of the Accord's Dhaka office being forced to close coincides with a crackdown on worker protests across the garment industry. Following a surge of strikes and protests in December 2018 and January 2019, about 11,000 workers lost their jobs, according to the global labor federation IndustriALL. The brutal suppression underscored that the meaning of “safety” at work is about much more than just fire exits. Some factories affected by the crackdown were producing for brands that are also signatories to the Accord—signifying how the struggle for safe workplaces and just jobs are interwoven at the bottom of the global supply chain. Foxvog noted that solidarity protests in Europe and the United States made demands on the brands: that they ""press their suppliers to drop all charges, rehire all dismissed workers with back wages, and denounce this crackdown on workers’ rights,” in addition to protecting the Accord.

Christine Miedema of the Netherlands-based Clean Clothes Campaign, says via email from Amsterdam that, “Brands will remain responsible for safety in their supply chains, whatever the outcome of the court proceedings in Bangladesh ... The Accord is a binding contract for brands, which they cannot leave before having fulfilled all their obligations.”

Since the Accord was spawned by a movement, not a state decree, the power of the agreement will endure through the social contract that it embodies for the fashion industry: the social imperative to break the link between cheap prices in the shop window, and the cost of workers’ lives on the shop floor."

Victoria Beckham has become the latest high-profile designer to ban exotic animal skins from her designs, in a move welcomed by animal rights campaigners.

The decision sees Beckham follow in the footsteps of brands including Chanel and Vivienne Westwood.

Beckham's line has never made use of animal fur, but her latest pledge means clothing and accessories made from alligator, snake and lizard skins will be discontinued from fall 2019.

""Victoria Beckham will cease the use of exotic skins in all collections as of AW19. The Victoria Beckham brand has never used fur in its clothing or accessories collections and confirmed last year that the brand will remain fur free,"" Beckham's brand told WWD in a statement.

CNN has contacted the brand for comment.

The decision was hailed by animal rights group PETA, who have campaigned against the use of snake skins in the fashion industry.

""Behind every crocodile, alligator, snake, or lizard handbag or pair of shoes is a violent death,"" PETA UK's director Elisa Allen said.

""Victoria Beckham's decision to ban exotic skins will spare countless remarkable animals immense suffering, and PETA UK calls on other luxury brands to follow her kind example,"" she added.

It also follows a continued trend of brands shunning products made from animals.

Last September's London Fashion Week was the first to be fur-free, after organizers announced that none of the 80 designers featured intended to use the material.

This season's London Fashion Week begins on Friday."
"Whangārei fashion designer Shelly Matiu is stitching together a successful career with her passion for denim and the environment.

Matiu upcycles unwanted denim to recreate garments into modern dresses, fitted jackets, overalls and puffer vests under the label Ano - Anoagainreuse.

""There's so much denim that goes into landfill,"" she said.

""A lot of people these days shop at fast fashion places so brand new jeans are just $9, then they just end up at op shops, who can't sell them.

""People don't understand whatever we put into landfill won't break down. The less things that go to landfill the better.""

Ano means ""again"" in te reo Māori.

Matiu's work, which has been described as a ""slow, ethical and sustainable eco fashion label"", also involves upcycling damaged furniture and creating cushions, table coasters and soft toy mats.

She has been selected to showcase her garments in the Eco Fashion Runway, part of this year's Hutt Winter Festival, which kicked off yesterday.

The fashion runway features 12 designer collections from around New Zealand, who fit the criteria of eco, ethical, upcycled, locally produced and/or New Zealand made.

The three-day festival is presented by Hutt City Council in partnership with The Dowse Foundation.

Matiu, who is from Ngāpuhi descent, originally lived in Wellington, before moving to Auckland to work on films, TV, and theatre as an audio engineer, boom operator and in the wardrobe department.

In 2000, she moved back to Whangārei where she did a brief stint at her friend's op shop turning the odd garment into upcycled garments for fun.

She moved back north last year and her passion for fashion has taken off. She was asked to present a small range at an Eco Journey event after a pair of jeans she had upcycled for herself was spotted by the event organiser.

Since then she was offered an ideal workspace and orders have started coming in.

Matiu, who has been sewing since the age of 8, sources her denim from various op shops and clothing swaps then sets about deconstructing them.

""Designing clothing has always fascinated me. I would see garments on TV and would make them myself.

""The garments are pieces of art someone can wear. And because they last a lifetime they can be passed on to people, which is what we used to do with garments.""

Matiu said she's excited to be showcasing her collection in the upcoming fashion show.

Hutt City Council community arts and culture adviser Pippa Sanderson said 6000 people attended last year's festival, which also includes more than 20 workshops, a street party, talent quest and an art market.

""We can't wait to enliven the community through arts and culture, providing accessible, free or low-cost family friendly activities and entertainment,"" she said.

Matiu's range will also be on display at the Dargaville Wearable Arts event on September 13 and 14."

By now, it's clear that every global fashion brand wants to harness the massive spending power of China's urban middle class. But Shanghai Fashion Week suggests that there's also a growing force of domestic talent ready to tip the scales.

Chinese designers are having their moment, both at home and at the ""Big Four"" (fashion weeks in New York, London, Paris and Milan). And this Spring-Summer 2019 season has underscored their influence, especially among an outspoken, style-conscious millennial generation.

Shanghai Fashion Week is still considered secondary to the main circuit, but it has grown considerably since its 2003 debut, nearly doubling in size in the past five years.

Hip-hop wear and Balenciaga-inspired sneakers may rule Shanghai's streets, but inside the tents, commercial brands and emerging designers brought diverse perspectives to what ""Made in China"" truly means. Here are four takeaways from the event.

Independent designers have more clout

Angel Chen returned from her debut at New York Fashion Week to put on a stunning presentation against a neon backdrop, attracting hundreds of camera-ready fans. British fashion blogger Susie Bubble, meanwhile, shared the creations of Chinese labels with swelling global influence -- like Shushu/Tong, which was once picked up by US retailer Opening Ceremony, and promising newcomers like 8on8 -- with her half a million Instagram followers.

On the main stage, well-known stylists teamed up with commercial brands for prestige points, and mass-market partnerships gave an edge to designers' marketing efforts. Budweiser partnered with New York-based brand Private Policy, led by Parsons graduates Haoran Li and Siying Qu, while Converse cemented its role in China's streetwear culture by partnering with London-based menswear designer Feng Chen Wang for a capsule collection.

Overseas independent labels gained ground too. Renowned Paris Fashion Week tradeshow Tranoï gave visitors a preview of its official launch in China (as part of the next installment of Shanghai Fashion Week, in April 2019), with an immersive fashion show and exhibition featuring five European designers.

'Made in China' reimagined

The fashion industry has long strived to define what makes Chinese design Chinese, with domestic brands and creatives working to reclaim the ""Made in China"" tag that typically implies counterfeits and poor quality. This year, a state-run TV network broadcast the show ""Fashion Master,"" which took a stab at the issue through a ""Project Runway""-like competition that encouraged emerging designers to incorporate symbols of Chinese heritage into their designs.

But while many of the show's contestants -- as well as previous generations of young designers -- exhibited more exaggerated and obvious examples of Chinese imagery in their work, the looks on display at Shanghai Fashion Week runway were decidedly more mature, modern and subtle. This transition reveals a budding confidence in what it means to be a contemporary Chinese designer.

Highlights here included a thought-provoking exhibition, ""New China Chic: A Fusion of East and West,"" which featured the mixing of plaid and Asian-inspired prints from LVMH Prize nominee Snow Xue Gao. Menswear brand Pronounce merged the influences of Shanghai and Milan, the cities between which the label is based.

On the runway, Samuel Gui Yang presented a gentle blend of tailored women's jackets and traditional Chinese button knots, Angel Chen dotted her Qing-Dynasty-meets-future aesthetic with elaborate dragon prints on men's bodysuits, while Ximon Lee showcased an androgynous, pastel-toned ode to 1930s Chinese motifs and traditional cheongsam dresses.

Direct to Z-lennials

While the main stage shows were invitation-only, edgy platforms for up-and-coming designers, like Labelhood, are attracting bigger and younger crowds with huge purchasing potential and social media clout. This, among other things, gave young emerging designers like Susan Fang and Pronounce a shot at wider publicity among the next generation of Chinese consumers.

Powerful online influencers and selfie-hungry Gen Z and millennial consumers arrived in droves to document the highly anticipated runway events on WeChat, Weibo and the video platform Douyin.

Labelhood relocated to the Power Station of Art, one of Shanghai's most impressive contemporary art museums, creating room for interactive fashion presentations and its first public market for up-and-coming designer, jewelry and lifestyle brands. Elsewhere, young, mobile-first shoppers had access to a new online-to-offline collaboration between Shanghai Fashion Week and the Alibaba-owned e-commerce giant, Tmall, which put around 20 designers in the public eye by boosting traffic to their online stores via a special brand channel.

Shades of sustainability

In a market where cheaply produced, fast fashion is just a click away, sustainability may seem like a hard sell. Yet, it continues to be a growing force at Shanghai Fashion Week, as both designers and industry leaders recognize China's unique potential to reduce fashion's environmental footprint.

Platforms like Greenevery[day] are attracting eco-conscious thought leaders to their workshops and exhibits, with previous participants having since graduated to the big stage.

This season, Zhang Na, of womenswear brand Fake Natoo, returned to the runway with her brand Reclothing Bank and a collection made from upcycled materials and environmentally friendly fabrics. Zhang, who has previously collaborated with brands like Starbucks and local food delivery giant Ele.me, brought elegance and bright colors to sustainable fashion in her ""Heaven Sent"" line, mixing the likes of cotton, linen, recycled PVC and fibers made from wood pulp.

Key global players in the sustainability fashion movement, including Kering and Woolmark, came together with Modern Media Group's Shaway Yeh (founder of sustainability-focused agency Yehyehyeh and co-creative director of the video channel Nowness) to discuss China's future role. On the production side, Yin Jiajue, the millennial general manager of a manufacturing company that produces garments for brands like Patagonia and Uniqlo, used the Business of Fashion China Summit to show audiences what sustainability in Chinese factories could look like."
"""We realised that more people were becoming aware of the issues in big business, particularly behind the scenes in how things were made and impacted on people and the planet, but the information wasn't out there to make better shopping choices,"" she said.

Ms Capponi said she was surprised when she heard she had made the list along with women she considered her heroes.

""They're all so unique but they all share such a powerful voice and they're taking meaningful action on things they care about, which really resonates with me,"" she said.

Good On You gives clothing companies an ethical rating based on labour impact, environmental impact and animal welfare to help shoppers make more informed purchases online or in-store.

The app rates 2200 fashion brands such as Louis Vuitton (""Not good enough"") and H &M (""It's a start"") based on how ethical they are.

It also takes into account whether brands are proactively improving how sustainable they are or whether they are engaging in ""negative citizenship"" such as fighting legislation that would increase supply chain transparency.

More than 300,000 people have used the database's app or website, according to Good On You.

Online luxury fashion retailer Farfetch started using Good On You ratings in May to help customers decide which products to buy.

Ms Capponi said the app had zeroed in on the largest segment of shoppers – women in their 20s and 30s – who are becoming more concerned about whether their clothes are made sustainably and ethically.

""We’re appealing to growing sentiment among younger generations in Millennials and Gen Z who are more conscious of issues in big business and more compelled to do something about it,"" she said."
"UK e-store Body4Real updated its collections to include a new line of 100% organic cotton clothing for men and women. All pieces are made of pure untreated cotton from eco-friendly farms to ensure high standards of safety and environmental responsibility.

Burnham, United Kingdom - November 6, 2018 /PressCable/ —

Body4Real, an online retailer based in the United Kingdom, launched an updated line of organic cotton clothing for customers interested in high-quality pieces made from 100% certified organic cotton from sustainable plantations. These organic fibers are not only environmentally responsible, but also ideally suited for individuals suffering from dermatitis, eczema, rashes, allergies and other skin conditions.

More information can be found at https://www.body4real.co.uk/brands/Body4real-Organic-Clothing.html.

As more and more people are becoming aware of the potential dangers associated with chemically treated clothing, the popularity of organic fibers has grown considerably in recent years. Organic cotton offers a variety of benefits over standard cotton, including minimum risk of allergies, increased skin protection, suitability for a wide range of skin conditions, and high environmental responsibility. Due to the untreated nature of the fibers, all pure organic cotton clothing is completely biodegradable.

The new Body4Real organic cotton collection is made of cotton fibers harvested in environmentally friendly, sustainable farms. Partnering cotton suppliers use exclusively ethical agriculture practices, working their fields with farm animals, using organic fertilizers, and eliminating any type of synthetic chemicals from the growth or treatment processes.

To ensure maximum standards of quality and environmental responsibility, each stage of the production process has received the GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard) certification. From spinning and weaving to manufacturing and distribution, the company ensures that its products adhere to the latest safety and environmental standards.

Customers will find men’s and women’s underwear, gloves, pyjamas and other pieces. Due to the elimination of all synthetic chemicals from the production process, the range of available colours is limited to ecru, brown and green.

The recent collection update is part of the e-store’s efforts to provide high-quality clothing for customers both in the UK and internationally. Established in 2001, Body4Real continues to expand its collections to meet the diverse needs of its customers.

A spokesperson for the company said: “We really do care about our customers and spend hours everyday answering queries and dealing with customer service issues. We constantly strive to make internet shopping a safe and enjoyable experience.”

"PARIS (Reuters) - Kering, the French fashion group whose brands include Gucci and Saint Laurent, said it would only work with models aged over 18, as the fashion industry aims to tighten up its ethical guidelines.

Kering said on Wednesday that from 2020 onwards, it would only hire models aged over 18 to represent adults and wear its adult clothing at its fashion shows and photo sessions.

“We believe that we have a responsibility to put forward the best possible practices in the luxury sector and we hope to create a movement that will encourage others to follow suit,” said Kering’s chairman and chief executive François-Henri Pinault."
"The magazine strives to educate and entertain people about sustainable fashion and living.

While many magazines struggle to stay afloat, one publication focusing on sustainability is going from strength to strength and celebrating 10 years in print.

Peppermint, a nation-wide magazine that educates people about sustainable clothing trends, originated from the curiosity of a former fashion designer.

Kelley Sheenan started the magazine from a desk in her laundry while her son was only 18 months old, during a time when sustainability was rarely spoken about.

She said the idea came after she began looking at the fabric she was using for her clothing.

""I wanted to know where it was made, and the more I started to find out about it, the more I knew I didn't want to be part of the industry ... I didn't want to be contributing to the problem,"" Ms Sheenan said.

""I stopped making clothing and was watching documentaries at the time and thought, if I, as a designer, didn't know where my fabric was from, then how on Earth was the public supposed to know?""

She said she combined her skills of graphic design, photography and fashion to create the magazine as a way to educate people.

""I wanted to get the information out to the public in a way that was palatable and fun,"" she told ABC Radio's Maria Hatzakis.

Starting from a laundry

In the early days, Ms Sheenan said she would push her son in a pram while making calls and then work through the night when he slept.

Her office was in a laundry hallway with only a small desk and a computer.

""It was a frantic mash of being a mother and about nine months of research before I slowly morphed into it.

""I became intensely passionate about making it [the magazine] happen by finding writers and photographers to contribute.""

Ms Sheenan said she didn't want the magazine to be judging people or pointing fingers but knew she wanted it to be ""fun and stylish"".

""I wanted people to think it looked interesting and cool, while also learning underneath it all it was about sustainability — that was part of our mission.

""It was important that people learnt that it wasn't about wearing hessian sacks and sandals.""

The first edition of the magazine was given away for free to introduce people to sustainable fashion and outline what sustainable living was.

""After the first magazine I was suddenly inundated with emails asking me when the next one was coming along,"" Ms Sheenan said.

""The first time I was called an editor, I had to google exactly what an editor did — I was doing all of that.""

Keeping a magazine 'sustainable'

It was important for Ms Sheenan and her team to keep the magazine as sustainable as they possibly could.

""We're producing a product so there's definitely a footprint that goes with it.

""We do use paper that has 50 per cent recycled content, it's carbon neutral paper and made in Australia.

""The whole magazine itself is carbon neutral and we've donated more than $20,000 to charity over the past 10 years.""

'It's all been about 1,000 per cent effort'

Her team of four works closely together and Ms Sheenan credits their passion as part of their success.

""We sit alongside magazines which are all owned by major publishing companies,"" she said.

""It's all been about 1,000 per cent effort and working hard.""

She said creating a hardcopy version of the magazine had also been key to their success, which was different to many other magazines in the industry.

""It's a tough industry but I think the reason we've managed to stay afloat is that our readers want to switch off and they're the ones that don't want to be online all the time,"" she said.

""Because we're about slowing down and living a more sustainable lifestyle, it works well with what our readers want.""

Ms Sheenan said she hoped the magazine would continue for other 10 years as she'd yet to feel like she had made it.

""I don't think you ever really feel like you've made it,"" she said.

""I do feel successful, but I wouldn't say I've reached the point where I'm done now or that I've had all the success in the world."""
"A toy brand has caused controversy among parents who claim it promotes gender stereotypes with its range of 'fashion dolls' with interchangable wigs and accessories.

Swiss brand I’M A GIRLY launches in the UK this month, and claims its mission is to 'create strong role models and inspire children to live out their individual ideas and fantasies'.

However, blogger Donna Wishart from Surrey was not impressed, tweeting: 'More like it reinforces and already existing massive gender stereotype that we're trying to steer away from.'

'Whilst they may wish to empower girls, calling the doll I’M A GIRLY is not going to cut it I'm afraid,' another added of the range that's supposedly aimed at both boys and girls, aged four to 16.

The range includes five fashion dolls such as Jasmine who is a 'full-time dreamer and adores everything that glitters', and children can change their doll's look with a range of wigs, outfits and accessories, with new products available every season.

A spokesperson for the brand told MailOnline: 'I’M A GIRLY believes it is important to work with children of both genders in the design of the dolls to express how they want to play.

'The products and designs across the I’M A GIRLY range were developed by a “Kids4Kids” team - a design panel made up of girls and boys aged 9 to 13.

'The fashion dolls have been created with natural proportions and varying skin tones, encouraging inclusion and creative play for children up to early adolescence, therefore moving even further away from the gender stereotyping of previous fashion dolls.'

Despite concern expressed by some parents, the brand has endeavoured to balance a love of fashion with ambition in the dolls' characters.

For instance the brand's website states that fashion doll Lucy, who is passionate about music and can also speak four languages, would one day love to write her own music or be an astronaut.

Despite the brand's mission to 'create strong role models', some critics have claimed that the name and aesthetic promotes gender stereotypes

The brand is also keen to champion diversity and introduced two new dolls with darker skin last month, Jasmine and Kayla.

An Instagram fan commented: 'LOVE what your brand is doing, we need more of these examples in the toy industry! #diversity'.

The brand also strives to be eco-friendly and has designed its packaging so that it can be re-used as a wardrobe for the doll's accessories to minimise waste.

However, some critics claim the brand doesn't go far enough to challenge gender stereotypes by creating a range of dolls so focused on fashion.

'I know there are children that would love it and I didn't expect it to be gender neutral, but they could have a less 'girly' name and dolls who strive for more than clothes and make-up, that's all,'Donna said.

The brand releases new clothing collections to coincide with the seasons for times a year, with more than 150 new accessories in each drop.

Some of its recently launched ranges include unicorn pyjamas, metallic swimsuits and fluffy backpacks.

Theresia Le Battistini, founder of I’M A GIRLY, said she set up the brand after having her daughter as she realised there wasn't much variety in the doll market or products that kept up with the latest trends.

'This is when I decided to bring to life my vision of I’M A GIRLY and bridge the gap between childhood and adolescence, with the aim to empower and inspire children to express their creative and individual ideas and expand their imagination.

'We're so excited to have finally launched in the UK and can't wait to continue to launch with amazing new dolls, clothes and accessories that we have in the pipeline for 2019.'"
"Denim manufacturing doesn’t have a good reputation when it comes to creating excessive levels of waste, but an innovative process spearheaded by the US jeans brand Wrangler may change that.

The company has partnered with Texas Tech University (TTU) and the Valencia-based fabric mill Tejidos Royo to create a foam-dyed, water-free process, eliminating the waste generated from the traditional dyeing processes.

To put this in perspective, the usual way to dye denim that traditional James Dean blue uses a repetitive dip-and-dry method to transfer indigo on to yarn. Multiple vats of water – up to 12, each containing thousands of litres of water – are used and then discarded. By the time they reach a shop, one pair of jeans can have used gallons of water.

The new process, Indigood, eliminates the need for “reduction” chemicals and instead uses a foaming agent. The indigo dye is transferred on to yarns in an oxygen-deprived environment sealed by a nitrogen hood.

Roian Atwood, the senior director of global sustainable business at the parent company Kontoor Brands, describes it as “an elegant one-process step” that “removes 100% of water from the dye process” as well as reducing energy and waste by 60% each. The technology has been in development for a decade, but achieving the depth of colour for indigo denim has only been achieved in the past three years.

“We want this to be adopted by as many brands as possible because it transforms our industry,” says Atwood. While water is still required to grow the cotton yarn in the first place, the brand says it has partnered with several organisations – including the Soil Health Institute and Cotton Connect – to help farmers adopt best practices. The pieces in its first collection using the technology are made from up to 30% recycled cotton. It is a case, says Atwood, of not waiting to be 100%, but to take small steps.

“Sustainability is a journey to making improvement – you can have a small initiative that is seen as a key priority,” he says.

While initially used for the brand’s autumn/winter 2019 Icons collection, priced between £80 and £130, the technology will be rolled out across the brand’s cheaper ranges so that “sustainable products aren’t a choice between basic needs and doing the right thing”, says Atwood. There are also plans for Lee Jeans, also owned by Kontoor, to release Indigood collections later this year.

The announcement comes as the fashion industry is having a major reassessment of processes throughout the often complex supply chain after intense scrutiny of past exploitation and polluting practices. Atwood says that Wrangler conforms to the “buy less, buy better” school of thought. “We will have to clothe ourselves, but at the same time be mindful of how we do that,” he says.

“The fashion industry must do far more to reduce its huge environmental impact – which includes vast water usage and chemical and micro​-​plastic pollution,” says Emma Priestland, a Friends of the Earth campaigner. “Innovation and new technology have an important role to play – and it’s encouraging to see a number of firms looking for ways to reduce their eco-footprint, but we also need government intervention to ensure that the whole industry reduces its impact on the environment. We can all play our part too by rejecting the fast-fashion, throwaway culture and the damage, pollution and waste it causes.”

Atwood says that “durability is by far the No 1 sustainable tenet” when it comes to being a retailer. “If you have a jean jacket for 30 years, that’s a real testament to its construction. If something blows out in eight months, it increases the need for continuous consumption. At the same time we have to mitigate the very real impacts happening up and down the supply chain.”

This has to be done “at an urgent rate in order to meet the global imperative – from climate crisis to lack of biodiversity and good workplace standards to the international manufacturing community”, says Atwood. “There is a way in this resource revolution to make products with far fewer impacts; that is what [Indigood] represents. To take the water footprint in dyeing and take it down to zero is the type of technology upheaval we need.”

• This article was amended on 4 July 2019 because an earlier version referred to the Indigood process using “chemical-free soap”. This has been corrected to say that the process eliminates the need for “reduction” chemicals and instead uses a foaming agent."

Teachers hand out lesson in sustainable style at fashion show BelfastTelegraph.co.uk Two fashion-conscious school teachers are swapping the whiteboard for the boardwalk in the aid of charity. https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/teachers-hand-out-lesson-in-sustainable-style-at-fashion-show-38404547.html https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/article38404545.ece/166a0/AUTOCROP/h342/2019-08-15_new_52573634_I2.JPG

Two fashion-conscious school teachers are swapping the whiteboard for the boardwalk in the aid of charity.

Jude Hawthorne and Maria Allen, who both teach at Wallace High School in Lisburn, are self-confessed devoted followers of fashion, but not at any cost.

They felt that the damage of 'fast fashion' and its impact on the environment was something that needed addressing and, at a more basic level, recognised that the cost of buying new clothes can leave a lot of people feeling the pinch.

From that, CollectEd was born, a fashion show with the emphasis on sustainable shopping, which will take place this evening in Belfast.

Part-time modern languages teacher and mum-of-three Maria (39), who lives in Lisburn with husband Russell, loves fabrics and interiors and runs the pop up Salle Home, specialising in crafts and homewares, and by her own admission has recently dipped her toe into the world of sustainable style.

She said: ""My mum recalls me commenting from my buggy commenting on the ladies' pretty shoes - a pair of brown loafers worn by a Franciscan nun - the obsession was real even in those early days!

""We felt charity shops and clothes swap events were under-utilised and set about plotting an event to engage women in sustainable shopping.

""Models of all ages and clothes sizes were approached and include friends, colleagues, family and women from our respective communities.

""We didn't realise how empowered these models would feel through the invitation and the challenge to carry off an outfit they might never otherwise have looked at in a shop themselves.""

Jude (41) is a religious education teacher and lives in Parkgate with husband Ryan and their three children Ynes, Briagh and Farran.

She says she has been left overwhelmed with the enthusiasm and passion of the models.

""I love how our volunteer models feel empowered throughout this experience,"" she said.

""Their willingness and enthusiasm has been remarkable. Without this, we couldn't have got to this stage. I visit charity shops at least four times a week during summer holidays. I'm always on the lookout for a bargain and we as a family love a rummage. My children are avid charity shoppers too, though they head for the jewellery and purses.

""I'm passionate about building women's confidence, regardless of size and shape.

""Clothing can be empowering and I hope tonight is the springboard for change in how people view fashion.

""We'd encourage people to follow the hashtag #wearmeout for style tips and to learn more about sustainable clothes shopping.""

Tonight's not-for-profit event will take place at restaurant Revolucion de Cuba. Tickets cost £12.50 with all profits going to The Homeless Period, a Belfast-based charity which helps ensure vulnerable women and girls in crisis have access to sanitary products monthly.

The clothing, gathered from local charity shops, will range from vintage right through to new with labels. These items will be available to buy on the evening of the event.

"Baby Sussex will likely have an ""individual"" and ""very modern"" fashion style, according to a former maternity nurse close to the royal family.

Sarah Dixon, who has worked for friends of the royal couple as well as two international royal households, told People magazine Meghan will ditch the traditional style sister-in-law Kate Middleton favours for her children.

""I really don't think this baby will be dressed in smocking and knee-high socks the way Kate's children have been,"" the former maternity nurse said.

She believed Meghan would be more likely to look to her A-list friends, such as Amal Clooney, for inspiration on how to dress her child, Daily Mail reported.

Royal fans are still anxiously awaiting the birth of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's first baby, who is due any day now.

Many are already predicting that their child will not follow the royal tradition of dressing in a ""timeless"" fashion.

Prince George, 5, Princess Charlotte, 4, and Prince Louis, 1, are renowned for wearing a 'traditional' British style for official engagements or photographs - including knee high socks, peter pan collars and knits.

Dixon told People she predicted Meghan will not only look to long-term friend Amal Clooney for inspiration, but also Serena Williams.

Both have children under the age of two and keep them looking current and on-trend.

""I think she will be a very modern parent and will probably take more guidance from friends such as Amal Clooney than she will from Kate,"" she said.

""Meghan has a very individual style, and she will incorporate that when she's shopping for her baby.""

The Duchess of Sussex has favoured designer clothing throughout her pregnancy - many nodding to modern trends.

But the Duchess does occasionally wear high street brands, and tends to lean towards those which are eco-friendly - such as the Veja trainers she wore during the Australian royal tour.

Meghan's love for ethical and sustainable fashion may also play a part in how baby Sussex will be dressed."
"Increasingly, the fashion industry is toying more seriously with sustainability. Kering, the luxury conglomerate which owns Gucci, Saint Laurent and Alexander McQueen has a hard target of 2025 in which time it hopes to have underscored its sustainability strategy across the business from supply chains to biodegradable glitter. Earlier this year it launched a sponsored programme with the London College of Fashion offering a digital open-access course in sustainable luxury fashion. It has been ranked as the most sustainable company in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index.

Yet, for every green shoot there is consternation, say, that Burberry destroyed over £28million worth of leftover stock last year. And that’s merely the depressing tip of a pretty murky iceberg. I know of priceless haute couture samples destroyed at the end of one “season”; a high street head once told me that the reason her global chain stopped copying designer brands was that they couldn’t fathom the logistics of burning so much stock if they lost a legal suit against them. In short, as much as a lot of good is being done within the fashion industry, the broader picture of dubious ethics and production can feel overwhelming. Especially as a consumer, and begs the question, whose problem is it to do something about this?"
"A new generation of rising fashion stars alarmed by the plight of the planet are designing in a radically different way to their elders.

Some of the most interesting shows of Paris fashion week - once notorious for its decadence and waste - have come from millennials and Generation Z creators rejecting the over-consumption they were brought up with.

Marine Serre, whose last catwalk show featured evening dresses made from old bedspreads, warned this time of ""the war on the climate destroying civilisation as we know it"" with a collection created from upcycled and repurposed materials.

The 27-year-old's brand is one of the fastest growing in France, with her sporty but fiercely feminine clothes and accessories snapped up as soon as they are made.

Sales have rocketed five-fold in a year.

For Serre, who won the top LVMH prize in 2017, there is no choice but to change. ""It is an enormous challenge to develop sustainably.

""But the apocalypse can be positive if we use it to stimulate creation, using shells"" or things that are already there ""and cost nothing"", she said.

GLAMOROUS FUTURIST

Berlin-based Ottolinger share a similar ethos and aesthetic.

They recut existing clothes or surplus stock for their glamorous futurist evening and streetwear.

""There is so much overproduction and consumption, we cannot justify it any longer,"" said Cosima Gadient backstage after the duo's Paris show was cheered by critics.

""There is so much out there already in fashion, so much has already been done,"" said her partner Christa Bosch.

""To do something new we would take a garment apart and recut it, or put it back together in our way,"" she Bosch, who met Gadient in fashion school in Switzerland."
"NEW YORK (AP) - The store isn't dead for Home Depot, Kohl's, Best Buy or Target. Many traditional chains have posted strong sales, both online and at stores, as people are in a mood to spend.

What's driving it? A booming economy and companies' own efforts to try to Amazon-proof their businesses. That means making their stores more pleasant, updating their websites and speeding up delivery.

The bounce is a welcome reprieve from talk of a retail apocalypse that flourished after a spate of bankruptcies. Plenty of stores are still struggling, particularly mall clothing chains like Victoria's Secret and department stores like Sears. So is it the start of a sustainable revival?

""It's a retail renaissance for a core group of retailers,"" said Ken Perkins, president of research firm Retail Metrics. ""They're set to glide on this path for a couple of years,"" he added. ""But specialty apparel stores are going to struggle.""

Here are some of the main trends right now.

A STRONG ECONOMY: Shoppers are spending more freely in an economy that has recently grown at the fastest pace in nearly four years. Unemployment is near an 18-year low. Average hourly wages rose 2.7 percent in July from a year earlier.

""There's no doubt that, like others, we're currently benefiting from a very strong consumer environment, perhaps the strongest I've seen in my career,"" Target CEO Brian Cornell told investors. Target saw sales at established stores post the strongest growth in 13 years. Customer numbers in stores and online had their best showing since at least 2008.

Walmart similarly posted the largest increase for same-store sales in more than a decade. Best Buy had its biggest second-quarter same-store sales boost in 15 years. These three retailers, along with Home Depot, Lowe's, Kohl's and others raised their outlooks.

FASTER OPTIONS AT THE STORE: Stores are catering better to time-conscious shoppers with delivery and pickup services that take advantage of their store networks.

Walmart has curbside grocery pickup at 1,800 stores, and is expanding its pickup towers, which serve up items ordered online within seconds. Target says it's reduced the wait time for curbside pickup to 2 minutes. Target has also found where it's testing same-day delivery for store shoppers the average basket size is more than $200, the highest of any service it provides.

Though Walmart has dropped mobile checkout at its namesake stores, others like Macy's and Kroger are embracing it. Urban Outfitters says more shoppers than it expected are using self-checkout at its store in Manhattan's Herald Square.

""It's all about instant gratification,"" says Faith Hope Consolo, chairman of Douglas Elliman's retail group.

REVAMPING WEBSITES: Stores are trying to make it easier to browse and discover products online as a way to compete with shoppers accustomed to Amazon.

Walmart overhauled its website with a special emphasis on fashion and home goods, and has special sections dedicated to Lord & Taylor as part of their partnership and for the outdoor brand Moosejaw it bought last year. Consolo cited Nordstrom and Bloomingdale's as others that have made their sites easier to shop.

""Retailers are putting together an internet-friendly site that's easy to navigate,"" said C. Britt Beemer, chairman of America's Research Group.

POWERFUL EXCLUSIVE BRANDS: Shoppers are responding to the brands stores have developed to differentiate themselves - and which have better profit margins.

Target has been aggressive here, particularly in clothing and home goods. Cornell says these brands are attracting new customers, and the children's clothing brand Cat & Jack generated $2 billion in sales one year after its launch in 2016.

Macy's hopes to have its private label and exclusive brands account for 40 percent of the merchandise it offers in the next few years, up from about 30 percent. And Kohl's teamed up with media company PopSugar on a clothing collection that will hit next month.

""The department stores that have a clear strategy and vision are going to be the clear winners,"" said Greg Petro, founder and CEO of First Insight, which helps retailers set prices.

"Plastic rubbish is often dumped in the sea where it is eaten by marine animals Alamy

The war on waste has begun. Last year’s outrage at plastics polluting the ocean was followed this year with anger at the fashion industry.

MPs questioned bosses of fashion companies during an inquiry into the sustainability of the industry, and the BBC documentary Fast Fashion’s Dirty Secret revealed that 300,000 tonnes of clothing is thrown into landfill each year. Burberry, a luxury goods company, burnt £28 million of unsold stock to protect the brand’s exclusivity.

Some investors expect that fashion brands could one day be taxed as “vice” industries in a bid to stop throwaway culture.

“The problem is becoming massive. We are generating 3.5 million tonnes of waste globally a year and we are not very good at recycling it,” says Esme van Herwijnen,…"

"Founded by three friends with a passion for watersports, Rash'R wanted to bring to market something for similar enthusiasts while contributing to a cleaner ocean.

Each of the rash guards are created with high performance, sustainable techno-fabric made of 100pc recycled polyester which comes from waste, including fishing nets, carpets and other waste collected from the sea.

CEO Tom Cotter said that the idea first came about when himself, Alex Musgrave and John Downey went for lunch after a morning on the water in July 2015.

""We were sick of seeing grey, black and white and thought that we'd love to see a bit more colour. So we had a pizza and look a look,"" he told Independent.ie.

""A lot of other sports had colourfully designed products, from cycling to golf, but the more we looked, colour in rash vests was a niche that was lacking and the big brands weren't really following"".

Memories of that early pizza conference are marked in the packaging of the Rash'R vests - they are actually delivered in pizza boxes - but it would take longer than originally expected to make the concept a reality.

""In our heads, the product development stage would take around three months but fast forward to 18 months later, we had created our first prototype. We really struggled finding fabric manufacturers, clothing manufacturers and printing companies that could suit our needs.

Tom Cotter

""Sustainability kept coming back to us, throughout the various trade shows and research months, and this was something that was really important to us.""

It would be over two years after the co-founders initial chat that the Rash'R website and its products would go live, in October 2017, selling out of 99pc of its stock within two months.

""The most frustrating thing for us is that we kept missing peak seasons; and when we finally launched after buying a ton of stock, we sold out everything within two months.

""But then the problem was that we had we only developed a long sleeve mens vest as a taster products, six versions of it, and all our money had gone into marketing. And we had no cash left.""

It was a steep learning curve for three entrepreneurs who had several years of experience in business, but not with products.

Tom was involved in the business end of the outdoor and recreation industry for more than a decade, Alex founded Irish digital media company Dog Day Media in 2011 while John is the founder of Irish restaurant chain Ramen.

But, at that point with Rash'R, ""it was walk away time"".

""Then I went in for an interview with a company a startup and explained what I had done over the last two years. The investor was on the board and said if I came on as a consultant for six months, he would invest in Rash'R.""

Rash'R launched again in August 2018 with full ranges for mens, womens, children and toddlers and a new website; their products available in retail stores and online, shipping to 24 different countries.

Today, a team of six remote workers span eight countries including Ireland, the UK, the US, Italy, Spain, Vietnam, China, and Australia.

The products have also gained interest from some of the world's top water sport athletes.

""Because we have the sustainable fabric, another big avenue for us is custom clothing for theme event competitions - and for eco friendly resorts,"" said Tom.

""The fact that the products are 100pc eco friendly, and can be printed with any logo or team name, makes it very popular.""

Rash'R is expecting to expand its product range with jackets, t-shirts and hats that are all at least 64pc eco-friendly by June 2019.

"Chances are that while you might remember to take a couple of reusable bags to the supermarket, ask for your drink without a plastic straw, or even pour your morning coffee into a KeepCup, you probably haven’t yet thought about the impact our growing activewear obsession is having on landfills, oceans and the wider environment.

This summer, when I attended LoveFit festival, a three-day adrenaline-inducing fitness festival at St Clere Estate, one particular company caught my eye: League Collective, a sustainable and high-tech sportswear brand for women. Designed by yoga instructor Lilly Richardson – who can usually be found teaching at the likes of Hotpod Yoga or Triyoga in London – all the League Collective garments are made in the UK with 100 per cent recycled fabrics.

“As a yoga teacher in London, I am constantly moving from A to B (biking, running, sweating),” says Richardson. “Over the years I found my clothing has broken pretty quickly or loses shape. So I wanted to create something that can sustain the amount of activity I do.

“Fashion is so fast-moving, and sewing technology is coming on leaps and bounds, but no one is putting pressure on big corporations to deal with the repercussions of producing so fast,” she adds. “The industry has the means and technology to be recycling all of our clothing, but because the demands aren't there, it is still a costly process. If we want to see this world continue, something needs to change.”"

The Royal College of Art held its annual fashion show on Friday with clothes grown from slime mould and plastic storage container handbags among the environmentally-friendly designs and ideas presented by fashion graduates.

Held in London, the event sees students in womenswear, menswear, knitwear, footwear, accessories and millinery unveil their creations.

This year, the show looked at the fashion industry's impact on the environment at a time when many designer houses are seeking to improve their green credentials to appeal to increasingly environmentally conscious consumers.

Student Andrew Bell said: 'Fashion and sustainability have to now be one. You have to be thinking in different ways.

'Fashion has been doing the same thing for so long, we've created the same black top and the same black jeans and we're constantly calling them new...there'a actually nothing new about these items.'

Mr Bell used ultrasonic welding to make clothes that fold completely flat, like coats with non-fray linings. His garments are 'mono-material', meaning they can be recycled more easily.

Margot Vaaderpass also looked at recycling when making tops, coats, trousers and skirts using pineapple leather, biodegradable buttons and knitted tailoring.

'That's one of things that I have taken up as a challenge - how can we create a suit that's knitted,' Vaaderpass said. 'The advantage of that is that we can shape the garment, that means that we can produce less waste.'

Piero D'Angelo hopes fashionistas can one day grow their own garments with slime mould. The living organism is applied on pre-designed patterns, and can grow up to one centimetre (0.39 inch) per hour.

'We designed a 3D printed prototype ... Once we apply the slime mould it will just grow, spread all over, connecting each of those holes,' he said.

'I am fascinated by the idea of growing garments and working with different materials, like living materials but also pushing further the idea of fashion.'

Animal-rights group PETA recently reiterated its criticism of the harvesting of natural furs from animals for use in coats. ‘Tis the season, after all, to lambast people for wearing leather, wool, hide, and fur garments.

On December 13, PETA added “#CanadaGooseKillsDay” to their Twitter account. Currently, PETA has a page on their website dedicated to detailing what coyotes undergo for the sake of the creation of Canada Goose coats. It describes how wild coyotes are trapped and the physical and psychological effects they can suffer, including dehydration, shock, frostbite, and gangrene. PETA says that “Canada Goose jackets are products of cruelty.”

Of course, PETA is not advocating for an end to coats. The same page declares that there is “no need for any of this to occur when so many fashionable, functional fur and down alternatives exist,” linking to a series of faux fur brands.

While at first glance, faux fur and synthetic garments might seem like a reasonable and compassionate alternative to natural fur coats, synthetic coats have a surprisingly large effect on the environment.

The list of materials in the making of one of the winter coats of Donna Salyers’ Fabulous Furs — one of the faux fur brands on PETA’s list of recommended alternatives — includes acrylic, modacrylic and polyester fur trim. Other faux coats boast a similar make-up of synthetic fibers, principally acrylic and polyester.

Polyester, invented in the early decades of the twentieth century as a cheap and more insulating alternative to cotton and wool, shortly overtook the competition and became one of the most popular fabrics. In the fashion world, polyester, like other plastics in other domains, became a quick and easy alternative to organic materials.

However, there is nothing quick nor easy about the production or destruction of polyester, which is one of the least environmentally friendly fabrics. Unlike organic fibers, polyester and other synthetic fibers do not easily biodegrade; a synthetic garment can take from 20 to 200 years to break down, whereas leather takes 50 years at the longest. Wool can take only six months, and a cotton garment can take as little as five months, to biodegrade.

And unlike wool and cotton that is harvested exclusively from organic sources, polyester is in part derived from coal and petroleum, industries much maligned by PETA: Another page on its website bears the headline “Fight Climate Change by Going Vegan” and says: “Climate change has been called humankind’s greatest challenge and the world’s gravest environmental threat.” In another list on the ethics group’s website, “save the planet” is one of their top ten reasons to go vegan. But PETA’s concern for the environment only seems to crop up when it is convenient for itself.

PETA has criticized the environmental toll of the oil industry before. However, the group’s criticism took a strange tack. It declared that consumers should stop eating meat, which drives demand for oil. In one instance PETA flew a plane over Mobile, Alabama, with the banner “Meat on Your Grill = Oil Spill.”

It is absurd of PETA to put the brunt of responsibility on consumers with limited options, but this is becoming an increasingly common position for the animal-rights group. PETA has endorsed practices that have much more toxic results than the production of animal-derived goods at a time when warnings about the environment are growing louder.

The process of creating and maintaining synthetic coats takes a toll, the garments themselves remain pollutants for hundreds of years after they are discarded, and when they are washed for everyday use, they shed additional plastic fibers. According to the Guardian, “researchers at the University of California at Santa Barbara found that, on average, synthetic fleece jackets release 1.7 grams of microfibers each wash. ”

And using the same coat from year to year will do little less damage. The amount of microfibers that synthetic coats and jackets release into water when washed only increases as the garment age. The same study found that “older jackets shed almost twice as many fibers as new jackets.”

Manifest pollution from polyester microfibers in synthetic garments have already been found by multiple studies to be a primary source of plastic pollutants in oceans, lakes and rivers. Plastic pollutants contribute to increased acidification of the ocean, which, UN scientists recently warned, “is projected to amplify the adverse effects of warming” and affect the “abundance of a broad range of species, for example, from algae to fish . ”

If PETA truly cared about environmental health and the health of the animals whose very existence depend on that healthy ecosystem, they would not promote fake fur as adamantly as they do. PETA’s facile reasoning doesn’t take into account the long-term repercussions of using non-biodegradable alternatives to natural garments.

Natural fibers are ultimately more sustainable than synthetic, even though they demand a more immediate use of resources, including livestock. PETA ought to consider whether, in the long-term, it is promoting trends that will prolong the length and quality of the lives of the animals it claims to speak for."

Dubai International Airport is one of the busiest airports in the world, shuffling more than 400,000 flights up and down its runways each year.

But during a sunny weekend in September, it exchanged high skies for high fashion, hosting a photo shoot for Vogue Arabia's final issue of 2018.

Vogue Arabia launched in 2016, and has since featured an impressive lineup of internationally-renowned cover models, including Gigi Hadid and Rihanna.

However, the magazine's Middle Eastern edition sets itself apart from its sister publications by embracing regional influencers and styles grounded in Arabian cultures and values. The airport shoot headlined by Iranian model Farnoush Hamidian and British-Somali model Shahira Yusuf, was no exception.

Changing face of modeling

In 2017, Yusuf became the first hijabi model to sign a contract with Storm Management, the agency known for discovering supermodel Kate Moss.

""We're Muslim women,"" Yusuf explains. ""We wear our headscarves because of religious beliefs, at the end of the day.

""It might be a trend, in terms of mainstream media picking up on these types of things, but it's something that has always been around.""

Few people understand the need for inclusion better than supermodel and fashion icon Naomi Campbell, who graced the cover of Vogue Arabia's November 2018 issue. Campbell spent much of her early modeling career breaking race barriers and championing diversity in her industry, eventually becoming the first black model to appear on the cover of French Vogue in 1988.

It's something that should of been the norm and it's every race and creed,"" Campbell told CNN while discussing strides made to increase the visibility of Muslim models. ""Everyone has their religion (and) has to be respected.""

While the recent victories for diversity are a cause for celebration, Campbell was quick to contain her excitement with a dose of reality.

""This is how it should have always been,"" she said. ""It's incredible to say it's taken us to get to 2017, 2018 for it to happen, but most importantly (it's incredible) that it's happening.""

A more 'modest' clientele

Modest fashion, a term that describes garments catered to women who choose to wear less revealing clothing, has grown in prominence in the global fashion industry.

Early movers in the modest wear sector have been rewarded by a lucrative and relatively untapped market -- Muslim women spent $44 billion on modest fashion in 2015, according to an industry report by Thomson Reuters. And this number does not capture modest clothing bought by women of other religions and cultures, or those who simply appreciate its aesthetic.

""The reality is that modesty, at least the way we look at it, transcends religion, it transcends age, size, where you come from,"" explains Ghizlan Guenez, the entrepreneur behind e-commerce platform The Modist.

The Modist stocks and curates luxury clothing from regional and local brands, and is tailored to women who dress modestly. For Guenez, making modest clothing accessible gives power back to women who have, until recently, been neglected in the luxury fashion space.

""One of the things we're very passionate about is the idea of choice, she says. ""And we truly believe that choice, and exercising that, is the most empowering thing."""
"A penny on every shirt, skirt and stocking could fund better recycling and repairing in the fashion industry, according to a parliamentary report that recommends new taxes to end the throwaway consumer culture.

The cross-party environmental audit committee also proposes tax incentives for companies that offer repair services for clothes, and urges schools to introduce darning and mending classes.

The report warns the fashion business in the UK creates 1m tonnes of waste each year and is a bigger source of carbon emissions than aviation and shipping combined.

It calls on the government to force all retailers with a turnover of more than £36m to take responsibility for the waste they create. A producer responsibility charge of one penny on each item of clothing should be levied to pay for better clothing collection and recycling, it said.

“Fashion shouldn’t cost the earth. Our insatiable appetite for clothes comes with a huge social and environmental price tag: carbon emissions, water use, chemical and plastic pollution are all destroying our environment,” said the Labour MP Mary Creagh, who chairs the group.

The clothing industry harms the planet. What can fashion students do? Read more

The report is the culmination of an inquiry by MPs into the sustainability of the fashion industry. After gathering evidence from 16 retailers, they found their voluntary efforts to reduce their environmental footprint had been outweighed by a 200,000-tonne increase in sales since 2012. Creagh said people were buying and discarding clothes more quickly than ever.

“‘Fast fashion’ means we overconsume and underuse clothes. As a result, we get rid of over a million tonnes of clothes, with £140m worth going to landfill every year,” she said.

Britons buy more clothes per person than any other country in Europe, according to the report. On average, consumers in the UK buy 26.7kg of fashion items each year, compared with 16.7kg in Germany, 14.5kg in Italy and 12.6kg in Sweden.

The environmental and social implications are enormous. The report estimates textile production creates 1.2bn tonnes of CO 2 each year and 20% to 35% of all “primary source” microplastics: microbeads, fibres, pellets and capsules, in the ocean. A kilogram of cotton, equivalent to a shirt and jeans, needs between 10,000 to 20,000 litres of water to produce it and often involves dire labour conditions both in the UK and overseas.

Several companies were cited for failing to prioritise sustainability, including Amazon UK, Boohoo, Missguided, JD Sports, Sports Direct and TK Maxx.

Others were praised for being more engaged on the issue, including Burberry, Marks and Spencer, Primark, Tesco and Asos, but MPs noted that overall the voluntary approach was not working and said it should be replaced with mandatory environmental targets for all big retailers.

As well as the proposed one penny charge, it said the government should reduce VAT on repair services, ban incineration or landfilling of unsold stock that can be reused or recycled, and draw up a “net zero” emissions blueprint.

It also recommends incentives for companies that reduce the material consumption needed for growth. This would require research into the environmental performance of different materials (for example, polyester shirts have more than double the carbon footprint of cotton shirts) and to measure microfibre pollution. Ministers, it says, should explore ways to foster a “sharing economy” with more hiring and swapping and less buying and discarding."
"A shocking undercover investigation has revealed how workers in Asia savagely rip hair off goats to fuel the global cashmere trade.

The agonised animals are then sent to slaughterhouses to be cruelly killed, according to the new study from an animal welfare organisation.

The research was conducted between last year and early this year on 20 farms in China and Mongolia, two of the world's largest cashmere producers.

The shocking investigation shows farmers violently tugging hair of goats with big metal combs

The research was done by PETA between last year and earlier this year in China and Mongolia

The animals are subject to abuse for years before facing a painful death, according to PETA

Disturbing footage released by PETA, the charity behind the project, shows frightened goats screaming in pain as workers forcefully tug hair off their bodies with metal combs.

Once proven useless to their owners - usually after years of abuse - the goats are destined for a slow and painful death, according to the PETA report.

The investigation shows workers selling the 'useless' goats to slaughterhouses for their skin and meat.

In the abattoirs, the animals get bashed in the head with hammers, slit in the throat before being left to die, it is found.

PETA urges consumers to stop buying cashmere products in order to stop such cruelty towards animals.

Cashmere comes from goats living in dry areas in central Asia, especially in the Gobi Desert - a 500,000-square-mile area stretching from northern China to Mongolia.

It comes from the goat's superfine winter undercoat and is commonly seen in jumpers, scarves, trousers, jackets and gloves in today's fashion industry.

According to PETA, one goat produces only 8.5 ounces of cashmere hair per year, and in order to make one cashmere jacket, the hair of six goats is required.

Cashmere hair is usually sorted, cleaned and refined in Asia before being transported to Europe to be sold to designers for roughly £90 a pound.

China and Mongolia, together with Iran and Afghanistan, are the world's largest cashmere producers and exporters.

While in Europe, Italy and UK are the main consumers of cashmere due to high market demand. In 2016, the two countries consumed 97.25 per cent of the cashmere sent to Europe, according to a latest market report.

PETA's exposé of the grim situation in cashmere's source countries has prompt popular high street brand H&M to react.

The Swedish fashion label vows to stop using 'conventional cashmere' by the end of 2020 and to only use the animal fibre if it's 'sustainable sourced'.

An H&M spokesperson said the company had set the goal of banning cashmere a few years ago, and PETA's report highlighted the animal welfare issues to them and prompted them to take actions.

The spokesperson said: 'Challenges connected to the environment, animal welfare and traceability are all reasons why we've decided to phase out conventional cashmere.'

The brand hopes to source cashmere in more sustainable manners in the future and contribute to making the industry more 'transparent and responsible'.

Currently, the fashion industry lacks a standard for 'sustainable cashmere', according to the spokesperson.

H&M is not alone. Online fashion retailer ASOS banned cashmere last year following another PETA report on South Africa's mohair industry.

The London-headquartered company sells more than 1,000 brands on its website.

According to an ASOS spokesperson, the ban went into effect in January and no items made with cashmere, silk, down or feathers is being sold by the company."

Prada has long been known for its nylon bags, and now the Italian fashion house is making the products more sustainable.

As part of the Re-Nylon project, a new line of Prada bag silhouettes will be made from a regenerated nylon material known as ECONYL, according to a press release from the company.

Prada has partnered with textile producer Aquafil, which manufactures ECONYL from plastic waste from oceans and fishing nets as well as textile fiber waste.

The material can be recycled over and over again without losing quality, and Prada plans to make all of its nylon products from ECONYL but the end of 2021.

One of the most common plastics in the world, nylon has long been favored for its strength and durability, but has a high environmental impact and is increasingly becoming a target in the fight against pollution.

Six bags for both men and women will form the Prada Re-Nylon collection, and a percentage of each sale will be donated to a project designed to improve awareness of environmental sustainability.

""This project highlights our continued efforts towards promoting a responsible business,"" said Lorenzo Bertelli, Prada Group Head of Marketing and Communication, in the press release.

""This collection will allow us to make our contribution and create products without using new resources.""

In May, Prada also announced that it will stop using fur in its products and design from February 2020.

The decision applies to all of the Italian fashion house's brands, including Miu Miu, Church's, Car Shoe and Prada itself.

It will come into effect after the Spring/Summer 2020 women's collection.

Prada joins a growing list of fashion houses that have ended their use of fur, including Burberry, Armani, Versace, Gucci, Chanel, Coach, Donna Karan, Michael Kors, Jimmy Choo, Diane von Furstenberg, Furla and Bottega Veneta, according to the Humane Society International."

"Coalition of 32 companies will present its Fashion Pact at the G7 summit in Biarritz

A coalition of 32 of the world’s largest fashion groups and brands has published a manifesto that details the practical objectives and targets it has set to minimise the industry’s impact on the climate, oceans and biodiversity.

The Fashion Pact, which was released on Friday and will be presented at the G7 meeting in Biarritz, says it “will not reinvent the wheel, but create an overarching framework for action”, and will make its findings open source. It intends to build on the work of existing organisations such as the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and Fashion For Good.

Key points include a commitment to 100% renewable energy across own operations by 2030; pledges to eliminate micro-fibre pollution and develop biodiversity strategies, which may include wildlife-friendly approaches to agriculture, mining and forestry that promote the conservation of key species; and a recommendation to eliminate single-use plastics in both B2B and B2C packaging by 2030.

It also details a joint initiative to ensure social inclusion, fair wages and respectful working conditions throughout the supply chain with a focus on “empowering small-hold producers and women in low-income countries”.

G7 and fashion houses join forces to make clothes more sustainable Read more

The initiative was instigated earlier this year by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who asked François-Henri Pinault - the CEO of the Kering Group, which owns Gucci, Saint Laurent and Alexander McQueen - to form an coalition to address the fashion industry’s environmental impact.

Pinault outlined his vision for the coalition at the Copenhagen fashion summit in May. “This has nothing to do with competition,” he told delegates. “It’s a matter of leadership. Alone it is useless, you have to work with your peers. We might not succeed, but we will achieve more than not doing anything.”

Burberry’s CEO, Marco Gobbetti, said on Friday: “We know that one company cannot solve the environmental challenges facing our planet alone and we believe in the power of collaboration to drive real change.”

The pact comes as key members of the luxury fashion industry have come under fire for failing to publicly respond to wildfires in the Amazon rainforest. The lack of response has been contrasted with the millions of euros donated by Kering and its rival LVMH toward the restoration of Notre Dame.

Macron described the situation in the Amazon as an international crisis on Friday, and called for it to be top of the G7 summit agenda."

"Image-conscious diners keen to impress with snaps at 'pop-up' eateries have contributed to a particularly difficult year for the restaurant industry.

The number of restaurants going bust across England, Scotland and Wales has reached its highest level since since 2010, with an average of four businesses going under every day.

Mid-price chains have faced most strain as they struggle to compete with trendy pop-ups promising customers novel, social media-friendly dining experiences, according to the analysis of Insolvency Service figures.

Big names including Guacho, Byron and Sir Terrance Conran's Prescott & Conran group are among the 1,123 restaurant businesses that became insolvent in the first three quarters of 2018. This compares to 1,075 failed restaurants in the whole of 2017.

Accountancy firm Price Bailey, which carried out the analysis, explained social media is accelerating changes in consumer tastes with people increasingly looking for novel dining experiences.

It means once popular restaurants can soon find themselves out of favour.

Paul Pittman, partner at Price Bailey, said: 'Chain restaurants are particularly vulnerable to changing consumer fads.

'What was once flavour of the month can quickly go out of fashion. The cost of acquiring leases and outfitting restaurants can run into the millions per site in prime city centre locations. You need a sustainable customer base to absorb that risk.'

Mr Pittman said it is part of the 'perfect storm' of adverse trading conditions.

Huge expansion in mid-market restaurants funded by private equity means the market is over saturated. Restaurants are also having to contend with rising costs such as pressure to implement the national living wage and the apprenticeship levy.

The uncertainty of Brexit also looms large over many consumers and is credited with pushing consumers towards the food delivery market, with brands such as Just East and Deliveroo capitalising."
"Lending each other clothes is something women have been doing for a long time.

A young Toronto entrepreneur believes she can build a business around that tradition, adding a new twist that will try to help save the planet.

""I thought, I have a great closet, I know my friend has a great closet and everyone around me does,"" said Vasiliki Belegrinis, the founder of Reheart. ""We already share our clothes, but now we are just formalizing it.""

Actually, ""just formalizing"" clothes swapping among friends is only a small part of what the 22-year-old entrepreneur is hoping to accomplish.

In trying to become the ""AirBnB of fashion,"" Belegrinis said she is hoping her customers can do good, feel good and look good all at once.

Twenty-two-year-old entrepreneur Vasiliki Belegrinis is behind Reheart, a clothing rental business that aims to help women buy fewer clothes and reduce the impact of clothing production. 1:56

The company fits right into the emerging clothing rental trend and is one of a few online businesses in Canada facilitating rental exchanges between individuals. Through Reheart, users can list clothes for rent for up to 50 per cent of the profits, and peruse its online catalogue for items they might wish to rent themselves.

The aim is to help reduce the environmental damage of fast fashion by getting women to purchase less clothing overall, while at the same time empowering them to save money through renting and to profit off lending out their own garments to others.

Reheart is tapping into a huge potential inventory.

Business analysts report clothing production has doubled since 2000 and in 2014 topped 100 billion garments a year for the first time. In context, that means almost 14 new pieces of clothing for every person on the planet.

Inventory expected to grow

Reheart is launching with about 2,500 registered users and an inventory of more than 1,200 items that Belegrinis estimates have a total retail value of more than $500,000.

She expects that inventory to grow quickly. According to Greenpeace, 40 per cent of the clothes people own in developed countries is barely used or never worn.

Currently the company accepts high quality, gently used items, including dresses, gowns, blazers, skirts, shirts, coats, bags and accessories.

Reheart has found Items that are less than one year old and cost $300 at full retail price do best,

Lenders send their rental items to Toronto for storage and Reheart handles all shipping and cleaning logistics because Belegrinis said the business is too time-sensitive to rely on direct peer-to-peer transactions.

GTA customer base

Most of Reheart's customer base is in the Greater Toronto Area and from ages 20 to 35. New users have signed on from Montreal, Calgary and Vancouver and the company ships across Canada.

""It didn't feel weird"" signing up to lend clothes to Reheart, said Risham Najeeb, a 22-year-old account executive who works in Mississauga.

""I was more ... like, 'Wow, why hasn't someone done this before?' ""

Najeeb plans to lend out several outfits to Reheart later this summer, but has already listed an expensive Kate Spade purse.

The first item Risham Najeeb gave to Reheart to rent was the Kate Spade purse she's holding, which is worth more than $500. (Risham Najeeb)

Initially she worried about her things being abused by renters, but Reheart says it protects lenders, repairs damaged items and charges customers who fail to return items with the full cost of replacing them.

Najeeb was not getting much use out of her $500 purse, which is listed at $45 for a four-day rental and was popular during Reheart's test pilot phase.

Najeeb said lending is about more than making money.

""I do personally also believe in just the message and the meaning behind this platform, which is to reduce waste from fast fashion and just kind of make our habits in terms of fashion more sustainable.""

Renters can have items for four, 10 or 30 days.

A short-term deal is often what Roxanne Bilski is after. The Toronto model has a busy social and work calendar.

She's worn rental outfits to more than 10 occasions in the past year. One of those outfits included a used gown for the Miss World Canada pageant.

A new dress for the preliminary competition could have cost her $1,500 or more. Instead, she paid $80 and felt good about reusing a dress. Sending the dress back came with an added bonus.

""I live in small downtown condo. I don't have the closet space.""

Global clothing crisis inspired entrepreneur

When it comes to creating clothing, business is booming. Experts say clothing production has become a $2.4-trillion-a-year industry — up from $1 trillion a year less than two decades ago.

One study reports that less than one per cent of material used to produce clothing is recycled into new clothing, with a truckload of clothes being dumped into a landfill every second.

Numbers like these shocked Belegrinis when she watched a documentary about the industry called The True Cost in 2016.

Then a business student deeply interested in social enterprise, Belegrinis decided to sell underused items in her closet that weren't appropriate to give to charity.

In early 2017, she began listing items on Facebook, Kijiji and the Letgo app. The effort failed. ""I had the worst experiences dealing with resale apps,"" said Belegrinis. She also found customers were unreliable and were looking for unreasonably low prices.

Later that year, she hatched the idea for her business, inspired both by the success of Rent the Runway and an American peer-to-peer used clothing rental business called Style Lend, which started in 2013 and claims to be generating revenue from more than 50,000 users.

Recently, Reheart took over another Toronto clothing rental startup called Boro, whose founders were giving up the business. Belegrinis hopes that merger will help her business reach a point that it could sustain itself within six months.

Turning property into profit

Clothing rentals are another example of how the sharing economy allows people to turn their property into profit.

Brands like AirBnB, VRBO, Uber, Lyft, Turo and Getaround are the big names in the sharing world but there's peer-to-peer bike rental, boat rental and RV rental, as well as several apps for parking spots.

But it's not all sunshine and roses. Sharing economy businesses can have negative impacts.

Prof. Ming Hu of the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto likes the Reheart idea, but worries about how sustainable the clothing rental model is overall. His concern is that manufacturers and retailers offering consumers tempting deals on new clothes for rent will mean that a large volume of clothing is still being produced.

""As a result,"" said Hu,""there could be more clothes out there circulating in the society.""

Hu points to complaints about AirBnB and VRBO reducing the supply of long-term rental housing and studies showing Uber and Lyft increase traffic congestion as other examples of unwelcome outcomes from the sharing economy.

Belegrinis believes sharing clothes will work out.

""A lot of who we're targeting, they just don't like to buy anymore,"" she said. ""And I think that even as the incoming generations also come into place, they'll put even more emphasis on sustainability."""

Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, surprised guests at the British Fashion Awards Monday night, as she made an unexpected appearance to honor her wedding dress designer, Clare Waight Keller.

After praising the fashion industry in her ""new home of the UK,"" she named Keller, Givenchy's artistic director, as British Womenswear Designer of the Year.

Actress Rosamund Pike was initially scheduled to present the award. But after reading out the finalists, she welcomed a ""special guest"" to join her. Markle then appeared in a black one-shoulder Givenchy dress to rapturous applause from the star-studded London audience.

She described Keller as a ""British designer leading on the global stage with vision and creativity, but also with incredible kindness,"" before announcing her the winner of the prestigious award.

Taking to the stage, a visibly shocked Keller described the surprise as ""an incredibly special moment.""

""This woman is so amazing, and I got to know Meghan on such a personal level,"" the designer said in her acceptance speech. ""And to have someone like that trust you in an incredible moment in their life, is something that is just the most unbelievable honor and I can't thank you enough. It was just the most beautiful moment.""

Meghan's Givenchy bridal dress: Expert opinion

The award tops off a notable year for Keller, who was thrust into the international spotlight when she designed the wedding dress for Markle's nuptials in May. The ivory silk dress was modern and feminine, with a shoulder-framing bateau neckline, simple A-line silhouette, and slim three-quarter sleeves. Her design famously featured a 16.5-foot silk tulle veil , which was hand-embroidered with flora representing each of the Commonwealth's 53 countries.

Markle has since been pictured wearing bespoke Givenchy items on a number of occasions, including on her recent tour of Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga.

Elsewhere at the awards, Craig Green was named British Menswear Designer of the Year, while Miuccia Prada was given the Outstanding Achievement Award in recognition of her four-decade fashion career. Cindy Crawford's daughter, 17-year-old Kaia Gerber, was named model of the year.

Sustainability was prominent on this year's agenda. Dame Vivienne Westwood, who has championed environmental issues in her career and promoted ethical fashion, was given the Swarovski Award for Positive Change. A Special Recognition Award for Innovation was handed to environmental group Parley for the Ocean, which has worked with brands like Adidas on clothing lines made from ocean plastic.

Established in 1989, the annual British Fashion Awards is considered one of the biggest events on the European fashion calendar. Industry figures at this year's ceremony included Kate Moss, Virgil Abloh, and Victoria Beckham, one of five designers shortlisted for Keller's womenswear award.

Figures from across the entertainment world were also in attendance at London's Royal Albert Hall, including Brooke Shields, Rita Ora and Robert Pattinson."

"Ascena Retail Group Inc. will start winding down its Dressbarn clothing chain, the latest upheaval in a continued retail shakeout.

After trying to find a new owner, Ascena said Monday that it’s preparing to close the approximately 650-store chain. No timeline was given, and stores will remain open until the wind-down commences. The Dressbarn website lists six stores in Oregon.

Ascena, whose brands have come under pressure as consumer tastes shift, needs to make changes after posting more than $1 billion of losses in the past four years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

""This decision was difficult, but necessary, as the Dressbarn chain has not been operating at an acceptable level of profitability in today's retail environment,"" Dressbarn Chief Financial Officer Steven Taylor said in a statement Monday.

Bloomberg reported in March that Ascena was exploring options for Dressbarn, which was struggling with a host of competitors from fast-fashion purveyors like H&M to Amazon.com. Its demise marks the end of yet another chain born in the New York area, less than a year after the final shutdown of New Jersey-based Toys ""R"" Us.

Roslyn and Elliot Jaffe opened the first Dressbarn in 1962 in Stamford, Connecticut, according to the chain's website, with Rosyln choosing the name shortly before it opened to denote fashion and value. After acquiring several other women's and kids' clothing brands, the company reorganized its structure in 2011 and changed its name to Ascena. The Mahwah, New Jersey-based company has built up an array of retail chains, most recently with the 2015 purchase of Ann Taylor and Loft brands.

Now Ascena has been unwinding some of those purchases. In March, it announced that it sold a majority stake in its Maurices chain to private-equity chain OpCapita for $300 million.

Details of the closing of individual locations and plans for job cuts will be shared as the wind-down progresses, the company said. The retailer says it will continue to pay its vendors and suppliers in full for products and services during the process."

▲ Royal baby

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.

The Duchess of Sussex gave birth to a baby boy on Monday 6 May.

The announcement was made on the couple’s recently launched Instagram account.

“We are pleased to announce that their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Sussex welcomed their firstborn child in the early morning on 6 May 2019,” the statement reads.

“Their Royal Highnesses’ son weighs 7lbs 3oz.”

On Wednesday, the couple introduced their son to the world for the first time during a photocall.

Speaking in St George’s Hall at Windsor Castle ahead of the photo’s release, Harry held their two-day-old child as Meghan said: “It’s magic, it’s pretty amazing. I have the two best guys in the world so I’m really happy.

“He has the sweetest temperament, he’s really calm.”

Later that day, Meghan and Harry announced the name of their son: Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor.

New research has since predicted that Archie is likely to become one of the most popular names in the UK by 2022.

▲ Met Gala

On Monday 6 May, the most elite members of the fashion industry took to the pink carpet for the Met Gala 2019.

This year, the theme was “Camp: Notes on Fashion”, prompting an array of headline-grabbing ensembles from the event’s guests.

Co-chair Lady Gaga arrived at the Gala in a hot pink Brandon Maxwell gown before unveiling a further three outfits including a strapless black dress, a hot-pink dress ensemble, and a matching set of black underwear and bejewelled fishnet tights.

Elsewhere, Zendaya turned a classic fairytale into reality by dressing up as Cinderella, while Billy Porter arrived on the pink carpet on a litter carried by six shirtless men and dressed in a custom “sun god” ensemble, created by The Blonds.

Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas also made their first public appearance since their Las Vegas wedding wearing matching 1980s-inspired outfits by Louis Vuitton.

Check out the best dressed from the Met Gala 2019 here.

▲ Model diversity

Primark was praised on social media this week for featuring a model with a missing tooth in its spring/summer campaign.

The high street clothing brand posted a photo of two models, Symone Lu and Lucy Knell, wearing its latest swimwear range on Instagram on Monday alongside the caption: “Vaycay season is upon us, and we’re leaving our cares behind!”

Lu, who is wearing a black bikini and yellow crocheted beach dress, is photographed smiling at the camera with her tongue out, revealing her missing central incisor.

Shoppers applauded Primark for promoting diversity by choosing to include a model with an “imperfect smile”.

“Good to see @primark having real people as models so my kids don’t grow up thinking they have to look a certain way,” one person commented on Instagram.

Another added: “Such an inspiration! I’ve felt so conscious of my teeth, just recently got braces due to gapping! She looks gorgeous… proud of her and Primark.”

▲ H&M x Stranger Things

H&M is launching a clothing range inspired by hit Netflix series Stranger Things.

The high street brand’s capsule collection comes ahead of the programme’s highly-anticipated third season, which will air later this summer, and consists of swimwear, clothing and poolside accessories.

H&M’s offering is logo-heavy – with “Hawkins Pool” emblazoned across T-shirts, swimsuits and trunks – and features a playful assortment of nostalgic floral prints in homage to the 1980s vibe that characterises Stranger Things.

Other standout pieces include a Stranger Things visor, beach towel and floral print Cuban-style shirt.

Get a first look at the entire collection, which will be available in-store and online from 23 May, here.

▲ Hijabs

Nike’s Pro Hijab has been named one of the hottest fashion products in the world right now by global fashion search platform Lyst.

The product ranks seventh in Lyst’s quarterly index behind a number of luxury high-fashion items, including Alexander McQueen’s oversized sole sneakers (first), Prada’s stud-embellished headband (second) and Jacqeumus’ Le Chiquito bag (third).

Morgane Le Caer of Lyst tells The Independent that although it may feel “reductive” to label a hijab a “hot fashion product” given its religious significance, the fact that it has made its way onto the report means it is one of the most in-demand fashion items across the globe, which she describes as “exciting and important”.

“This is reflective of the many socio-cultural changes that have been impacting the fashion industry,” Le Caer adds. “There is a real need and ever-growing demand for more inclusive fashion. A totally inclusive approach to representation in design and marketing is essential – for both customers and brands.”

Find out which other products made Lyst’s report – based on the shopping behaviours of more than 5 million people – here.

GOING DOWN ▼

▼ Danny Baker

Radio host Danny Baker has been fired by the BBC after posting a racist tweet about the royal baby.

The 5 Live presenter, 61, was accused of racism after seemingly mocking the Duchess of Sussex’s heritage in a now deleted post that featured an image of two people holding hands with a chimp dressed in a suit alongside the caption: “Royal baby leaves hospital.”

Baker’s tweet received a huge backlash on social media with many calling for him to be let go by the BBC.

“Danny Baker should be given today to resign and clear his desk. If he is still there at 16:59 @bbc MUST FIRE HIM! I’m disgusted by the hate and racism inherent in his tweet. Unforgivable,” one person tweeted.

He confirmed his firing from the station on Twitter, writing: “Just got fired from @bbc5live.”

The broadcaster, who called the tweet an “idiotic” mistake, later insisted he was not racist in an interview with Sky News.

A BBC spokesperson said: “This was a serious error of judgment and goes against the values we as a station aim to embody. Danny’s a brilliant broadcaster but will no longer be presenting a weekly show with us.”

▼ Festival tents

This week, festival organisers called for a ban on single-use tents in a bid to help tackle plastic pollution.

The Association of Independent Festivals (AIF) – an organisation that represents and empowers independent UK festivals like Shambala, Boomtown and Boardmasters – urged retailers to stop marketing and selling tents as single-use items.

It also called on festivalgoers to take their tents home with them at the end of the event.

The initiative follows a report published by the AIF in 2018 which found that while 93 per cent of festivals had ditched plastic straws and 40 per cent have banned the sale of drinks in single-use plastic on-site, abandoned tents remain a real problem with 10 per cent of people attending festivals leaving their tent behind – a figure it estimates is the equivalent to 875 tons of plastic waste.

We call upon major retailers to stop marketing and selling tents and other camping items as essentially single-use, and profiting from disposable culture,” said Paul Reed, CEO of the AIF.

“The message here is not ‘buy a more expensive tent’… festival audiences can take positive action and reduce their carbon footprint simply by taking their tent home and reusing it, ensuring that it doesn’t become a single-use item this summer.”

▼ Wendy’s

Amy Schumer urged fans to boycott Wendy’s this week, amid claims the American fast food chain does not provide its farmworkers with adequate protection.

The call to action came after Chance The Rapper tweeted asking the restaurant to bring back its spicy chicken nuggets.

Two days later, Wendy’s announced it was reinstalling the nuggets back to its menu, following Chance The Rapper’s plea.

While many fans of the fast food chain rejoiced in the news, comedian Schumer responded by highlighting Wendy’s alleged refusal to “protect farmworker women”.

“Hey! We love @chancetherapper and hate to be the ones to tell him that Wendy’s is the only fast food chain refusing to protect farmworker women from sexual assault and rape in the fields. This is true. Please read that sentence again,” the comedian wrote on Instagram.

“Message for the people in charge: instead of spicy nuggets, we want food that is harvested with dignity NOT violence.”

Schumer ended the caption by imploring Wendy’s to join the Coalition of Immokalee Workers’ Fair Food Programme, and asked fans to boycott the company.

Wendy’s has since issued a response, stating that all of its suppliers must follow the company’s Supplier Code of Conduct, which “includes requirements to human rights and labour practices”.

▼ Wet wipes

Health food firm Holland and Barrett has announced that it will no longer sell disposable wet wipes in a bid to encourage customers to be more sustainable.

Described as a “problem product” by sustainability campaigners because of the damage they cause to water systems, wet wipes are mostly made out of polyester and contain millions of microfibres.

As a result, the high street retailer has said it will remove the 34 products in its wet wipe range in 800 stores in the UK and Ireland. Instead it will sell sustainable, multi-use alternatives, such as cotton pads and exfoliating mitts.

“There is a growing awareness of how much our current throwaway culture is damaging our oceans, beaches and rivers,” said the company’s head of beauty, Joanne Cooke.

“We want to encourage our customers to think about what they currently throw away and encourage them to swap to more sustainable alternatives. The quickest way for us all to make a positive impact on the world we live in is to choose to spend our money on more sustainable products.

“There are a variety of eco-friendly alternatives to wet wipes that are just as easy, efficient, and safe to skin.”"
"I recently read a book in which the author, describing rural life in the early 19th century, casually mentioned clothing as being ‘all made in the home’. I laughed. Anyone who has ever tried to sew anything (let alone make an entire family’s wardrobe by hand) would not be so cavalier about the amount of labour involved. But it is typical of how a female trade tends to be dismissed as something anyone (well, women) can do in their spare time, as a picturesque hobby. Nobody similarly suggests that farmers in the 1800s made all their own furniture or saddles. But just like those items, clothing was made by people who made clothing for a living. Most people bought or inherited their clothes — often second-hand — and only the rich owned more than a couple of outfits.

The history of ‘women’s work’ being devalued is very much a part of textile history, from the lace-makers of 17th-century Flanders to the Japanese silk factory workers of the 19th century. Just like sweatshop workers in the garment industry today, women worked long hours to be paid a pittance — often on products that are sold at prices they could never hope to afford. In this book, Kassia St Clair looks at the developments of textiles through human history, and explains how our ancestors’ lives were shaped by these changes. In her journey, she touches on everything from the materials that went into Neil Armstrong’s space suit to biotech firms experimenting with spider silk.

She starts from the earliest humans to use a sewing needle, and spans the different cultures of the world in their uses of fabric. In all but the warmest regions of earth, people need to wear clothing to survive, and addressing this need led to the earliest experiments with textiles (animal pelts, the other option, still need to be sewn or tied together to make any kind of garment). Our ancestors had to figure this out before they could migrate from Africa.





These developments required a lot of human ingenuity, which it is easy to forget when we are accustomed to buying ready-made clothes, curtains, bed sheets and bags. The most basic technology of weaving was improved over thousands of years, giving us not only clothing but sailcloth — without which the exploration of the world would not have been possible.

St Clair explains how textiles were dismissed as a historical resource until recently. The first archaeologists exploring the Pharaohs’ tombs thought the linen wrapping of mummies was an impediment to be discarded, rather than a valuable artefact in its own right (although mummy wrappings were sold in Europe as a source of dye or for various medicines).

Textile technology has shaped our lives in ways we often forget: the industrial revolution was about cotton as much as it was about anything else. In one of the many fascinating statistics St Clair shares with us, in 1862, one in 65 people alive on earth were in the cotton trade. Meanwhile, the punch cards that allowed a loom to make a jacquard pattern led to the punch cards of the earliest computers.

We can wonder at how silk came to be produced — the folk legend of a silkworm cocoon falling into a cup of tea and thus dissolving, revealing its strands, seems too good to be true. But St Clair explains how this labour-intensive product became so important as a trade good for China — and a marker of wealth and luxury around the world. The Chinese emperors jealously guarded their monopoly on silk, even punishing with death those who exported silkworms. Of course, human ingenuity got around this obstacle too, and sericulture spread to different parts of the world, particularly Persia.

In the post-industrial age, we have synthetic fabrics, serving different purposes in our lives — so much so that we overlook their presence. St Clair argues that exploration of polar and mountainous regions was hampered until synthetic fabrics were developed, able to keep the human body both warm and dry in extreme cold. But she doesn’t overlook the dark side of these developments: the toxic chemicals required to make rayon (carbon disulphide causes brain damage and a host of physical ailments), and the environmental pollution created by polyester. Synthetics are now over 60 per cent of global textile production. We spend less of our income than our grandparents on clothing, because we exploit the labour of sweatshop workers in poor countries. Our addiction to cheap fashion is toxic.

Having read St Clair’s accounts of factory workers’ horrific injuries, I’ll certainly think again before buying anything rayon. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to look at the textiles in our world with a new understanding."
"The Japanese company that owns Uniqlo and other clothing brands gave a media preview last month of a new technology to reduce the amount of water used to give jeans a ""worn in"" look.

It is among greener moves by fashion businesses in an industry increasingly scrutinised for its environmental impact - from the consumption of resources, pollution arising from the production process and beyond, to the creation of clothing waste."

Additionally, Dixie will implement a new company-funded employee volunteer program, providing employees with the opportunity to give back and support the environment with the brand's full support.

""The cannabis industry as a whole is growing at a rapid pace, and as a pioneer in CPG cannabis, we believe the industry must do better to protect the environment,"" said Smith. ""It's time to shine a spotlight on this important industry-wide issue and lead by example in implementing sustainable business practices. We believe it's about looking forward, being responsible and conscientious as it relates to our environmental impact, and encouraging others to do the same.""

Dixie expects to open six more facilities across the U.S. in 2019, including the newest operation in Michigan which was announced last month.

"Whether you are a size 8 or 18, you should be able to cultivate a sense of style and flaunt it, writes Carolyn Moore.

Body positivity is having a moment. Look no further than 33-year-old, size 22 supermodel Tess Holliday. She weighs 300 pounds and is on the cover of Cosmopolitan UK October 2018 issue, stating she “wants the haters to kiss her ass”.

The evidence of this movement is all over social media. From every corner of the world, plus size style stars are amassing huge followings, but these ladies are not dishing out style advice to help their fans look slimmer; instead they’ve been strolling through summer in rompers and crop tops, hitting the beach confidently in bikinis, heading out on the town in sexy, body con dresses, and encouraging women everywhere to do likewise.

Phew, I’m literally a COSMO GIRL!! Can’t believe I’m saying that! 😭😭 Thank you @CosmopolitanUK for this incredible opportunity 🙏🏻 If I saw a body like mine on this magazine when I was a young girl, it would have changed my life 💕 Issue hits stands 8/31! 🎉🎉🎉🎉 pic.twitter.com/sBYWY7nEwZ — Tess Holliday 🥀 (@Tess_Holliday) August 29, 2018

Basically, they’re doing what their so-called ‘straight size’ counterparts have been doing for years — cultivating an enviable sense of style and flaunting it online. Whether your favourite style star wears an 8 or an 18, one detail of their clothing you won’t see on Instagram is the size on the tag, because when it comes to showcasing great style, size has never been more irrelevant.

Unless, of course, there’s an unwelcome correlation between the size on the label and the price on the tag. High street chain New Look faced an online backlash this summer when a customer discovered a pair of trousers from their Curves range cost £22.99, while an identical pair in their core collection cost £19.99. This wasn’t the first time such a discrepancy had been highlighted, nor is New Look alone in adding a levy to plus size styles. Dubbed a “fat tax” by the customer in question, brands may try to blame higher prices on increased production costs, but if that were the case, shouldn’t a size 6 cost less than a size 16?

While larger sizes do require more fabric, ready-to-wear pricing models have always been based on averaging the cost price across the size spectrum. As Lisa Scannel, fashion marketing lecturer at Cork Institute of Technology, points out, “More fabric can mean the item costs more in materials. However, in mass-produced clothing, material is a negligible proportion of the final price.” From a marketing perspective, she says, “High street retailers need to recognise that diversity makes good business sense. Customers of all sizes deserve to purchase new clothes without being financially penalised.”

Irena Drezi agrees. A curvy model with Not Another Agency, Drezi boasts over 100k Instagram followers, and having once struggled with an eating disorder, she’s now a proud advocate for body positivity.

Plus size model and influencer Irena Drezi says segregating curvy girls and making them pay more is totally unfair. Picture: Lee Malone

“I like to show girls that you can wear whatever you want, at any size!” she says. “Whether it’s a figure-hugging dress, over sized streetwear, or a bikini, if you feel comfortable in something, wear it!”

She thinks New Look’s “fat tax” sends a negative message.

“I don’t know what they’re trying to achieve with this,” she says. “We should all be treated equally and not be segregated into an overpriced pit just because we are larger than your regular size. If they’re charging more for plus size clothes, they should be charging a different price for each size, but to segregate curvy girls and make them pay more is totally unfair.”

Thankfully, many high street brands agree. The typical size range available in most core high street collections is now 6 to 18. In July, Penneys announced they would begin carrying size 24 as standard, and other high street stores, like M&S, go up to or beyond a size 20 in their mainline ranges and often feature curvy models in their advertising. Others have specialist plus size ranges that run upwards from a size 18. This is not just admirably inclusive; as Scannel stated, it also makes good business sense.

Last November, Price Waterhouse Cooper released their plus size clothing market review, revealing the plus size market has been outperforming the overall fashion retail market since 2012. Driven by increasing body confidence in plus size consumers, projections indicate it will continue to so over the next five years. As highlighted in the report, global social media mentions of ‘body positivity’ rose from 84k in 2015 to almost 1m in 2017, making this a movement to be reckoned with, and as Tess Holliday as Cosmopolitan’s October cover girl, it’s clear that it’s only going to keep gaining traction.

Which makes it all the more perplexing that outliers like Zara continue to hold firm to what has plainly become an outdated sizing model. While the average woman wore a size 12 in 1957, a study last year showed her 2017 counterpart wore a 16; yet some stores continue to treat the former as their ‘average’, placing it at the centre of a limited sizing scale.

Other high street giants have been quicker to embrace fashion conscious plus-size customers. Plus size bodies have always managed to be clothed, but the issue for plus size women who love fashion has generally been that fashion didn’t seem to love them back. Happily, that’s starting to change.

Carrie Elphinstone is the buyer for River Island’s RI Plus collection, and she insists their customers will never pay a ‘fat tax’.

“River Island Plus always aims to follow the pricing of the main range. This may mean that as a company we take a lower profit from this range, as the cost of garments is higher, but we believe it’s essential to be inclusive and treat all customers the same, whatever their size.”

That’s in keeping with the ethos of the Plus collection, which was started in 2016 “to enable inclusivity for as many customers as possible,” Elphinstone says.

“The majority of RI Plus is like-for-like with the main collection. We found our customers just wanted to buy the same looks and trends as our main range, but in a size that fitted them.”

This tallies with the experience of stylist and personal shopper Natasha Crowley. When she began offering a personal shopping service in 2011, Crowley says she would rarely see clients above a size 14. About two years ago, she began to see the occasional plus-size client, and in the last year, she says, “there’s been a noted increase”.

“I have a lot more people, size 16 plus, coming to me. Previously there wouldn’t have been a great selection for them, but now on Opera Lane, there’s three or four stores I can bring them to, the ranges are getting better, and there’s even more online.

“There’s always been a market there of women who want to shop in the same stores as their friends, buy cool clothes, and dress their age,” she adds.

“Stores are realising they have to make stylish clothing above a size 16. People want to dress fashionably, whatever their size. Increasingly they have the options; they just need to find the confidence.

“A lot of times, women come to me and they’re almost apologetic — experience has taught them that they’ll struggle to find anything. My aim is to show them what’s out there and encourage them to be braver in their choices. They don’t have to wear black or look for things that are ‘slimming’. I’ll say, look, if you like it, wear the mad print, wear the stripe!”

Crowley attributes this surge of interest in plus size fashion to the growing impact of the body positivity movement. “People are learning to embrace the size they are,” she says. “In the past, people might have thought, ‘Oh, well, I just need to lose a bit of weight first’, but so many women are coming in now saying, ‘You know what, I am this size.’ And I say, you’re so right — you need to dress the body you have right now, and look good the way you are.”"
"Garment worker and mum Tania often cries alone when she isn't busy making clothes for Australian fashion brands.

The 21-year-old, who works as a sewing operator in central Bangladesh, has been forced to send her daughter 250km away and visit her only twice a year in a bid to ensure the family's survival on her meagre wage.

She is one of hundreds of garment workers in Bangladesh and Vietnam whose daily suffering has been revealed in the first in-depth exploration of their lives in a new report.

Seen the reports today on our new investigation into the lives of the women who make our clothes?



Here’s just some of what we found.



See the full report at: https://t.co/TDVHXb0LLZ#WhatSheMakes pic.twitter.com/1wf2d6ff4S — Oxfam Australia (@OxfamAustralia) February 24, 2019

Released on Monday by Oxfam, the report titled Made in Poverty has also uncovered the way Australian fashion brands have cared more for the clothes than the people making them, including demanding air-conditioning for their products while workers labour in horrid conditions.

""The findings are shocking and the case studies harrowing,"" says Oxfam chief executive Dr Helen Szoke.

Researchers interviewed more than 130 factory owners, managers and others in powerful positions, as well as 472 women working in factories that supply clothing to Australian brands such as Kmart, Target, Big W, Cotton On and more.

""Systemic exploitation"" of workers has been enabled by Australian companies, whose buying practices compel factory operators to reduce cost of production, the report reveals.

These buying practices include fierce price negotiation, short-term contracts with factories, and reducing delivery times at one end while imposing fines for not meeting those squeezed deadlines.

In a number of cases in Vietnam, interviewees reported buyers insisted on the installation of automatic fire extinguishers for rooms where finished clothing was stored, but did not require the same for the sewing floors where hot machines could also ignite.

Falling short of a living wage

The report reveals 100 per cent of workers interviewed in Bangladesh were not paid a living wage, and nine out of 10 could not afford enough food for themselves and their families until their next monthly pay.

The majority survive on pulses, rice and potatoes, sometimes eating a mix of old, fermented rice with chilli to feel fuller throughout the day.

In Vietnam, wages are comparatively higher, yet seven out of 10 said their pay was not enough to meet their needs.

Altogether, 99 per cent of workers in Vietnam were not paid a living wage that would allow them to buy nutritious food, live in decent housing, send their children to school and get health care when they are sick.

Oxfam' has labelled the findings an indictment on the fashion industry, which turned over $23 billion in Australia last year.

""Brands are responsible for making credible commitments to ensure the payment of living wages to the workers making their clothes,"" Dr Szoke said.

A previous Oxfam report, released in 2017, found paying living wages would add just one per cent on average to the retail price of a piece of clothing.

Ahead of the report's release, Cotton On, Kmart, Target and City Chic announced credible commitments towards reaching a living wage for workers in their supply chains, Oxfam said in a statement on Monday.

Brands that have failed to do so include Myer, Best and Less, Bonds, Country Road, Forever New and Peter Alexander."
"An Australian woman has slammed clothing standards in Australia after struggling to find a pair of jeans that fit her on a recent shopping trip.

Jess King, a size 12 model, shared a photo of herself unable to do up a pair of 'extra large' jeans on Instagram and warned designers that it sent a poor message to women.

'The average Aussie woman is a size 14 to 16 and if someone smaller than that can't fit into a brand's size XL what kind of message is that sending?' She captioned the photo.

An Australian woman has slammed clothing standards in Australia after struggling to find a pair of jeans that fit her on a recent shopping trip.

'I'm honestly torn - With fashion week being on this week I'm truly grateful to be involved in some way but sad too because my body and others are STILL not good enough to be seen or catered to. When is it going to get better?'

Her followers were quick to share their support in the comments, with many saying they struggle finding clothes that fit properly.

'I have bought jeans in size 16, 12 and 11 in the past week, all of which have fit me comfortably and all of which have messed with my head,' one person said.

Another woman said she was thinking the same thing when she was shopping and was reading sizes as she couldn't believe a size 14 was considered an extra large.

'The average Aussie woman is a size 14 to 16 and if someone smaller than that can't fit into a brands size XL what kind of message is that sending?' She captioned the photo

'I genuinely can fit from a 10 to a 16 depending on where I'm buying and what I'm buying,' another follower said.

'It's so frustrating especially when you think yeah a 12 will fit and feel awful about yourself when it doesn't.'

This isn't the first time Jess has brought attention to the variation in women's clothing sizes.

In a different post she expressed her disappointment at the fact the fashion industry classifies her as a plus size model even though she doesn't wear plus size clothing.

In the modelling world a plus size model is considered a model over a size 10, which she said is purely an industry term to help clients when booking models larger than a traditional sample size.

Most plus size brands start their sizing from a 16/18 but at the same time, the average Australian woman wears a 14/16.

'When I explain to people that I am a 'plus size' model I'm often met with - 'you're not plus size- you're beautiful'. As if the two are not mutually exclusive?!' She said.

'Why do we have such a negative relationship with the term? I've never felt embarrassed at being referred to as a plus size model, but I've sometimes felt that I am unfairly taking the voice and space from someone who is truly plus size in an everyday sense.'

She went on to say that there is a lot of confusion and differing opinions on what plus size actually means and whether it's a good or bad thing.

'I think it's silly to say that being in an industry that nit-picks your body wouldn't make you question your worth every now and then, but it's about not letting those insecurities define me,' Jess said."
"Among the line’s items are a basket created to look like braided hair, blankets inspired by Johannesburg’s modernist architecture, and a woven rocking chair created as an homage to the designer’s childhood days sitting in his mother’s garden in Dakar. But for African fans, there’s one enduring disappointment: There are no Ikea stores on the continent.

But from the start, to many of the designers, including some of the continent’s most celebrated, this project felt different. In early conversations, the team quickly decided they didn’t want to put out a “curio version” of Africa, says Sindiso Khumalo, a South African designer who created textiles for the collection. “As a designer,” Ms. Khumalo says, “I get this all the time: people saying ‘You can design a print for us’ and then coming back to me and saying ‘Well, it isn’t African enough.’ This was different.”

There is a long history of Western brands taking African design ideas to add a bit of “exotic” flair to their collections. So Swedish furniture giant Ikea's announcement of a collection in collaboration with 10 African designers generated both excitement and skepticism.

When Swedish do-it-yourself furniture giant Ikea announced this year that it was releasing a line of housewares in collaboration with 10 African designers, many approached the news with both excitement and skepticism.

On the one hand, the designers selected were some of the continent’s most celebrated: from Senegal’s Selly Raby Kane, best known in the West for outfitting Beyoncé in a funky kimono, to Ivorian architect and designer Issa Diabaté. And the idea that their designs would soon be on display inside angular Ikea showrooms around the world was, well, pretty cool.

On the other, there is a long history of Western brands taking African design ideas to add a bit of “exotic” flair to their collections. Think Louis Vuitton’s blue and red checked menswear collection of 2012, an obvious nod to the traditional clothing of the Maasai people of East Africa (which the company paired with khaki safariwear).

Sometimes, designers allege, it goes beyond inspiration from traditional motifs. The baguette bag that appeared in Yves Saint Laurent’s Paris Fashion Week show in 2017 was an echo, to many observers, of a bag released by a young Senegalese designer named Sarah Diouf under her label Tongoro the year before. Then there’s South African menswear creator Laduma Ngxokolo, who is participating in the Ikea project, known for work inspired by the bold geometry of Xhosa beadwork. When fast-fashion brand Zara produced diamond-patterned socks with a striking resemblance to one of his iconic designs last year, he sought legal action, and the brand quickly pulled socks from its shelves.

“Brands do this because they feel that they can get away with it,” says Nana Spio-Garbrah, the founder of Blueprint Africa, an interior design consultancy with offices in Ghana and Cote d’Ivoire. “And they know that often even if they have to pay damages in the end, they can afford it, so it won’t be a big deal.”

But from the start, to many of those involved, the Ikea project – called Överallt, or “everywhere” – felt different. For one thing, it was launched on the African continent, at an annual showcase for African design called Design Indaba, held each year in Cape Town. Design Indaba and Ikea hatched the idea together and collaborated to select designers and decide how the collection would look, says Design Indaba founder Ravi Naidoo.

“[We were asked], what could we add to Ikea? What would be a unique African perspective? What is there about our way of life that could add value to people living across the world?” he says.

One thing that quickly emerged was that the designers didn’t want to put out the “curio version” of Africa, says Sindiso Khumalo, a South African designer. With fellow designer and architect Renée Rossouw, she created textiles for the collection that were, in part, inspired by Johannesburg’s distinctive modernist architecture. “As a designer, I get this all the time: people saying ‘You can design a print for us,’ and then coming back to me and saying ‘Well, it isn’t African enough.’ This was different.”

Iona Dutz/Courtesy of IKEA South African designer Sindiso Khumalo created a quilt and other textiles for the Overallt collection for IKEA that drew on Johannesburg’s modernist architecture for inspiration.

Among the other items are a basket by Ms. Kane created to look like braided hair and a woven rocking chair that fellow Senegalese designer Bibi Seck created as an homage to days spent sitting in his mother’s garden in Dakar as a child.

Much of the collection is designed to evoke “a porousness between inside and outside,” says Mr. Naidoo of Design Indaba, a tribute to how much cultural life in many African countries takes place on porches, verandas, and other spaces poised between house and street. Issa Diabaté, for instance, designed a deceptively simple chair made from a single piece of plywood that can be used either inside or out.

But for African design fans, there’s at least one enduring disappointment about the collection: There are no Ikea stores anywhere on the continent, putting some of the most democratic versions of these often high-end designers’ work out of the reach of many of their most ardent fans.

“Many of us want to support this, but unless we’re already in London or Tokyo we won’t have the means to,” says Ms. Spio-Garbrah, the interior designer.

Ms. Khumalo too is disappointed about that, but she says she hopes that for the consumers her collection does reach, it will be meaningful.

“There’s so much fast fashion and fast furniture already out there,” she says. “We wanted to push back on that. We wanted to create pieces that could last and could even be passed on.”"
"PARIS (Reuters) - Kering, the French fashion group whose brands include Gucci and Saint Laurent, said it would only work with models aged over 18, as the fashion industry aims to tighten up its ethical guidelines.

Kering said on Wednesday that from 2020 onwards, it would only hire models aged over 18 to represent adults and wear its adult clothing at its fashion shows and photo sessions.

“We believe that we have a responsibility to put forward the best possible practices in the luxury sector and we hope to create a movement that will encourage others to follow suit,” said Kering’s chairman and chief executive François-Henri Pinault."
"Fossil fuels are the backbone of the global petrochemicals industry, which provides the world’s growing population with fuels, plastics, clothing, fertilizers and more.

Fossil fuels are the backbone of the global petrochemicals industry, which provides the world’s growing population with fuels, plastics, clothing, fertilizers and more. A new research paper, published today in Science, charts a course for how an alternative technology — renewable electrosynthesis — could usher in a more sustainable chemical industry, and ultimately enable us to leave much more oil and gas in the ground.

Phil De Luna (MSE PhD 1T9) is the paper’s lead author. His research at U of T Engineering involved designing and testing catalysts for electrosynthesis, and last November he was named to the Forbes 30 under 30 list of innovators in the category of Energy. He and his supervisor Professor Ted Sargent (ECE) collaborated on the paper with an international team of researchers from Stanford University and TOTAL American Services, Inc.

Writer Tyler Irving sat down with De Luna to learn more about how renewable electrosynthesis could take the “petro” out of petrochemicals.

Can you describe the challenge you’re trying to solve?

Our society is addicted to fossil fuels — they’re in everything from the plastics in your phone to the synthetic fibres in your clothes. A growing world population and rising standards of living are driving demand higher every year.

"Chanel has become one of the first luxury labels to ban crocodile and lizard skin from its collections – but the move could have a severe financial impact on Australian farmers.

The Australian crocodile industry is valued at a reported $100million, so Chanel's 'ethical' decision has plenty of farmers on edge.

Chanel president Bruno Pavlovsky announced the French brand 'would no longer use exotic skins in our future creations'.

Karl Lagerfeld, Chanel's creative director (pictured) said that he used fur so rarely at Chanel that he couldn't remember when it last featured on the catwalk

Chanel has announced it is banning the use of animal skin in its collections, although vintage handbags are still available to buy elsewhere

Daily Mail Australia understands Chanel do not source skins directly from Australia, although rival labels such as Hermes and Louis Vuitton own farms in the Northern Territory and Queensland.

Dr Rosie Cooney, the Australian National University's chair of the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Sustainable Use and Livelihoods Specialist Group, said she is disappointed by Chanel's decision.

'There are problems in the [skin] industry but this will cut the bottom out of great initiatives,' she told Fairfax Media.

'The crocodile story [in Australia] is a really positive one.'

The new policy will also see Chanel ban fur from animals such as the raccoon dog, mink and rabbit.

Handbags, coats and shoes made from snake, crocodile and stingray skin command premium prices globally.

Some vintage Chanel handbags made from pelts sell for upwards of $34,000 online in Australia.

Animal rights groups have welcomed the move, with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) hailing Chanel for their decision.

This vintage Chanel 2.55 shoulder bag, cut from crocodile skin, is now banned in the label's collections

The value of second-hand pieces like this vintage A Chanel Grey Python Mini Flap Bag is now likely to soar

'There's nothing trendy about using stolen skins from tormented animals for clothing or accessories,' they said.

'It's clear that the time is now for all companies, like Louis Vuitton, to follow Chanel's lead and move to innovative materials that spare countless animals a miserable life and a violent, painful death.'

Although top fashion brands have been under heavy pressure to renounce fur, with Gucci, Armani, Versace and John Galliano all deciding to go fur-free, Chanel's decision to stop using exotic skins was unexpected.

Animal rights campaigns against the use of crocodile and snake skin products have not got the same traction with the public as similar crusades against fur, with some luxury brands even investing in reptile farms so they can guarantee that skins are sourced ethically."

If you are yet to be acquainted with the term 'Sustainable Fashion', it is just a more planet-friendly way to shop, dress and look after our clothes.

It doesn’t mean you have to stop loving fashion, it’s simply that making some small changes will not only help the planet but will save you money in the long run.

Every week in the UK 38 million items of new clothing are bought and 11 million items go into landfill.

Plus 60% of all clothing contains polyester, like nylon and acrylic these fabrics are made using plastic and only 44% of us realise we’re actually wearing plastic.

"J.C. Penney and ThredUp Inc. will sell used clothing in 30 stores through a partnership with the popular resale site that stocks brands from Gap to Gucci.

The announcement came as J.C. Penney reported a net loss of $48 million for the second quarter and a nearly 9.2% drop in sales from the year-earlier period.

The clothing initiative might not be enough to save 117-year-old J.C. Penney, a literal penny stock these days that's trading for less than 60 cents a share.

Ailing department store chain J.C. Penney is making its first foray into the increasingly popular used-clothing business.

The retailer announced Thursday a partnership with online consignment store ThredUp Inc. as part of its effort to rebuild the waning brand into a profitable business.

The announcement came as the retailer reported a net loss of $48 million for the second quarter, and a nearly 9.2% decrease in sales compared to the same quarter a year ago.

Analysts sounded the alarm bells and warned that 117-year-old J.C. Penney must act fast to save itself.

""When you have sales declines of almost 10% over the course of the year, you've got a very serious problem that needs to be very quickly addressed. It's a shrinking company with a lot of costs and debt and they need to move very rapidly,"" said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail.

Online consignment opens doors for bargain hunters' paradise

The reasons for J.C. Penny's decline are clear, Saunders said. ""It does not take much effort to understand why customers are migrating away: Most stores lack energy, interest and ease. They are not pleasant places to shop and offer little that is compelling, so customers increasingly avoid them,"" he explained.

He said the retailer's partnership with ThredUp is a step — albeit a small one — in the right direction.

""This kind of partnership should only be seen as the icing on the cake. It's a nice extra benefit; it's not a solution or replacement for getting the core business right,"" Saunders said.

Thirty of its stores will begin selling used clothing through a partnership with the resale site, which stocks brands from Gap to Gucci. The selection will rotate weekly in order to surprise frequent shoppers, according to a press release.

""With the rise of online resale markets, there's no doubt that demand for great value on quality brands is at an all-time high. There's an emotional thrill that comes with finding one-of-a-kind secondhand product for much less,"" said Michelle Wlazlo, executive vice president and chief merchant for J.C. Penney.

The so-called circular fashion movement is gaining steam as more shoppers eschew buying new clothing, citing the toll of clothing production on the environment as well as their own household budgets.

In 2016, the apparel and footwear industries together accounted for more than 8% of global climate impacts — the equivalent of 3,990 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to a report from Quantis.

The resale market is expected to outpace fast fashion within 10 years, according to a 2019 report by the Business of Fashion. The secondhand market is projected to be valued at $64 billion by 2028, according to ThredUp's research.

Indeed, 64% of women have bought or are now willing to buy secondhand products, according to ThredUp.

This isn't ThredUp's first foray into brick-and-mortar retail. J.C. Penney rival Macy's on Wednesday announced a similar partnership with the company.

ThredUp sells name-brand clothing for up to 90% off retail prices and has resold nearly 100 million pre-owned garments.

From its perspective, the partnership will bolster ThredUp's visibility.

""This is wonderful, giving it exposure in existing stores that will enlarge its audience and amplify the brand for them,"" Saunders said.

Still, the initiative might not be enough to save J.C. Penney, a literal penny stock these days that was trading this week for less than 60 cents a share.

""It's a sensible move, but in some ways there is this element of department stores scraping around to find things to put in their big shops because they aren't delivering sales,"" Saunders said. ""There is also an element of having to borrow someone else's smart thinking because you are not savvy enough to think of it yourself."""
"Burberry announces it will stop using fur, burning millions of dollars worth of unsold goods

Posted

British fashion label Burberry says it will no longer burn millions of dollars worth of unsold luxury goods or use real fur in its collections after a furore over its environmental record.

Key points: Burberry admitted in July to destroying more than $50 million of unsold goods

The fashion industry is under consumer pressure to adopt more sustainable practices

PETA welcomed Burberry's move and is calling on Prada to follow

It admitted in July to destroying 28.6 million pounds ($51.4 million) of unwanted items in a single year to prevent them being sold at below market prices and devaluing the brand.

That cast a light on waste in the fashion industry — both luxury and mass market — just a few months after the owner of Cartier and Montblanc admitted to having to buy back their own watches from dealers to prevent overstocking.

Burberry also said on Thursday (local time) it would follow the likes of Versace, Gucci and the trailblazer for ethical fashion, Stella McCartney, in removing real fur such as rabbit, fox, mink and Asiatic racoon from its ranges.

The fashion industry is under pressure from consumers and environmental organisations to make itself more sustainable, and many retailers have been called out in recent years for destroying unsold stock, including by slashing or punching holes in garments before throwing them out.

In the watch market, Richemont, owner of the luxury brands, said it would buy back unsold stock from dealers and would not move them to other markets. Instead it planned to recycle the precious metals and stones that were in the high-end pieces.

Burberry, whose coats sell for more than 2,500 pounds ($5,815) and handbags retail at around 1,500 pounds ($2,697), said it would expand efforts to reuse, repair, donate or recycle its products and work to develop new sustainable materials.

PETA, the campaign group for the ethical treatment of animals, welcomed Burberry's move to stop using fur, which the fashion house's chief executive said was part of a bigger shift and PETA said was a sign of the times.

""Modern luxury means being socially and environmentally responsible,"" said Burberry's Marco Gobbetti, who is in the process of repositioning the label to be more upmarket.

In the financial year to end March, Burberry said it physically destroyed 28.6 million pounds worth of finished goods — up from 26.9 million pounds the previous year — including 10 million pounds worth of beauty products such as perfume.

Burberry said it was now working with the sustainable luxury company Elvis & Kresse to transform 120 tonnes of leather offcuts into new products over the next five years.

""This belief is core to us at Burberry and key to our long-term success. We are committed to applying the same creativity to all parts of Burberry as we do to our products,"" Mr Gobbetti said.

He is hoping new designer Riccardo Tisci, the former Givenchy star who designed costumes for Beyonce and Madonna, can transform the quintessentially British fashion house.

Campaign group Humane Society International said animal charities would unite during this year's major fashion shows to call on Italian brand Prada to follow Burberry's lead on ending the use of real fur in its collections.

""The few fashion houses refusing to modernise and listen to the overwhelming public opinion against fur are now sticking out like a sore thumb for all the wrong reasons,"" said PETA's director of international programs Mimi Bekhechi.

Head of the International Fur Federation Mark Oaten said substituting natural fur with ""plastic petroleum-based materials, like fake fur"" was neither luxury nor responsible.

"In the past, shopping sustainably for clothing likely meant a trip to an ""eco-friendly"" store somewhere in the ""granola belt"" in a major city.

Now, consumer demand for more information and options to shop sustainably has compelled two major retailers, The Iconic and David Jones, to overhaul their online stores.

From today, The Iconic will offer customers the ability to search by five sustainable criteria covering social issues, the environment and animal welfare, as part of its ""Considered"" initiative.

"Over 80 hotels including 20,000 hotel rooms obtained the green star certificate, Adviser to Tourism Minister for Sustainable Tourism Emad Hassan said.

Hassan said at a press conference on Thursday attended by Tourism Minister Rania al-Mashat and representatives of the chambers of tourism and the parliament’s aviation and tourism committee that the ministry is currently coordinating with the Hotel Facilities Chamber to encourage hotels to use solar energy for generating electricity. He added that a 150 KW solar power plant will be installed on the roof of a luxurious hotel in Cairo soon to be a model that could be applied in other hotels.

Hassan stressed that one of the ministry’s top priorities is to achieve the goals of sustainable development through providing an attractive competitive touristic product while preserving the environment, as well as contributing positively to economic and social development to cope with international variables in the tourism industry.

According to Hassan, a unit has been recently established in the Tourism Ministry for sustainable tourism.

The Green Star Hotel Certificate for tourist accommodation businesses is awarded to tourist accommodations in Egypt for their commitment to environmentally friendly management and social responsibility. It has been developed as a public-private project between key stakeholders from the German and Egyptian tourism markets.

The Egyptian tourism authorities and the German International Cooperation have worked together to improve environmental awareness of hotels and increase competitiveness and environmentally friendly performance of the Egyptian tourism accommodation industry, according to the official website of Global Sustainable Tourism Council (GSTC). The program has been applied in Egypt since 2012.

GSTC is an international body that manages the global standards for sustainable travel and tourism and acts as the international accreditation body for sustainable tourism certification “with the aim of increasing sustainable tourism knowledge and practices among public and private stakeholders,” according to the GSTC official website."

More like this:

- Is it the end for the suit?

- What does luxury mean now?

- The rise of guilt-free gems

Anything, apparently, is better than what we have now. From questions over modern slavery to the planet-levelling effects of over-consumption, fashion is under fire – and brands are having to adapt. According to a recent report shared at the Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana’s third international roundtable on sustainability in Milan, buyers at stores like Barneys and Saks in the US and Printemps in France expect to nearly double their total spending on sustainable products in the next five years, from 23% to 40%.

What looks set to remain constant, however, is the urge to consume, hard-wired into human nature. As Dr Mark Summer from Leeds University School of Design wrote, in Fixing Fashion, this year's report by the Environmental Audit Committee: “fashion satisfies consumers’ psychogenic needs… and any solution has to recognise – and maintain – these benefits.

Accordingly, innovators are exploring future solutions that offer all the hit of the new buy without stripping the earth – and the answers, increasingly, appear to lie in the digital world. “We’re finally seeing the digital industry revolutionise age-old practice and evolving over the next 20 years,” says Rachel Stott of The Future Laboratory. “Immaterial and digital fashion offers opportunities for brands to exert creativity, and connect with consumers through a different medium.”

A hairstyle made from water, a dress that alters its shape according to sound: these are all possible – Rachel Stott

And in one manifestation, the clothes won’t exist at all. When Norwegian retailer Carlings launched a digital collection last year, the fashion – futuristic streetwear, bought online and e-fitted to users’ photos – was created to counter the ‘wear once, take a selfie, chuck it away’ philosophy of today’s frantic online influencer. “We’ve opened up a world of taking chances with styling, without leaving a negative footprint on the world,” Morten Grubak of Virtue Nordic, told iD’s Jake Hall, at the time.

For the virtual generation, the digital collection is just a logical step forward. Fervent players of games like Fortnite, The Sims and Sansar already spend billions on things that aren’t actually there – including clothes. “Increasingly, we will see digital collections and garments free from physical and creative restrictions become part of the fashion landscape,” says Stott.

“There is a clear trend to blending the physical world with online content,” agrees Matthew Drinkwater, of the London College of Fashion’s Fashion Innovation Agency. His vision posits a future in which, using augmented-reality glasses that overlayg digital imagery onto the real world, we ‘share’ the clothes we want to be seen wearing into the AR glasses of others who are participating.

Pie-in-the-sky? Not quite. Working with Lucasfilm's immersive entertainment division ILMxLAB, Drinkwater introduced the project at designer Steven Tai’s London Fashion Week 2018 presentation.

""The project hints at a future where we will be able to download content to our clothing, viewable through AR glasses, and present ourselves differently to everyone around us,” says Drinkwater. “Our identities are constantly evolving and becoming more fluid by straddling both the digital and physical realms,” adds Stott. “Digital fashion allows people to fully experiment with how they would like to be perceived – and push limitless creative boundaries. A hairstyle made from water, a dress that alters its shape according to sound: these are all possible.”

Brave new world

But, if the thought of operating so completely online makes you jumpy, there are more concrete applications for the tech. According to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, $500 billion is lost every year in clothing under-use and waste costs; 87% of all fashion made goes to landfill. So what would happen if we only made clothes people really wanted? This is the concept behind NY-based digital agency Neuro Studio’s latest work, Solventus 2019, a collection for which human models were 3D-scanned to obtain precise measurements before the garments were designed directly onto digital avatars.

The intention, eventually, is to only make the clothes – capes, body harnesses and leggings built with body-supporting weaves and cold weather fabrics; very post-apocalyptic – when someone orders them.

And there is, of course, more: Neuro Studio’s collection encompasses 3D-printing, the tech that allows designers to tailor-make pieces digitally for individual customers. Sportswear companies such as Nike, which already allows shoppers to design their own trainers, posit a future where consumers will be able to 3D print their own shoes at home. Shoppers could become designers – when streetwear label Hype couldn’t decide which design to go for, they let their customers choose via an Instagram post.

We are, says Stott, moving ever closer to consumer-designed clothing. “Fashion – the industry it once was – no longer holds the cultural imagination or kudos it once did,” she says. “The hegemony of fashion influencers has shifted in recent years, from designers, creative directors and magazine editors to the people. The consumer wants creative input and hyper-personalised products, and technology is empowering them to do so.”

Clothes will function as a new interface – Mano ten Napel

At the same time, the technology that goes into clothes themselves is galloping ahead. Smart fabric companies are developing materials that can gather data such as, in the case of the Nike Adapt BB basketball shoe, whether a wearer needs to alter their strike in order to avoid injury. “In the future, with the roll out of 5G, clothes will function as a new interface, impacting on the way we communicate with the connected world and with each other,” says Mano ten Napel, founder of digital magazine FashNerd.

Whether or not these technologies will available to all, as in the case of fast fashion , is another matter. “I look at social behaviours,” reflects fashion forecaster Geraldine Wharry. “And I think supply scarcity – in terms of water and fabric shortages and costs going up, for example – is going to be a big one. When those things happen, people shift their budgets for what they really need to survive.” And fast fashion? “It’s an outdated model,” says Wharry. “I just cannot see how it can continue. Brands without some kind of sustainability strategy are in trouble.”

So where will the ordinary person turn for their fashion fix? As future tech evolves, parallel movements are showing a return to the hand made and the tactile. “There’s a lot of interest in craft,” says Wharry. “It’s a different way of connecting with the clothes.” Secondhand markets are exploding; according to fashion resale site ThredUP, sites like itself are growing 24 times faster than the retail industry as a whole. Meanwhile, the rental economy is gaining traction. “In fashion, rental can provide newness without the environmental cost,” says Sara Arnold of Higher Studio.

Fashion will retain its identity as a form of escapism and expression

“Humans still need to be clothed so we will see a shift in the way in which we access clothing in the future,” says Stott. “Ownership is no longer the end goal. We outsource our music and film choices to digital subscription services, and we will see a similar movement with clothing powered by AI. People will subscribe to central fashion services, and borrow clothes on a short-term basis according to their needs and lifestyle changes, reducing the masses of clothing sitting unused in a closet.”

However we get our clothes, fashion will retain its identity as a form of escapism and expression, particularly as planetary conditions get more difficult. “If you look at the Great Depression, there was a lot of glitz and glamour,” says Wharry. “And if you look at the trends right now, there’s a lot of colour. Fashion is always a mirror of what is going on in society. There could be so much difference between the haves and the have-nots in the future that it could create very extravagant fashion.”

"(Bloomberg) — France is taking aim at the fashion industry’s heavy environmental footprint with a plan to stop companies from destroying unsold items, a government official said.

While mass-market apparel brands often mark down goods until their shelves are cleared, luxury labels have long preferred to burn some unsold items or bury them in landfills rather than risk damage to their image that might come from having them spotted in discount bins.

“Too many companies feel OK with just throwing away or destroying the shoes or the clothing that haven’t been sold,” French Deputy Ecology Minister Brune Poirson said at a conference on fashion and sustainability in Copenhagen. “You can’t do this anymore. It’s shocking.”

Poirson called on brands to tackle the matter at the industry level but said the government would pursue a ban. The pledge comes after Burberry Group Plc said last year that it would end the practice after the disclosure that the U.K. trenchcoat maker destroyed almost $37 million worth of unsold goods in 2017.

Finding other ways to dispose of $2,500 jackets or $1,000 shoes will be challenging for luxury brands that don’t want to give away unsold items, since the array of materials in them could make recycling difficult."

You've invested in a reusable coffee cup, you're regularly separating your plastics in your rubbish and you've stopped splurging your paycheck on fast fashion. Now if only you could be so virtuous with your gym routine.

Working out is great for your health, but your quest for the perfect bod could be having a negative impact on the environment. Between reusable plastic bottles, throwaway wet kit bags and bargain-priced leggings, there's a lot you can do to trash the planet before you've even stepped foot on the treadmill.

Thankfully, gyms are making efforts to change the conversation. Chains like Barry's Bootcamp and 1Rebel have gone plastic-free this year - but there's still lots we can be doing on a micro-level.

If you're keen to become more sustainable while working up a sweat, switch to these green products to make your gym bag more friendly to the planet.

"From speed-dating to upcycling workshops, the people behind Peckham Palms have created a space for new fashion talent. Is this a lesson to ailing bricks-and-mortar stores?

With the British high street in serious decline and luxury fashion houses such as Burberry closing down stores globally, it’s no secret that the retail landscape is due a rethink. The public may be changing the way it shops, but retailers are also changing the way they sell. On Thursday, for example, models dressed in the latest collection by Amsterdam-based denim fashion label Hardeman joined members of the public in west London’s Eccleston Yards for a round of speed-dating. Part fashion presentation, part serious opportunity to find “the one”, the gathering was just the latest on the long list of events pushing the limits of the contemporary retail experience. The location? 50m, a fashion concept storefounded by the creative studio Something & Son.

Andy Merritt and Paul Smyth, who founded Something & Son, believe their fashion venture – a communal space for emerging designers to grow and evolve as their businesses do the same – offers one answer to the problem of smaller labels being shut out of the physical retail space by skyrocketing rents.

This is not Merritt and Smyth’s first social enterprise: the pair previously launched Makerversity (a community for creative businesses set in Somerset House), Mission Kitchen (shared workshops for food workers) and Peckham Palms (a hub for Afro hair and beauty).

Community events at 50m aren’t just for industry insiders either. In the past year, they have organised magazine parties with Niijournal (which seeks to explore “the issues of empowerment and representation within race”) and Gal-dem (written by women and non-binary people of colour), as well as a week-long series of events in honour of the 2019 Fashion Revolution, a global non-profit that campaigns for greater transparency in fashion supply chains. In addition to the panel discussions and workshops, Fashion Revolution also saw a special collaboration with Dutch designer Duran Lantink that encouraged people to bring in their own old clothes, which Lantink then reworked into new luxury items.

Providing a space for designers who wouldn’t necessarily be able to hold down a standalone store is one way that communal fashion spaces hope to foster new talent in an age when even big fashion houses are struggling to profit from bricks-and-mortar spaces.

50m originally stocked the works of just 10 designers.“We were already producing stock for our own e-commerce platform but [50m] gave me the opportunity to put that into a store and provided me with a chance to gain a better understanding of our customers,” says Daniel w. Fletcher, whose eponymous label was one of the original 10.It offered a way of curating a physical shopping space without the pressure of a big department store buy.

“We want to be supportive and help [brands] grow in an organic way and for them to really feel ownership of their own space, ” says Merrit and Smyth’s 50m co-founder, Tracey Suen. “At the moment, a lot of our designers are London-based, and we’re starting to introduce more international brands. We want to be a platform where the best emerging designers around the world are all on one screen.”

Today, the store houses around 50 brands, including menswear, womenswear and jewellery, as well as work by ceramicists, artists and candlemakers. Each of the creatives rents their own space within the store, deciding what to sell and how much of it, with 50m receiving a commission based on their sales.

“Designers have lots of creativity but, in order to build their brand, there’s so many other aspects they need to be thinking of,” says Suen. “Luckily, we’ve managed to find lots of people willing to volunteer their time.” Through internal meet-ups and mentoring programmes, the community interacts with a group of experts including production and intellectual property specialists, accountants and lawyers, and marketing pros – many of the contacts that a designer will need in order to grow a successful business.

The community-based concept allows designers the increasingly rare opportunity to meet with customers face-to-face, which can encourage a circular economy system. Instead of disposing of clothes after just a few wears, customers may be more inclined to keep, re-sell or gift an item if they have an emotional attachment to it, having been part of its creation.

Some pieces on the store’s online platform are also strictly made to order, again nurturing a sense of collaboration between the designer and their audience. By slowing down the process of shopping for clothes, 50m not only hope to create a more sustainable environment, they are also paving the way for emerging designers who want to do things differently."

"David Jones is struggling as customers are flocking to cheaper options such as Cotton On and K-Mart.

The Australian department store giant reported that their total sales decreased by 0.9 per cent over the last financial year.

Analysts believe that the decline is partly due to bargain hunting, where customers are seeking out cheaper options to purchase clothing and homeware items.

Senior Industry Analyst from IBISWorld, Kim Do, said that the results aren't surprising as many of the mid to up-market department stores have been seeing poor results.

'Both David Jones and Myers have failed to retain consumer expenditure amid rising competition from online-only retailers, fast fashion retailers and largely negative consumer sentiment over the period,' Ms Do said.

Lower-end department store, K-Mart, has boomed ever since they put their focus on affordable homewares, and has seen year-on-year growth over the past five years.

'Kmart dominates the cheap homeware market, as consumers increasingly prefer inexpensive fashionable homeware items over premium-priced varieties,' she said.

Ms Do also said that Big W has also tried to focus on this market by launching their own collection of affordable homewares.

While these smaller department stores are booming, David Jones' fashion department is also taking a hit as competition from fast fashion retailers, such as Cotton On and Zara, is becoming more intense.

Fast fashion retailers have the advantage of selling clothes at a lower prices, while still offering their customers the latest styles.

David Jones' profits were halved to $63 million over the last financial year, and they're trying to build this back up by offering exclusive partnerships.

DAVID JONES' STRUGGLES David Jones continues to struggle in an increasingly competitive retail environment, with total sales decreasing by 0.9 per cent in 2017-18. David Jones' profits were halved to $63 million over the last financial year. Comparable sales were also down in 2017-18 by 0.4 per cent.

On Thursday, it was announced that the Country Road Fashion Group would be leaving Myer completely to exclusively sell their products in David Jones - a move that could help the department giant rise again.

Ms Do says that despite the trend of bargain hunting rising, the luxury high-end market isn't diminishing.

'This trend is known as market polarisation, whereby consumers purchase the majority of their clothes and accessories from the fast fashion segment and then complement this with pieces from the luxury high-end market,' she said.

While David Jones has positioned itself as an up-market department store, the influx of international luxury brands in the Australian market poses a threat.

'Consumers have opted to purchase their luxury goods directly from these brands, rather than through the department store,' Ms Do said."
"Victoria’s Secret, already burdened by weak sales and calls to evolve in the #MeToo era, is facing another controversy: its leader Les Wexner’s name appearing in reports about disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.

Wexner, chairman and CEO of the alluring lingerie chain's parent L Brands, employed Epstein as a money manager for years, building a relationship close enough for Epstein to buy his Manhattan mansion. On Monday, federal prosecutors unsealed new charges claiming Epstein ran a sex-trafficking ring, which included girls as young as 14. These allegations have also triggered a political firestorm in Washington.

Wexner hasn’t been accused of any wrongdoing himself. The executive, who has declined to comment, severed ties with Epstein more than a decade ago.

L Brands Inc., which Wexner founded, hasn’t publicly commented on its chief's link to Epstein.

‘Saying Nothing’

The company may have to consider a more robust response, including a public effort to distance the lingerie company from its founder’s former fund manager. L Brands shares fell as much as 3.5% Tuesday, the most in about a month, while the S&P 500 index was little changed.

“Wexner needs to immediately and forcefully distance himself from Epstein, personally and professionally, and condemn Epstein’s actions in no uncertain terms,” said Jonathan Bernstein, a crisis-management consultant, noting that the company should proactively come forward with a statement. “You can’t separate the Wexner name from L Brands. He’s the founder of the company. There’s no such thing as saying nothing.”

If Victoria’s Secret is unwilling to take a stand, the company is likely to lose some market share to its competitors that take a hard stance on human rights and female empowerment, Bernstein said. And that’s something Victoria’s Secret can’t afford to do: Its same-store sales, a key retail metric, fell 5% in the latest quarter with management telling investors it was “clearly not satisfied” with the brand’s performance.

Changing Culture

Victoria’s Secret has been challenged by a changing culture—one where consumers are asking for more representation of a wider range of body types and respect for women. For years, its popular catalog took its cues from romance novels and Cosmopolitan magazine—a mix of sexiness, windswept allure, and cleavage-accentuating product lines. Still, change may be afoot: The company recently said it would amend the way it does its annual fashion show, suggesting it’s open to criticism after years of losing market share to upstarts seen as more female-friendly.

Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Poonam Goyal said the bigger thing for investors to watch is not Wexner’s name being dragged into the Epstein reporting, but whether the retailer is successful at rebranding this fall with new products that move Victoria’s Secret further beyond just “sexiness.”

This is “not good for profiling of the company, but the question is how long does this stay in the social realm? For any brand, if the negativity continues to be a part of mass following for a long period of time, it’s something that they’ll have to address,” she said. “Whether this affects the success of the new strategy depends on what the sentiment is in the fall.”

"Consumers are ramping up the pressure on fashion brands to ethically make clothes, resulting in a slow but significant shift across the industry, a report has revealed.

More than a third of brands have improved their rating since last year, according to the latest Baptist World Aid report.

But paying a living wage to workers continues to be a huge challenge for retailers, with only five percent of companies proving they were doing so at their final stages of production.

The sixth Ethical Fashion Report, released on Wednesday, graded 130 apparel companies, including 480 brands, from A+ to F on their policies, transparency, worker rights, and environmental management.

The 2019 report revealed Australia's best and worst performers alongside international brands, with Etiko, Outland Denim, Kookai, Cotton On and Country Road among those handed an A- or above.

Poor Australian performers included the Noni B Group, which owns brands such as Katies and Miller, swimwear company Tigerlily and discount clothing store Lowes.

Baptist World Aid CEO John Hickey says overall fashion companies have felt the pressure from consumers since the first report was released in 2013.

""People want to know they're not doing harm in what they're purchasing,"" he told AAP.

Last year there were 50,000 downloads of the organisation's ethical shopping guide, and thousands of others viewed the website and printed versions.

This year, the guide will be available through an app for the first time.

Governments are also turning up the heat through legislation.

Mr Hickey said the Modern Slavery Act, introduced on January 1, would make ""waves"" across the Australian fashion industry, which was worth close to $23.5 billion last year.

""The beginning of the supply chain is where the risk of child labour, forced labour and exploitation is most prevalent,"" he said.

The report revealed fashion brands rated most poorly on ""worker empowerment"", with a median D grade for this section of the report.

Nearly half of companies (48 per cent) had started to develop a living wage methodology, while 14 per cent of companies have projects to improve wages in the majority of factories, the report said.

Tanya Deans, Brand Manager at BONDS and its owner Hanesbrands, says working with third parties in the supply chain was one of the biggest challenges when aiming for ethics and sustainability.

Ms Deans said the company had scored an A partly because it owned a significant proportion of its manufacturing.

""If we own it, we can control workers rights in that process,"" she said.

While the company admits it's not perfect, Ms Deans said it was making a genuine effort to improve.

Some changes have come faster than others, with the company making big inroads in environmental sustainability by reducing greenhouse gases and water use, saving $10 million and reinvesting in local communities, Ms Deans said.

DEMETER

Demeter represents fertility and motherhood – she is the ultimate nurturing archetype. She is drawn towards full and layered highwaisted dresses.

MOTHER EARTH

Mother Earth is concerned about nourishing the world This means a gravitational pull towards natural fabrics. Hence, the move towards easy, simple designs. The must-have is the babouche – a shoe originally worn by Muslim women.

APHRODITE

Aphrodite was born from the cut-off genitals of her father mixed with the foam of the sea, so she loves foaming materials, layers and frills. You’ll find her dressed in pale colours, transparent textiles and elastic textiles to show off her body.

HESTIA

Here, both men and women can relate. Hestia is romantic with a caring disposition. She is comfortable being on her own but would welcome a partner. She is attracted to medium, dense colours and denim.

BASTET

The Egyptian goddess of cats, Bastet is the dancer archetype that displays physical characteristics like little hands and a high neck. Elegant and supple, her style is about sophistication and small hairdos.

"Organic children’s clothing store Ark & Eve announced an updated collection of linen clothing for boys and girls, featuring handmade pieces with natural, plant-based dyes.

East Ballina, Australia - February 21, 2019 /PressCable/ —

Ark & Eve, an online store specializing in linen children’s clothing, announced a new line of natural dyed pieces for boys and girls. Handmade from high-quality natural linen, the pieces are ideal for babies and toddler, being hypoallergenic and safe for all skin types. The new collection includes aprons, shorts, bandit scarfs and other items.

More information can be found at https://arkandeve.com.au.

Linen is an ideal fabric for baby clothing, offering a series of important advantages over other materials. It absorbs moisture rapidly, thus allowing the skin to breathe and minimizing the risk of rashes, is highly resistant to daily wear and tear, and grows even more comfortable to use as time goes by.

Ark & Eve offers a wide selection of handmade linen products for children up to the age of two, striving constantly to keep its collection updated with high-quality organic fabric pieces.

The latest update includes the Wanders Cross Back Apron, an all-purpose apron available in a gender-neutral, earth-tone green color which makes it ideal for both boys and girls. Handmade of 100% organic linen and dyed with all-natural plant dyes, the apron is hypoallergenic and designed for high comfort and durability.

Store visitors will also find linen bandit scarves featuring a single layer and available in Gold Dust and Midnight colors.

Other available pieces include shorts, dash rompers, dresses, capes and various others.

All Ark & Eve products are handmade of natural linen and dyed with organic plant-based dyes, the entire production process being environmentally sustainable.

The e-store was founded by Jessica Brook, a mother of two who strives to provide an eco-friendly, responsible alternative to synthetic-based children’s clothing stores.

Jessica said: “My, lets be honest, ‘obsession’ with children’s clothing has now transformed into something I’m very proud of, Ark and Eve. We are a sustainable and ethical option for kids clothes online, using only natural plant dyed fabrics, practical designs that grow with your child, and quality construction to ensure their longevity as they are handed down.”

There are 30 leaving the National College of Art and Design (NCAD) this year, 23 leaving the Limerick School of Art and Design (LSAD), with most destined to further their careers or studies abroad.

In NCAD the new Studio+ year between second and third year has attracted 11 students who either go on an Erasmus programme for further study or opt for practical experience in Ireland or abroad. Limerick students have interned with Simone Rocha and McQueen in London, IRO in Paris and even Ellery in Australia, and the college has now installed Gerber digital technical training, vital for improving modern skill sets.

On a recent visit to NCAD, the creativity of the fashion area which encompasses jewellery, textiles and fashion design was impressive. Detailed handwork was evident in many of the collections with widespread use of laser cutting, embroidery, pleating, printing and other elaborate time-consuming craft techniques.

Sustainability

According to the head of fashion Anne Melinn in Limerick, upcycling and sustainability “are huge this year. Many students are reclaiming old garments and reusing them. A lot are using natural dyes and aim for zero waste in pattern cutting,” she says. The college now has two courses, Fashion Design established over 40 years ago and the newer BA Fashion, Knitwear & Textiles course now in its third year with 11 graduating.

Inspiration

Inspiration comes from family, culture and heritage; in NCAD, from boxing and fishing to sustainable architecture and urban environments, in LSAD, 1920s movies, swing dancing and dreams were diverse starting points. Multicultural backgrounds are particularly notable; in NCAD Dora Newman and Elizabeth Omowumi mixed elements of African and European culture from their common Nigerian backgrounds to create something new and vibrant, while Nicolette Mai Xunanova’s handwoven interlaced jackets with pockets for plants made its own statement about sustainability. In Limerick, students hail from the Philippines, Holland, South Africa, France, China – last year there were three from Canada.

Many come up with unusual pieces: in NCAD Sinead Power who plays ladies’ football and camogie in the GAA used elements of sportswear with subtle details, as did Ciara Palmer whose grandfather was a garda and who used his 1970s raincoat as a guide to make something entirely new. In LSAD international students “bring a whole new ethos and these different approaches are really exciting” says Melinn.

According to Angela O'Kelly head of fashion design at NCAD, the work of the graduates of 2019 “reflects our changing cultural environment, how we are embracing local, national and global cultural identities”.

On Monday May 27th, one lucky student will win the Brown Thomas NCAD Young Designer of the Year Award, a cash prize, showcase of work at Create and a mentorship programme with Brown Thomas directors. BT have also sponsored the BA Fashion Design Film in Limerick with additional support from LEO Limerick. Another NCAD student Una King won this year’s River Island Bursary."
"Stella McCartney is set to back a United Nations charter to promote sustainable fashion and target some of the environmental threats the industry currently poses.

The British designer will work alongside high street fast fashion brands, who have yet to be announced, to help them set out plans to reduce their carbon footprint without compromising on business strategies.

The charter will be officially launched on 10 December at the UN’s annual convention on climate change, which takes place in Katowice, Poland.

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.

Speaking to The Guardian, the OBE and animal rights activist explained how it’s more important for fashion brands to champion sustainability now more than ever before.

“We really don’t have long now, to change things. But I honestly believe it’s doable – I couldn’t do what I do if I didn’t believe that,” she said.

“There is so much guilt and fear attached to talking about sustainability and that’s not helpful.

“What is essential is for the big players in the industry to come along with me, because that changes the price point.”

McCartney will unveil her plans at the Business of Fashion’s ""Voices"" conference in a session on Thursday afternoon.

The announcement comes two days after the Parliamentary Environmental Audit Committee's inquiry into fast fashion, which saw executives from Primark, M&S and Topshop come together to justify how they’re able to sell items for such low prices while meeting ethical and environmental standards.

The inquiry shed a light on just how much work there is to be done if we’re to see lasting change in the industry, explained Mary Creagh, chair of the Environmental Audit Committee.

“Evidence we heard today justifies our concerns that the current system allows fashion retailers to mark their own homework when it comes to workers’ rights, fair pay and sustainability,” she said in a statement released shortly after the inquiry had concluded.

Creagh went on to name some the most shocking revelations.

“Marks and Spencer are supposed to be a leading light in corporate responsibility, but even they pulled out of a scheme seeking to achieve living wages for garment workers through collective bargaining,” she said, adding that she was “unimpressed” that the CEO of Missguided, Nitin Passi, had refused to attend Parliament in person to answer questions about his supply chain."
"Consumers are ramping up the pressure on fashion brands to ethically make clothes, resulting in a slow but significant shift across the industry, a report has revealed.

More than a third of brands have improved their rating since last year, according to the latest Baptist World Aid report.

But paying a living wage to workers continues to be a huge challenge for retailers, with only five percent of companies proving they were doing so at their final stages of production.

The sixth Ethical Fashion Report, released on Wednesday, graded 130 apparel companies, including 480 brands, from A+ to F on their policies, transparency, worker rights, and environmental management.

The 2019 report revealed Australia's best and worst performers alongside international brands, with Etiko, Outland Denim, Kookai, Cotton On and Country Road among those handed an A- or above.

Poor Australian performers included the Noni B Group, which owns brands such as Katies and Miller, swimwear company Tigerlily and discount clothing store Lowes.

Baptist World Aid CEO John Hickey says overall fashion companies have felt the pressure from consumers since the first report was released in 2013.

""People want to know they're not doing harm in what they're purchasing,"" he told AAP.

Last year there were 50,000 downloads of the organisation's ethical shopping guide, and thousands of others viewed the website and printed versions.

This year, the guide will be available through an app for the first time.

Governments are also turning up the heat through legislation.

The 2019 Ethical Fashion Guide is here! The Guide grades over 400 brands on their efforts to reduce the risk of child labour, slavery, exploitation, and environmental degradation. Order it now: https://t.co/Uh98hfhPFY#BehindTheBarcode — Baptist World Aid (@BaptistWorldAid) April 10, 2019

Mr Hickey said the Modern Slavery Act, introduced on January 1, would make ""waves"" across the Australian fashion industry, which was worth close to $23.5 billion last year.

""The beginning of the supply chain is where the risk of child labour, forced labour and exploitation is most prevalent,"" he said.

The report revealed fashion brands rated most poorly on ""worker empowerment"", with a median D grade for this section of the report.

Nearly half of companies (48 per cent) had started to develop a living wage methodology, while 14 per cent of companies have projects to improve wages in the majority of factories, the report said.

Tanya Deans, Brand Manager at BONDS and its owner Hanesbrands, says working with third parties in the supply chain was one of the biggest challenges when aiming for ethics and sustainability.

Ms Deans said the company had scored an A partly because it owned a significant proportion of its manufacturing.

""If we own it, we can control workers rights in that process,"" she said.

While the company admits it's not perfect, Ms Deans said it was making a genuine effort to improve.

Some changes have come faster than others, with the company making big inroads in environmental sustainability by reducing greenhouse gases and water use, saving $10 million and reinvesting in local communities, Ms Deans said.

"The '90s fashion revival is one of the most talked about industry trends but, as is often the case when it comes to fashion, there's more than one style in vogue.

While you've probably seen the resurgence of tracksuits, graphic tees and hoop earrings, one fashion trend you might not be familiar with is the rise of modest fashion.

True to its name, modest fashion can roughly be described as dressing in a relatively covered manner with longer and looser clothes, without compromising on the latest style and colour trends.

Here's where modest fashion came from, how it's grown, and advice on how to rock the look.

Where modest fashion came from

While primarily associated with Islam and the requirement of Muslim women to cover up, modest fashion can be seen throughout many different time periods and cultures.

The trend can be traced back as early as the eighth century Islamic Empire. Then there's the robes, shawls and intricate kaftans of the 14th century Ottoman Empire. Even the Farthingale skirts of Elizabethan England could be considered modest fashion.

Image Modest fashion goes way back. Here are examples of modest clothing in the Ottoman Empire (left) and Elizabethan era (right). ( Wikipedia Commons and Wikipedia Commons )

Fast forward to the 21st century and RMIT University lecturer Shazia Bano describes modest fashion as ""a struggle to find a mediation between traditional modesty and blending into the crowd"".

As Ms Bano explains, modern modest fashion emerged from small-scale online retailers.

Now modest fashion has been endorsed by global fashion brands and retailers, launching their own exclusive modest fashion lines and embracing modest styles in many of their collections.

The trend has even featured in international fashion shows, including London and New York fashion weeks.

""Making fashion that accesses both sides of the audience is the real trend that's going on right now,"" Ms Bano says.

With modest fashion searches increasing by 500 per cent on Pinterest in the UK, and more designers resorting to longer and more flowy designs, the industry is expected to increase 51 per cent by 2019 and reach a net worth of $450 billion.

Modest fashion in Australia

In an Australian context, modest fashion is only starting to take off, according to Tarik Houcher, the 29-year-old CEO of a hijab fashion house.

Inspired by his sister's inability to find ""hijabi-friendly"" clothing, Tarik and his family opened one of Australia's first modest fashion clothing brands only six years ago.

Tarik explains how opening a modest fashion business in Australia hasn't been an overnight success because it was a completely new concept for the existing fashion market.

""One of the biggest struggles has been pioneering everything,"" Tarik says.

But starting from scratch also provided Tarik with a clean slate to work with to differentiate his brand from traditionally simpler styles associated with wearing the hijab.

It wasn't until Tarik and his team ventured into newer and brighter patterns, designs and colours that modest fashion in Australia really went viral and ""changed the hijab world"" here, he explains.

""Before then, no-one wore floral. We released this really feminine pink floral collection and it went viral and everyone loved it,"" Tarik says.

Since then, dozens of other modest fashion boutiques and online stores have opened to accommodate this new gap in the Australian fashion industry. And a modest fashion show was held in Perth earlier this year.

The trend was even recognised by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade who created a ""Faith, Fashion, Fusion: Muslim Women's Style in Australia"" exhibition at the Islamic Arts Museum in Kuala Lumpur.

Ms Bano believes the exhibition really ""started the conversation on modest fashion in Australia and made a statement that it was there"".

Social media has played a big role in modest fashion’s growth

Image Just like with most fashion trends, the trick is to take your own creative characteristics and weave them into the clothes you wear. ( ABC Life: Massilia Aili )

Over the last few years, the fashion industry has noticeably improved its cultural diversity, with models like Duckie Thot, Imaan Hammam and Halima Aden.

As a result, for many Muslim women, dressing modestly has become a creative form of self-expression where they can explore current fashion trends and mould them to create a more modest look.

Many inspiring young women use Instagram to document their own take on modest fashion and personal style, and encourage other Muslim women to explore modest fashion's infinite avenues.

Nineteen-year-old Instagram influencer Nawal Sari, from Liverpool in Sydney, started wearing the hijab at the age of sixteen when the modest fashion scene in Australia was barely existent.

""I looked up to my mum, my aunties and my cousins, and it was all very plain 'mum' clothes. I just didn't know what I was doing and I thought loose clothes and a tight hijab was the right way,"" Nawal says.

With the rise of social media as a platform for fashion and beauty bloggers, Nawal, who's had an interest in fashion from a young age, built her own style by taking inspiration from bloggers she would see on Instagram.

""I made an Instagram account a year after I wore the hijab, after I begged my mum,"" Nawal explains.

""I would see other girls overseas in the UK and America wearing jeans and a nice outfit, so I tried it.

""I never mainly looked at hijabi bloggers in the beginning — there wasn't many — so I was looking at normal bloggers and their outfits and making it my style.""

Loading...

Today, Nawal's modest twist on street style has helped her reach over 50,000 followers on Instagram, inspiring more than just a Muslim audience.

""I'm wearing sneakers and more street style, and everybody likes it. It's not just the Muslim community,"" Nawal says.

For 21-year-old hijabi model Miski Omar from Auburn in Sydney, who also started wearing the scarf at the age of 16, her style when first wearing the scarf was ""so basic"".

""I would just wear an outfit and chuck a slip-on scarf on top. It was very messy. When you first start wearing the scarf it's a lot of trial and error,"" Miski says.

Like Nawal, Miski took inspiration from those around her, regardless of whether they were Muslim.

Loading...

""In my first year of uni, I saw this girl wearing flared pants with Chuck Taylors, and that was not something I would see back at home in Auburn or at school. I thought, 'That's so cool, can I wear that?'"" Miski says.

From this, she grew to build her own personal style where she mixes ""many different subcultures that I find cool"" to create her own unique bohemian edge on modest fashion.

""Today, wearing my hijab is my expression and it's me being free,"" Miski says.

Fashion tips on how to rock a stylish modest look

When it comes to advice on how to dress modestly, both Nawal and Miski explain there's one all-important trick you have to master first: confidence!

""Don't be afraid. If you see something, just try it, see if it works, test yourself. You really will be surprised as to what could work,"" Miski says.

Just like with most fashion trends, the trick is to take your own creative characteristics and weave them into the clothes you wear.

Don't let the fear of looking different or being the odd one out deter you from exploring how different shades, textures and cuts work together. Instead, aim to be the trendsetter.

And if you're looking for a little inspiration, here are some things to remember:"

The website, founded in Paris 10 years ago, encourages consumers to join the circular economy as a sustainable alternative to fast fashion.

The three-day in-store pop-up aims to give unwanted fashion a second life by selling it on and helping to save natural resources.

"Una Healy and Emeli Sande rubbed shoulders with supermodels as they took to the catwalk for Oxfam’s show during London Fashion Week.

The music stars joined top models such as Stella Tennant and Laura Bailey at the Fashion Fighting Poverty event at Ambika P3 in London.

All the models showcased Oxfam clothes – which were picked by stylist Bay Garnett from the organisation’s online and high street shops – in a bid to highlight sustainable fashion. Emeli Sande (Aaron Chown/PA)

Garnett said: “I’m styling this show for a very simple reason. I love clothes, and the opportunity to work with them in a way that can actually help people is so exciting.

“I get a lot of pleasure from knowing that.

“I love second-hand clothes, and I love Oxfam’s commitment to fighting poverty. This collaboration is a no-brainer for me.” Stella Tennant (Aaron Chown/PA)

Fee Gilfeather, Oxfam’s sustainable fashion expert, said: “Here at Oxfam we never lose sight of the reason we sell fashion, which is to raise money to help the world’s poorest people.

“The clothes in Oxfam shops really do transform lives. A £10 dress can provide clean water for 10 people in an emergency.

“The outfits created by Bay illustrate beyond a shadow of doubt that our affordable, stylish clothes look incredible.

“Even better are the beautiful things they do, which is save lives and slow down fast fashion by giving clothes a second chance to be sold and prevent them blighting the environment in landfill. So, it’s clearly perfect shopping sense to buy our fashion!”

Tennant said the organisation was “a fabulous wardrobe of opportunity”. “I don’t like waste!” she added. Laura Bailey (Aaron Chown/PA)

Oxfam works across many areas of fashion, collaborating with big brands to recycle and reuse stock, joining forces with fashion houses to improve conditions in their supply chains and fighting to improve garment workers’ rights.

All profits from the organisation’s fashion sales fund Oxfam’s work fighting poverty and suffering around the world.

"Dog-friendly hotels and pet centric activities like yappy hour and cat cafes are on the rise. Picture: Supplied

The world of pet parenting is changing. Pets are the family we choose and we treat them as such. From daycare, hotel stays, clothing and food choices, we are humanising our pets, says South African pet nutrition expert, Hill’s.

There are six trends that are shaping the human world which underpin the humanisation of our four legged friends.

The quest for balance

Balancing health and well-being with a busy schedule is a perpetual struggle and one that leaves people looking for easy, quick fixes to optimise their self-care. Super foods and nutrient-dense ingredients have gained popularity over the past decade and the trend has filtered into pet nutrition too.

Peace of mind

Peace of mind about what goes into your body is now worth the extra time and expense – and this trend now plays a role in pet nutrition too. Pet parents look particularly for ""no lists"" and ""free from"" claims.

Pet parents are more aware, more critical and are on the hunt for simple ingredients, transparency and clean labels to reassure them that what their pets eating and feeding is healthy.

Treading lightly

Pet parents want to know where their pets’ food comes from and what impact the foods and ingredients are having on the environment. They want to know that they are making sustainable choices that won’t ultimately negatively affect the earth.

Less is more

Less is more, streamlining, simplification, downsizing – easier is better. Consumers around the world are demanding efficiency and technology is playing an important role.

From materialism to experientialism

It’s not about what you have, but rather what you do. People are spending more on experiences and travel and less on things – and taking our pets along with us is gaining popularity. Dog-friendly hotels and pet centric activities like yappy hour and cat cafes are on the rise.

One size doesn’t fit all

There is a surge of support for companies and brands that treat consumers as individuals and not as stereotypes. Pet parents are becoming less comfortable choosing a breed specific food or a one size fits all food when their pet might be battling with an ailment of sorts that the food doesn’t address.

Pets are an expression of human identity and brands that understand this, are the ones that will win in the future."
"A pint-sized fashionista is taking over our social feeds with her impeccable street style.

Aili Adalia and her mom, Kanaya, are the brains behind Aili's Instagram blog, where the 6-year-old's 23,000-plus followers are absolutely loving her looks.

""It's something that's fun to us that we enjoy doing,"" Kanaya, who lives in Michigan, told ""Good Morning America."" ""Of course, being her mom, it makes me ecstatic because it's not something I'm forcing her to do. She loves it and it makes me so happy.""

Kanaya, who's also mom to 2-year-old Maddox, said Aili has always shown an interest in fashion.

""She kind of mimics me,"" said Kanaya, who also has her own style blog. ""She [says], 'Mom, what are you wearing?'""

""She's a natural, it's just in her,"" Kanaya added.

In 2016, Aili was named the winner of a Christmas pageant and later began modeling for fashion brands.

But it's her Instagram page that's literally a family affair, with dad James Boler snapping the photos and mom helping Aili with outfit inspo.

""She'll tell me when she's not feeling it,"" Kanaya said. ""I'm not going to tell her, 'This looks crazy,' but I help her. You don't want to force her to do anything.""

Aili will sport the occasional splurge item, but the mother-daughter duo primarily shop affordable kids' clothing at Target, Walmart, Amazon, OshKosh and more.

Kanaya also designs some outfits herself for Aili, including a take on actress-singer Zendaya's 2017 and Cardi B's 2018 Met Gala looks. More recently, Aili channeled Tracee Ellis Ross' fashion moment from InStyle's November 2018 issue.

Each one of those stars re-grammed Aili's style portrayals, which garnered thousands more followers on Instagram.

""She's a little fashion blogger out here locally, and now she's gone viral,"" Kanaya said, adding that she teaches Aili to wear ""whatever makes you feel good.""

Kanaya is currently working on the launch of her kids' and women's clothing line."
"Last year, Southern African Clothing and Textile Workers Union marched on the SA Revenue Service (Sars) headquarters in Pretoria to protest against the lack of enforcement and inspection of imported goods. Photo: Mlondolozi Mbolo

JOHANNESBURG – While we have all seen the extent of public sector fraud and corruption, private sector corruption is just as damaging to the state and our economy. One such example is the illegal importation of goods into our country that flood mostly, but not exclusively, informal sector markets, which are most vulnerable and therefore receptive to cheap commodities.

Illegal importation takes a number of different forms. These include under-invoicing, where the importer declares a value on the goods that is significantly lower than their real worth; the false declaration of goods when the importer claims to be importing something different from what is actually in his consignment because it carries a lower import duty (for example, clothing and textiles carry a 40 percent import duty, making the sector among the highest rated); plain smuggling, where the items are not declared at all; or re-routing goods via another country, which may have a more favourable trade agreement with SA than the importer's own.

Of course, while this is private sector fraud on the part of the importer and receiving entity in South Africa, it requires the collusion or at least some turning of a blind eye by customs and excise duty officials, which also needs to be dealt with decisively.

Last year, Southern African Clothing and Textile Workers Union marched on the SA Revenue Service (Sars) headquarters in Pretoria to protest against the lack of enforcement and inspection of imported goods, specifically in their sector, which, as we know, has been decimated by massive amounts of cheap imported fabrics and ready-made garments.

This despite the introduction of a price reference system, devised by government, labour and business, to make it easier for customs officials to spot false amounts on import invoices. But it seems that there are many instances when they ignore flagrant falsification of facts and figures and allow the goods to pass across our borders.

The result of this illegal dumping is a massive loss to the fiscus. According to Sars figures, in 2014/15, they conducted 630 successful seizures of R68.8 million worth of illicit clothing and textiles.

The loss to the fiscus is a loss to public spending on health, education and training, and other basic services. And the losses are not only in tax revenue, but are felt massively in the jobs market. When cheap imported goods replace locally manufactured equivalent products, factory closures and lay-offs follow.

Ironically, in the very act of buying cheap, illegally imported goods, we are perpetuating our own poverty cycle by depriving ourselves of job opportunities and instead are stimulating productivity in countries whose exporters have few morals and no conscience.

In addition, there are risks to consumers when we knowingly accept cheap imports that evade SABS verification and local industry standardisation.

We have seen dangerous child car seats which cannot properly be anchored or secured and paraffin stoves that are highly prone to cause fires that ravage densely populated informal settlements where they are most prevalent.

In the automotive sector, illegal and unregulated filters, which comprise the largest portion of after-market sales, can pose a risk to the vehicle in which they are fitted.

GUD Filters manufacture oil, fuel and air filters and are Proudly South African members, verified, checked and audited and are an example of how Proudly South African as an organisation ensures that companies bearing its logo are accredited and quality controlled, and safe for consumers.

So, while we are working to drive demand, we are also ensuring there is a safe, legal and compliant supply of goods and services, produced or manufactured here. These, and not items that have been produced overseas and brought in through South Africa's back door and which are lining the pockets of the foreign producers and importers, are what we should be looking out for in our shops and on our shelves.

Unemployment persists, affecting many of us. Vusi Nova’s song Asiphelelanga is most relevant this week – too many of us are still ""left out"" – and those tasked with protecting our borders from illicitly imported goods should be helping us to grow our economy to create meaningful, decent and sustainable jobs.

Eustace Mashimbye is the chief executive of Proudly South African.

BUSINESS REPORT"
"US technology business Stitch Fix, which sells personalised clothing recommendations online, has unveiled plans to launch in the UK in 2019.

The company assigns personal stylists to customers who shop through its website, and then sends them personalised fashion boxes with items they believe will fit their tastes.

Stitch Fix chief executive Katrina Lake said on Monday that she plans to expand the business to the UK. “We believe our ability to create a uniquely personalised shopping experience is something that will resonate with consumers and brands outside of the US,” she said.

The company plans to sell items in the UK for prices ranging from £40 to £150 per item, a spokesman said. It has launched a waiting list for UK customers to sign up to ahead of the 2019 launch of the service in the UK.

Stitch Fix went public in the US last year and has a market cap of $4.3bn (£3.3bn). Its most recently quarterly earnings results saw the company increase quarterly revenue to $318.3m, up 23pc from the same period last year. The business also grew its number of active customers to 2.7m.

The entry of Stitch Fix in the UK market will disrupt the existing personalised fashion industry here. Startups including Thread and Intelistyle have raised funding for their personalised clothing products, which use a mixture of human stylists and artificial intelligence to provide clothing recommendations."

"Earlier this month, the French fashion conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton announced, after months of speculation, that it would expand its partnership with the pop star Robyn Rihanna Fenty, 31, beyond the beauty industry by launching a fashion line called Fenty. It’s the first major fashion brand that LVMH has created from scratch in its history, and it represents another historic shift: Rihanna is now the first black woman at the helm of one of Paris’s luxury houses, long revered for maintaining the highest level (in terms of craftsmanship, aesthetics and, yes, cost — though more on that later) of clothing and accessory design.

Today, in a wide-ranging digital cover story published by T: The New York Times Style Magazine, Rihanna discusses her new company for the first time, explains its genesis and reveals the line by modeling it in photographs that were shot for T in a home near London. In the interview, conducted by the playwright Jeremy O. Harris, she goes deep on her life, her music and her businesses. Here are the seven things to know first.

[Read more: Rihanna Opens Up About Her New Clothing Line, the Future of Fashion and Her Next Album]

1. Rihanna has a vision for changing the fashion industry.

When Fenty.com goes live on May 29, it will be one of few luxury brands to commit fully to online sales: There are no plans for runway shows, flagship boutiques or third-party sales through department stores. New clothes will instead “drop” each month on the website, similar to the model pioneered by the streetwear brand Supreme. Prices, which start at around $200 for a T-shirt and rise to around $1,500 for outerwear, are lower than most other Parisian luxury brands, and sizes — which go up to a French 46 (an American 14) — are offered in a somewhat wider range. “It’s a new way of doing things because I believe that this is where fashion is going to go eventually,” said Rihanna, who based this strategy and the collection of clothing, shoes and jewelry on how she wants to shop and dress herself:

“You wear what looks good on you and that’s it. I’m thick and curvy right now, and so if I can’t wear my own stuff then, I mean, that’s not gonna work, right?”

2. Rihanna has new music coming out soon.

In a rat-a-tat exchange with Harris that addresses the rumors surrounding her forthcoming album, the first since she released “Anti” to rapturous praise in 2016, the singer confirmed the following facts: She is making a reggae album; it will arrive imminently, but she doesn’t know the exact date yet; and, sure, she’s open to working with Lady Gaga, who recently followed her on Instagram. As for the name of her ninth album? Here’s her response:

“So far it’s just been R9, thanks to the Navy,” she said, referencing the term for her crew of fans. “I’m about to call it that, probably ’cause they have haunted me with this ‘R9, R9, when is R9 coming out?’ How will I accept another name after that’s been burned into my skull?”

3. ... But don’t expect Drake to be featured on her next album.

The two musicians, reportedly linked by a romantic past, have often appeared on each other’s albums, producing memorable hits like 2010’s “What’s My Name?” 2011’s “Take Care” and 2016’s “Work.”

But when asked if she would collaborate with him again, she was definitive: “Not anytime soon, I don’t see it happening. Not on this album, that’s for sure.”"
"(Bloomberg) — France is taking aim at the fashion industry’s heavy environmental footprint with a plan to stop companies from destroying unsold items, a government official said.

While mass-market apparel brands often mark down goods until their shelves are cleared, luxury labels have long preferred to burn some unsold items or bury them in landfills rather than risk damage to their image that might come from having them spotted in discount bins.

“Too many companies feel OK with just throwing away or destroying the shoes or the clothing that haven’t been sold,” French Deputy Ecology Minister Brune Poirson said at a conference on fashion and sustainability in Copenhagen. “You can’t do this anymore. It’s shocking.”

Poirson called on brands to tackle the matter at the industry level but said the government would pursue a ban. The pledge comes after Burberry Group Plc said last year that it would end the practice after the disclosure that the U.K. trenchcoat maker destroyed almost $37 million worth of unsold goods in 2017.

Finding other ways to dispose of $2,500 jackets or $1,000 shoes will be challenging for luxury brands that don’t want to give away unsold items, since the array of materials in them could make recycling difficult."

"Hong Kong (CNN Business) Some are leather-free. Others use recycled plastic bottles. Many have soles made from wild Amazonian rubber.

Could Veja sneakers be the most sustainable shoes in the world?

The French fashion brand's founders, Sébastien Kopp and François-Ghislain Morillion, certainly hope so.

The two childhood friends visited clothing and food factories in South America, Asia and Australia while running a nonprofit group — and were appalled by what they saw.

""We realized that we did not know how products were made, and that if we knew, we would consume differently,"" said Kopp.

In 2005, they founded Veja in France, with the mission of making sneakers using the most ecological materials and ethical suppliers they could find.

Today, Veja supplies its shoes to 1,800 retailers in 45 countries. The company says it sold 550,000 pairs last year, generating $21 million in revenue.

Rethinking a popular product

Kopp and Morillion, who are both 40, didn't start out in fashion. They worked in finance in Washington and New York until 2002, when they made the switch. They founded a non-profit that studied companies' corporate social responsibility policies around the world, and then launched Veja three years later.

Veja means ""look"" in Portuguese, the official language of Brazil, where Kopp and Morillion source their materials.

The idea behind the brand is to ""rethink the creation of a popular product,"" Kopp said.

A pair of Veja retails for $95 and up.

The two men each put in about $8,000 and took out a small loan to launch Veja.

They started buying wild rubber from rubber tappers in the Amazon even though it costs more than synthetic materials. ""It helps to fight against deforestation, as [they] prefer to work for us than to cut trees to raise cattle,"" he said.

The business partners also decided to use ecological cotton that's grown in a way that enriches the soil rather than damaging it with chemicals.

But their most striking move was to invent the waterproof ""bottle mesh"" used to make the upper part of some of their sneaker models.

It takes three recycled plastic bottles to make one pair of shoes, according to the company. The bottles are collected from the streets of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, then sent to a factory where they're crushed into flakes and transformed into fiber.

None of this comes cheap. Making Veja sneakers costs between five and seven times as much as an average pair of sneakers, according to the company.

Founders Kopp (on the left) and Morillion.

""A lot of our clients are discovering what is behind Veja after they buy one or two pairs,"" he explained, adding that they come back for more after finding out the brand's story. Veja sneakers' prices range from $95 to $195.

Other ethical fashion brands on the market include US-based Alternative Apparel, which uses eco-friendly materials, and UK womenswear brand People Tree, whose products are made out of organic materials.

International growth

The company, which employs 100 people, is headquartered in Paris. Kopp, who taught himself shoe design by visiting sneaker factories, leads the design team.

Celebrities such as Emma Watson and Marion Cotillard have been photographed wearing Veja shoes, which are known for their minimalist design and signature ""V"" logo.

Sales have taken off in recent years, growing 50% annually since 2015, according to the company. It supplies its sneakers to high-end retailers in the United Kingdom and started selling them in the United States in 2016.

Kopp believes awareness of ethical fashion is growing.

""People want to change the way they are consuming much more than before,"" he said."
"The Duchess of Sussex has championed several Canadian labels since joining the royal family, and coats from the brand Mackage have been her go-to on some of her most high-profile appearances to date - including her engagement announcement.

Now, British fans looking to steal Meghan's style can buy the brand in the UK after it launched a pop-up in Harrods, running until mid-November.

However, the Duchess might not be quite to impressed with the pieces on offer, which don't quite fit with the ethical image she likes to champion through her clothing.

The new range of coats available at Harrods features a collection of parkas lined and trimmed with real fur.

One £1,150 parka for instance in lined with 'genuine rabbit fur' and has a 'genuine fox fur trim to hood'.

The Duchess of Sussex chose a Mackage coat for her first official visit to Belfast in March, but will she boycott the brand now that it's selling coats adorned with real fur at Harrods?

The £950 Akiva Down Fur-Lined Hooded Coat currently on sale at Harrods features a real fox fur trim and rabbit fur lining

The new Mackage range on sale at Harrods features multiple coats that feature real fur trim and linings

Meghan has championed Mackage on a number of important occasions, including her highly significant first official royal duty with Harry, days after they announced their engagement.

The Duchess wore the $790 CAD (£585) Elodie by Mackage navy coat to meet hordes of fans in Nottingham in December 2017, her first official royal engagement on behalf of the royal family.

She also donned the Mai waterfall coat, $750 CAD (£427), for her first official visit to Northern Ireland with Prince Harry in March 2018, which sold out within an hour.

The label later cashed in on its popularity by ramping up the price of the belted number by $40 CAD (£23), up to $790 CAD (£450).

The Duchess of Sussex chose to champion Mackage on her high profile first official engagement with Prince Harry in Nottingham in December 2017, days after announcing they were getting married

The use of real fur will surely not sit well with Meghan who is known for wearing brands that support ethical, eco-friendly or sustainable practices.

She also likes to wear brands that support charitable endeavours or have a feminist message at heart.

During the recent royal tour of Sydney, New Zealand and Oceania, she used her high profile appearances to promote a 'woke' message through her wardrobe.

The Veja trainers she wore for a boat trip in Sydney during the Invictus Games were environmentally friendly, made from raw materials sourced from organic farming and ecological agriculture.

Meghan wore her Rothy's flats - seen on the Duchess on South Melbourne Beach - twice on tour. Vogue has dubbed the pumps, made from recycled plastic bottles, the most 'politically correct shoes on the planet'

Outland Denim, the brand behind the 'Harriet' jeans she wore on the same boat trip - and on other occasions over the course of the tour - revealed that the spike in interest in its jeans thanks to the Duchess' support had enabled it to employ a further 15 to 30 seamstresses in its Cambodian production house.

Outland trains and employs female victims of human trafficking and sexual exploitation in the country.

The Rothy's flats Meghan wore twice on tour are made from recycled plastic water bottles that would otherwise have been destined for landfill - and have been dubbed the most 'politically correct shoes on the planet' by Vogue.

Even her most high-end items included right-on choices - she wore a navy cocktail dress by Gabriela Hearst in Wellington, a designer who operates on a sustainable, less-is-more ethos.

And Meghan's wedding reception dress designer Stella McCartney, who also made the navy dress she wore in Rotorua on the final day of the royal tour, is famous for her cruelty-free approach to luxury fashion."
"KZN businesswoman Lelly Mntungwa. PHOTO: Supplied

CAPE TOWN - A KwaZulu Natal businesswoman resigned from her retail store manager position in an effort to uplift young women by establishing a clothing factory which currently affords a living to more than 60 people in her community. Lelly Mntungwa, 38, from Msinga, a rural community in the Umzinyathi District Municipality, saw a gap in the market when a leading retailer closed down to establish a clothing factory.

In an effort to reduce the unemployment rate and poverty in the area, she grabbed the opportunity to empower the Msinga community through job creation and skills capacitation.

“In my community, young girls being abducted and forced into marriage even at the age of 16 is commonplace as is dropping out of school to run child-headed families. The situation compelled me to intervene and develop these ‘young wives’ through skills transfer,” said Mntungwa.

She added that a partnership with the department of higher education had been forged to assist learners dropping out of school to complete their matric at no cost and 216 learners were already part of the programme.

Without any financial assistance, she began her entrepreneurial journey.

“It has taken me five years to be where I am today. Expect challenges and delays with whatever you do in life. They exist to make you stronger,” she said.

Mntungwa has a national diploma in marketing and undertook various courses aimed at skilling herself in the areas of clothing and textile and leather processing.

The mother of two was raised by a single parent and has four siblings. She completed her primary and secondary school education at Domino Servite School in Kranskop in the Natal Midlands.

“Women in remote areas don’t have access to information and resources to thrive and are hence, neglected. Rural life is still very much dominated by a patriarchal system where women find themselves working harder to prove themselves,” Mntungwa said.

She added that perseverance and hard work were her recipes for success in life and that the responsibility was on the individual to take advantage of the opportunities to succeed.

“I am not afraid of a challenge and I am somewhat of a risk taker. I believe skills transfer is a sustainable gift - it can empower people to become income generators and survive during difficult situations.”

Trade and Investment KwaZulu-Natal (TIKZN) whose mandate is to promote KZN as an investment destination has also provided Mntungwa with much-needed support and business guidance.

“The turning point in my career was in 2016 when TIKZN did an Umzinyathi District Municipality Roadshow. I was given an opportunity as an up-and-coming entrepreneur to deliver a presentation at the roadshow.

“Even though I probably had the least experience in the room, I capitalised on the opportunity given to me by TIKZN to expose my business.

“People often look down on individuals from rural backgrounds as they make the assumption that we are clueless but this was not the case with TIKZN. The investment promotion agency encouraged me to view my business on a much larger scale and to identify opportunities to market my products internationally,” she added.

She said she had obtained a wealth of knowledge from TIKZN about the clothing and textiles industry in which she works. “The success and growth of my business will have a positive impact on the local economy as Msinga is one of the poorest parts of KZN.”

Spanning London, Florence, Paris and Milan -- and even a branch of McDonald's -- the runways of men's fashion season have been full of surprises.

Over the last three weeks, the world's leading menswear designers unveiled their Spring-Summer 2020 creations through a Europe-wide schedule of shows and presentations. And in addition to the usual assortment of streetwear and classic tailoring, their collections were rich with innovation, from inflatable clothing to recycled textiles.

Memorable moments

Arsenal defender Héctor Bellerín, who British Vogue dubbed ""football's most stylish player"" in March, took his well-known love of fashion to new heights in Paris, walking the runway at Louis Vuitton. The Spaniard wore an embossed fushcia hoodie and matching shorts by artistic director Virgil Abloh.

Vetements -- under the leadership of creative director Demna Gvasalia -- engineered the ultimate high-low collaboration, hosting its show in a Parisian McDonald's.

Taking things a step further, Gvasalia showed outfits inspired by the uniforms worn by security guards and managers, and a few models ate fries while they walked down the runway. In an additional flourish, show notes were printed on napkins.

The most transcendent concept, however, was conceived by University of Westminster student San Kim, who showed a collection of inflatable garments in London. One model walked in what seemed to be a transparent balloon suit. (A pair of white boxer shorts kept things PG.)

During Pitti Uomo in Florence, Clare Waight Keller, perhaps best known for designing the wedding dress worn by Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, debuted her first full menswear collection for Givenchy at the lush Villa Palmieri.

This season, Waight Keller was inspired by 19th-century French poet Charles Baudelaire's floral book covers, traditional French tapestry-making and, in an unexpected twist, contemporary Seoul street style. Models kept their louche tailoring and streetwear-inspired pieces casual with sneakers.

British designer Craig Green drew from similarly diverse sources of inspiration this season, including Mexican ""papel picado"" (perforated paper flags) and Egyptian burial rituals, at London Fashion Week Men's.

At the same event, Bethany Williams, who won the Queen Elizabeth II Award For British Design, showed a sustainable collection made exclusively from recycled and organic textiles.

In Paris, Kenzo designers Carol Lim and Humberto Leon staged their final show with the French luxury fashion house, after eight years at the helm. Models walked to a musical score by Solange, and the collection -- with neoprene suits and mermaid-esque touches -- was inspired by Japanese ama, or female free divers.

And over at the Celine show, creative director Hedi Slimane, known for his love of skinny silhouettes, sent models down the runway in slim-cut blazers and 70s-style flares.

"Once upon a time in Guatemala, you could tell the precise village a Mayan resident lived in by the clothes they wore.

Such site-specific fashion design is but a long-ago notion in the age of globalism, but a new exhibit at San Jose’s Museum of Quilts and Textiles serves up a collection of trajes, or traditional clothing, from various Mayan communities in Guatemala. The exhibit also includes more contemporary fashions and explores the reasons and results of fashion evolution in that South American country.

Fascinating as the subject matter is, though, the star of the exhibit is the brightly colored, intricately designed items of clothing on displaying, dating from the early 20th century to contemporary times.

The exhibit, titled “Mayan Traje: Tradition in Transition,” features items from the Ixchel Museum in Guatemala.

Details: Through Oct. 13; 520 South 1st St., San Jose; hours are 11 a.m.-4 p.m. Wednesday through Friday, 11 a.m.-3 p.m. Saturday and Sunday; $6.50-$8; 408-971-0323, www.sjquiltmuseum.org."
"The greatest misconception about the Green Carpet awards, which brought Milan fashion week to a close with a celebration of sustainable fashion, is that they are an alternative to the traditional red carpet. The true aim of the Green Carpet project is to rip the red one up entirely and replace it.

“People called last year’s Green Carpet awards the Oscars of sustainable fashion,” said organiser and ethical fashion campaigner Livia Firth. “I hope that soon we will just be the Oscars of fashion.”

Firth’s strategy is to use glamour to mainstream sustainability. Julianne Moore and Cate Blanchett travelled to Milan to join Anna Wintour and Cindy Crawford for a ceremony for which statuettes are crafted from Fairmined-certified ethical gold.



For Italy, the awards are a valuable sprinkling of stardust on a Milan fashion week that has been depleted by this season’s defection of Gucci to Paris, where the label’s show will be held on Monday evening. But, with embarrassing timing, the ethics of the Italian luxury fashion industry have been called into question.

A New York Times investigation found that skilled work was being outsourced from licensed factories to seamstresses working at home, who were paid as little as one euro an hour while working on clothes that would retail for thousands of pounds. Reporters collected evidence from 60 home workers, mostly female, in the economically fragile region of Puglia, working for exploitative rates and without contracts or insurance.

The revelations are a setback for Italian fashion, undermining the wholesomeness of the Made in Italy slogan and flagging the need for brands to take proactive responsibility in overseeing their supply chains. Carlo Capasa, president of Italian fashion’s chamber of commerce, addressed the issue directly, opening the evening by declaring himself “saddened and concerned” by the investigation.

But he pushed back on Italy’s specific culpability, arguing that the problem of irregular workers was greater in New York City than in Puglia. “Rather than ‘this is Italy’,” he said, “I would say ‘this is the world’.”

Capasa remains convinced that leadership on sustainability is essential to help the country recover pole position as the most dynamic fashion capital. Firth said: “Sustainablity is not just about environment footprint of fashion, it is also about the handprint – the social impact, which is just as important. If you address the social impact of fashion you will fundamentally change it for the better.”

Social impact was spotlit throughout the ceremony. Cameron Russell, who has led an uprising of models fighting harassment and abuse, received the prestigious changemaker award. Sinéad Burke, whose dwarfism drives her activism for inclusivity in fashion, was presented with the leaders award. “The influence of fashion shapes culture,” she asked the audience. “What will you do with your privilege to make this space more accessible?”

Italian entrepreneur Renzo Rosso said: “People like all of us destroyed the world. But now, we are trying to make it better for our children.” Cate Blanchett, honouring Australian wool growers with the eco stewardship award, said the awards “honour those who take their cue from our planet, an approach that is so important to our future”. Julianne Moore presented a craft mashup award to 20 cobblers of Salvatore Ferragamo, while Elle Macpherson received the wellness award, and Cindy Crawford presented an award to Donatella Versace.

At Cannes film festival this year Blanchett broke with red carpet by wearing a black lace Giorgio Armani gown in which she was photographed winning a Golden Globe in 2014. “It seems wilful and ridiculous that such garments are not cherished and reworn for a lifetime,” Blanchett said in Cannes.

Despite the accusations levelled at luxury fashion this week, Firth believes the biggest barrier to sustainability remains fast fashion, which “wreaks devastation on the industry. There is a reason that the owners of stores like Zara are multimillionaires, and that is that we buy too much crap and we buy without thinking.”"
"In the past, shopping sustainably for clothing likely meant a trip to an ""eco-friendly"" store somewhere in the ""granola belt"" in a major city.

Now, consumer demand for more information and options to shop sustainably has compelled two major retailers, The Iconic and David Jones, to overhaul their online stores.

From today, The Iconic will offer customers the ability to search by five sustainable criteria covering social issues, the environment and animal welfare, as part of its ""Considered"" initiative.

Launching with 6500 products, the function follows a year-long process that included a major upgrade of the e-tailer's back-end, says Jaana Quaintance-James, The Iconic's head of sustainability and ethical sourcing."
"PARIS (REUTERS) - Louis Vuitton parent owner LVMH is developing a luxury brand with singer Rihanna, in a rare move by the acquisitive group towards building a new fashion label from scratch, industry news site WWD reported.

Paris-based LVMH - also the owner of Christian Dior and Givenchy, among a host of other luxury brands also spanning champagne and cosmetics labels - declined to comment.

It already has a partnership with the Umbrella singer in make-up. Fenty Beauty, which was developed with Rihanna via LVMH's Kendo ""brand incubator"", which promotes new products and labels, has grown rapidly since launching in September 2017.

LVMH said last April it expected Fenty to reach US$500 million (S$670 million) in retail sales in 2018 - which includes the revenue reaped by third parties - though it has not given an update since.

The new Rihanna venture would include clothing, leather goods and accessories, WWD said on Wednesday (Jan 16), citing sources with knowledge of the launch.

It said a collection could be released later this year, though the timing was uncertain.

Run by billionaire boss Bernard Arnault, LVMH has more often opted to grow through purchases, and it splashed out US$3.2 billion at the end of last year to buy hotel owner Belmond in a bid to branch into upscale hospitality.

In recent months, it has also invested heavily in developing its existing brands, however, including Celine, which has brought in a new designer and launched into menswear in a bid to grow revenues.

"With the sales in full swing and festive soirees dominating social calendars, fast fashion is showing few signs of slowing down. But for those consumers with more parties than pounds, fashion libraries – where clothes can be rented rather than bought – are becoming increasingly popular.

“I don’t have the financial income to invest in high quality but I do want to change my style regularly,” said Zoe Partridge, founder of rental service Wear the Walk, which launched last year. “So my problem was either to invest every six months in a luxury item or to buy lots of fast fashion. There was no middle ground. I wanted to create that.”

As the party season continues, the appeal of borrowing instead of buying is on the rise. It allow partygoers to wear items that may be beyond their usual budget and means they aren’t under pressure to wear them to every possible occasion in order to feel they are getting their money’s worth.

Fashion libraries allow users to check out clothes, wear them for a set period, then return them to the library (where dry-cleaning is usually taken care of) in exchange for something new. Some also offer the option to buy – ideal if it turns out you can’t bear to say goodbye to the item after all.

“We realise the burden and commitment that come with ownership and the freedom that comes with using what we really gain value from, when we want it,” said Sara Arnold, founder of subscription-only rental service Higher Studio, which launched in April. “It comes down to re-evaluating what we want from our fashion objects.”

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Websites such as Girl Meets Dress, above, offer the chance to rent designer clothing at a low cost.

Renting clothes is not a new concept: high-priced items worn for a single occasion, such as a prom night or a wedding, have long been available for hire. Sites such as Front Row and Girl Meets Dress offer designer items at a low cost – the latter specialising in dresses and catering for events such as races, premieres and awards. But subscription services, which offer long-term borrowing on everyday items, are beginning to gain traction.

Westfield shopping centre in Stratford, east London, launched the first streetwear hire pop-up store, The Drop, earlier this month, offering items for hire (starting at just £10 for four or seven days). It focused on streetwear styles – trainers topped the list of the most-coveted item on show – rather than just dresses. Available apparel also included a Maharishi tiger-style tour jacket (worth £750 new) and a Dirty South padded jacket (worth £210).

The trend for renting clothes also has the scope to tackle other forms of “throwaway” fashion: for example, the US-based subscription service Le Tote invites users to choose from classic or maternity ranges. For pregnant women, the fact that clothes will only be worn for a short period is perhaps more easily understood than it is for those of us who vow to wear something for years because it cost the same as a month’s rent.

But is rentable fashion bad news for designers? Not necessarily, according to Arnold. “We don’t own the stock but split the earnings with the brands when items are rented,” she said. “We want them to be able to earn from quality and durability rather than the quantity sold.”

With UK households sending 300,000 tonnes of fashion waste to landfill each year, and the average number of times a garment is worn before it is retired dropping by 36% in the past 15 years, fashion libraries offer an ethical solution.

According to research by Westfield, seven out of 10 UK shoppers would pay to rent “the hottest fashion item of the moment”. For 33% of them, the appeal of renting clothes lay in saving money, while one in eight were motivated by the desire to shop in a more sustainable way.

It’s not just in the UK that shoppers are keen to maximise wardrobe space. At Lena fashion library in Amsterdam, subscriptions allocate customers points that can then be “spent” on renting new and vintage clothes, alongside the option to buy. In Gothenburg, Sweden, fashion library Klädoteket offers lease periods of up to three months – 450kr (£40) for two items, 650kr (£57) for four. Items range from sequin dresses to baseball caps and, if customers decide they want to own an item they are renting, they will be given 15% off the retail price.

Meanwhile, Toronto’s Fresh Fashion Library offers one of the most budget-friendly options: $30 (£17.50) per month membership allows customers to borrow three items for an unlimited lease period. Which beats scouring the sales for something to see in the new year – and then never wearing it again.

And there were serious bargains to be had: ""I remember buying a pair of vintage, barely-worn Reebok shoes for about €30, after seeing them for €100 in town.""

Lucan native and master's student Titilola Akande (31) went even one better in terms of lucrative finds: ""The best bargain l've ever bought was a pair of vintage Deadstock Levi jeans from the 70s,"" she enthuses. ""They're like a piece of history.""

In the last few years, the cohort of young fashion trailblazers that raid their own wardrobes and sell (and buy) on the app has swelled considerably, both in Ireland and elsewhere. Founded in 2011, Depop now boasts 10 million users, a great many of them women aged between 13 and 24, and the site takes more than $400 million (€350m) in sales a year, a figure that has doubled every 12 months. Ireland, according to Rachel Swindenbank, Depop's VP of Marketplace, was among the fastest-growing markets in 2018, and now boasts around 300,000 accounts.

Hazel O’Malley sources vintage clothes to sell on Depop

""We've built a product that's mobile-first, and our product really fits with the Gen Z trends,"" she reveals. ""The younger generation are particularly interested in building a side hustle and not following the traditional (work) routes. We've just empowered them to build their own brands and empires.""

Young men and women are raiding their own wardrobes (and often, their parents') and selling off what they no longer need. Billed as a more Insta-adjacent alternative to eBay and Gumtree, Depop is a close relative of online marketplaces like Grailed and Thredup, albeit with one difference. Depop, with its filtered, aspirational look, is widely regarded as blazing a serious style trail, and its users are shaking up trends. Want to know what's about to become a huge trend? Depop is one of the best barometers out there.

A study in the US by Thredup suggested there was a 25pc rise in the number of women prepared to buy second-hand in 2017 compared with the year before. The reasons are manifold: Gen Z is tiring of fast-fashion and looking for a more sustainable alternative, and they don't appear to have the reticence about wearing 'pre-loved' items that previous generations might.

""The numbers on how much clothing end up in landfills or how much water it takes to make a new T-shirt is mind-boggling,"" notes Akande. ""Vintage/second-hand clothing is a way to offer people affordable and trendy clothing while keeping vintage clothes out of the landfill. Being mindful about what l buy new is very important.""

But even more pertinently, Depop offers young men and women the chance to bag one-off items.

""Irish women are looking for something different,"" observes Killarney-based Depop seller Hazel O'Malley (44). ""I think Irish women are more confident in developing their own style and sometimes that means that what you are looking for isn't on the high street, just because it's not on trend that particular season. From speaking with customers, a lot of them have lived abroad or spent summers away and it has become the norm for them to shop in second-hand stores, markets and yard sales.""

Binns sells on her coveted looks from Irish festivals, as featured on her Instagram account. ""It's a look that I probably won't wear again,"" she notes. ""People going to music festivals will want to shop smaller, individual brands as they'll want to look different. If I bought an outfit for €150 and wear it once, I'll sell it for €100, and it pays for my festival ticket.""

Others, like Clonskeagh-based artist/textile designer Cathy Jackson (26), use the site with an eye trained towards business.

""I've only been selling on Depop for a few months, but have made €100 selling little bits,"" she says. ""I'm a single mum trying to work in the art industry and take care of my child, and I was scratching around for ways to make money. I'm pretty tech-illiterate, but it's the easiest thing I've used in my life. I studied textiles so it's easy for me to make clothes and embellish items.""

Akanda, too, admits that the financial potential is a huge part of the appeal: ""A big accomplishment for me is having repeat customers,"" she says. ""It's easy to sell once, but to have returning customers who buy multiple items is great. I have a good few girls that are returning customers at the moment and my goal is to increase that number. At first, a lot of the clothes l sold were my own as l already had quite an extensive personal vintage collection. Nowadays, l sell a mix of both and do actively find vintage clothing to upcycle and resell.""

O'Malley had already enjoyed a successful stint at co-running a weekly flea market. Moving online was a natural progression. ""I had been selling at vintage markets in Dublin, Galway and Cork and this just seemed like the perfect way to reach even more people,"" she explains. ""I source the clothes to sell. I have a vintage shop in Killarney, Hazel's Nuts About Vintage, so the pieces I have in the shop are mostly all for sale on Depop too.""

For many years, one-off vintage items made up the bulk of listings, but its Irish sellers have noticed a shift recently.

""I think vintage had a more 'exclusive' meaning years ago, but it's out a bit now, and designer labels are definitely coming back in,"" says Jackson. ""We used to want the alternative, hipster thing, but now people want designer items but can't afford them."" Binns echoes this sentiment: ""Gucci belts were massive on Depop last year. I've seen people buy Balenciaga runners on Depop for €400 - I looked in Brown Thomas and they were €800.""

Yet Akande is adamant that our love affair with vintage looks set to run and run.

""There's a higher appreciation for vintage clothing and the unbeatable quality that's hard to find these days - there's also wanting to own clothes that have a story/history behind them,"" she notes.

Unlike eBay, Depop operates in much the same way as a social networking site, allowing users to amass followers (and by extension, social cachet), to contact each other and forge a community of sorts.

""It's so personal,"" says Jackson. ""I live in Clonskeagh and one buyer told me he was across the road, and he came to my house and paid the €30 for a Ralph Lauren jumper, and I saved on postage. Presumably as the site gets more mainstream, you might not be able to do that. But the good thing is you can message people for a while beforehand, and you can talk to others about how such and such a guy might have ripped you off,"" she adds.

Similarly, sellers can take measures to get the most of the Depop experience.

""As with Instagram, if you want more followers, you have to follow more people,"" says Jackson. ""Your listings have to be photographed well, and you don't want to be selling ragged clothes. If there is a small stain on an item, it's best to say so.""

Depop is aiming to quadruple the size of the business in the next three or four years. In total, $40m (€30m) has now been ploughed into the company by investors betting on that future, including Octopus Ventures, the company that backed Graze and Gym Box, and Creandum, that backed Spotify and iZettle.

And Jackson has an eye firmly on the site's future: ""If I could find the time, I'd love to make original pieces and sell them on there for €20 or €30,"" she notes. ""I think people would definitely pay that - they feel special about handmade items.""

"Fashion label Burberry will no longer burn millions of euros worth of unsold luxury goods or use real fur in its collections following a furore over it environmental record.

It admitted in July to destroying nearly £29 million (€32 million) of unwanted items in a single year to prevent them being sold at below market prices and devaluing the brand. This cast a light on waste in the fashion industry - both luxury and mass market - just a few months after the owner of Cartier and Montblanc admitted to having to buy back their own watches from dealers to prevent overstocking.

Burberry also said on Thursday it would follow the likes of Versace, Gucci and the trailblazer for ethical fashion, Stella McCartney, in removing real fur such as rabbit, fox, mink and Asiatic racoon from its ranges. The fashion industry is under pressure from consumers and environmental organisations to make itself more sustainable and many retailers have been called out in recent years for destroying unsold stock, including by slashing or punching holes in garments before throwing them out.

In the watch market, Richemont, owner of the luxury brands, said they would buy back unsold stock from dealers and would not move them to other markets. Instead it planned to recycle the precious metals and stones that were in the high-end pieces. Burberry, whose coats sell for more than £2,500 and handbags retail at around £1,500, said it would expand efforts to reuse, repair, donate or recycle its products and work to develop new sustainable materials.

Peta, the campaign group for the ethical treatment of animals, welcomed Burberry’s move to stop using fur, which the fashion house’s chief executive said was part of bigger shift and Peta said was a sign of the times. “Modern luxury means being socially and environmentally responsible,” Marco Gobbetti, who is in the process of repositioning the label to be more upmarket, said. - Reuters"

What greater inspiration is there for taking better care of the environment than becoming a parent? Having children opens your eyes to the reality that your actions have the capacity to reverberate over the generations to come. With the startling effects of pollution and landfills making an appearance in everyday life, parents are looking to go green by having “eco babies” - children raised in a manner that is mindful about making as small an impact on the environment as possible.

Here are simple ways parents can get on board:

Feeding

Breastfeeding, when possible, is the best option for mother, baby and the environment. After all, nourishing a baby this way does not waste scarce resources or generate pollution.

With breastmilk being the equivalent of liquid gold to moms, even a single drop wasted can be heartbreaking. When storing breastmilk, opt for glass containers as they are reusable and won’t be thrown away after each use like many plastic items, this results in less plastic waste going into the the landfills. Use containers that are microwave, dishwasher, and freezer safe as these are more durable and will last longer compared to silicone or plastic. Watertight and airtight lids are a must for keeping the contents fresh and safe for consumption.

Choose homemade over store bought. Making and storing your own baby food means you’re actively aiding in reducing the demand for processed baby food, along with the excess packaging. Homemade is also the perfect option for parents who want to know exactly what goes into their baby’s mouth.

The Baby Bullet System allows you to steam and blend fresh vegetables, soft fruits and even make grain cereals using its compact mini blender. Pour your purées into the cups and set the date — this way you'll never have to second guess the freshness of your homemade baby food.

Clothes

Fast fashion breeds a desire for cheap clothes. However, these items are often the result of low-wage manufacturing in poor countries. Clothes are no longer seen as valuable possessions, but rather disposable items that are thrown out at the end of the season. Fortunately, more and more clothing brands are supporting conservation of natural resources with the aim of making as small an impact on nature as possible.

Adorable onesie from The Earth Collection (theearthcollection.co.za) .

The Earth Collection sources materials from sustainable and ethical farms, keeping eco-friendly standards high when they manufacture their clothing. Their ranges include top-quality, classic and durable clothing for women, men and children. Their website, states: “We believe that we must take care of not only our country’s beauty but also that of the world.”

Since baby’s grow alarmingly fast, all those adorable onesies from your baby shower might not even get to be worn more than once (if at all). Save baby’s clothes for the next child in your family or swap with friends rather than buying new.

Toys

Much like clothes, toys can be handed down to future generations. However, the lifespan of cheaply made plastic toys isn’t longer than a few weeks, or minutes in some instances. The options for recycling plastic toys are limited as they are typically composed of various other materials too, often metals. The recyclable components can’t be separated and are therefore banned from recycling centers and bins.

Wooden toys or plush toys made from organic materials are both better options for the environment. Whether it’s because of the durability or the fact that wood doesn’t shatter posing as a potential threat to children, parents are looking to replace plastic toys with wooden one's made from sustainably harvested resources. According to Pinterest, saved pins for ""wooden toys"" increased by 173 percent, in 2017. Natural toys extend beyond brown building blocks - everything from puzzles, board games, painted trains and colourful figurines are available too.

Faithful To Nature is an online store based in South Africa that sells natural and organic products in broad range of categories including beauty, lifestyle, home and kids. Their website states that they have checked every single product to be sure that it really is as green and as safe.

Nappies

Taking about 450 years to decompose, disposable nappies add to the the untreated waste accumulating in landfills that contaminate groundwater. With only 10% of an estimated 59 million tonnes of the general waste produced in South Africa in 2011 getting recycled (National Waste Information Baseline Report published by the Department of Environmental Affairs), the case for reusable nappies being the kinder option for the environment is evident.

Gone are the days of pinning cloth nappies onto wriggling babies, and anxiously checking for leaks. Reusable nappies, with adorable designs and easy snap on buttons, have been created to suit the needs of a modern mom and the comforts of an eco baby.

Reusable nappies now come in a range of cool designs and patterns. By Bam+Boo.

Bam+Boo, based in Westville, have a line of reusable nappies available for order online. Believing in quality, convenience and style, their website, bamboobaby.co.za, shares that they have over seven years knowledge and experience in the South African modern cloth nappy market."
"Italian label Prada has been urged to follow in Burberry's footsteps and ban the use of fur in its designs.

British luxury fashion group Burberry confirmed this morning it had will no longer use real fur and angora in its clothes, following in the footsteps of Gucci and Versace.

Prada remains one of the few luxury houses to still use it, however, and now animal charity Humane Society International (HSI) has urged the brand to go fur-free.

HSI's executive director Claire Bass said: 'Brands like Prada that continue to sell animal fur are becoming increasingly isolated as top designers drop fur cruelty from their collections, knowing that the vast majority of consumers find it obscene and obsolete.

'Prada has a clear choice to make as to whether it wants to be an apologist for the vile fur trade or to move with the times and strike a pose for compassionate fashion.

A pair of £610 Prada sandals made from leather and 'lamb fur' according to an item description on luxury fashion site MyTheresa. The Italian fashion house has been urged to follow in the footsteps of Burberry, Versace and Gucci and ban the use of fur in its products

'We hope it makes the ethical choice to go fur-free, joining more than 900 brands that have joined the Fur Free Retailer programme globally.'

HSI's #FurFreeBritain campaign launches on the first day of New York fashion week and will extend through fashion weeks in London, Paris and Milan.

Prada, which has a number of stores and outlets in the UK across London, Manchester and Glasgow, is a major fur user and its current range includes items made of fox and mink fur.

Fur products include a fox fur jacket for £4,550, a mink fur jacket for £7,880, and a full length fox fur coat for £10,700.

Meanwhile, global designers including Hugo Boss, Armani, Tommy Hilfiger, Stella McCartney and Vivienne Westwood have long-standing fur bans.

In a statement on Thursday, Burberry's chief executive Marco Gobbetti said: 'Modern luxury means being socially and environmentally responsible. This belief is core to us at Burberry and key to our long-term success.'

Campaigners toasted the news, with animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) tweeting: 'VICTORY! Cartwheels are happening at PETA following the announcement that, after more than a decade of campaigns, @Burberry is banning fur and angora from its collections.'

However Mark Oaten, chief executive of the International Fur Federation, expressed disappointment, saying more was needed in order to ensure respect for the environment.

'Substituting natural fur with plastic petroleum-based materials, like fake fur, is [...] neither luxury nor responsible and sustainable,' he said in a statement.

'Any fashion business with a commitment to sustainability should be using natural products such as wool, cotton, leather, silk and natural fur,' he added.

Burberry confirmed earlier this year it was 'reviewing' the use of fur in its clothing and said that fur had been banned from recent collections (pictured: Cara Delevingne in a faux fur coat at Burberry's London Fashion Week show in February. The brand says its 'limited' use of fur is ethically sourced)

Humane Society International (HSI) has previously suggested Burberry's decision to ban fur could be down to Meghan (pictured in London in April) and her pro-animal credentials

On ending its part in the industry-wide practice of burning unsold goods, Burberry said: 'This commitment builds on the goals that we set last year as part of our five-year responsibility agenda and is supported by our new strategy, which is helping tackle the causes of waste.

'We already reuse, repair, donate or recycle unsaleable products and we will continue to expand these efforts.'

Burberry and its peers have been burning tens of millions of dollars worth of products annually to maintain the exclusivity and luxury mystique of their brands.

Burberry burned unsold clothes, accessories and perfume worth £28.6 million, according to its last annual report in July.

But Gobbetti, who last year took over from Christopher Bailey, is shaking up the brand with a strategy overhaul that aims to add even more luxury to the fashion house's products.

Anti-fur protesters scuffled with security guards outside the Burberry Fashion Show at the Dimco Buildings, part of the London Fashion Week events, in February this year

Protesters outside the Burberry show. 'Ditching fur would be the perfect fit for this brand-Britain fashion powerhouse so we strongly urge Burberry to embrace the compassionate trend,' said HSI's Claire Bass earlier this year, ahead of their decision to go fur-free

One of his first moves was to appoint Tisci, who Gobbetti worked with at Givenchy, as Burberry's chief creative officer.

Tisci also replaced Bailey, who stepped down from the dual role of CEO and chief creative officer.

At the time, Humane Society International (HSI) suggested the brand's decision could be down to Prince Harry's fiancée and her pro-animal stance.

Executive director Claire Bass said: 'Burberry is famous for being a royal fashion favourite so Meghan Markle, who is well-known for disliking fur, joining the family is sure to have made the quintessentially British brand look twice at its fur policy.

'Ditching fur would be the perfect fit for this brand-Britain fashion powerhouse so we strongly urge Burberry to embrace the compassionate trend.'

Meghan is believed to be staunchly anti-fur, is fond of vegan leather trousers, and reportedly convinced Harry to miss the annual Boxing Day shoot at Sandringham."

Meghan Markle used her royal tour wardrobe to send subtle messages about her passionate beliefs, it has been claimed.

The mum-to-be impressed fashion-lovers with her incredible looks - covering everything from comfy casual to red carpet glam from high street names, as well as designer brands.

And communication coach Robin Kermode believes the pregnant duchess, 37, used her strategically picked attire to signal her strongly held beliefs.

In total, it is estimated Meghan's Down Under tour wardrobe cost £59,904.

The items of clothing with significant meanings behind them include her pumps created out of recycled plastic water bottles, and jeans made by female victims of human trafficking and sexual exploitation.

With the world of the eyes upon her, some of Meghan's outfits have unsurprisingly sold out as fans rush to snap them up.

The jeans made by female victims of sexual exploitation

On several occasions during the overseas tour, Meghan opted to wear jeans from Outland - including the 'Harriet' pair, pictured above.

The Australian brand was founded by James Bartle after he saw first-hand how human traffickers prey on vulnerable young girls in order to service the sex industry.

Determined to making a change, James learnt that once a girl has been rescued and supported through her recovery, a sustainable career path is vital for securing her future.

He created the Denim Project, to enable those girls who demonstrated an interest in sewing to put their new skills to use.

Outland's team of seamstresses offer positions to those at risk of falling into poverty, and has broadened its mission to set a standard for the treatment and remuneration of young female workers in the garment manufacturing industry.



It also sources ethically and environmentally sound raw materials, from organic cotton pocket linings to recycled packaging.

After the Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced their engagement, they asked people who wanted to mark the occasion to donate to charities they had picked instead of giving them wedding gifts.

One of these charities included the Myna Mahila Foundation, which empowers women in Mumbai’s urban slums, by providing them with a trusted network, where they are supported professionally and personally to help them grow as individuals and businesswomen.

Thus Meghan's Outland jeans reflect her desire to help vulnerable women which she has spoken so openly about.

The vegan leather trainers

Meghan went comfy and casual as she donned $125 (£98) white Veja V10 trainers while on a boat trip in Sydney during the Invictus Games.

The trainers got everyone talking as they are environmentally friendly, and made from raw materials sourced from organic farming and ecological agriculture.

Some of the shoes also use recycled plastic bottles and many have soles made from wild Amazonian rubber.

The French fashion brand's founders, Sébastien Kopp and François-Ghislain Morillion visited clothing and food factories in South America, Asia and Australia while running a nonprofit group — and were appalled by what they saw.

So in 2005, they founded Veja in France with the vision of making trainers using the most ecological materials and ethical suppliers they could find.

Fashion fans were delighted when they saw Meghan wearing a pair and the duchess is keen on environmental and conservation causes.

The recycled plastic bottle pumps

Meghan wore Rothy's flats twice on tour, including during a beach clean-up in Melbourne.

The pumps are made from recycled plastic water bottles that would otherwise have been destined for landfill - and have been dubbed the most 'politically correct shoes on the planet' by Vogue.

The insoles on all of Rothy’s shoes contain recycled foam; the rubber soles are made without environmentally stressful black carbon.

The yarn comes from plastic and even the packaging’s made from post-consumer recycled materials.

Meghan supports charity Surfers Against Sewage, which is a national marine conservation and campaigning charity.

It inspires, unites and empowers communities to take action to protect oceans, beaches, waves and wildlife.

Hugo Tagholm, chief executive of the charity said: ""Our work as a national marine conservation charity empowers tens of thousands of volunteers annually to protect beaches for everyone.

""We are currently focused on tackling plastic pollution and this support will help us move towards our vision of Plastic Free Coastlines.”

So it is very fitting Meghan wore the pumps during the beach visit - signalling her passion to protecting the sea from plastic.

The sustainable brand

The Duchess of Sussex wore a stunning custom-made silk wool cocktail dress in dark navy by Gabriela Hearst at Government House in Wellington.

The sustainable luxury brand is based on a 'less is more' approach.

Gabriela is a notable feminist designer and political activist.

She wanted to create a brand that reflects a slower pace and process: where things are made with care and detail, where tradition is more important than trend, where there is a purpose to every piece, according to her website.

She takes into consideration where materials come from and who is making them.

Meghan wore the dress to deliver a speech to honor the 125th anniversary of female suffrage.

The empowering dress

Meghan looked sensational when she wore a beautiful white Theia dress for dinner with the King and Queen of Tonga.

The label is inspired by the Greek Goddess Theia, who had an incredible power to turn everything that she gazed on to light.

The Theia dresses are designed to make women feel confident – similar to Meghan’s beliefs.

The website explains about their collection: ""Inspired by the Greek Goddess Theia, this evening wear, bridal and day dress collection was created to bring out every woman's inner goddess.

""One of the original Titans, Theia, who ruled during the Greek Golden Age, possessed the incredible power of light which radiated from her sparkling eyes.

""All that she gazed upon glittered, becoming luminous and radiant.

""She imbued gold and silver with their shine. She gave diamonds their fire and rubies and emeralds their sparkle.

""Her three children; Helios the sun, Celene the moon, and Eos the dawn, all continue to bring light in to the world everyday.

""The woman who wears Theia will be filled with confidence knowing her dress fits wonderfully and looks beautiful on her, thus naturally allowing her inner goddess to shine."""

New Zealand’s green reputation is one of this country’s strongest selling points, but how to manage the relationship between farming and the environment is complex and controversial.

How do we support New Zealand farmers transition to a more environmentally friendly and economically sustainable future?

The clamour to act urgently on climate change is adding pressure on farmers to manage environmental sustainability, but farmers often have to make trade-offs between what they want to develop and what’s affordable.

New Zealand’s banks are increasingly focused on helping agribusiness meet the challenges of developing sustainable farming practices.

With its Environment Loan, ANZ supports customers to prepare their farm environment plan.

The loan pay for a range of infrastructure investments designed to develop or improve environment management, including water and energy conservation projects, fencing and planting, and effluent management.

This support for the farming community is one reason why Canstar is delighted to announce that ANZ has won our Agribusiness Bank of the Year award for the eighth year in a row.

Canstar General Manager Jose George says: “Farming sustainably while protecting New Zealand’s unique environment inevitably involves trade-offs between profitability and care for the land.

“Through its Environment Loan, ANZ has demonstrated its commitment both to New Zealand Agribusiness and environmental sustainability. Winning the award for the eighth year in a row is a fantastic achievement and recognises ANZ’s institutional support for our farming community.”

ANZ outperformed the market across all institutional measures these included service and support, information and education and disaster relief or assistance.

ANZ has a large network of Agribusiness managers and support their communities through programs like the Primary Growth Partnership – Red Meat Profit Partnership. Further strengths include the custom benchmarking that is now offered across the sheep and beef sectors as well as specific Agri education programs and succession planning for the Agricultural industry. This breadth of offering through the end to end process is where ANZ excels in servicing the Agribusiness industry.

Accepting the award, ANZ Commercial and Agri Managing Director Mark Hiddleston says: “It is a great achievement to have won the Canstar award for eight years running and shows ANZ is always looking for ways to improve our support for agri customers.”

“As sustainability becomes imperative for all businesses, we continue to see plenty of examples where customers are growing and preserving the value of their land and businesses through investment in environmental initiatives,” Mr Hiddleston says.

“While this award is a great achievement for ANZ and something we are very proud of, I am equally pleased to see recognition for our farmers and their commitment to building a more sustainable future for New Zealand’s agri sector.”

"Clothing rental options are evolving from one-off, special occasion outfits to subscriptions for everyday apparel, and a Canadian company is expanding its closet to get in on the trend.

Rent Frock Repeat is relaunching this fall as a monthly clothing subscription service, after eight years in the designer dress rental business.

""[The customers are] the ones that set this in motion, because the demand was there,"" said Kristy Wieber, president of Rent Frock Repeat.

Wieber and Lisa Owen were inspired to create the company after they were invited to a wedding and didn't want to spend hundreds of dollars on a dress they would only wear once.

They found a U.S.-based dress rental company online called Rent the Runway and thought their problem was solved. But the site didn't ship to Canada.

""It was a light-bulb moment for both of us,"" said Owen, who's now the CEO of Rent Frock Repeat. ""We thought it was brilliant.""

In 2011, Rent Frock Repeat began renting dresses for four to eight days at a time, for anywhere from $40 to $595 Cdn, depending on the retail cost of the dress.

Now, the company is expanding to a monthly rental subscription for everyday wear — from blazers to skirts, pants to blouses. Members will receive four to six pieces every month, for between $99 and $199. Subscribers will be able to pause their plan at any time, and the more expensive options will have other perks — such as swapping out items mid-month.

Clothing chains see potential

Rent the Runway has already convinced millions of Americans to rent clothes. It first launched as a one-off specialty dress rental service in 2009, and has since expanded to offer subscription plans, including an ""unlimited"" rental option for $159 US per month.

In March, Rent the Runway announced it had raised $125 million in a round of funding from investors, which would value the company at $1 billion US.

Traditional clothing chains see potential in rentals as well. Urban Outfitters created an offshoot called Nuuly to launch a rental service for women's apparel this summer. According to Nuuly, its warehouse and fulfilment centre will include ""state-of-the-art laundry equipment operated by veteran laundry technicians.""

The logistics of the various rental services work in a similar way. A customer picks out an item (or items) online, it's shipped to them, the customer wears it, then mails it back. The companies wash or dry clean each item before sending it out to the next customer.

Fashion industry analyst Tamara Szames said clothing rental is still a small trend, but definitely one she's watching. (CBC News/Laura MacNaughton)

Clothing rentals may seem better for the planet — shoppers avoid over-buying fast fashion items, and rented clothes are used and reused until they're no longer in acceptable shape. But the practice could have its own environmental issues, according to Tamara Szames, a fashion industry analyst for NPD Group.

""Think of the washing and the returns and the shipping — all of that back end,"" said Szames. ""I'm challenged to know how environmentally sustainable that will be.""

Szames can see the appeal for retailers, though, at a time when the apparel industry is struggling with a lack of growth, because people are buying less.

""It all stems from the market being flat, so all these retailers are looking at ways to disrupt their retail business model,"" said Szames.

Ready-made rental technology

Many of the traditional retailers that have launched rental services in the U.S. in the past year — including Ann Taylor, Vince Unfold, American Eagle and Express — are using a technology created by a company called CaaStle.

CaaStle's founder and CEO, Christine Hunsicker, said that for traditional retailers, subscription services attract new customers and more spending, rather than cannibalizing sales.

""We look at what we're doing as really partnering with the retailers and helping them grow their businesses and strengthen their brands, as opposed to displacing them,"" said Hunsicker.

According to Hunsicker, half of the people who sign up for a subscription are new to the brand, and the other 50 per cent spend more than they previously would have.

So far, the retailers CaaStle is partnered with don't ship to Canada.

""There's definitely a ton of interest for an unlimited rental subscription service in the Canadian market. I think we are probably 12 to 18 months away from expanding internationally,"" said Hunsicker.

At its previous peak, Rent Frock Repeat had 1,700 dresses. When the company relaunches this fall, it will have 30,000 different pieces available for rent. (CBC)

It's not a sure bet that people will stay interested in the rental trend, though. According to data from NPD Group, most U.S. consumers who signed up for a fashion subscription service unsubscribed within a year, with 56 per cent unsubscribing within three months.

""You need to think of how you continuously acquire new consumers,"" said Szames, or find a way to get them to stay loyal.

30,000-piece wardrobe

Rent Frock Repeat is doing a limited launch of its subscription service with 5,000 people this fall to test the technology and logistics, and get feedback on the clothing.

At its peak, Rent Frock Repeat had 1,700 dresses. When the company relaunches, it will have 30,000 different pieces — everything from blouses to skirts and blazers.

""You have to have a big closet to dress that many women,"" said Owen.

The founders aren't worried about stocking up on all that expensive inventory — they're confident it's what Rent Frock Repeat's customers want, because the company has asked for extensive feedback along the way.

""I'm so excited, because we finally recognize it's not a risk anymore,"" said Owen."
"Garment worker and mum Tania often cries alone when she isn't busy making clothes for Australian fashion brands.

The 21-year-old, who works as a sewing operator in central Bangladesh, has been forced to send her daughter 250km away and visit her only twice a year in a bid to ensure the family's survival on her meagre wage.

She is one of hundreds of garment workers in Bangladesh and Vietnam whose daily suffering has been revealed in the first in-depth exploration of their lives in a new report.

Released on Monday by Oxfam, the report titled Made in Poverty has also uncovered the way Australian fashion brands have cared more for the clothes than the people making them, including demanding air-conditioning for their products while workers labour in horrid conditions.

""The findings are shocking and the case studies harrowing,"" says Oxfam chief executive Dr Helen Szoke.

Researchers interviewed more than 130 factory owners, managers and others in powerful positions, as well as 472 women working in factories that supply clothing to Australian brands such as Kmart, Target, Big W, Cotton On and more.

""Systemic exploitation"" of workers has been enabled by Australian companies, whose buying practices compel factory operators to reduce cost of production, the report reveals.

These buying practices include fierce price negotiation, short-term contracts with factories, and reducing delivery times at one end while imposing fines for not meeting those squeezed deadlines.

In a number of cases in Vietnam, interviewees reported buyers insisted on the installation of automatic fire extinguishers for rooms where finished clothing was stored, but did not require the same for the sewing floors where hot machines could also ignite.

The report reveals 100 per cent of workers interviewed in Bangladesh were not paid a living wage, and nine out of 10 could not afford enough food for themselves and their families until their next monthly pay.

The majority survive on pulses, rice and potatoes, sometimes eating a mix of old, fermented rice with chilli to feel fuller throughout the day.

In Vietnam, wages are comparatively higher, yet seven out of 10 said their pay was not enough to meet their needs.

Altogether, 99 per cent of workers in Vietnam were not paid a living wage that would allow them to buy nutritious food, live in decent housing, send their children to school and get health care when they are sick.

Oxfam' has labelled the findings an indictment on the fashion industry, which turned over $23 billion in Australia last year.

""Brands are responsible for making credible commitments to ensure the payment of living wages to the workers making their clothes,"" Dr Szoke said.

A previous Oxfam report, released in 2017, found paying living wages would add just one per cent on average to the retail price of a piece of clothing.

Ahead of the report's release, Cotton On, Kmart, Target and City Chic announced credible commitments towards reaching a living wage for workers in their supply chains, Oxfam said in a statement on Monday.

Brands that have failed to do so include Myer, Best and Less, Bonds, Country Road, Forever New and Peter Alexander."
"Global fashion brands are failing to fulfil promises to provide workers with living wages, a new report has revealed.

On Thursday, academics from the Sheffield Political Economy Research Institute (SPERI) at the University of Sheffield published their findings from an investigation delving into corporate commitments to living wages in the garment industry.

The team assessed 20 global brands, including Nike, Primark, Adidas, H&M, Under Armour and Gucci.

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.

The researchers evaluated the commitments each of the companies made to provide workers in their supply chains with living wages, and the actions the brands took to fulfil their promises.

They gathered data collated by a survey carried out by the Clean Clothes Campaign, in addition to statistics they accumulated themselves.

According to the report, 17 of the 20 clothing companies assessed are members of initiatives which declare themselves committed to providing workers in the supply chain with living wages.

Three of the companies investigated – H&M, C&A and G-Star RAW – were found to have a supplier code of conduct which requires workers to be paid wages which match the Clean Clothes Campaign's definition of a living wage.

However, the report also found that ""most corporations are outsourcing their living wage commitments to MSIs [multi-stakeholder initiatives] and external initiatives"".

By outsourcing their living wage commitments to external initiatives, this means that some companies have conflicting ""definitions and approaches to living wages, causing their commitments to lack clarity"".

Professor Genevieve LeBaron, professor of politics at the University of Sheffield, director of SPERI and project leader of the report, explained that living wage commitments don't always necessarily result in positive action.

""There is little evidence that corporate commitments to living wages are translating into meaningful change on the ground,"" Professor LeBaron said.

""As such, consumers are purchasing products they may believe are made by workers earning a living wage, when in reality, low wages continue to be the status quo across the global garment industry.""

Professor LeBaron added that fashion corporations need to ""adopt existing benchmarks and living wage calculation methodologies"" so as to work towards providing living wages throughout their supply chains.

Tom Hunt, deputy director of SPERI, stated that if companies within the garment industry do not take action, ""workers will continue to receive low wages that do not meet the basic needs of food, housing, medical care, clothing and transportation for themselves and their families"".

In 2013, the Rana Plaza factory – an eight-storey garment factory in Bangladesh – collapsed, resulting in the deaths of more than 1,000 workers.

The collapse of the building led to greater focus on the conditions of workers in the garment factory.

The building's owner, Sohel Rana, was accused of ordering employees to carry on working despite reports of cracking plaster the day before the industrial disaster, and an engineer deeming the building ""unsafe"".

As part of their investigation, the report's researchers outlined several key obstacles standing in the way of garment companies providing workers in their supply chains with living wages.

These include ""inconsistency and confusion"" among firms over what constitutes a living wage; lack of transparency among companies with regards to the wages they pay their workers; and companies' lack of a ""roadmap"" signalling how they will go about providing living wages in future.

Remi Edwards, research assistant on the report, emphasised the importance of global fashion brands meeting their living wage commitments.

""This matters for the 60 million garment workers around the world who make clothes for the industry and for the consumers who buy them,"" Edwards said."
"We all have that T-shirt that’s several years old, but has retained its unduplicated softness through many wash cycles, food stains and brushes with danger.

The idea behind Marine Layer, a San Francisco-based clothing retailer, is that shirts can feel that way from their first wear. Since launching in 2009, it’s opened nearly 40 stores across the country, including one in Atlanta at Ponce City Market.

But Marine Layer will soon have a second location in metro Atlanta. It’s set to open a store at Avalon, the mixed-use development in Alpharetta, on Nov. 3, according to a press release from North American Properties, which operates Avalon.

“Avalon’s merchandise mix is a rotating collection of best-in-class concepts – an experiential playground for forward-thinking retailers like Marine Layer to showcase their latest and greatest concepts,” David Weinert, partner and senior vice president of leasing at NAP, said in a statement. “While some in our industry see e-commerce as a threat to brick and mortar retail, we see it as an incredible opportunity for entrepreneurial brands like Marine Layer to come to life in communities like Avalon.”

Marine Layer will be Avalon’s 38th store and it will open at a location near Café Intermezzo.

The company makes its signature fabric out of a blend of Supima Cotton and MicroModal, which is made from recycled beechwood, making the tees sustainable, eco-friendly and “absurdly soft.”

Marine Layer CEO Mike Natenshon launched the company after his girlfriend threw away his favorite T-shirt. He set out to recreate the softness and perfect broken-in feeling.

“We can’t wait to grow our community with our newest store at Avalon,” Natenshon said.

Marine Layer has not set yet operating hours for its new location at Avalon.

"Saba's general manager of product, Elisha Hopkinson, said the business case for the range was strong after the brand experienced positive growth over recent seasons. ""Dresses are a big category [for us] and in the bridesmaid market, it was difficult to find something good quality in a pure silk,"" she said. ""It wasn't a risk because whether weddings are in March, April or May, we will have select stores that will carry the range and we can always have it online."" Bec & Bridge has launched a bridesmaid collection. Ms Hopkinson said the difference between general evening wear and bridesmaids' attire is ""bridal party women are different shapes so the most important thing is to make her feel beautiful but still designer"".

Priced at $429, Ms Hopkinson said she hopes the range, which is launching with three silhouettes, will grow and that women will wear the dresses again. Saba's Elisha Hopkinson: 'Dresses are a big category [for us] and in the the bridesmaid market, it was difficult to find something good quality.' ""The wastage [in fashion] is becoming an issue for all of us. It's the fine balance between quality, considered design lines and being appropriate to the trend."" Rather than being super trend-driven, Saba's bridesmaids' dresses are designed to be ""style that lasts"", she said.

""The length is mid-calf, that's very on trend, but it's very classic, sophisticated and elegant."" With the average wedding in Australia costing about $36,000, and more than $4000 of that spent on clothing, brands entering the wedding space can bolster their takings in otherwise turbulent times. According to industry analysts IBIS World, specialty bridal stores had a turnover of more than $300 million last financial year. Cat Pope and Bonnie Sinclair spotted a gap in the market for high-quality bridesmaids' dresses when they opened The Bridesmaids Studio in Prahran, in Melbourne's inner-east. Pope, who is now based in New York, said the fact popular fashion brands are launching bridesmaids' ranges helps ""legitimise"" the category.

The Bridesmaids Studio carries hard-to-find US brands that specialise in weddings by having dresses in up to 25 different colours and a variety of cuts so bridesmaids of all sizes can co-ordinate. Bonnie Sinclair of The Bridesmaids Studio saw a gap in the market. Credit:Darrian Traynor As opposed to regular evening wear, specialty bridesmaid designers have considered ""the practicality of wearing the dresses in daytime, for a long time, or [making it] bra-friendly or a shoe that makes sense"", Pope said. She said more brands have started making maternity bridesmaid dresses, such is the demand from customers. As for the question of ""who pays?"", Pope said it varies but often when the bride chooses more expensive bridesmaids' dresses, she picks up the tab.

""We have groups of brands more premium – if that's what the bride wants then she normally says it's on her. I think it depends how controlling the bride wants to be."""
"The music stars joined top models such as Stella Tennant and Laura Bailey at the Fashion Fighting Poverty event at Ambika P3 in London.

All the models showcased Oxfam clothes – which were picked by stylist Bay Garnett from the organisation’s online and high street shops – in a bid to highlight sustainable fashion.

Emeli Sande (Aaron Chown/PA)

Garnett said: “I’m styling this show for a very simple reason. I love clothes, and the opportunity to work with them in a way that can actually help people is so exciting.

“I get a lot of pleasure from knowing that.

“I love second-hand clothes, and I love Oxfam’s commitment to fighting poverty. This collaboration is a no-brainer for me.”

Stella Tennant (Aaron Chown/PA)

Fee Gilfeather, Oxfam’s sustainable fashion expert, said: “Here at Oxfam we never lose sight of the reason we sell fashion, which is to raise money to help the world’s poorest people.

“The clothes in Oxfam shops really do transform lives. A £10 dress can provide clean water for 10 people in an emergency.

“The outfits created by Bay illustrate beyond a shadow of doubt that our affordable, stylish clothes look incredible.

“Even better are the beautiful things they do, which is save lives and slow down fast fashion by giving clothes a second chance to be sold and prevent them blighting the environment in landfill. So, it’s clearly perfect shopping sense to buy our fashion!”

Tennant said the organisation was “a fabulous wardrobe of opportunity”. “I don’t like waste!” she added.

Laura Bailey (Aaron Chown/PA)

Oxfam works across many areas of fashion, collaborating with big brands to recycle and reuse stock, joining forces with fashion houses to improve conditions in their supply chains and fighting to improve garment workers’ rights.

All profits from the organisation’s fashion sales fund Oxfam’s work fighting poverty and suffering around the world.

"Welcome to Refresh – a series of comment pieces by young people, for young people, to provide a free-market response to Britain's biggest issues ​

A couple of years ago, I made the decision to switch to vegetarianism, and I’ve done a pretty good job of sticking with it ever since. I’m fortunate to live in a part of the world where veggie alternatives are available and easily accessible, making it far easier to cut meat out of my diet.

While it’s not been too much of a challenge to stop eating meat, clothing myself is far trickier. It’s easy to swap minced beef for quorn, chicken breast for halloumi, or meatballs for mushrooms. It’s another thing to swap leather for, well, faux-leather.

It’s for this reason that I can’t quite get myself on board with calls to ban the use of animal products in fashions. As much as I look forward to the day when such options are widely-available, affordable, and good-quality, I’m just not sure we’re there yet.

One reason for this is, quite simply, the price. While veganism and vegetarianism are certainly in-vogue at the moment, the ‘cruelty-free’ fashion trend is still in rather early days. Many luxury brands, including a new endeavour from Stella McCartney, have begun selling such garments at fittingly luxurious prices."
"Stella McCartney presented a new collection at Paris Fashion Week made from “upcycled” materials.

The British designer’s line, unveiled Monday during a show at the Opera Garnier in Paris, featured dresses made from vintage T-shirts stripped and knotted together.

The process of upcycling sees discarded products reused to create a new product of higher quality.

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.

Of her decision to embrace used materials, the designer told the Guardian: “There were second hand T-shirts that were going to get thrown away or burned or landfilled, which we cut into strips and made knitwear out of.”

And the shoes featured on the runway and created in partnership with Hunter Boots followed the theme, as they may be the “most sustainable ever made”, according to the designer’s Instagram.

But apart from showcasing bright colours and statement shoulders through upcycled materials, the designer’s latest collection offered much more in terms of raising awareness and saving the environment – as it was part of McCartney’s new campaign to protect the Leuser Ecosystem, an endangered forest in Sumatra, Indonesia, that is home to orangutans, elephants, tigers and rhinos.

Invites for the show included vacuum-packed oak tree leaves, according to the Hollywood Reporter, and invited attendees to join the “There She Grows” campaign by dedicating a tree to the forest.

According to the news outlet, Gwyneth Paltrow, Pink, Drew Barrymore, Jimmy Fallon and Rooney Mara have already pledged their support for the cause – with the designer’s show also drawing Oprah Winfrey as a front-row attendee.

According to McCartney’s Instagram, the show was “dedicated to the ones we love in the past, present and future”.

McCartney’s 2019 Fall/Winter collection is the designer’s latest commitment to sustainable fashion.

As a proponent and pioneer of eco-friendly clothes and a fur-free industry, McCartney has previously committed to only using “vegetarian leather” in her designs.

The designer also explains the brand’s dedication to sustainability on its website, where it states: “We use a breakthrough decision-making tool called the Environmental Profit and Loss to measure and understand our impact on the environment that goes far beyond traditional environmental reporting.”

The trend of sustainability and a focus on the environment has been a common theme this year, with the BBC unveiling a new sustainable fashion line during London Fashion Week and climate change protestors using the platform to raise awareness."

INTERNATIONAL - During the holiday shopping frenzy that grips America every year, the handbag wars descend upon midtown Manhattan with unbridled fury.



Specifically, the largest department store in the country: the Macy’s flagship. The behemoth opens its doors on Thanksgiving afternoon to thousands of shoppers, and the first thing they see are the bags. Employees on the front lines brace for impact as they shovel leather satchels, shoulder bags and clutches to the ravenous hordes.





Those bags belong to Coach and Michael Kors, two rivals who’ve been duking it out for years. They have dueling shops right inside the Macy’s main entrance. On Thursday and Black Friday, the raucous crowd streams in to their displays, unfazed by the predictable glare of news cameras. “Excuse me, we’ve got to make money!” a Coach associate says as he muscles his way through to replenish a rack of 50-percent-off crossbody bags. It was picked clean in minutes.





This year, expected to be a $1 trillion season, there’s more than usual at stake for these two companies. Handbags represent a $7 billion segment of the U.S. fashion accessories industry, but they’ve been on the decline, down 8 percent in 2017 over the year prior, according to data from research firm NPD Group. As Kors and Coach seek to make up the difference, the rivalry has spilled into other fashion categories. Each is trying to build a U.S. rival to European luxury conglomerates LVMH and Kering SA, which own dozens of high-end brands that make everything from sandals to yachts.





Coach acquired shoe label Stuart Weitzman for $574 million and former handbag rival Kate Spade for $2.4 billion. Kors responded with a $1.2 billion purchase of high-end footwear brand Jimmy Choo, then shook up the fashion industry with its $2.2 billion acquisition of Italian icon Gianni Versace SpA. Meanwhile, their namesake brands have broadened their offerings, with more ready-to-wear clothing and accessories, including watches and sunglasses.





Coach and Kors are even looking to tweak their branding to match the expansion. Last year, after adding Kate Spade, Coach renamed its corporate entity Tapestry Inc. Following the Versace announcement, Michael Kors said it would change its company name to Capri Holdings Ltd.





Upstairs at Macy’s, on its equally hysterical shoe floor, there are few handbags in sight. Here, Kors is surrounded by Coach, too. Kors has a gleaming white store full of chunky heels and peep-toe booties, but all three Coach brands are close by. The Kate Spade has a little space to hawk its slides and pumps. Stuart Weitzman is on the other side, with customers lining up to buy knee-high boots. And Coach’s namesake shoe shop looms over them all, its heels presented on shelves high in the air.





Both companies are struggling to return to their former glory, after years of intense competition led to heavy discounting and eroded their cachet. So far, each has recovered well, returning U.S. sales to positive growth. Both have undertaken a strategy to become a luxury house of brands, having refocused on selling more non-sale items, bringing average prices higher and weaning shoppers off of perpetual discounts.





Not today, however. On Black Friday at Macy’s, it’s about the mad grab for any and all shoppers, and there’s no shortage of markdowns. The Kors store is full of bright red signage declaring 50-percent-off “doorbuster” deals. Coach’s black signs promise either 30 or 50 percent-off merchandise. Within minutes, store workers are picking bags up off the floors and re-aligning those shoved aside by aggressive browsers. It’s full-on shopping debauchery, and it’s still November.

"A YOUNG and stylish woman friend of mine, and incidentally a fan of my weekly Ramblings, was telling me about what she is doing personally to reduce the effect of climate change. She has adopted a fully vegan diet and doesn’t buy any new clothes at all except for knickers.

She buys all her clothes from charity shops like Oxfam: “Oxfam are particularly good and also have a website where you can buy quite specialist items.”

She explained why charity shop purchases are so much part of her political thinking. “The fashion industry is a disaster. Fast fashion focuses on speed and low costs in order to deliver frequent new collections inspired by catwalk looks or celebrity styles.

“This is particularly bad for the environment, as pressure to reduce cost and the time it takes to get a product from design to shop floor means that environmental corners are likely to be cut.

“Just as important, so much of the fashion industry is based on sweatshop factories all over the third world. It is a huge greedy industry from sweatshop to high street fashion chains and websites.

“If the fashion business is bad, much worse, especially when it comes to climate change, are the industries making the raw materials that the rag trade uses to make next week’s high-street fashion offering.”

About here Frosty needs to declare an interest. My wardrobe, such that it is, is almost entirely made from cotton. My shirts, knitted shirts, cords and even underwear are almost all made of 100 per cent cotton.

You can see, I like cotton but as you are about to read I’m beginning to realise I’m part of a major problem when I usually try to be part of the solution.

Of course I have always known that cotton has some dark secrets in its long history. British slavers raided the coast of Africa to kidnap slaves to work the cotton fields of the southern states of the US.

The “dark satanic mills” of Lancashire and indeed of New England saw some of the worst and most dangerous working conditions, all to produce what became known as King Cotton.

These cotton mills saw many battles as workers began to organise and take on the capitalist mill owners, some of the most cruel, greedy and grasping in the world.

Friedrich Engels wrote much about them and so did his best mate Karl Marx. Engels’s father actually owned a textile factory in Salford making Friedrich quite the expert.

In the cotton mill towns of New England across the Atlantic the massive red brick mills look almost exactly the same as those in Lancashire. One, in Lawrence, Massachusetts, was the site of the famous 1912 Bread and Roses strike about which I have written in these pages.

Textile dyeing is the second largest polluter of clean water globally — only agriculture

is worse

Today cotton is causing massive environmental damage which is causing environmental disaster after environmental disaster all over the globe.

One of the worst examples is the former Aral Sea — between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan — once one of the largest bodies of fresh water in the world, now reduced almost entirely to dust as a side effect of the cotton industry.

Once the fourth-largest lake in the world, it has been shrinking since the 1960s. The rivers that fed it were diverted by cotton irrigation projects for the vast Soviet cotton industry.

By 1997, the sea was just a tenth of its original size and satellite images in August 2014 revealed that the eastern basin of the Aral Sea had completely dried up – it has become the Aralkum Desert.

A Kazakh dam, started in 2005 to save and replenish the North Aral Sea, is having some effect. By 2008, the water level in the lake had risen by 39 feet.

The Aral Sea is just one of the many such locations all across the globe. New dust bowls are appearing across what were once rich cotton prairies in the southern states of the US too.

Across the world, toxic chemicals used for growing cotton have led to health problems. They range from the death of a US cotton farmer from a brain tumour to serious birth defects in Indian cotton farmers’ children.

Today most cotton grown worldwide is genetically modified to be resistant to the boll weevil but at last there is growing interest in organic cotton. Sadly so far this only represents less than 1 per cent of the world’s cotton — we clearly have a long way to go.

Not all fashion garments are made from cotton. More and more are made of polyester, which today is the most popular fabric used for fashion.

The fashion industry constantly seeks to invent new vibrant colours, prints and finishes. These can only be achieved with by higher levels of toxic chemicals, hence textile dyeing is the second largest polluter of clean water globally — only agriculture is worse.

Greenpeace has been pressing fashion brands to take action to remove toxic chemicals from their supply chains, after it tested a number of brands’ products and confirmed the presence of hazardous chemicals.

Many of these are banned or strictly regulated in various countries because they are toxic and are bio-accumulative — a term meaning the substance builds up in an organism faster than the organism can excrete or metabolise it. They are also disruptive to hormones and carcinogenic.

Even at home when polyester garments are washed in domestic washing machines, they shed microfibres that add to the increasing levels of plastic in our oceans.

These microfibres can easily pass through sewage and wastewater treatment plants into our waterways. They do not biodegrade and because of this they represent a serious threat to aquatic life.

These microfibres make their way up the food chain from plankton to bigger fish and shellfish and eventually to our fish and chip suppers.

Clearly our clothing industry has a big problem and one that is getting worse.

So is there anything you can do?

A new charity Wrap has launched The Love Your Clothes initiative to give advice on buying more responsibly, caring for and repairing clothing items, up-cycling and responsible disposal.

Ultimately, the best thing we can do is to keep our clothing in use for longer, buy less new stuff and even more important, keep up the wider pressure to reverse the many disasters and unsustainable actions that are causing climate change."
"Have you filled your fridge with cauliflower ‘steaks’ for Veganuary? Did you rush to Greggs to sample one of its sell-out vegan sausage rolls?

If you haven’t jumped on the plant-based wagon, grab yourself an oat milk latte and get on board. With the number of Brits going vegan skyrocketing to an estimated 3.5 million (Waitrose has increased its vegan food offering by 223 per cent to keep up with demand), veganism is the hottest trend for 2019.

And the next big thing: making sure your wardrobe is as vegan as your kitchen. That means no fur, no leather, no suede. You’ll need to skip shearling, angora and mohair, too.

Eschewing real feathers and crocodile skin might be fairly simple if you’re not Cruella de Vil, but vegan fashion also means no silk (silkworms are often steamed inside their cocoons to obtain the precious threads), no cashmere (it’s made from the soft undercoat of mountain goats) — and no wool (PETA says the shearing process can hurt sheep).

Hanna Woodside shared advice for embracing the trend for vegan fashion, designers including Burberry (pictured) have committed to going fur-free

With veganism no longer a niche trend for eco-warriors and evangelical A-listers, the global fashion industry has had to respond to the increased scrutiny of its ethical practices, which are harder to ignore in the age of Insta-activism. Appealing to a new ‘woke’ generation of customers is a commercial imperative.

Established designers such as Coach, Burberry, Diane von Furstenberg and Michael Kors have committed to going fur-free.

More than 300 brands including Gap, Mango and Zara agreed to stop selling mohair after PETA released evidence of goat mistreatment in the supply chain.

London Fashion Week has been entirely fur-free since last September, while Helsinki Fashion Week has gone further and banned leather on its catwalk as of this year. The very first Vegan Fashion Week will take place next month in Los Angeles.

There are even dedicated dating apps if you want to keep your love life vegan.

But the proof that vegan fashion is now truly mainstream? This month Marks & Spencer unveiled its vegan shoe range, with 350 styles boasting the vegan logo you’ll already find in its food and beauty aisles.

‘We’ve seen a 200 per cent rise in online searches for vegan-related products,’ says Phil Townsend, sustainable raw materials specialist for M&S.

‘We’ve offered synthetic shoes for a number of years, but over the past nine months we’ve made sure every component of our vegan footwear is made without animal derivatives, from the trims to the adhesives [shoe glues often use animal products].’

The phrase ‘vegan shoes’ might conjure up nightmarish images of felt clogs and clunky cork sandals, but in the M&S spring range you’ll find lipstick-red kitten-heeled court shoes (£19.50, marksand spencer.com, top), trainers with a rainbow stripe (£25) and a pair of statement block-heeled courts with a striped ankle strap (£35).

‘Our synthetic materials are premium quality, which means they have the look and feel of leather,’ says Phil. Up close you’d be hard-pushed to know the court shoes weren’t genuine leather. They have none of the squeakiness you associate with man-made materials.

The global worth of faux leather is predicted to reach £66 billion by 2025 (file image)

Other retailers have cottoned on to the rising demand, too. Schuh has a vegan section on its website, with zebra-print loafers (£8.99, schuh.co.uk) and Chelsea boots (£17.99).

Esprit, Dr Martens and Toms all have decent vegan-friendly shoes, approved by PETA, so you won’t get caught out with animal-based dyes and glues.

ASOS — which recently won a PETA award for banning the sale of mohair, cashmere, feathers and silk — does a great pair of women’s brogues (£25, asos.com) made from next-generation faux leather, a water-based polyurethane with a smaller environmental impact than other plastic-based synthetics. (Just because a material is vegan doesn’t mean it’s necessarily environmentally-friendly).

Fashion snobs may associate real leather with luxury, but with the global faux leather market predicted to be worth $85 billion (£66 billion) by 2025, a wave of vegan designers are intent on proving their wares can be just as beautiful and well-crafted.

John Lewis stocks boutique Canadian label Matt & Nat — its chic handbags are favourites with vegan celebrities such as actress Katie Holmes. The circular crossbody bag in cherry red (below right, £98, johnlewis.com) is particularly lust-worthy.

There are plenty of British labels conquering the vegan market, too. For sleek, modern watches with a pared-back aesthetic try Votch (votch.co.uk) or Aubry (below left, aubrywatches.com).

Actress Natalie Portman put Brighton-based vegan shoe designers Beyond Skin on the style map, wearing a pair of their heels on the cover of U.S. Harper’s Bazaar.

Its gorgeous, Prada-esque embroidered slippers (below far right, £139, beyond-skin.com) use faux-suede made from 100 per cent recycled plastic. Unlike real suede, it doesn’t get those dreaded watermarks; Jaguar uses it in its car interiors.

Meanwhile, London brand LaBante has cracked the art of recreating leather’s distinctive texture. Its vegan leather undergoes a special process to give it that lovely ‘grain’. There’s a high-quality finish, too; look closely at, say, the Sophie tote (£200, labante.co.uk) and you’ll see that the lining and stitching are exquisite.

Vanita Bagri who founded LaBante says people are starting to realise that vegan styles, made by the right designer are just as desirable as real leather (file image)

‘When we first started out as a brand, many department stores we met with couldn’t understand why we were using such high levels of craftsmanship,’ says LaBante’s founder Vanita Bagri.

‘They thought non-leather bags shouldn’t be priced over £80. There was a mindset that synthetic materials could only create ugly, peeling bags. But people are realising vegan styles, made by the right designers, are every bit as desirable as the “real” thing.’

Her customers are ‘clued up’ about sustainability, but, she adds: ‘I’m also designing for fashion-forward women.’

Stylist Rebekah Roy, who has worked with the likes of Erin O’Connor and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, says attitudes have shifted.

As one of the organisers behind the launch of Bare Fashion, a London event showcasing vegan clothing and beauty products, she says the sector is evolving rapidly.

‘There are so many brands changing our perception of vegan fashion. The French vegan trainer brand Veja, for example, has had a huge cult following ever since the Duchess of Sussex and Emma Watson were seen wearing its trainers,’ she says.

In case you’re wondering, Meghan Markle wore the Esplar style (far left, £95, harveynichols.com).

Even Net-a-Porter, the go-to destination for serious designer fashion, is getting in on the vegan action.

Next time you’re filling a fantasy shopping basket, take a look at Hungarian brand Nanushka, by London College of Fashion graduate Sandra Sandor. Her vegan leather midi-dress (£500), and mock-croc jacket (£357, both net-a-porter.com) are worlds away from any hemp-tunic cliche.

For less pricey options, try Kitri’s vegan leather culottes (below left, £95, selfridges.com), or Free People’s vegan leather midi skirt (£88, freepeople.com).

Stella McCartney is currently collaborating with Bolt Threads to develop vegan silk made from yeast and sugar (file image)

Net-a-Porter also stocks Fuzz Not Fur, purveyors of PETA-approved faux fur coats. Crafted in a family-run atelier in Paris, they mimic the volume and softness of real fur — and the price. The Oh My Deer coat comes in at £955.

Designer faux fur needn’t be that expensive, though. Jackets from super-cool Shrimps start at £375 (shrimps.co.uk).

Jakke London do similar colour-popping designs (far left, jakke.co.uk) with the PETA seal of approval (and Kate Moss’s: she was spotted in one of the brand’s furry scarves).

At the cutting edge of vegan design is Polish designer Alexandra Koscikiewicz. She creates bags using apple-leather, made of reworked pips and peel left over from harvested apples (prices from £220, alexandrak.co).

If you think wearing fruit is out there, Stella McCartney is collaborating with biotech company Bolt Threads to create a vegan silk made from yeast and sugar.

The fashion house also sponsored a prize to find viable vegan alternatives to wool (one of the hardest materials to mimic).

The winning innovation, Woocoa, uses coconut fibres treated with mushroom enzymes.

Back on the humble High Street, it’s a little less high-tech.

‘But it’s import-ant that brands including M&S, and big online retailers such as ASOS, are starting to introduce vegan styles, if sustainable fashion is to become normalised,’ says Rebekah.

OK, it will be a while yet before we’re buying yeast-silk blouses in M&S, but vegan fashion has certainly shaken off its ‘hessian sack’ image and replaced it with a brand new attitude.

It’s official: vegan is the new black — for January at least!"
"Logos are having a fashion moment, but it's not the same logo mania as the 1990s.

From designer labels Gucci and Louis Vuitton to mass-market duds such as Champion, Adidas, and Nike, fashion brands are creating new ways to display their signature. At the other end of the fashion spectrum, some logos are so minimal, they're barely noticeable, or they're purposefully absent.

“There’s a marked difference in the way our culture approaches logos from the ‘90s to today,” said Sarah Unger, cultural analyst for Civic Entertainment Group, calling logos from a couple decades ago ""very cookie-cutter.”

Now, “you’re seeing logos used in different ways, chopped up, patterned—it’s not just logos in itself,” Unger said. “It could be a logo with a print, a logo reiterated with another creative artist, it could be another artist’s interpretation of somebody’s logo.”

Designer Todd Snyder's version of a Champion-logo sweatshirt ($148) and hoodie ($188), with a color-block pattern.

Today, logos are considered more a part of the design process, said Durand Guion, vice president, Macy’s Fashion Office. “While still a statement, there is creative intention in how logos are applied,” he said.

Japanese designer Chitose Abe has reinvented the sportswear giant's logo as part of her reimagined Nike running togs, in a collaboration with her Sacai label, for release next month. (This includes an updated Sacai x Nike LDV Waffle sneaker with a double Nike swoosh. Earlier versions are collectibles, fetching several hundred dollars.)

“Often, I take the things I like from two different items of clothing and splice them together to create a whole that is bigger than the sum of its parts,"" explains Abe, in a preview. ""I express the end result as a hybrid.""

Louis Vuitton has recreated its LV monogram with bold leopard prints in its new Monogram Jungle collection, including a Neverfull tote (1,750), high-top sneakers ($1,140), and a redo of its classic Twist MM bag ($3,950).

Gucci’s Ultrapace sneakers ($790) for the fall showcase the brand's logo several ways: The G, the double Gs, and Gucci, written in both the vintage logo style and its current font.

Burberry credits its new logo of interlocking Bs used as a pattern in designer Riccardo Tisci’s debut runway collection Kingdom, as helping to reinvigorate the iconic brand as part of a broader reinvention. ""The initial reaction from customers has been very positive with sales of the new collections delivering strong double-digit percentage growth,"" CEO Marco Gobbetti said.

Dapper Dan's influence

As retro-logo mania fashions stage a comeback, their reinvention seem to pay homage to Harlem haberdasher Daniel Day, known as Dapper Dan, who's widely credited as the driving force behind brash logos as fashion statements. Starting in the 1980s, he broke fashion ground by dressing music artists LL Cool J, Jam Master Jay, and Jay-Z, among others, with mashups of unauthorized logos from European luxury brands, which ultimately led to his 2017 partnership with Gucci, and reopening of his Harlem atelier.

Dapper Dan's use of large and reimagined logos was also a way to indicate wealth, Unger said. But what might have seemed to be a risky fashion move to some in the industry, it's ""much better received today by fashion houses because we’re in a much more creatively democratic environment than we were back then,” Unger said.

Today, hip-hop and rap continue to shape streetwear, which is now mainstream fashion, and a huge driver of sales, as well as creativity.

Dan sees today's logo trends as the natural evolution of style.

“When you look at styles past, they recycle themselves. If it was right, how did it fall out of style? If it’s wrong, how’s it back in style? I don’t personally think there is right and wrong in fashion,” Dan writes in his newly released autobiography Dapper Dan: Made in Harlem. “But there is a weak and a strong. Because whoever the dominant personality is, whether it’s the hustler on the corner or the artist on a stage, whoever has that dominant influence, other people gravitate towards that strength.”

Logos alone don't sell fashion

Logos are only cool if the brand speaks to the consumer on creative levels, such as through advertising and featuring cultural figures, said Roseanne Morrison, fashion director at N.Y-based Doneger Group, a fashion merchandising consultancy.

“Saint Laurent is using Finn Wolfhard from Stranger Things in an ad campaign and the image is similar to a young Bob Dylan,"" Morrison said, while Gucci is featuring British singer-songwriter Harry Styles and Calvin Klein is highlighting American singer Billie Eilish. ""These moves portent well for brands that are well established, yet connect with the young consumer,” Morrison said.

As before, today's “logos are a very important status signature for many [fashion] categories,"" said Morrison. “Consumers feel that they belong to the club when they wear certain status labels.”

And brand loyalty comes at all prices—such as a Champion logo-print track jacket, $60; Nike Air Jordan 8 Retro shoes, $190; or Chanel Flap Bag, $3,900.

Sometimes less is better in fashion

Just as reinvented logos are in their ascendancy in streetwear and designer clothing, some branding in women's ready-to-wear is taking a more subtle approach.

Women's fashion ""now is about personal style and the romantic dress or the utility trousers,” said Morrison, citing brands like Ganni's silk wrap dress ($440) and LoveShackFancy's floral print long silk dress ($695).

“Consumers want smaller, less obvious logos,” detects Albert M. Romano, chairperson and professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York. “Too large of a logo detracts from the marketing message and makes it appear that the marketer is shouting.”

Taking an overall view of fashion, Elizabeth Kanfer, director of Nordstrom Fashion Office, observes there's a trend toward more discreet logos.

“In the last two years, these [luxury] designer brands have moved on and overt logo mania is not as prevalent as before,"" Kanfer said.

Items with less prominent logos at Nordstrom include a Loewe Leather T Pouch ($690) and Burberry Monogram Leather Bag ($2,450), Kanfer said.

At Macy’s, “the shift to smaller logos has been fluid,” Macy's Guion said, noting ""without logos, key differentiators include fabric, fit, prints, patterns and new silhouettes.""

“At some higher-end brands, we are starting to see a shift away from the heaviest usage of logo,"" he said. ""This is aimed at the earliest trend adopters who are always looking for the next thing. However, this will take a while to impact what a broader range of consumers are thinking about when making apparel and accessory purchasing decisions.""

"Global brands demand for quick production leading to workers' abuse: report

Updated

Big fashion brands are putting pressure on their suppliers to deliver more quickly and cheaply, which is contributing to labour abuses in factories that manufacture garments, footwear and textiles, according to a new report.

Key points: Pressure to make garments quickly one of the biggest causes of worker mistreatment

Esprit, Nike and Gap were among the 67 retailers and brands analysed

Textile workers in India requested to take less time off during upcoming Diwali festival

More than half the suppliers surveyed were affected by cost negotiation strategies that cut into their profits, according to the report by Better Buying, a Delaware-based group that rates purchasing practices of brands and retailers.

Suppliers, in turn, put pressure on workers, leading to abuses, according to the research, which was funded primarily by the C&A Foundation, a funding partner of the Thomson Reuters Foundation for human trafficking and slavery coverage.

The impacts on workers include excessive overtime, underpayment of benefits, insufficient wages, and use of unauthorised sub-contractors, Doug Cahn, Better Buying co-founder, said.

""Understanding and reducing the negative impacts of purchasing practices is the missing link in the movement to ensure decent conditions of work in supply chains,"" Mr Cahn said.

The index included ratings from 319 suppliers across 38 countries and measured the performance of 67 retailers and brands, including Esprit, Nike and Gap.

Supplier ratings indicated that one third of buyers did not pay bulk order invoices on time, according to the report.

More than 20 per cent of the orders received from retailers or brands were not priced to cover the cost of social, environmental, quality and other compliance requirements.

""These practices create challenges for suppliers to pay their workers adequately and on time,"" Jill Tucker, head of supply chain innovation and transformation at the C&A Foundation, said.

""We hope that with type of insight, buyers will change their practices in a way that make it possible for benefits to trickle down to workers.""

Pressure to deliver quickly has prompted the Tirupur Exporters Association to request workers in India's textile hub in Tamil Nadu state to take only one or two days off during the upcoming Diwali festival, rather than the entire week.

""The peak manufacturing season clashes with two big festivals — Diwali and Pongal,"" Raja M Shanmugham, the association's president, said.

Diwali, a Hindu celebration of lights, falls on November 6 and 7, but workers traditionally take the whole week off, while the harvest festival of Pongal is in January.

Buyers will cancel orders if deliveries are delayed, putting financial strain on suppliers, Mr Shanmugham added.

"Helping New Zealand’s farmers take care of our land

12 June 2019



New Zealand’s green reputation is one of this country’s strongest selling points, but how to manage the relationship between farming and the environment is complex and controversial.

How do we support New Zealand farmers transition to a more environmentally friendly and economically sustainable future?

The clamour to act urgently on climate change is adding pressure on farmers to manage environmental sustainability, but farmers often have to make trade-offs between what they want to develop and what’s affordable.

New Zealand’s banks are increasingly focused on helping agribusiness meet the challenges of developing sustainable farming practices.

With its Environment Loan, ANZ supports customers to prepare their farm environment plan.

The loan pay for a range of infrastructure investments designed to develop or improve environment management, including water and energy conservation projects, fencing and planting, and effluent management.

This support for the farming community is one reason why Canstar is delighted to announce that ANZ has won our Agribusiness Bank of the Year award for the eighth year in a row.

Canstar General Manager Jose George says: “Farming sustainably while protecting New Zealand’s unique environment inevitably involves trade-offs between profitability and care for the land.

“Through its Environment Loan, ANZ has demonstrated its commitment both to New Zealand Agribusiness and environmental sustainability. Winning the award for the eighth year in a row is a fantastic achievement and recognises ANZ's institutional support for our farming community.”

ANZ outperformed the market across all institutional measures these included service and support, information and education and disaster relief or assistance.

ANZ has a large network of Agribusiness managers and support their communities through programs like the Primary Growth Partnership – Red Meat Profit Partnership. Further strengths include the custom benchmarking that is now offered across the sheep and beef sectors as well as specific Agri education programs and succession planning for the Agricultural industry. This breadth of offering through the end to end process is where ANZ excels in servicing the Agribusiness industry.

Accepting the award, ANZ Commercial and Agri Managing Director Mark Hiddleston says: “It is a great achievement to have won the Canstar award for eight years running and shows ANZ is always looking for ways to improve our support for agri customers.”

“As sustainability becomes imperative for all businesses, we continue to see plenty of examples where customers are growing and preserving the value of their land and businesses through investment in environmental initiatives,” Mr Hiddleston says.

“While this award is a great achievement for ANZ and something we are very proud of, I am equally pleased to see recognition for our farmers and their commitment to building a more sustainable future for New Zealand’s agri sector.”

"Chanel Inc. is the latest retail giant to make a public nod toward environmentally conscious products, investing in an eco-friendly chemistry company as part of an effort to make luxury items less damaging to the planet.

Both the apparel and cosmetics industries are major sources of waste, and chemicals often used to make fabrics and skincare products, such as microplastics, ingredient stabilizers, and textile finishers. Startups like Evolved by Nature, to which Chanel will pay an undisclosed sum for a minority stake, seek to replace these harsh synthetic additives with sustainable alternatives.

Evolved by Nature’s trademarked Activated Silk is derived from actual silkworm cocoons, which can be used in fabrics, cosmetics, and medical products, according to the company. Someday, the eco-friendly silk might even find its way into one of Chanel’s $475 scarves.

While people can debate whether planet-friendly proclamations by corporations are a substantive shift or window dressing, the fashion, health, and beauty sectors have been making their interest clear. Brands have sought to market themselves as friends of the Earth, and the bigger players are beginning to move that way, too.

As for Chanel, this isn’t the first time the French luxury house has sought to establish its green bona fides.

It made another sustainability investment late last year with Finnish biodegradable plastic packaging alternative Sulapac. The fashion house made earlier moves within the existing silk industry, too: In 2016, the label acquired four high-end French silk companies to shore up its supply chain. And last year, Chanel published a report on how it addresses sustainability issues, a first for the 100-year-old, privately held retailer.

Evolved by Nature, based in Boston, was started by biomedical engineer Rebecca Lacouture and chemist Gregory Altman in 2013. Their product is pure silk in liquid form, a regenerative technology made from discarded silkworm cocoons. The company has patented dozens of molecular combinations of the natural silk protein since filing its first application in 2014.

Existing backers include Kraft Group, Jeff Vinik, and Roy P. Disney. The company declined to say how much total funding it has raised.

Evolved by Nature said it will use the fresh funding to “explore innovative material, mechanical and optical enhancements of different fabrics.” It’s unclear how the technology will be specifically integrated into Chanel’s products, which range from handbags to haute couture. Altman said the Chanel link-up is still in the research-and-development stage.

“For them to believe in us enough to make a financial investment says we’re certainly doing the right thing,” said Altman.

"Press Release – Little Yellow Bird

Wellington fashion brand Little Yellow Bird has been tackling the uniforms, workwear and apparel industry head-on since its establishment in 2015. As of today, it’s claiming a new title, as New Zealand’s first community-owned ethical fashion brand.

The company is on a mission to change perceptions and prove that fashion can and should be done with sustainability and ethics as the core focus.

Little Yellow Bird has already exceeded its minimum goal raising over $393,000 with another day still to go until the equity crowdfunding campaign closes to scale up the company. This includes diversifying the product range and exploring new markets. Planned projects include the expansion of a clothes recycling program, which the company sees as a crucial next step for sustainable change in their industry.

“We’re more than just a clothing brand; we’re telling the story about where and how our products are made and are working tirelessly to provide employment opportunities in the communities where our clothes come from,” Jones says.

At only 29 years of age, Samantha Jones has already made waves in the apparel industry. Her company, Little Yellow Bird, a certified B Corp, provides ethical and sustainable workwear, uniforms and apparel. Jones is an Edmund Hillary Fellow has been recognised for her innovative work by numerous organisations, including the Wellington Gold Awards, the New Zealand Women of Influence Awards, Sustainable Business Network Awards and was New Zealand Young Innovator of the Year in 2017.

All of Little Yellow Bird’s factories follow fair-trade guidelines and supply chains are monitored from farm to factory.

Their rain-fed, organic cotton is grown without the use of pesticides or chemicals. Their factories also use zero-waste initiates and the company is continuously working to minimise waste and utilise closed loop systems. Little Yellow Bird’s high-quality garments are made from the world’s best quality rain-fed cotton.

"Inclusivity was a huge buzzword in 2018, especially in fashion. Brands announcing expansions to their offerings to accommodate plus-size women are proud to call themselves inclusive. But it's obvious some brands are including plus-sizes as a marketing ploy and simply don't know what they are doing. Nasty Gal was blasted for not be inclusive enough and Victoria's Secret was chastised when they backpedalled by saying they would begin to include plus-size models in its shows. Should all brands include plus sizes?

PERSPECTIVES

Brands were eager to jump on the size-inclusive bandwagon in 2018. In the past, plus-sizes were an afterthought. But now brands are putting plenty of thought into the idea of plus-size fashion. According to Fashionista:

Thankfully those times have passed, and 2018 has been the dawning of a new age in plus size and size inclusive fashion. Every year, plus size options in the marketplace increase, and 2018 surpassed the amount of new brands that launched in previous years. 2018 also saw existing cult favorite brands like Nasty Gal, Madewell, J.Crew, Reformation and Wildfang raise their size ranges, and we're hoping that in 2019 we'll see those brands expand sizing past a 20.

But for brands like Victoria's Secret, it may be a bit too late for them to join the plus-size wave and critics are calling for them to leave it alone. The brand recently found itself in hot water after its Chief Marketing Officer Ed Razek said the brand wasn't interested in having plus-size models on the runway. The brand later ate its words but by then it was too late. Fashion and Lifestyle Editor editor of Huffington Post, Jamie Feldman said she doesn't want to see a plus-size model at a Victoria's Secret fashion show:

I am not self-loathing and I am not averse to creating change in the fashion industry more broadly. Nor am I in denial about the ways the fashion world and society at large have, in some ways, changed for the better when it comes to inclusivity.

The reason I don't care to see a plus-size model in the show is because Victoria's Secret is not, has never been and never will be the catalyst for change the industry so desperately needs.

"Clothing is a popular item on many holiday shopping lists. But some fashion companies want shoppers to buy fewer clothes in order to cut pollution.

At a tiny factory in Irvington, New York, Eileen Fisher's small but mighty team of socially conscious employees are trying to make a dent in fashion's carbon footprint with their Renew program.



""We get between four and 6,000 pieces a week,"" Fisher told CBS News correspondent Elaine Quijano.

The program buys back worn Eileen Fisher pieces and sorts them to determine if they can be resold, resewn or remade.



""We see it as an important long-term investment for us. It's a bit hard to rationalize that cost but we do it because... we think it's the right thing to do and because we believe there's going to be no business done on a dead planet. So we better do the best we can,"" Fisher said.

The average person buys 60 percent more clothing today than 18 years ago, according to McKinsey & Company. Researchers also estimate the fashion industry will use 25 percent of the world's carbon budget by 2050, the estimated amount of carbon dioxide emissions the planet can have without the worst effects of climate change.

Fashion accounts for 8.1 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and 85 percent of unwanted clothing ends up in landfills, piling up to more than 12 million tons annually.

""It's daunting. It's -- yeah, some days I try not to get depressed. Some days I say, 'Oh, my God. It feels like we're moving deck chairs on the Titanic,'"" Fisher said. ""I'm just like, 'Oh, how many years do we have? Twelve before catastrophe strikes us.' … We're only a drop in the bucket… and we're trying to be a role model for other companies.""

Other companies have tapped into the sustainable market too, like Patagonia whose Worn Wear program encourages customers to patch up old clothing rather than buy new. Even Ikea is testing a program to buy back their old furniture and H&M offers a recycling program where customers get 15 percent off when they bring in used items.



But sustainability expert Maxine Bedat says coupons just encourage more consumption, and only about one out of every 1,000 pieces sold is ever recycled.



""The last figures that have come in are showing that there are 150 billion new pieces of clothing that are made every single year,"" Bedat said. ""If you look even at the global population, that's a disposable wardrobe for every man, woman, and child on the planet, every single year.""

She said consumers need to be more conscious shoppers.



""You don't have to be wealthy to make these sustainable choices,"" Quijano said.



""Exactly, you can learn a lot from the clothes just from looking at the tags and looking at the inside of the garment,"" Bedat said. ""I think that's the takeaway. It's not about, you know, getting a PhD in sustainability. It's about finding the clothes that we really love and only using our hard-earned money to purchase things that we're really gonna want to wear in the future.""

Eileen Fisher's Renew program, has sold nearly $3 million worth of garments that would otherwise have ended up in landfills. Finding ways to reuse versus throwing away unwanted clothing could actually save taxpayer money. In New York City alone, it costs $85 million a year to collect and dispose of unwanted clothing."
"Hong Kong Fashion Week Opens with 1,400 Exhibitors



Hong Kong Fashion Week Opens with 1,400 Exhibitors

Budding Local Designer Labels Showcased at FASHIONALLY Parades

HONG KONG, Jan 14, 2019 - (ACN Newswire) - Organised by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC), the 50th edition of Hong Kong Fashion Week for Fall/Winter started its four-day run today and continues until 17 Jan at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre (HKCEC). This year's fair, the largest of its kind in Asia, has attracted some 1,400 exhibitors from 11 countries and regions. In 2018, Fashion Week drew 14,000 buyers from 76 countries and regions, reinforcing Hong Kong's position as a key sourcing hub for global fashion traders and retailers.

HKTDC Deputy Executive Director Benjamin Chau noted: ""We are thrilled to kick off the 50th edition of Hong Kong Fashion Week for Fall/Winter today. What started out as a small-scale show held at local hotels has become Asia's largest fashion fair, creating many important business opportunities for exhibitors from Hong Kong and around the globe.""

Facing the uncertainties resulting from the ongoing trade conflict between the United States and Mainland China, together with rapid changes in sourcing and retailing models, Mr Chau urged industry players to grasp the opportunities presented by buyers from emerging markets, and stay competitive by improving design quality. Manufacturers also need to adopt the latest technologies to add value to their products. ""Hong Kong Fashion Week is poised to remain as the ideal platform through which the industry can promote the latest products and exchange the latest information on fashion and market trends,"" said Mr Chau.

Barney Cheng and LuLu Cheung Feature at Corporate Fashion and Uniforms Zone

Fashion Week incorporates various themed zones to cater for the sourcing needs of different sectors in the garment industry, from garments, designer labels and upstream products, such as fabrics and clothing accessories, to trade services and new production technologies in fashion.

The Corporate Fashion and Uniforms zone returns this year and features the Hong Kong Designer Uniform Display, which showcases uniform collections from some of Hong Kong's top designers including Allan Chiu, Barney Cheng, Kurt Ho & Nelson Leung, LuLu Cheung and Mountain Yam.

The World of Fashion Accessories also returns, bringing together items ranging from shoes and bags to fashion jewellery, scarves and shawls. New this year, The Federation of Hong Kong Footwear Ltd showcases its latest shoe designs with a fashion parade. Special product zones such as Fashionable Sportswear, Thermal Clothing, Bridal & Evening Wear and Intimate Wear & Swimwear feature the latest designs on offer. Incorporating the designs of 60 designers from different countries and regions, the International Fashion Designers' Showcase presents fashion masterpieces from around the globe under one roof.

FASHIONALLY Parades Show Creativity of Budding Hong Kong Labels

The FASHIONALLY Presentation showcases the design works of local fashion designers Arto Wong (brand name: ARTO.), Jason Lee (brand name: YMDH) and Carrie Kwok (brand name: CAR|2IE) through theatrical storytelling. Yam Chan, who comes from a fashion design background, is also collaborating with FASHIONALLY for the first time, showcasing his handcrafted dolls MICH at the MICH - ALLY Exhibition on 16-17 Jan.

Buyer Forums and Fashion Trend Seminars Promote Industry Exchange

Alongside the many fashion parades at Fashion Week, buyer forums, trend-forecasting seminars and sharing sessions on the latest production technologies will provide effective platforms for the industry to gather market information and exchange ideas. Leading international fashion trend forecaster Fashion Snoops shared on ""The Visionary Fashion Trends for Spring/Summer 2020"" today. Other seminars feature industry leaders and experts addressing issues such as rapid footwear prototyping, the sustainable development of the fashion industry, the cotton market outlook and the latest cotton textile technologies, as well as online-to-offline (O2O) retailing strategies.

Hong Kong is a popular sourcing hub frequented by international traders, major retailers and chain stores. The annual Hong Kong Fashion Week for Fall/Winter is an important platform for buyers to discover the latest products and accessories. To create more business opportunities for exhibitors, the HKTDC has arranged 90 buying missions from 43 countries and regions, bringing more than 3,800 companies to the show.

Innovative Digital Initiatives Lead to New Era of Connectivity

The 50th edition of Hong Kong Fashion Week for Fall/Winter marks a new era of connectivity for the fair.

"He is known across the world as the 'bad boy' of fashion.

And Jordan Barrett lived up to his reputation as a ladies' man on Saturday when he partied with French beauty Cindy Bruna at her birthday celebrations in Paris.

The Australian model, 22, kept it casual in a stylish Champion tracksuit while posing for photos at the five-star Hôtel Lutetia.

Model behaviour! Jordan Barrett (right) kept it casual in a designer tracksuit while posing with French beauty Cindy Bruna (left) during her birthday celebrations in Paris on Saturday night

Jordan's black hooded jumper featured a white rose design across the chest.

He paired this with coordinating baggy trousers and accessorised with several rings and gold bracelets.

During the soirée, Jordan placed his arms around Cindy, 24, as the pair engaged in what appeared to be a very friendly conversation.

Oh, la, la! During the soirée, Jordan placed his arms around Cindy, 24, as the pair engaged in what appeared to be a very friendly conversation

Before Cindy's birthday party, Jordan walked the runway at Paris Fashion Week.

Only recently, Jordan spoke about the gender pay gap in the modelling industry.

He told The Courier Mail last month: 'It is kind of one of the only industries where women are paid more than men.'

Close friendship? The two models appeared very close indeed

However, he wasn't concerned because models' pay reflects the fact women's fashion is a much more profitable industry.

'Sales in men's and women's products are completely different, it is ­obvious and fair that women make more money in modelling,' he explained.

'It is basically a women's ­industry. More women buy makeup, hair products and clothing than men. It is just simply that.'"

"Climate change protesters blocked traffic in Bristol city centre as part of demonstration organised by the Extinction Rebellion (XR) campaign group.

Activists halted cars on on several roads around the Cabot Circus shopping district on Saturday before staging various protests to highlight waste in the fashion industry.

While a handful of activists were seen posing semi-naked alongside dummies inside shop windows, bearing slogans about the environmental cost of cheap clothing, hundreds of others joined a “die-in” by lying down inside the main shopping mall.

Environmentalists also staged an impromptu catwalk show and held workshops on mending, upcycling and swapping second-hand clothing on the pedestrianised streets of Cabot Circus.

Organisers said the day of direct action – entitled “Disrupt the Circus of Excess” – took place in the “consumer heart of Bristol to highlight unnecessary consumerism”.

XR is calling on its supporters to buy no new clothing for at least one year, until 30 April 2020. “If we have not seen meaningful change in the industry, the boycott will renew for a second year,” said a spokesperson.

“Fashion, clothing and textiles production is one of the most polluting industries in the world, with a carbon footprint matching the whole of Russia, causing untold suffering of mistreated workers, damaging the mental health of millions through unrealistic idols of “beauty”, and resulting in massive amounts of waste and chemical pollution.”

More than 1,000 XR campaigners were arrested in London last month during 10 days of non-violent civil disobedience.

Earlier this week a spokesperson for XR said the group was considering using drones to shut down Heathrow Airport this summer. If the government refuses to all Heathrow expansion, the group plans to take action in a bid to close the airport for up to 10 days from 1 July.

Dozens of activists were filmed “swarming” the roads outside Cabot Circus on Saturday afternoon, blocking cars while handing out flyers to delayed drivers.

Campaigner Steve Rees, 60, handed out homemade flapjacks to some of the motorists.

“It’s been a bit nerve wracking at times, we’ve had one or two motorists who obviously weren’t happy, but on the whole people have been very, very understanding,” he told The Bristol Post. “I think it’s important to be out here, doing our bit.”

Avon and Somerset Police said no arrests were made during today’s protests."
"Iceland recently unveiled its hard-hitting Christmas advert, which was deemed too “political” by Clearcast.

The 90-second short, originally made by environmental organisation Greenpeace, highlights the impact that production of palm oil can have on the environment by depicting the plight of an orangutan that had lost its home due to deforestation.

Palm oil is used in a myriad of household products, including shampoo, margarine and soap.

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.

So what is palm oil, what products contain it and why is it bad for the environment? Here’s everything you need to know:

What is palm oil?

Palm oil is a type of vegetable oil that comes from palm oil trees.

Palm oil trees can be found in Africa, Asia, North America and South America, many of which are grown on plantations.

85 per cent of all palm oil that’s produced is exported from Indonesia and Malaysia, according to the organisation Say No To Palm Oil.

Why is palm oil bad for the environment?

Many areas of rainforest are destroyed in order to make space for large palm oil plantations, Greenpeace explains.

As depicted in the Iceland advert, this leads to many species such as orangutans losing their homes and being put at risk of losing their lives.

The organisation states that an area of rainforest the size of a football pitch is lost every 25 seconds in Indonesia due to deforestation.

While a lot of palm oil is produced in a manner that damages the environment, it can be produced in a responsible way, explains the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).

WWF is currently working with Johnson & Johnson, a pharmaceutical company, in order to promote sustainability within the palm oil industry.

What products contain palm oil?

Palm oil can be found in numerous everyday household, cosmetic and edible products.

The vegetable oil is used to manufacture makeup such as lipstick, as it helps lipstick to retain its colour for longer.

Palm oil is also used in margarine, as it allows the dairy product to stay solid at room temperature, and in chocolate, to help give it its smooth and visually appealing appearance

Other products that contain palm oil, as outlined by WWF, include ice cream, laundry detergent and instant noodles.

How can you find products made with sustainable palm oil?

Act for Wildlife, an organisation led by Chester Zoo, has created a list of brands that use palm oil that’s been sourced in a responsible way, without causing harm to the environment.

For biscuits that contain certified sustainable palm oil, Act for Wildlife recommends brands including Wagon Wheels, Maryland, Lotus and Jammie Dodgers.

Hovis and Warburtons offer bread made with sustainable palm oil, Galaxy and Kinder do the same for chocolate, and Clover and Nutella do the same for dairy products and spreads.

Other brands on Act for Wildlife’s list include Quorn, Uncle Ben’s, Dolmio, Turrell’s crisps and Skittles. Click here for the full list."
"Burberry has been named the leading luxury brand in the 2018 Dow Jones Sustainability Index, which tracks the performance of companies in terms of economic, environmental and social criteria.

The British heritage label has been included in the index’s ‘Textiles, Apparel & Luxury Goods’ sector for the fourth year running due to a series of eco-friendly initiatives such as the recent pledge to stop destroying unsold clothes, which it previously did as a way of preserving its exclusive image.

The brand also announced that it would no longer be using real fur in its products and will be phasing out existing products made from real fur.

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.

These new measures come after Burberry launched a responsibility agenda in 2017, partnering with sustainable luxury company Elvis & Kresse to turn 120 tonnes of wasted leather offcuts into saleable products.

In 2017/18, the label obtained 48 per cent of its total energy from renewable sources, up by 24 per cent from the precious year.

Shape Created with Sketch. New York Fashion Week 2018: Best street style Show all 45 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. New York Fashion Week 2018: Best street style 1/45 Looking like a sea creature that's just emerged from a year down under, this billowing emerald ensemble takes every biscuit in the tin and leaves a trail of sparkling crumbs behind. It might be New York City, and the road might not be made from yellow brick, but this street styler is almost certainly on her way to Oz. Rex Features 2/45 The sass of this look is palpable. From the clownish print to its sunshine yellow hue, this is a jumpsuit you won't forget in a hurry. While the red lippy is a commendable and aesthetically-pleasing addition, it's the coquettish gaze over those super-slim sunglasses that is the cherry on top here. Getty Images for NYFW: The Shows 3/45 Somebody sent this street styler the weather forecast. New York Fashion Week might've started as a sunny affair, but it was only a matter of time until the heavens opened. This co-ord would've put you in good stead for staying dry, thanks to its slippery vinyl coating. Getty Images 4/45 Don't let the earrings throw you. If tinsel is too synonymous with yuletide gatherings for you to make a fair judgement, look to this street styler's inimitable coordination skills. Red repetition aside, the fan she holds is almost identical to the one decorating her satin coat: now that is some strategic sartorial prowess. Getty Images 5/45 More is more when it comes to python, one of the most dynamic prints set to dominate in the season ahead. Paired here with a baker boy hat and a tangerine lip, there's no stopping this savvy street styler. Getty Images 6/45 It's textures galore in this eye-catching ensemble, which just about gets away with its cacophonous clash of suede and satin thanks to its earthy tones and this street styler's bare-faced complexion. Getty Images 7/45 The colour co-ordination may be subtle, but it's fundamental to the success of this look's juxtaposing patterns. The navy of the trousers is matched by the jacket's stripes and almost every accessory is united by a bright shade of candy red. Meanwhile, the shoes are in cahoots with the jacket with their corresponding fawny hues. Rex Features 8/45 The corduroy, the shirt dress and the Burberry bucket hat - it could be the name of a girlband, one that would certainly suit this stylish trio. Rex Features 9/45 It's the silky feline skirt you've seen splattered across Instagram, the one that grazes the calf in just the right place and has the perfect ratio of spot-to-base in terms of its leopard print. Réalisation Par knew what they were doing when they designed this now-iconic garment, which is styled here with an oversized white shirt, complete with striking scarlet flames. Rex Features 10/45 Who said white crochet was reserved for sun-kissed eight-year-olds and kitsch beachside stalls? Proving that the breezy fabric can work wonders on the streets of Manhattan, this street styler adds a cosmopolitan flair via emerald satin and clunky trainers. Rex Features 11/45 When the tailoring is this good, all you need is a simple pair of white kitten-heeled boots and dark boxy sunglasses to achieve a smart and polished look. Rex Features 12/45 Always match your polka dots to your sunglasses, as the old adage goes. The thigh-high slit and flowing silhouette of the wrap dress is cleverly offset by the rigid structure of the thick-strap shoulder bag, resulting in the ultimate flirty-meets-grungy ensemble. Rex Features 13/45 Wallpaper florals rear their aesthetically-pleasing heads time and time again, and this look is foolproof that they needn't be synonymous with archaisms. In this case, the nostalgia of the print is modernised by lace-up cream boots and a slim leather belt. Rex Features 14/45 Boxy cropped jackets might've first entered the sartorial fray in the mid-90s, but its zip-heavy, oversized counterpart is having a renaissance that sets it aside from the archetypal biker chick garb. Paired here with a dusty pink midi-dress, it adds an unexpected grunge to an otherwise girlish foundation. Rex Features 15/45 More is more when it comes to tartan, as this street styler proves. The mustard jacket is enough of a statement in isolation, but when paired with the matching trousers and monochromatic bustier-style top, it's a serious vibe. Rex Features 16/45 If your outfit doesn't complement your green juice, you're doing fashion week wrong. Dressed head-to-toe in shades of blue, the splash of colour provided by said juice is more than just a happy coincidence. As for the look on the right, it's optical illusion-meets-retro glamour. A vivid beetroot juice would not have gone amiss here. Rex Features 17/45 When you have a double-breasted jacket that's long enough to cover your valuables, who needs trousers, really? It helps if you have the lithe limbs of a Grecian goddess, but who's to say the rest of us can't be equally as minimalistic? Maybe less really is more. Rex Features 18/45 Lashings of leopard offset by crocodile, this street styler knows a thing or two about animal prints, which, when combined, can only be worn alongside a simple staple, such as this plain white tee. Rex Features 19/45 Say what you will about the underwear as outerwear trend, this 70s aesthetic - cemented by those dangling spectacles - wouldn't be complete without the black lace bodysuit. The statement gold earrings also work a nostalgic treat. Rex Features 20/45 Blind for love but sighted for style. There may not be a whole lot of colour wheel action, but a single slick of scarlet lipstick makes all the difference, giving this all-black ensemble the fervour it would've otherwise craved. Rex Features 21/45 Teenagers have crop tops and Reeboks, grown-ups have midriff-baring slits and stilettos. The slicked-back platinum bob is the cherry on top of this cosmopolitan creation. Rex Features 22/45 Read all about it - then tear it to shreds and turn it into a shirt dress. Is it a political statement against fake news? Is it a tribute to Carrie Bradshaw's infamous newspaper dress from Sex and the City? Or is it just another set of wavey garms? The jury is out. Rex Features 23/45 The graphic T-shirt conjures up a Hockney painting while the ornamental trousers add an elevated sense of artistry to this eye-catching ensemble. However, it's the furry Gucci loafers that are the true shining stars of this intricately-woven sartorial tapestry. Rex Features 24/45 If you're going to carry a bright red bucket bag in one hand, you might as well carry a luminous green bottle of water in the other. Plus, if you're heading out with your equally stylish pal, you are practically obliged to match your handbag to her shoes. It's basic economics. Rex Features 25/45 If sugar had a sartorial spirit animal, this would be it. The candy floss-coloured mini dress is saccharine in style while white knee-high boots give the look a distinct confectionary charm. Rex Features 26/45 Gingham takes a starring role in this look, which cleverly combines an all-white base with colourful drapes and a graphic Chanel bag for an added splash of vibrancy. Rex Features 27/45 Don't let the graphic tee and pinstripe trousers distract you from admiring the unlikely hero of this delightfully gaudy ensemble: brown furry slippers. Evidently, comfort is key, even at New York Fashion Week. Rex Features 28/45 And it was all... feathers. If you're going to wear an outfit that is predominantly plumage, this street styler proves that it's best to keep things simple and devoid from fuss elsewhere, which is achieved here via white shoes and a simple collared shirt. Rex Features 29/45 There's something very space age-meets-Scooby Doo about this look. Maybe it's the combination of a fringed bob haircut with brazen colour-blocking that strikes up memories of Velma Dinkley, the iconic character from the popular cartoon. The crimson satchel and slick of matching lippy complements the emerald hue of this stylish attendee's mini dress with aplomb. Rex Features 30/45 Chevrons take centre stage in this colourful ensemble, which exudes a 70s kind of charm, mostly thanks to the flared style of the candyfloss pink trousers and super-slim sunglasses. Rex Features 31/45 A perfect pairing in every sense. From the pulled-up sports socks to the corresponding denim shorts, this couple knows a thing or two about dressing in tandem. Rex Features 32/45 Logomania isn't going away anytime soon, as this artful monochromatic snap proves. Gucci meets Chanel in a delicious harmony of opposites - these two should stick together. Rex Features 33/45 Is he going to a fashion show or a True Romance tribute party? The destination is unclear, but whichever it may be, there's no doubt that this idiosyncratic floral shirt-and-baggy jeans combo would be warmly welcomed in either setting. Rex Features 34/45 Absolutely fabulous in every sense of the phrase, this fashion week attendee has got sophisticated sass down to a tee. The oversized sunglasses carry an appealing nostalgia, while the metallic ankle boots and dogtooth print bring the ensemble back to the modern day with sublime verve. Rex Features 35/45 Proving that sometimes a smartphone is the ultimate handheld accessory, this look is elevated by the creative addition of a DSLR camera casually slung over one shoulder. Rex Features 36/45 Jumpsuits are having a moment - and when combined with a brightly-coloured handbag, it's a look that would not be amiss on the pages of a fashion magazine. Rex Features 37/45 Tailoring isn't going anywhere this season. Neither are dramatic drop earrings, for that matter, or kitten heels. All of this is good news for those with a penchant for souped-up workwear with a casual underbelly. Rex Features 38/45 Oversized blazers should always be worn with round spectacles, evidently. Also, if you're struggling to inject some colour into your wardrobe, you can always dab it with splashes of paint yourself, as this street styler might well have done, or not, maybe the trick is to keep us guessing. Rex Features 39/45 Why tie your jumper round your waist when you can create a dynamic silhouette by opting for a diagonal technique that is moree commonly seen on male student ravers? Pair with an arty headscarf for extra style points. Rex Features 40/45 Trouble and stripes is very much the vibe of this fashion week attendee, thanks to his geometric shirt and the plethora of intricate tattoos it reveals. Rex Features 41/45 If in doubt, suit it out and take a Louis Vuitton bucket bag along for good measure. Rex Features 42/45 Yellow sunglasses might've had their heyday a few seasons ago, but the look is very much still a popular one among editors and fashion influencers. This particular street styler has cleverly matched her tinted shades with the heels of her shoes - a subtle but praiseworthy detail. Rex Features 43/45 Two outfits, both alike in dignity but different in mood. Colour clashing is the prevailing theme in one, while dramatic drapes and luminous lime-green nails characterise the other. Rex Features 44/45 Why bother wearing multiple brands when you can make an emphatic statement by sporting the logos of just one in every component of your outfit? In case you missed it, this look is entirely Fendi. Rex Features 45/45 Slip dresses are no longer a slave to the bedroom and 90s-themed parties. Tie a jumper round your waist to give it some shape and throw on a pair of Birkenstock-style sandals to offset the girlish glamour of it all. Rex Features 1/45 Looking like a sea creature that's just emerged from a year down under, this billowing emerald ensemble takes every biscuit in the tin and leaves a trail of sparkling crumbs behind. It might be New York City, and the road might not be made from yellow brick, but this street styler is almost certainly on her way to Oz. Rex Features 2/45 The sass of this look is palpable. From the clownish print to its sunshine yellow hue, this is a jumpsuit you won't forget in a hurry. While the red lippy is a commendable and aesthetically-pleasing addition, it's the coquettish gaze over those super-slim sunglasses that is the cherry on top here. Getty Images for NYFW: The Shows 3/45 Somebody sent this street styler the weather forecast. New York Fashion Week might've started as a sunny affair, but it was only a matter of time until the heavens opened. This co-ord would've put you in good stead for staying dry, thanks to its slippery vinyl coating. Getty Images 4/45 Don't let the earrings throw you. If tinsel is too synonymous with yuletide gatherings for you to make a fair judgement, look to this street styler's inimitable coordination skills. Red repetition aside, the fan she holds is almost identical to the one decorating her satin coat: now that is some strategic sartorial prowess. Getty Images 5/45 More is more when it comes to python, one of the most dynamic prints set to dominate in the season ahead. Paired here with a baker boy hat and a tangerine lip, there's no stopping this savvy street styler. Getty Images 6/45 It's textures galore in this eye-catching ensemble, which just about gets away with its cacophonous clash of suede and satin thanks to its earthy tones and this street styler's bare-faced complexion. Getty Images 7/45 The colour co-ordination may be subtle, but it's fundamental to the success of this look's juxtaposing patterns. The navy of the trousers is matched by the jacket's stripes and almost every accessory is united by a bright shade of candy red. Meanwhile, the shoes are in cahoots with the jacket with their corresponding fawny hues. Rex Features 8/45 The corduroy, the shirt dress and the Burberry bucket hat - it could be the name of a girlband, one that would certainly suit this stylish trio. Rex Features 9/45 It's the silky feline skirt you've seen splattered across Instagram, the one that grazes the calf in just the right place and has the perfect ratio of spot-to-base in terms of its leopard print. Réalisation Par knew what they were doing when they designed this now-iconic garment, which is styled here with an oversized white shirt, complete with striking scarlet flames. Rex Features 10/45 Who said white crochet was reserved for sun-kissed eight-year-olds and kitsch beachside stalls? Proving that the breezy fabric can work wonders on the streets of Manhattan, this street styler adds a cosmopolitan flair via emerald satin and clunky trainers. Rex Features 11/45 When the tailoring is this good, all you need is a simple pair of white kitten-heeled boots and dark boxy sunglasses to achieve a smart and polished look. Rex Features 12/45 Always match your polka dots to your sunglasses, as the old adage goes. The thigh-high slit and flowing silhouette of the wrap dress is cleverly offset by the rigid structure of the thick-strap shoulder bag, resulting in the ultimate flirty-meets-grungy ensemble. Rex Features 13/45 Wallpaper florals rear their aesthetically-pleasing heads time and time again, and this look is foolproof that they needn't be synonymous with archaisms. In this case, the nostalgia of the print is modernised by lace-up cream boots and a slim leather belt. Rex Features 14/45 Boxy cropped jackets might've first entered the sartorial fray in the mid-90s, but its zip-heavy, oversized counterpart is having a renaissance that sets it aside from the archetypal biker chick garb. Paired here with a dusty pink midi-dress, it adds an unexpected grunge to an otherwise girlish foundation. Rex Features 15/45 More is more when it comes to tartan, as this street styler proves. The mustard jacket is enough of a statement in isolation, but when paired with the matching trousers and monochromatic bustier-style top, it's a serious vibe. Rex Features 16/45 If your outfit doesn't complement your green juice, you're doing fashion week wrong. Dressed head-to-toe in shades of blue, the splash of colour provided by said juice is more than just a happy coincidence. As for the look on the right, it's optical illusion-meets-retro glamour. A vivid beetroot juice would not have gone amiss here. Rex Features 17/45 When you have a double-breasted jacket that's long enough to cover your valuables, who needs trousers, really? It helps if you have the lithe limbs of a Grecian goddess, but who's to say the rest of us can't be equally as minimalistic? Maybe less really is more. Rex Features 18/45 Lashings of leopard offset by crocodile, this street styler knows a thing or two about animal prints, which, when combined, can only be worn alongside a simple staple, such as this plain white tee. Rex Features 19/45 Say what you will about the underwear as outerwear trend, this 70s aesthetic - cemented by those dangling spectacles - wouldn't be complete without the black lace bodysuit. The statement gold earrings also work a nostalgic treat. Rex Features 20/45 Blind for love but sighted for style. There may not be a whole lot of colour wheel action, but a single slick of scarlet lipstick makes all the difference, giving this all-black ensemble the fervour it would've otherwise craved. Rex Features 21/45 Teenagers have crop tops and Reeboks, grown-ups have midriff-baring slits and stilettos. The slicked-back platinum bob is the cherry on top of this cosmopolitan creation. Rex Features 22/45 Read all about it - then tear it to shreds and turn it into a shirt dress. Is it a political statement against fake news? Is it a tribute to Carrie Bradshaw's infamous newspaper dress from Sex and the City? Or is it just another set of wavey garms? The jury is out. Rex Features 23/45 The graphic T-shirt conjures up a Hockney painting while the ornamental trousers add an elevated sense of artistry to this eye-catching ensemble. However, it's the furry Gucci loafers that are the true shining stars of this intricately-woven sartorial tapestry. Rex Features 24/45 If you're going to carry a bright red bucket bag in one hand, you might as well carry a luminous green bottle of water in the other. Plus, if you're heading out with your equally stylish pal, you are practically obliged to match your handbag to her shoes. It's basic economics.

Leanne Wood, Burberry’s chief people, strategy and corporate affairs officer, said that the brand was “extremely proud” to be the leading luxury brand in the 2018 Dow Jones Sustainability Index.

“At Burberry, we are passionate about finding ways to be socially and environmentally responsible in everything we do, from investing in the communities at the heart of our business to creating innovative ways to tackle the most pressing issues faced by our industry,” she said.

“We will continue to expand these efforts as we work towards our responsibility goals to 2022 and beyond.”

The recent eco-friendly changes are just one component of Burberry’s comprehensive revamp under new artistic director Riccardo Tisci, who will showcase his debut collection for the brand at London Fashion Week on Monday 17 September.

If the recent releases are anything to go by - fans have so far been given a sneak peak at the label’s new logo and monogram - the traditional label, known for its trench coats and checks, is set for a significant sartorial revamp.

However, Burberry is not the only British brand at the vanguard of sustainability.

Earlier this month, Stella McCartney and Adidas announced the launch of the world's first vegan Stan Smith trainers, an environmentally and ethically-friendly alternative to the iconic tennis shoe, which will be made entirely from vegan, cruelty-free leather.

Meanwhile, making eco-friendly waves across the pond is US retailer Reformation, which are committed to making every item of clothing as sustainable as possible by making its clothes from eco fabrics like Tencel, deadstock materials and repurposed vintage clothing."
"""Right now we are facing a man-made disaster of global scale, our greatest threat in thousands of years: climate change,"" he said, adding that the collapse of civilisation was ""on the horizon"".

However, we haven't done much about it. The more urgent the warnings, the more likely we are to pull a duvet over our heads. The problem seems so vast, so terrifying that we feel helpless.

When you hear that whole nations will be swallowed by rising sea levels while catastrophic weather events, like the wildfires that destroyed swathes of California, are only set to get worse, ensuring we take the cap off the milk carton before it goes into the recycling seems futile.

While we may not be in a position to comb beaches looking for marine mammals and birds tangled in plastic, we can buy less.

At this time of year, rampant consumerism is encouraged. Along with donning a silly jumper and drinking too much, panic-buying is now seen as unavoidable. Not only do we need to purchase new items to make ourselves 'party ready' but there's also the questionable business of buying gifts for others they probably don't want or need.

It's unlikely that we are all going to stop buying Christmas gifts. But how about buying more mindfully; that means buying less, buying better quality and buying from charity shops. It's not just bobbly cardigans and dog-eared books you'll find; many charity shops stock new items, like sunglasses, earrings and bags, all ideal stocking fillers or even Kris Kindle gifts. Oxfam shops stock a range of Fair Trade products, such as chocolate coins, mulled wine and spiced cider, retro games and novelty socks plus cards and gift-wrap paper.

A stigma still surrounds charity shops, possibly due to their jumble-sale appearance. For charity-shop lovers, however, this needle-in-a-haystack aesthetic is exactly why they keep coming back. At this point, I should introduce myself: my name is Sophie, and I am a charity shop addict.

I became an avid shopper of second-hand fashion in my early twenties when I was cash-strapped. Now I'm a little more flush but I still prefer charity shops to the high street. Yes, I comb those overstuffed rails because I love the thrill of finding a gem among the dross, but perhaps charity-shopping is my subconscious way of reconciling my love of fashion with that niggling feeling that I don't need any of this stuff.

That said, I have found some absolute treasures. Most recently, it was a fuchsia mohair cardigan and a wool/cashmere overcoat in mint condition. There have been Salvatore Ferragamo blouses and box fresh handbags from the 1980s. I have spotted Versace jeans and a Max Mara camel coat, both too big, which still haunt my dreams.

It also salves my conscience because fashion, my great love, is an environmental disaster. It is estimated that the global fashion industry is now producing up to 100bn new garments a year, while only 1pc of clothing is fully recycled. The greenhouse gases from the industry are cited as a major contributor to climate change. Hundreds of millions of garments end up in landfill each year; the collateral damage of producing cheap goods is stark.

It can take more than 2,000 litres of water to produce the cotton for one T-shirt, the fibres in many synthetic fabrics are difficult to recycle and it's estimated that half a million tonnes of microfibres a year enter the ocean.

It's damning, and that doesn't include the human impact; the cheap labour behind this multi-billion euro industry.

Our attitude to fashion has also changed with the influx of cheap clothing. The clothes on your back are now as disposable as that used milk carton. Although it may be too late for some, the fast fashion industry may be facing a reckoning.

Two weeks ago, representatives from brands like Primark, Asos and Boohoo were brought before the UK's House of Commons. The Environmental Audit Committee is investigating the impact fast fashion has on the environment, its labour force and the climate.

Even my beloved charity shops are suffering from all that cheap clothing. Mary Creagh, Labour MP and chair of the committee, said charity shops now turn away donations due to poor quality.

""If we were to turn our backs on fast fashion, what would happen to it? It would go to landfill,"" says Dermot McGilloway, St Vincent de Paul Ireland's national retail development manager.

""We are very aware of the environmental and social issues that arise from the industry, but the fact remains it is consumer driven. People want more fashion, cheap, and retailers are simply responding.""

So, perhaps the onus is on us. Until our penchant for fast fashion dwindles, the best thing we can do with the clothes once we no longer want them is to donate them.

""We are committed to the circular economy,"" says McGilloway, adding that ""97pc of what we receive stays out of landfill"".

""We don't have a surplus of goods,"" adds Alice Dawson-Lyons from Oxfam Ireland.

""We are open to accepting nearly everything. What we can't resell we can recycle. Our shops are part of ethical consumerism. We would much rather receive these goods and recycle them, than them going in the bin.""

So, as December gets into full swing perhaps you'll reconsider your shopping strategy this Christmas. Rather than giving into the mania, look at the alternatives. Shop ethically, shop mindfully, and try to shop a bit less.

You might even see me, elbow deep in the knitwear rail of your local charity shop, helping save the planet one second-hand jumper at a time.

Primark's hugely anticipated new store will finally open its doors tomorrow (11th April), with the flagship branch officially letting members of the public into the secret at 10am.

The 187th Primark store in the UK, Primark Birmingham high street will also be the brand's largest store to date. And it will sell a lot more than just affordable clothes...

While rumours have been spreading for a while now about a supposed Disney cafe launching inside the new site, Primark has now confirmed to us that not only are the rumours true, but it will also be joined by two other cafes, as well as a designated Disney shopping zone and Hogwarts Wizarding World.

Other key features of the store include a recycling scheme and ""custom lab"" for personalising things like t-shirts.

In fact, Birmingham's new Primark is so big it will have water fountains dotted throughout, in a nod to the brand's focus on new environmentally-friendly shopping conditions.

We've got the full list of features set to be hosted in the new, super-size Primark below.

The Primark Café with Disney: A café with a touch of Disney magic. Inspired by Disney’s own Mickey Mouse & friends, the café allows customers to use an interactive game zone and enjoy a unique Disney themed menu. This menu includes great quality, nutritious, freshly prepared hot and cold food, and drinks all day.

The Mezz restaurant: A place to ‘grab & go’ or sit down for a full meal, including freshly baked pizza and locally-inspired street food.

Primarket Café: Primark’s first own-brand café, which uses only Fairtrade certified coffee beans and gives 5% of the total cost of every kilo of coffee sold in-store back to the coffee bean growers. Takeaway cups are compostable, and customers will get 10p off when they bring their own reusable cup.

Duck & Dry Xpress x Primark: A full beauty studio experience, offering head to toe treatments in a boutique environment at the best price on the high street. This follows the recent opening of Primark’s first Duck & Dry Xpress at its Oxford Street East store in London.

Mills x Primark barbers: Fronted by session hairdresser and entrepreneur Joe Mills, a barbershop offering slick cuts, wet shaves and facials at great prices. Customers can sip coffee in the Mills coffee bar while they wait.

Disney Shopping Area: After visiting the Primark Café with Disney, customers can continue their experience in a Disney shopping area, where they can find everything from clothing to soft toys. Close to the café, on the top floor, there is a Disney baby section with a selection of babywear and accessories.

Outside the Primark Café with Disney, customers can continue their experience in a dedicated Disney area on the 1st floor, where they can access some of the best Disney merchandise around including homeware, makeup and clothing.

Hogwarts Wizarding World: Bringing a bit of magic to Birmingham, this licensed Harry Potter experience gives budding wizards and witches the clothing, accessories and gifts they need to cast their next spell.

Recycling Scheme: The store features Primark’s recycling scheme, meaning customers can easily recycle pre-loved clothes and shoes from any brand.

Custom Lab: The store is home to Primark’s Custom Lab, which gives customers even more freedom to express themselves through printing bespoke, personalised t-shirts and other items.

The entire store will span a massive five floors across 160,000 sq ft, and employ more than 1,000 people, including 500 new jobs, plus 430 existing employees who have transferred from the Primark New Street store.

There's also more than 100 people who are employed in partner-run experiences including chefs, hair stylists, beauticians and more.

Customers will also find water fountains throughout the store and all water sold is bottled in recyclable or recycled packaging.

As for Wi-Fi, Primark has catered to both the Instagram-addicted shoppers, and the ones who would rather take a back seat in the experience, with free Wi-Fi and recharge seating areas, where they can relax and recharge both themselves and their mobile devices.

As well as the latest trends in women’s, men’s and children’s fashion, footwear, accessories, lingerie and homewear, Primark’s certified cruelty-free Leaping Bunny PS...Beauty range will also be for sale in the store.

Primark’s range of pyjamas and jeans - both made from 100% sustainable cotton - are also available in-store, as well as locally-inspired products made just for Brummies.

The bold design of the Primark store front is another architectural statement for Birmingham, and it will be one of the first buildings that passengers see when they arrive into the city’s train station.

Primark’s Retail Director for the UK & Northern Europe, Simon Gibbs said: “Primark is proud to be a part of the fabric of Birmingham. We’ve been in this great city since 2002 and have witnessed its incredible transformation, including the opening of the Bullring in 2003 and Grand Central in 2015.

The opening of Birmingham High Street gives us the opportunity to bring our flagship product range and the very best of Primark to our customers in this vibrant and diverse city, which is something we have wanted to do for many years.”

Primark’s Director of New Business Development, Tim Kelly said: “Our customers can expect a great experience at Primark Birmingham High Street.

They can spend time with friends and family, eat great food, recharge and have fun, and find everything under one roof including Fashion, Beauty and Homewear – all at an amazing price. We’re proud to bring this great store and everything it has to offer, to Birmingham.”"

Meghan Markle has shared never before seen pregnancy photos of her secret trips to design her new clothing line.

The beaming Duchess of Sussex can be seen lovingly holding her blossoming baby bump during the ""quiet visits"" to charity Smart Works over the last year.

In another photo she pats her stomach while sat at a table as they discuss ideas. In a third snap she is also seen surveying a rack of clothes.

The discreet trips were arranged months before she gave birth to son Archie in May.

The 37-year-old, who will celebrate her birthday on Sunday, was ""moved by the impactful work"" being done by the non profit organisation, Smart Works, which helps women into the workforce.

(Image: sussexroyal/Instagram)

It equips them with both the skills and clothes they need to feel job-ready, but Meghan noticed that the donations were a combination of mismatched items and colours.

The style-conscious duchess felt the clothes didn’t necessarily “suit” the job at hand: to make a woman feel confident and inspired as she walked into her job interview.

So this autumn, Meghan will be supporting a collection to help equip the women of Smart Works with the key workwear essentials they need as they enter into the workplace.

(Image: sussexroyal/Instagram)

She has teamed up with leading British retailers to create a capsule collection of women's clothing.

Meghan asked John Lewis, Marks & Spencer, Jigsaw and her fashion designer pal Misha Nonoo to create a fashion line which will benefit her patronage.

Writing in the September issue of Vogue, which she guest edited, the new mum explained: ""When you walk into a Smart Works space you’re met with racks of clothing and an array of bags and shoes.

""Sometimes, however, it can be a potpourri of mismatched sizes and colours, not always the right stylistic choices or range of sizes.

(Image: sussexroyal/Instagram)

""To help with this, I asked Marks & Spencer, John Lewis & Partners, Jigsaw and my friend, the designer Misha Nonoo, if they were willing to design a capsule collection of more classic options for a workwear wardrobe.

""Taking the idea further, many of the brands agreed to use the one-for-one model: for each item purchased by a customer, one is donated to the charity. Not only does this allow us to be part of each other’s story, it reminds us we are in it together.""

A spokesman for the Duchess added: ""This initiative is supported by four generous brands who share the vision to empower the women of Smart Works to look and feel as they bravely venture in to what can often be a daunting environment for those who have been out of the job market.

(Image: sussexroyal/Instagram)

""The brands have come together to work towards this united force for good, “[reframing] the idea of charity as community,” as The Duchess writes in a piece for this month’s British Vogue.

""They will follow the 1:1 model where an item from the collection purchased is an item shared with a woman of Smart Works because “not only does this allow us to be part of each other’s story; it reminds us we are in it together.”

Smart Works helps over 2,000 women every year across two offices in London, with over one in two clients succeeding at their job interview.

Upon booking, each client is given a two-hour appointment where they receive one complete outfit for their interview which they can keep, free of charge, before taking part in a one-to-one interview coaching session"
"Have you filled your fridge with cauliflower ‘steaks’ for Veganuary? Did you rush to Greggs to sample one of its sell-out vegan sausage rolls?

If you haven’t jumped on the plant-based wagon, grab yourself an oat milk latte and get on board. With the number of Brits going vegan skyrocketing to an estimated 3.5 million (Waitrose has increased its vegan food offering by 223 per cent to keep up with demand), veganism is the hottest trend for 2019.

And the next big thing: making sure your wardrobe is as vegan as your kitchen. That means no fur, no leather, no suede. You’ll need to skip shearling, angora and mohair, too.

Eschewing real feathers and crocodile skin might be fairly simple if you’re not Cruella de Vil, but vegan fashion also means no silk (silkworms are often steamed inside their cocoons to obtain the precious threads), no cashmere (it’s made from the soft undercoat of mountain goats) — and no wool (PETA says the shearing process can hurt sheep).

Hanna Woodside shared advice for embracing the trend for vegan fashion, designers including Burberry (pictured) have committed to going fur-free

With veganism no longer a niche trend for eco-warriors and evangelical A-listers, the global fashion industry has had to respond to the increased scrutiny of its ethical practices, which are harder to ignore in the age of Insta-activism. Appealing to a new ‘woke’ generation of customers is a commercial imperative.

Established designers such as Coach, Burberry, Diane von Furstenberg and Michael Kors have committed to going fur-free.

More than 300 brands including Gap, Mango and Zara agreed to stop selling mohair after PETA released evidence of goat mistreatment in the supply chain.

London Fashion Week has been entirely fur-free since last September, while Helsinki Fashion Week has gone further and banned leather on its catwalk as of this year. The very first Vegan Fashion Week will take place next month in Los Angeles.

There are even dedicated dating apps if you want to keep your love life vegan.

But the proof that vegan fashion is now truly mainstream? This month Marks & Spencer unveiled its vegan shoe range, with 350 styles boasting the vegan logo you’ll already find in its food and beauty aisles.

‘We’ve seen a 200 per cent rise in online searches for vegan-related products,’ says Phil Townsend, sustainable raw materials specialist for M&S.

‘We’ve offered synthetic shoes for a number of years, but over the past nine months we’ve made sure every component of our vegan footwear is made without animal derivatives, from the trims to the adhesives [shoe glues often use animal products].’

The phrase ‘vegan shoes’ might conjure up nightmarish images of felt clogs and clunky cork sandals, but in the M&S spring range you’ll find lipstick-red kitten-heeled court shoes (£19.50, marksand spencer.com, top), trainers with a rainbow stripe (£25) and a pair of statement block-heeled courts with a striped ankle strap (£35).

‘Our synthetic materials are premium quality, which means they have the look and feel of leather,’ says Phil. Up close you’d be hard-pushed to know the court shoes weren’t genuine leather. They have none of the squeakiness you associate with man-made materials.

The global worth of faux leather is predicted to reach £66 billion by 2025 (file image)

Other retailers have cottoned on to the rising demand, too. Schuh has a vegan section on its website, with zebra-print loafers (£8.99, schuh.co.uk) and Chelsea boots (£17.99).

Esprit, Dr Martens and Toms all have decent vegan-friendly shoes, approved by PETA, so you won’t get caught out with animal-based dyes and glues.

ASOS — which recently won a PETA award for banning the sale of mohair, cashmere, feathers and silk — does a great pair of women’s brogues (£25, asos.com) made from next-generation faux leather, a water-based polyurethane with a smaller environmental impact than other plastic-based synthetics. (Just because a material is vegan doesn’t mean it’s necessarily environmentally-friendly).

Fashion snobs may associate real leather with luxury, but with the global faux leather market predicted to be worth $85 billion (£66 billion) by 2025, a wave of vegan designers are intent on proving their wares can be just as beautiful and well-crafted.

John Lewis stocks boutique Canadian label Matt & Nat — its chic handbags are favourites with vegan celebrities such as actress Katie Holmes. The circular crossbody bag in cherry red (below right, £98, johnlewis.com) is particularly lust-worthy.

There are plenty of British labels conquering the vegan market, too. For sleek, modern watches with a pared-back aesthetic try Votch (votch.co.uk) or Aubry (below left, aubrywatches.com).

Actress Natalie Portman put Brighton-based vegan shoe designers Beyond Skin on the style map, wearing a pair of their heels on the cover of U.S. Harper’s Bazaar.

Its gorgeous, Prada-esque embroidered slippers (below far right, £139, beyond-skin.com) use faux-suede made from 100 per cent recycled plastic. Unlike real suede, it doesn’t get those dreaded watermarks; Jaguar uses it in its car interiors.

Meanwhile, London brand LaBante has cracked the art of recreating leather’s distinctive texture. Its vegan leather undergoes a special process to give it that lovely ‘grain’. There’s a high-quality finish, too; look closely at, say, the Sophie tote (£200, labante.co.uk) and you’ll see that the lining and stitching are exquisite.

Vanita Bagri who founded LaBante says people are starting to realise that vegan styles, made by the right designer are just as desirable as real leather (file image)

‘When we first started out as a brand, many department stores we met with couldn’t understand why we were using such high levels of craftsmanship,’ says LaBante’s founder Vanita Bagri.

‘They thought non-leather bags shouldn’t be priced over £80. There was a mindset that synthetic materials could only create ugly, peeling bags. But people are realising vegan styles, made by the right designers, are every bit as desirable as the “real” thing.’

Her customers are ‘clued up’ about sustainability, but, she adds: ‘I’m also designing for fashion-forward women.’

Stylist Rebekah Roy, who has worked with the likes of Erin O’Connor and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, says attitudes have shifted.

As one of the organisers behind the launch of Bare Fashion, a London event showcasing vegan clothing and beauty products, she says the sector is evolving rapidly.

‘There are so many brands changing our perception of vegan fashion. The French vegan trainer brand Veja, for example, has had a huge cult following ever since the Duchess of Sussex and Emma Watson were seen wearing its trainers,’ she says.

In case you’re wondering, Meghan Markle wore the Esplar style (far left, £95, harveynichols.com).

Even Net-a-Porter, the go-to destination for serious designer fashion, is getting in on the vegan action.

Next time you’re filling a fantasy shopping basket, take a look at Hungarian brand Nanushka, by London College of Fashion graduate Sandra Sandor. Her vegan leather midi-dress (£500), and mock-croc jacket (£357, both net-a-porter.com) are worlds away from any hemp-tunic cliche.

For less pricey options, try Kitri’s vegan leather culottes (below left, £95, selfridges.com), or Free People’s vegan leather midi skirt (£88, freepeople.com).

Stella McCartney is currently collaborating with Bolt Threads to develop vegan silk made from yeast and sugar (file image)

Net-a-Porter also stocks Fuzz Not Fur, purveyors of PETA-approved faux fur coats. Crafted in a family-run atelier in Paris, they mimic the volume and softness of real fur — and the price. The Oh My Deer coat comes in at £955.

Designer faux fur needn’t be that expensive, though. Jackets from super-cool Shrimps start at £375 (shrimps.co.uk).

Jakke London do similar colour-popping designs (far left, jakke.co.uk) with the PETA seal of approval (and Kate Moss’s: she was spotted in one of the brand’s furry scarves).

At the cutting edge of vegan design is Polish designer Alexandra Koscikiewicz. She creates bags using apple-leather, made of reworked pips and peel left over from harvested apples (prices from £220, alexandrak.co).

If you think wearing fruit is out there, Stella McCartney is collaborating with biotech company Bolt Threads to create a vegan silk made from yeast and sugar.

The fashion house also sponsored a prize to find viable vegan alternatives to wool (one of the hardest materials to mimic).

The winning innovation, Woocoa, uses coconut fibres treated with mushroom enzymes.

Back on the humble High Street, it’s a little less high-tech.

‘But it’s import-ant that brands including M&S, and big online retailers such as ASOS, are starting to introduce vegan styles, if sustainable fashion is to become normalised,’ says Rebekah.

OK, it will be a while yet before we’re buying yeast-silk blouses in M&S, but vegan fashion has certainly shaken off its ‘hessian sack’ image and replaced it with a brand new attitude.

It’s official: vegan is the new black — for January at least!"
"With Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, and Kim Kardashian spotted in vintage wear, and its increasing availability on the high street, it could be the answer to sustainable shopping

Like it or loathe it, when Kim Kardashian wears something, people take notice. With the reality TV star wearing secondhand Azzedine Alaïa to Paris fashion week, secondhand Jean Paul Gaultier to a party and a secondhand 1990s Thierry Mugler gown to an award ceremony, it suggests change is afoot. Who would have thought that Kardashian – a woman worth $350m (£270m), who usually wears Balmain and bodycon – would be making a case for sustainable fashion?

As consumers become increasingly aware of the environmental impact of fast fashion, they are looking for a more sustainable way to shop. Could buying secondhand be the answer?

Vintage, it seems, is increasingly in vogue across the board, from Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, who wore 1960s Dior to a christening, to its appearance in British Vogue (the May issue asks: “Does your dress look vintage?”), to high street stores H&M, Arket and & Other Stories announcing they would trial vintage and secondhand clothes sales on their websites. High-end boutique Browns has also just launched the label One Vintage, which uses antique textiles to create new garments. Octavia Bradford, the womenswear buyer for Browns, says: “Sustainability is the loudest conversation in fashion right now.”

A study shows that, last year, 64% of women were willing to buy pre-owned pieces compared with 45% in 2016 – and it is thought that by 2028, 13% of the clothes in women’s wardrobes are likely to be secondhand. Fashion circularity, a new term referring to the recycled life of a garment, is projected to reach $51bn in five years, up from the current $24bn, according to ThredUp’s annual resale report.

Stella McClure, the founder of the online shop The Stellar Boutique, has noticed a shift. When she opened 20 years ago “there was still a stigma attached” – conjuring images of the yellow sweat patches and emotional baggage people often associate with used clothing. “But now (thankfully) it is not just acceptable – it’s cool and has completely captured the fashion zeitgeist,” she says.

Vintage has been venturing on to the high street in fits and starts – in 2000, Portobello Road’s Peekaboo Vintage was welcomed into Topshop’s Oxford Circus flagship store. In 2010, Asos launched its Marketplace, which helped to bring vintage wares to a much wider – and crucially, online – audience.

If the trend has waned of late, this has been purely about aesthetics – minimalism replaced boho chic, and modernity was more in demand than 1970s florals. But fashion has shifted. Aside from an increased awareness of sustainability, vintage fashion fits neatly into the wider mood of the Instagram age, where authenticity and originality – not being seen in the same outfit as anyone else – are highly prized. What better way to stand out than to wear clothes few others are likely to own?

Fashion tends to mine the past. But many of today’s most exciting young designers, from punk-revivalist Charles Jeffrey to James Theseus Buck and Luke Brooks of Rottingdean Bazaar, are looking to decades before they were born for inspiration. “High-end design teams are referencing past eras,” says Nicky Albrechtsen, the author of Vintage Fashion Complete. She refers to the prairie-style dresses of Erdem and Zimmermann, “reminiscent of the nostalgic fashions of the 70s”, as well as cult brands such as The Vampire’s Wife and Batsheva.

“Seeing such strong references on the catwalk gives confidence to fashionistas to embrace the original dresses and showcase original pieces in a modern way,” says Albrechtsen. According to Scarlet Eden, a vintage buyer at Beyond Retro, if the pieces the high street produces are based on vintage trends: “We’re able to offer customers the original looks.”

Vintage naysayers who may have been put off in the past by thoughts of rummaging around in jumble-sale-like basements may be persuaded by the ability to buy online. “The popularity of online vintage shops is great for those who don’t have access to everything a city such as New York has to offer,” says Gabriel Held, described by Vogue as “Instagram’s most celebrated vintage dealer”.

But it is not all rosy: opening up the market with numerous online shops has meant less quality control. Held sees “a lot of mediocre used clothing being marketed as vintage … Something doesn’t have to be 20 years old to be considered vintage, but, for me, if it’s not true vintage, then it should be something extraordinary.”

This is where the lines blur between secondhand and vintage. For Albrechtsen, vintage means any era up to the early 80s, while Eden and McClure consider it to be clothing that is more than 20 years old. Held says his definition “is not set in stone” – he even has some contemporary pieces in his own archive “that I know will be collectible in 10 years’ time”.

Virginia Bates, whose Notting Hill vintage emporium attracted the likes of Naomi Campbell and Donatella Versace before it closed in 2012, used to stock items from the end of the 19th century. Her definition of vintage runs “up to the 1920s, 30s, a bit of 40s, occasionally 50s … I don’t consider 60s vintage. I would never have sold that because I was there, I was wearing it.” But, as she says: “With another generation coming up, the 60s is the equivalent of what I thought of as antique when I opened my shop.”

Albrechtsen says: “Many professionals now include any [era]-defining garments – by which I mean iconic or clever designs.” This is where the resurgence and reverence of certain 90s styles comes in, arguably spearheaded by cult Peckham shop Wavey Garms. “Nineties sportswear is,” according to Albrechtsen, “very clever in terms of design … so it still works now.” Little surprise, then, that it has filtered down to more mainstream vintage outlets – Beyond Retro, for example, is always well-stocked with Champion sweatshirts.

The flames of this “less vintage vintage” are also being fanned by the rise of resale sites. According to the ThredUp 2019 resale report, resale has grown 21 times faster than apparel retail in the past three years. These luxury sites offer a glimmer of hope to those seeking a more affordable way to buy into designer fashion.



Not content to sit back and watch others profit from their vintage items, some luxury labels are relaunching decades-old designs from their own archives. Last year, for instance, Dior brought back its saddle bag because of the attention it was getting in the vintage fashion market. In February, Fendi brought back its Carrie Bradshaw-approved baguette bag from 1999 – luxury resale website Vestiaire Collective had seen a 558% increase in sales of the bag since January last year. “Every brand is currently developing a point-of-view on how to coexist with secondhand,” ThredUp cofounder and chief executive James Reinhart recently told the Business of Fashion.

Of course, for some, buying vintage will never feel quite right. “It’s really not my bag,” says Bates. There are obvious pitfalls – sizing isn’t uniform, and, she says: “You have to be so careful to look for holes and moths and rips.”

But being able to call a 90s hoodie, a Dior bag from the 00s, or a dress first worn by Naomi Campbell in 1996 “vintage”, might just help to keep the appeal going. As Bates puts it: “At the end of the day it doesn’t really matter … the most important thing is that it’s recycled – it encourages people not to go out and buy more.”"
"Finland prides itself on being remarkably progressive when it comes to gender equality. It routinely scores among the highest countries when it comes to economic equality between men and women, and tops charts for countries that have the highest number of women serving in parliament.

This week, the country’s largest department store, Stockmann, rolled out an entire floor dedicated to gender-neutral fashion.

Inside Stockmann, located in Helsinki, there’s a section called “One Way.” It’s located in between the men and women’s floors and sells clothing from cool brands like Acne Studios, Calvin Klein, Marimekko, Burberry, and Kenzo.

“Our aim is to inspire our customers to forget the rules and shop unbiasedly,” Stockmann chief operating officer Anna Salmi told the Australian site SheSociety. “We believe that men’s and women’s departments should function as guidelines to finding the clothes that best fit your shape and style rather than definite rules to follow. “

This is part of a broader trend — more brands and stores than ever before are embracing gender-neutral clothing. But it’s still not clear whether it’s a passing moment or will spell a lasting shift in how we dress.

Androgynous fashion has been on the rise for a few years

In 2015, the research group NPD declared that one of the biggest trends in fashion would be moving away from gendered dressing, and cited younger shoppers’ collective desire to buck societal norms.

“From clothing to footwear to technology, forward-thinking companies are enacting a less binary vision of how we shop, dress, and live — in response to an emerging consumer need,” NPD wrote. “Half of [millennials] believe gender exists on a spectrum and shouldn’t be limited to male and female. So retailers and manufacturers with their eyes on this most valued of consumer demographics would be wise to start thinking of shoppers as more complex and varied. They’re more than just male or female.”

Dubbed the “great gender blur” by the New York Times, there’s been a rise of androgynous fashion. Brands like Alexander Wang, H&M, Zara, Marc Jacobs, Burberry, Tom Ford, and Gucci have made androgynous collections, and in 2016, Jaden Smith appeared in a Louis Vuitton womenswear campaign wearing a skirt (sparking some outraged headlines). The trend has led to the debut of new gender-free brands too, like Telfar and 69 Worldwide.

In 2015, the British department store Selfridges debuted Agender, a gender-neutral shopping concept that takes up three floors inside its stores. In 2017, John Lewis, a chain of department stores across England, Wales, and Scotland, combined the kids’ clothes inside its boys and girls sections, citing the desire to do away with gender stereotypes. Earlier this spring, the gender-neutral fashion brand Phluid Project opened its store in New York City.

While gender fluidity has attracted positive press for fashion companies, it’s certainly not the norm. The industry is still notoriously rigid when it comes to gender expectations; it still relies on society’s sexualization of women, as well as the promotion of the patriarchal definition of femininity. Agender collections from important designers and big stores have largely been just that — one-off collections.

Mainstream fashion is also still very much reliant on gender divides when it comes to marketing, whether that takes the form of separate departments in stores or tabs on websites. When there’s money on the table, it can be difficult to tell whether brands are authentically interested in executing change and recognizing the fluidity of gender expression, or if it’s all just another clever marketing campaign.

Will androgynous fashion spread everywhere?

Helsinki’s Stockmann appears to be going all in on the androgynous approach. The department store is hosting ongoing discussions about “unisex thinking,” according to its website, and the change is purported to be a permanent one. Still, this is a store that prides itself on gimmick marketing; six months ago, it changed its name to Stockwomann for a campaign in honor of International Women’s Day.

While it’s a step in the right direction, genderless shopping sections certainly don’t solve everything. Gender-neutral clothing currently on the market often doesn’t cater to shoppers who aren’t thin, or those who can’t afford the price tags of brands like Acne or Calvin Klein. And it’s not a two-way street when it comes to clothing coded as “masculine” versus “feminine” — as one trans Auckland University sociology lecturer, Ciara Cremin, told the New Zealand website Stuff about Finland’s latest move, “although shops that had gender neutral sections were ‘welcome,’ it was not the shops that were the problem, but an aversion amongst men towards anything feminine.”

Still, while one floor in one Finnish department store can’t single-handedly lead the way on a gender-free revolution, it could be part of a larger shift toward a far less rigid future. Finland has already figured out generous parental leave and universal health care; maybe skirts and tailored suits for everyone are next."
"JohnnyGreig via Getty Images Social media is helping fuel consumerism on an unprecedented scale, especially when it comes to fast fashion, as brands and influencers look to sell us more and more products.

Imagine missing the chance to save humanity from runaway climate change because we couldn’t resist Cardi B-inspired tracksuit pants. The suggestion might seem ridiculous, but our love of stuff is driving us toward environmental catastrophe, from the energy-intensive extraction of raw materials to the pollution of freshwater and greenhouse gas emissions created as we manufacture, transport and dispose of all the things we consume. One of the biggest culprits is fast fashion, the system of rapid production that creates low-cost clothes increasingly treated as disposable. Without reform, the fashion industry (of which fast fashion is the dominant player) could be responsible for a quarter of the Earth’s carbon budget by 2050. The advice is clear — and simple. Keep your current clothes working longer and be more conscious about what you buy. Extending the life of clothes by nine extra months of active use would reduce carbon, water and waste footprints by around 20-30 percent per garment, according to research by U.K. government agency Waste Resources Action Programme. But there is a new force at work fueling consumerism on an unprecedented scale: social media.For digital natives used to stalking social media to track down items, being able to “swipe up” and purchase an outfit worn by someone they follow is intuitive. It works across platforms and across sectors as “influencers” push fast consumption in travel, beauty, food and fitness. There’s one platform that rules. “For me, it’s all about Instagram and it’s all about the influencer,” said Rupert Esdaile, a freelance brand and social media expert. “Fast fashion labels target the audiences where influencers reign. Engaging people on Instagram is key to selling these products and the influencers are the best tool.” This social-first strategy has been like rocket fuel for Fashion Nova, Instagram’s most popular fashion brand whose rise is as eye-catching as its tight-fitting, low-cost clothing. From an original LA store opened in 2006, investment in social strategies has seen the brand amass more than 14 million Instagram followers.

In 2017, Fashion Nova was one of the most Googled brands on the planet alongside luxury behemoths like Gucci and Louis Vuitton that have huge marketing budgets and runway shows. The company introduces 600-900 new pieces each week. While this leaves sustainability experts like me reaching for the smelling salts, it’s a source of pride for CEO Richard Saghian. “There aren’t many companies that are creating clothes as fast as we are,” he has reportedly said. “There aren’t many companies that post on social media every 30 minutes. We bring so many trends every day.” There will soon be more companies like Fashion Nova as other brands emulate this model and increasingly use the micro-influencer — someone who has between 10,000 and 100,000 followers online. We all have the potential to be influencers. “Influencer marketing used to be celebrities — think George Clooney with Nespresso,” said brand expert Esdaile. “Now brands have figured out that the public prefers someone who is a bit more relatable, who we consider a peer. Whatever your size of audience, brands would like to leverage it.” Esdaile said this is often done by brands providing influencers with a discount code that they share with their followers. “Your influence is tracked essentially by the discount code and you earn commission.” Social media platforms like Instagram can distort our reality, said Danielle Wagstaff from Federation University Australia, who studies the psychology of popular social media. “Back in the day, your social circle was formed of friends and family,” she said. “Now, you have access to all of these influencers. That means our perceived social circle is enormous. It would be too exhausting to make a judgment every time you saw a new image of someone from this circle, so cognitively your mind automatically creates an average.” The problem with this average, according to Wagstaff, is that all the images you’re exposed to on social media are highly curated and edited — even no filter, no makeup shots are selected — meaning that the “average” that your brain creates is not a true representation of someone’s lifestyle, attractiveness or income. “If you’re constantly being presented with false information or information that is biased, then your schema [a cognitive representation of your sense of self, other people and products] is biased. It doesn’t represent the real world,” Wagstaff said. At this point, we become susceptible to good old-fashioned FOMO (fear of missing out). It can seem perfectly reasonable to need 12 bikini options for a weekend vacation or put long-haul flights to Bali on a credit card to get some good shots for Insta. What’s more, we are driven to act immediately. Normal values can be overridden by the power of the platform. Other research tells us that the same demographic ramping up consumption through social shopping — millennials and generation Z — are also the ones with finely tuned ecological consciences. Surely some influencers could be diverted from pushing products to protecting the planet? Esdaile thinks this is starting to happen. “Influencers are already reconsidering how their positionas people of influence can affect the world around them. There are some really prominent examples of those who have started to use their platforms as an arsenal for good.” He cites zero-waste vegan chef Max La Manna and model Cameron Russell as standout examples, alongside the fact there are more than 3 million Instagram posts bearing the hashtag #SustainableFashion.

Ilya S. Savenok via Getty Images Model, writer and activist Cameron Russell poses during Glamour Celebrates 2017 Women Of The Year Live Summit at Brooklyn Museum on November 13, 2017 in New York City.

The business model underpinning social media platforms doesn’t make it easy. “I turn down probably 10-20 approachesfrom brands every week,” said New York-based earth activist and sustainable influencer Renee Elizabeth Peters, who has close to 18,000 Instagram followers. “We simply can’t keep consuming in the way that we have done in the past, and that means that I can’t promote consumption.” Peters does still promote brands though, but says the ones she chooses must “be revolutionary or something that I really need and am going to be using authentically.” “Instagram is really good at helping people scratch the surface. And to show people those gateway changes such as using less plastic,” she said. “But the issue is: Once we’ve made all the really easy switches, how do we implement the real changes that need to be made? What do we do about much bigger systematic issues? That’s where the line gets drawn on Instagram because all of those big institutional changes that need to happen.” Recently she expressed these limitations in a post titled: “The Truth Most Sustainable Influencers Won’t Tell You.” In it, she explained that she tried to eliminate single-use plastic from her life and found it much harder than is suggested by the perfectly filled mason jars that dominate the feeds of zero-waste influencers. Peters’ post received more than 1,700 likes, but many followers failed to read the text that explained what she meant. Some worried she was telling them that small actions didn’t count."

"100% Pure Certified Organic Cotton Socks

Slough, United Kingdom - February 4, 2019 /PressCable/ —

In the conventional textile industry fabrics go through more than twenty different finishing processes and most of them wet ones. Once the fabric has been woven, other dyes are added which damage the environment and can result in skin sensitivity. Spraying, fatigue tests, coatings, softeners, anti-crease treatments, anti-microbe treatments, fungicides, antiseptics, enzyme treatments, among many others all of which can affect the skin adversely.

This is why many are turning to organic or eco friendly clothing. The Organic Cotton Colours are comfortable, healthy and respectful with the environment and skin.

Organic Cotton Colours prevent redness, itching, allergies, dermatitis, eczema or any other skin conditions. These skin disorders can be caused from contact with fabrics that have been highly processed with toxic substances. The cotton is totally pure, free from dyes, toxic chemicals and carcinogens.

No chemicals or synthetic products are used in the growing and manufacturing processes of Organic Cotton Colours products. The seeds and plants are free from genetic engineering and pests are controlled by other insects.

Because the Organic Cotton Colours fabrics are not dyed, they come in cotton’s natural colours Ecru ,Brown and Green. In fact most people have the perception that cotton the natural colour of cotton to be white.

This Organic Cotton fabric uses just one washing process to remove the vegetable fats derived from the weaving process.

This is a completely pure and biodegradable textile that follows the ‘cradle to cradle’ philosophy: born from the Earth and returned to the Earth. You can leave any of the Organic Cotton Colours products on the ground and it will end up completely decomposing and forming part of the planet once again.

Non-Transgenic seeds(Non-GMO)

No Irrigation systems, just rainwater

"Stella McCartney is to announce a United Nations fashion industry charter for climate action, which will be launched at next month’s climate talks in Poland.

The designer hopes the charter will “ring some alarm bells” while making a business case for sustainable fashion, setting out a path for collective action to enable low-carbon production methods to be scaled up, improving economic viability. Other signatories to the charter, which will be launched in Katowice on 10 December, have yet to be announced but are known to include several major fast fashion brands.



The charter has been initiated by the UN climate change secretariat. Waste, pollution, deforestation, toxicity in manufacture and carbon-fuelled supply chains combine to make fashion one of the most environmentally damaging industries, and reform is essential if the goals agreed in the Paris climate agreement are to be met.



There are signs consumers are driving a move towards responsible consumption. A report by the fashion search website Lyst, which tracked more than 100m searches over the past year, shows a 47% rise in searches that combine style and ethics, such as “vegan leather” and “organic cotton”.



“We really don’t have long now, to change things. But I honestly believe it’s doable – I couldn’t do what I do if I didn’t believe that,” said McCartney. “There is so much guilt and fear attached to talking about sustainability and that’s not helpful. What is essential is for the big players in the industry to come along with me, because that changes the price point.”

Support for the charter has so far come largely from high street brands. “Fast fashion is responsible for the lion’s share of environmental impact, so they are the most important element in effecting real change,” said McCartney.

But Thursday’s announcement doubles as a recruitment drive for the luxury industry. Between 30 and 40 chief executives of international high fashion brands will be in the audience when McCartney unveils the charter at Voices, an annual fashion industry conference staged by Imran Amed’s Business of Fashion website. “It’s a captive audience of industry leaders,” said Amed. “And that presents an opportunity to convince them to come onboard.”



Convincing industry decision-makers to prioritise sustainability is “not about peer pressure, it’s about making them excited”, said McCartney. “Who wants to talk about this season’s colour or the next It bag? The sustainability conversation is really the only one that I am interested in having. Prospects for lab-grown alternatives to leather are the kind of topics I find sexy now.”

Facing a trend from younger consumers to spend money on experiences rather than clothes, the fashion industry has been resistant to regulations that would make fabric production more expensive. An ethically produced velvet that McCartney hopes to use for next season’s party dresses is priced at £100 a metre because a lack of demand means it is produced in tiny quantities. “There is a reason the fashion industry clings to old-fashioned ways of doing things – it is cheaper and it is easier,” said McCartney. “We can only fix this mess if we work together.”

Sustainability is not immune to trends, and the buzzword in environmental fashion is soil. “We know about the rainforest and about the ocean, but we also need to talk about soil and regenerative agriculture,” said McCartney. Mass production of cotton, the most widely produced fabric on earth, is inflicting huge damage on soil biodiversity.



McCartney will be preceded on stage at the conference by the keynote speaker, Christopher Wylie. The Cambridge Analytica whistleblower will address the growing power of big technology companies, and how the fashion industry interacts with them.

Wylie, who studied for a PhD in fashion trend forecasting at the London School of Economics, told the Observer he drew an analogy between fashion and politics for Steve Bannon, telling him: “Trump is like a pair of Uggs, or Crocs, basically. So how do you get from people thinking ‘Ugh. Totally ugly’, to the moment when everyone is wearing them?”

On Friday, David Pemsel, the chief executive of Guardian Media Group, and John Ridding, the chief executive of the Financial Times, will address digital disruption and new media audiences."
"The construction industry has called on the State’s environmental watchdog to reclassify for recycling and reuse the same kind of demolition rubble which is at the centre of enforcement action on a strategic site in Cork city.

The Construction Industry Federation (CIF) said the situation on the BAM-owned site on Sullivan’s Quay is a “perfect example” of the difficulties that many contractors face in managing “crushed concrete” because there is no place in Cork to process it. The nearest licensed facility is in Waterford.

The CIF confirmed that it has asked the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to reclassify such crushed concrete to give the industry the option of reusing and recycling the material in a more environmentally friendly way.

CIF regional director, Conor O’Connell, said the industry today faces significant problems in the managing of construction and demolition by-products here:

Moving clean soil and stone or crushed concrete is extremely difficult as there are few licensed facilities available to move these products to and the regulations that govern these by-products are confusing and outdated.

“In other European countries there are licensed facilities and regulations that allow the construction industry to reduce, reuse and recycle. The site on Sullivan’s Quay is a perfect example of the difficulties that many contractors face in managing crushed concrete.

""The preferred option of the industry and indeed the correct option for the environment is that these products should be re-used as an aggregate on existing projects but unfortunately, this is not easy or possible due to the current interpretation of the regulations.”

It is understood that the CIT and the Irish Concrete Federation have asked the EPA to designate crushed concrete an “end of waste” product which if approved would allow the industry re-use the material in a manner similar to other EU countries.

“Treating these products as waste is adding significant costs to the construction process and is contrary to good sustainable development practices,” Mr O'Connell said.

“The National Planning Framework seeks for 50% of new development to take place in existing urban locations involving the regeneration of many brownfield sites. This type of development will involve a significant amount of demolition.

""Transporting crushed concrete many miles away from the original site is not sustainable or environmentally good practise. We are hopeful that changes will be introduced shortly to the regulatory process or that it will be accepted by regulators that crushed concrete is a by-product and not waste.""

Cork City Council’s planning department has initiated enforcement proceedings against BAM in relation to the storage of rubble on the Sullivan’s Quay site following the demolition last year of the landmark Revenue building where BAM has planning for a hotel and office block.

In early May, a bulldozer contoured the rubble so that it is not visible over the site hoarding."
"Helping hoarders is a lot more complex than hiring a skip. Instead think self-help books such as Buried in Treasures, online support groups and seeing the GP for a mental health care plan. But what about the rest of us who are not quite hoarders, but are nonetheless dealing with the accumulation and proliferation of too much stuff? There’s a reason why books like Marie Kondo’s The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up have become international bestsellers. I don’t aspire to minimalism but I do yearn for calm and order, so I can enjoy – or even just find ­- the possessions worthy of keeping. I’d really like to be able to have people over without feeling mortified by the state of the house or spending hours throwing all the clutter in boxes and hiding them in the spare room for future-Caitlin to deal with.

I feel that I could stay on top of tidying if I could just once reset to zero and have fantasies of finding a spare $1000 or so to spend on a professional organiser to come and do it with me. When I get overwhelmed by emails, I can select all the emails in my in-box and archive in one go – and then rely on the search tool to help me find emails when I need them in future. Unfortunately there are no such shortcuts for real life. Cartoon showing cluttered room Credit:Judy Horacek For me, there are two things that make it difficult to declutter. The first is obvious: lack of time. Yes, I know I have the same 168 hours a week as everyone else but I work full time and have seven-year-old twins, so a lot of it is taken up by essentials. If I do have spare time, organising the house is a fourth-order priority behind exercising, socialising and reading a good book. The second reason it’s hard to declutter is my environmental conscience. I hate to put things in the bin unless they are broken and can’t be repaired. But rehoming unwanted goods takes time and effort.

To successfully sell something you need to spend time taking a photograph, writing snappy, descriptive ad copy, responding to queries, figuring out prices, queueing at the post office or hanging around waiting for the buyer to come and collect. Even giving things away is no simple task. I love that my neighbourhood has quite a few “street libraries” or “book nooks” – little cabinets dotted around the streets for the purpose of neighbourly book sharing. We also have several charity shops and I often donate clothing, household items and books. The problem is I live in a society where nearly everyone else is addicted to buying new things and the old ""mend and make do"" is very much out of fashion. Sure, my trash can sometimes be someone’s treasure, but not that often. A charity shop is a no-go if something is broken, even just a bit, and they also won’t take electronic items. They don’t want clothes that are stained or torn or missing buttons and even if an outfit is in perfect condition, there’s no guarantee they’ll be able to sell it. Australian households send 299,000 tonnes of leather and textiles to landfill each year, while industry contributes another 457,000 tonnes.

Just the household component alone works out at 13.5 kilograms a year for every man, woman and child in Australia – the waste figures are from the Australian Bureau of Statistics for the 2010-2011 year so I’ve used the population figure for that year too. Loading We’ve added another 3 million people to the national population since then and there’s no evidence we’ve reformed our landfill habits. That means Australian households alone have buried at least 2 million tonnes of leather and textiles in the seven years my children have been alive. And that’s before you even get to plastic toys and the rest. The real solution to our collective clutter problem is to reduce what we bring into our homes in the first place."

Earlier this year, John Lewis announced plans to launch a scheme that buys back unwanted clothing from customers to reduce the 300,000 tonnes of fashion waste going into landfill each year.

The new scheme launches in the new year and means shoppers will be able to earn money on their clothes while also supporting the environment.

And now Primark has announced it's joining in with its own version that will donate unwanted clothes to charity.

Speaking on twitter, the clothing chain said that while they ""have very little unused stock"" there are plans to launch a take-back scheme for consumers next year - where old clothes can be returned and recycled by overseas charities.

A spokesman told The Mirror: ""We can confirm Primark will be launching an in-store customer recycling scheme in 2019. More details will be announced in due course.""

But what other buy back schemes exist and how can you use them to trade in your unwanted items for good?

H&M introduced its recycling scheme back in 2013, and so far, says it's collected more than 17,771 tonnes of textiles — the equivalent of 89 million t-shirts.

The retailer has collection points in their stores worldwide for customers to drop bags of clothes in, regardless of their condition. For every bag you donate (H&M or not), you'll receive a £5 voucher for your next £30 shop.

Interestingly, the H&M group also includes Monki and & Other Stories, which means you can recycle at these stores too.

At Monki, you can drop off your old garments and home textiles - even old towels and sheets - by the cash desk, and get rewarded with a sweet voucher. At & Other Stories it's slightly different. Customers can recycle beauty products instead such as an empty lip stick for a 10% off your next purchase voucher.

Marks & Spencer has joined forced with Oxfam to allow customers to recycle clothes they no longer wear.

Donate an item of M&S labelled clothing or soft furnishings to the charity shop, and you'll receive a voucher for £5 off when you spend £35 in participating M&S stores.

Since the partnership began in 2008, over 28 million garments have been donated in M&S and Oxfam shops, worth an estimated £19 million.

Zara won't pay for your unwanted clothing but it will collect it and donate the items to non-profit organisations. In some cases they'll be recycled or transformed into new fabrics for charities to use.

The clothes don't have to be from Zara and you can also donate footwear, household linens, and even jewellery. The condition does not have to be wearable, either. You can read all about the scheme and find out how it works, here.

Calzedonia Group, which owns Intimissimi also offers a scheme that gives new life to unwanted clothing.

Pop into your local store and put your unwanted clothes, of any brand, in the I:CO container for a voucher.

For every 5 items deposited, you will receive a voucher of £10.00 to use when you spend £50 in stores.

Return any six MAC containers to a store counter or online, and you'll receive a free MAC lipstick of your choice as a thank you.

If you return five clean, used Lush black pots to a high street store, you'll get a free, fresh face mask in return.

It's part of its Black Pot recycling scheme and instead of going to waste, means the pots will go back to the factory where they'll be washed and dried, then melted down to create fresh new pots for future products.

Return any empty Kiehl's full size product to any Kiehl's standalone store in the UK, and collect 1 stamp on a loyalty card. When you've got 10 stamps, you'll receive one free travel-sized product worth up to £9.50."
"MADRID/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chico’s FAS Inc warned in January that it would shutter at least 250 stores across its namesake brand, along with its White House Black Market and Soma labels.

But the U.S. women’s clothing chain is expanding a different storefront - its Chico’s-branded micro site on Amazon.com Inc.

The world’s largest online retailer now sells around 2,300 Chico’s styles, from crease-proof trousers to fine-knit sweaters, representing nearly six times more product offerings than when it started last May, Chico’s told Reuters.

While that growth should entice any retailer, Chico’s is one of a growing number of clothing brands treading carefully.

From Nike Inc and Under Armour Inc to Lands’ End Inc and Levi Strauss & Co, major brands are distributing clothing and accessories directly through Amazon.com, attracted by more than 100 million members of Amazon’s loyalty club Prime and its advanced delivery network.

The risk in this relationship, according to interviews with retailers and industry analysts, comes if Amazon uses real-time data from customer purchases to help it quickly build out its own private label clothing brands, and ends up stealing market share from its current retail partners.

“The word that’s most commonly used with respect to Amazon from a brand perspective, and also retailers to some extent, is ‘frenemy,’” said Kate Delhagen, an independent retail consultant and former senior director of global digital business development at Nike. She had input into Nike’s decision process to partner with Amazon, but left the shoe company shortly before the deal was finalized in July 2017.

Recognizing the concern from retailers, the European Commission has launched a preliminary antitrust investigation into Amazon and whether it might “gain access to competitively sensitive information about competitors’ products which it could use to boost its own retail activities at the expense of third party sellers on its marketplace,” an EU spokesman said.

The company told Reuters it does not use an individual seller’s data to give its private label products an advantage.

It declined to comment on the early-stage probe, or say how many private label clothing brands it had and how fast it was churning out new ones.

A spokeswoman noted that Amazon’s private label products account for about 1 percent of its total retail sales. “Our private brands supplement the great assortment that our selling partners provide,” she said.

A Nike spokeswoman said its business with Amazon continued to perform well, but said the company’s approach was broader than Amazon alone and that it continued to engage with a number of digital marketplaces.

To sell through Amazon, Chico’s and other clothing retailers can either sell product to Amazon in a traditional wholesale relationship or sell directly to consumers as third-party merchants, paying a 17 percent referral fee on clothing and accessories sold.

Retailers pay Amazon extra to store and ship their orders under the ‘fulfillment by Amazon’ model.

Amazon has set a goal of being a leader in the apparel space for around a decade, former Amazon director Mike Pazak told Reuters, and has invested heavily in the sector. It has recently ramped up its own private label apparel brands.

It had 109 of its own brands in clothing, shoes and jewelry categories at the start of 2019, which is more than a five-fold increase over two years, according to TJI Research.

“It’s something we’re aware of and understand the risks,” said George Nahra, senior vice president of strategy, business development and international at Chico’s, which flies executives to Seattle regularly to review the growing Amazon business.

OVERTAKING WALMART

Amazon markets fashion across the world from Brazil to China. It has made its Prime Wardrobe concept, which allows Prime members to order clothing with no upfront charge and free delivery, available in the United States, Britain and Japan.

The online giant has sponsored fashion weeks in the United States, Mexico, Japan and India and has photography studios for fashion shoots in New York, London, Tokyo and New Delhi. It is a patron of the British Fashion Council.

Following an upheaval of consumer habits, which has led to the shuttering of thousands of small apparel stores, Amazon has overtaken Walmart Inc as the most-shopped clothing retailer in the United States, according to a Coresight Research survey.

In Britain, Amazon has outpaced Marks and Spencer Group PLC as the most-shopped clothing retailer, according to an HSBC survey.

Amazon Prime member Abby Kidd bought a pair of Silver brand $80 jeans the first time she used the Prime Wardrobe service.

“I doubt I’ll look anywhere else for jeans as long as Amazon keeps expanding their options,” said the 35-year-old private tutor, based in Oak Harbor, Washington who also shops at chain stores Macy’s Inc and Maurices.

Classic American clothing retailer Lands’ End turned to Amazon more than a year ago when it looked to increase sales after a bruising exit from previous owner Sears.

“We’d be ostriches sticking our heads in the sand if we didn’t take heed and pay attention to where customers are going,” said Sarah Rasmusen, senior vice president of e-commerce at Lands’ End, founded in the 1960s as a mail-order business.

Lands’ End started selling core items such as flannel shirts and down coats on Amazon in February last year as part of its strategy to branch out from troubled Sears stores, where it has lost dozens of retail locations.

Lands’ End’s key swimwear lines compete with Amazon’s Coastal Blue swimwear private label on the site.

Both Chico’s and Lands’ End declined to say what percentage of their sales were made through Amazon, but said the platform was a useful customer acquisition tool that was not drawing clients away from their own e-commerce sites.

A gripe for retailers is that selling on Amazon loses the direct customer relationship they get from their own website or store.

“You don’t know where your customer’s coming from, you don’t know what they’re clicking on once they get to the site,” said Melanie Travis, founder of upmarket swimwear brand Andie who has talked to Amazon, but decided against selling on the platform.

Others are satisfied with the limited data they get from Amazon. For instance, Chico’s gets enough to mail catalogs to new Amazon customers, said senior vice president Nahra.

Canadian shoe retailer Aldo, which deepened its 10-year relationship with Amazon to a wholesale model this year, said it receives more information as a result, such as the basket composition of customers who buy Aldo’s products on Amazon. That allows it to adapt its product offering accordingly.

Slideshow (3 Images)

Insights shared by Amazon can influence how the retailer designs collections, Aldo said. Its products compete with Amazon’s footwear private label The Fix on the platform.

“There’s an interesting partnership you get by selling to Amazon instead of selling through Amazon,” said Justin Cohen, senior director of e-commerce for Aldo North America. “We’re just starting to lean back into that relationship.”"

"Cheap fashion can be just as durable as designer clothing, an expert has said (Isabel Infantes/PA)

Fast-fashion can be just as durable as designer brands, says academic BelfastTelegraph.co.uk Low-cost clothing can prove just as durable and sometimes offers better quality than designer fashion, a study has suggested. https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/uk/fastfashion-can-be-just-as-durable-as-designer-brands-says-academic-37586097.html https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/uk/article37586096.ece/7447b/AUTOCROP/h342/bpanews_7021e552-e629-4eaf-9389-fa36cac2d980_1

Low-cost clothing can prove just as durable and sometimes offers better quality than designer fashion, a study has suggested.

Dr Mark Sumner, a lecturer in fashion and sustainability at the University of Leeds, said so-called fast fashion demonstrated “significantly better value for money” when compared to designer brands following a series of durability tests.

The study was said to have involved testing samples of T-shirts and jeans for seam strength and colourfastness, as well as how easy it was to tear a hole in the fabric or how long it took to rip an item.

Dr Sumner told the Sunday Telegraph: “Jeans from one fashion brand lasted twice as long as designer-label jeans, but cost just a tenth of the price.

“For the T-shirt work the designer label product was the worst performing product across all the tests we did with an online fast fashion brand out-performing all other products.”

Dr Sumner was among the experts asked to give evidence before MPs after concerns were raised about the mountains of inexpensive clothing that were being almost instantly discarded.

There’s no correlation to say that price will give you an indication to say which product will wear out Dr Mark Sumner

The Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) is worried that fast fashion has led to a rise in the amount of clothes being bought, leading to hundreds ofthousands of tonnes of clothing being dumped each year and poor working conditions in UK garment factories.

Dr Sumner told the Telegraph clothes were not necessarily being thrown away because they were poor quality, but because consumers “no longer like them or want them”.

He added: “We know that some clothing will be thrown away because it does actually wear out, but there’s no correlation to say that price will give you an indication to say which product will wear out.”

Expert evidence published by the EAC shows people in the UK buy more new clothes than any other European country – almost double that of consumers in Italy, Germany and the Netherlands – and purchase twice as much as 10 years ago.

"100% Pure Certified Organic Cotton Socks

Slough, United Kingdom - February 4, 2019 /PressCable/ —

In the conventional textile industry fabrics go through more than twenty different finishing processes and most of them wet ones. Once the fabric has been woven, other dyes are added which damage the environment and can result in skin sensitivity. Spraying, fatigue tests, coatings, softeners, anti-crease treatments, anti-microbe treatments, fungicides, antiseptics, enzyme treatments, among many others all of which can affect the skin adversely.

This is why many are turning to organic or eco friendly clothing. The Organic Cotton Colours are comfortable, healthy and respectful with the environment and skin.

Organic Cotton Colours prevent redness, itching, allergies, dermatitis, eczema or any other skin conditions. These skin disorders can be caused from contact with fabrics that have been highly processed with toxic substances. The cotton is totally pure, free from dyes, toxic chemicals and carcinogens.

No chemicals or synthetic products are used in the growing and manufacturing processes of Organic Cotton Colours products. The seeds and plants are free from genetic engineering and pests are controlled by other insects.

Because the Organic Cotton Colours fabrics are not dyed, they come in cotton’s natural colours Ecru ,Brown and Green. In fact most people have the perception that cotton the natural colour of cotton to be white.

This Organic Cotton fabric uses just one washing process to remove the vegetable fats derived from the weaving process.

This is a completely pure and biodegradable textile that follows the ‘cradle to cradle’ philosophy: born from the Earth and returned to the Earth. You can leave any of the Organic Cotton Colours products on the ground and it will end up completely decomposing and forming part of the planet once again.

"Little Yellow Bird is NZs first local, ethical fashion brand

Wellington, Wednesday 29th May: New Zealand fashion brand Little Yellow Bird has been tackling the uniforms, workwear and apparel industry head-on since its establishment in 2015. As of today, claiming a new title, as New Zealand’s first community owned ethical fashion brand.

The company is on a mission to change perceptions and prove that fashion can and should be done with sustainability and ethics as the core focus.

Little Yellow Bird has already exceeded its minimum goal raising over $393,000 with another day still to go until the equity crowdfunding campaign closes to scale up the company. This includes diversifying the product range and exploring new markets. Planned projects include the expansion of a clothes recycling program, which the company sees as a crucial next step for sustainable change in their industry.

“We’re more than just a clothing brand; we’re telling the story about where and how our products are made and are working tirelessly to provide employment opportunities in the communities where our clothes come from,” Jones says.

At only 29 years of age, Samantha Jones has already made waves in the apparel industry. Her company, Little Yellow Bird, a certified B Corp, provides ethical and sustainable workwear, uniforms and apparel. Jones is an Edmund Hillary Fellow has been recognised for her innovative work by numerous organisations, including the Wellington Gold Awards, the New Zealand Women of Influence Awards, Sustainable Business Network Awards and was New Zealand Young Innovator of the Year in 2017.

All of Little Yellow Bird’s factories follow fair-trade guidelines and supply chains are monitored from farm to factory.

Their rain-fed, organic cotton is grown without the use of pesticides or chemicals. Their factories also use zero-waste initiates and the company is continuously working to minimise waste and utilise closed loop systems. Little Yellow Bird’s high-quality garments are made from the world’s best quality rain-fed cotton.

"It may be cheap and on-trend but fast fashion isn’t the answer for cash-strapped students. For Mia Smith, a fashion communication student at Liverpool John Moores University, it’s not an option. “I am strongly aware of the effects fast fashion has on the environment and I believe they’re too catastrophic to ignore,” she says. “More people need to be aware.”

Thanks to our hyper-connected world and ethical fashion movements such as Fashion Revolution, we know more about the industry than ever. We know that garment factories pump toxic chemicals into local rivers, farmers use dangerous pesticides to grow the huge amounts of cotton needed, and thousands of gallons of water are used to make just one T-shirt. “The industry’s dirty secrets are now easily uncovered and once revealed they’re hard to ignore,” says Jessica Donnelly, programme leader of fashion communication and styling at De Montfort University.

And fast fashion not only has a negative impact on people and the environment; it’s also not that great for your bank balance. Our favourite brands encourage us to buy more and more and it all adds up. In fact, we now buy 60% more clothing than we did 15 years ago but keep it for half as long.

Instead of shelling out on new clothes, why not get creative and make the most of what you already own?

Melanie Lehmann, 24, is a third-year student, BA fine art, Central Saint Martins

I started selling clothes I didn’t wear, on Depop 18 months ago, and after about half a year it became a business. I started off looking for stock in charity stores and at car boot sales, and I go back home to Thailand a couple of times a year where there are loads of vintage clothes that are really cheap. Wherever I go, I’ll make sure that I find charity shops or markets to go to. I’ve dedicated two wardrobes just for Depop.

When you take photos, it is best to put the clothes on someone – that’s when people buy them. It doesn’t even take that long – an hour or two to take pictures of everything I have in stock. I don’t upload them right away; Sundays are very good days and I’ll leave quite a bit until payday, because I know instantly there are going to be loads of customers.

I recommend selling your stuff, especially when you’re a student, because you can save the environment and earn money from it. I didn’t know that it would become my business, but I think it’s about taking chances. It started off being pocket money and now it’s helping me pay my rent.

Ethical tips

• Want to update your old jeans? Cut the hems with scissors and pop them in the wash for an instant frayed look.

• Gently run a blunt razor over the surface of knitwear to get rid of bobbles.

• Add fringing to the hem of a skirt, sew patches on to a vintage denim jacket, glue sequins to your sliders or embroider a slogan on to an old T-shirt.

• Dyeing your clothes is a great way to completely transform them. Go for a uniform colour or grab some elastic bands and embrace the tie-dye trend.

• Instead of hiding your repairs, make a feature of them, whether stitching up holes with colourful thread or patching jeans with printed fabric."
"FROM the dust of the Rana Plaza garment factory that collapsed six years ago this week, killing 1,134 people, many of them garment workers, a new co-operative has emerged that is now working with British activists as part of a global solidarity project that challenges the sweatshops industry.

Survivors of the Rana Plaza disaster, among them seasoned Bangladeshi trade unionists, have formed a co-operative called Oporajeo — which means “invincible” in Bengali — and have teamed up with British anti-sweatshop campaign, No Sweat, to produce ethical T-shirts for the British market. More than just another ethical fashion accessory, these T-shirts actively fight sweatshops.

“We are creating a radical circular economy based on workers’ rights and campaigning activism,” said Jay Kerr, activist with No Sweat, a British-based grassroots campaign to end the use of sweatshop labour across the world.

We are importing blank T-shirts to Britain made in co-ops run by former sweatshop workers. In doing so we help them to build their business and escape the exploitation of the sweatshop industry, we then use the profits from the T-shirt sales to help fund unions defending the rights of other garment workers.”

Formed in 2000, No Sweat has spent years protesting outside flagship stores of major brands like Nike and Gap. It helped to expose the east London sweatshops used by Top Shop, and has raised thousands of pounds for workers fighting for their rights.

Oporajeo and No Sweat are taking on worker exploitation in the fashion industry from the inside — by challenging the wholesale stranglehold of the big brands that turn a blind eye to abuses in the clothing supply chain.

The move marks a new departure in “ethical fashion” campaigns by responding to a belief that, while some socially conscious brands prioritise environmental issues, they often pay mere lip service to workers’ rights and consumers remain ignorant.

The Rana Plaza disaster prompted a massive exercise in reputation management among the hundreds of Western brands producing apparel in Bangladesh, and especially international giants like Zara, Mango, Benetton and Walmart that also produced clothing in Rana Plaza.

Sweatshops are common in Bangladesh, where four million garment workers, mostly women, toil in more than 5,000 factories to generate profits for a sector worth over £23 billion, which in turn forms part of the global $3 trillion textile industry.

But while some brands have become more transparent about where they produce, many garment workers still earn less than the minimum wage and are trapped in a cycle of poverty, where human rights abuses and dangerous conditions still persist in factories.

The recent Spice Girls sweatshop scandal shows that even so-called ethical brands can’t guarantee that their products are sweatshop-free.

By sourcing T-shirts made in co-operatives like Oporajeo, No Sweat ensures its T-shirts are made by workers who control their own factories, taking decisions jointly and providing a powerful model of how the garment sector — long notorious for exploitation and bad conditions — could operate.

Oporajeo workers earn a monthly 12,500 taka (£110) wage plus a 50 per cent share of profits which puts them close to the 16,000 taka living wage called for by trade unions and well above the new national minimum wage of 8,000 taka.

Workers also receive 100 per cent payment of all medical bills and education expenses for their children, and co-op profits are even starting to be used to fund local environmental projects.

Oporajeo’s success has upset a number of the local sweatshop bosses in Bangladesh, in 2015 its factory caught fire under suspicious circumstances — but true to its name the co-op has continued and gone from strength to strength.

Kazi Monir Hossain, one of the founders of Oporajeo, said: “All of us at Oporajeo are equal: we are workers and we make our decisions together and ensure we all benefit. Making clothes for No Sweat means our work can help other garment workers fight for their rights and share the benefits.”

No Sweat has already provided T-shirts to a number of bands, campaign groups and trade unions, including for the GMB’s recent Amazon campaign.

“By doing this we can adapt to new demands, reach sustainability goals and be able to set new standards for fashion.”

Rosen added that the Council is putting “the past to rest” and instead focusing on creating tools and platforms that will help support and prepare the industry for the future.

“Stepping away from the conventional Fashion Week model has been a difficult, but much considered decision,” said Jennie Rosen, CEO of the Swedish Fashion Council.

The announcement follows ongoing conversations surrounding the demise of fashion week and whether its usual format of putting on shows to buyers and the media still makes sense for most brands.

In recent years, the industry has been in a constant state of flux with a string of designers, such as Burberry, Tom Ford and Tommy Hilfiger, choosing to ditch the traditional fashion week model in favour of a “see now, buy now” strategy, in which their runway collections are available to purchase immediately.

Furthermore, the digital era we find ourselves in is now offering young designers more efficient and affordable ways to promote their labels and set themselves apart from the crowd using tools like social media.

As a result, the question as to whether brands, regardless of their size, rely on stage shows and presentations in the same way anymore is more pressing than ever before.

While the future of fashion week as a whole remains in the balance, the Swedish Fashion Council said it plans to reveal its new strategy later this year and will also relaunch its Fashion Talents incubator program which assists emerging brands in developing their business."

"Trending Lesela is a new shopping app for local fashion

Lesela

Available for free on Google Play, coming to the iStore soon

. . . . -

A new local app is linking African designers directly to consumers. On Lesela (an adjective meaning cloth in Sesotho and Swahili), you can shop for all the best fashion and accessories from established and emerging talent.

The app features design houses including African Revolution Clothing, Fluidity Clothing, Lunar, Sabali Fashion House and Apex Active Apparel, and you can get the items delivered to your door.

Created by entrepreneurial couple Andile Tshuma and Mamello Khantsi, the idea is to boost commerce on the continent.

Khantsi says: “We believe in the potential of our African fashion industry. We believe that fashion is an expression of who we are as a people, and in giving fashion designers the platform to express themselves, and show their work and their representative backgrounds with little interruption from existing, large, often multinational organisations that tend to overshadow them.”

The app is easy to download and use, but the ranges are still quite limited as some brands don’t have their products available yet.

I used the app on a Samsung J1, and some of the images appeared a little stretched on my screen. Nevertheless, we’re sure Lesela will iron out any kinks in the weeks to come, and the most important part – adding your new fashion to your cart and checking out – worked like a dream.

There’s a particularly striking headpiece on there by Nutcase ACTS made completely out of zips that will be scooped up quickly. Viva local fashion!"

Two Cents’ Worth: Refashioning NZ’s rag trade

This week's business podcast looks at some of the economic pressures facing NZ's increasingly volatile fashion industry

New Zealand-made fashion is becoming increasingly unaffordable.

Our clothing manufacturers are facing growing pressure over sustainable fashion and calls for transparency around where our clothes are made.

The result is the closure of outlets as they cave under major competition from online shopping markets and international clothing giants.

Stephen Blase, the managing director of independent clothing manufacturer, The Pattern Table, has diversified. He’s now making items like tracksuits, leotards and babywear.

Adaptability and diversification has been the key to The Pattern Table’s success, since its launch four years ago.

“We’re only a small factory,” said Blase, “What we’re good at is being versatile.”

“We kind of do a little bit of everything in here. And that’s how we survive in a market that’s relatively difficult to work in.”

The Pattern Table, absorbed the Figaro sportswear company which has been around since the 70s, and it’s now one of the last remaining factories in NZ that makes garments from start to finish.

In the industry this is called CMT or Cut, Make and Trim. Blase said they do everything from cutting pattern blocks, to sourcing fabrics, sewing samples and doing production runs for mainly mid to high end fashion labels including Paris Georgia and womenswear label Harman Grubisa.

He said CMTs were very common in the late 90s, early 2000s.

“This establishment used to be a sportswear specialist factory and in its heyday there were 50 machinists, there was a screen printer and an embroiderer. But with the Chinese revolution, everything went off shore and it’s not sustained anymore.”

Nowadays NZ manufacturing is highly niche, said Blase.

“You’ve got the fabric suppliers, silk suppliers, wool suppliers and then you have contract cutters, contract sewers and then there’s me and one other business that does buttons and buttonholes.”

And the thing is, tapping into all these niche businesses or even making something new from scratch in New Zealand is not cheap.

Even if it has cost Blase $200 to make a coat, it will be sold wholesale for $400 and then the retailer puts three or four times on it. The coat ends up costing $1000.

“That’s just the cost of manufacturing locally.”

Which doesn’t stake up when people are more than happy to go to a chain store and buy a t-shirt for $10.

In comparison, for a nice shirt with all the bells and whistles Blase estimates you’re looking at 2 hours of sewing.

“That’s 40 or 50 dollars of labour in the shirt. We can charge at the most $40 an hour because if it’s more than that, the garment is not worth what it’s worth anymore. What the staff can do in here is pretty incredible. It’s just not worth what it’s worth,” he said.

This is how shipping production offshore becomes more feasible, as long as you’re transparent about it.

Blase believes people are willing to spend a bit more buying New Zealand made, they just have to trust it is locally made.

Which sounds appealing but has its own challenges.

The industry is also facing a significant skill shortage and Blase said growing emerging talent is difficult because there’s no margin for training people and there is no room for error when the cost of producing a garment is so high.

“Every year, there’s a thousand kids graduating from tech schools and sewing schools. They can make a garment ok, but they can’t make it as fast and as good as we need them to in here,” he said.

He is watching the changes in the industry closely as many of the skilled workers are aging and none of the new graduates want to be machinists, they all want to be designers.

Sue Prescott is a senior lecturer in Fashion at Massey University and she agrees the current industry isn’t sustainable and because of the limited opportunities here, fashion graduates are likely to head offshore.

But with a downsizing industry, Prescott said it is very hard for new graduates.

“People always need to be looking for niche areas. But people are also looking for new and innovative ways, they’re setting up small businesses and there are fewer Cut, Make and Trim factories and some machinists are very scarce, so people are looking for different ways to do things,” said Prescott.

She would like to see the government reinvest in training students in craftsmanship and artisanal practices.

“All those lovely slow methods and the beauty that comes from those. So, in the ideal world it would be wonderful to see a return to that.”

But even she admits that’s probably a long way off.

"She was named the world's No. 1 model in January this year.

So it came as no surprise on Monday when Australian supermodel Adut Akech was announced as the ambassador for Melbourne Fashion Week.

The 19-year-old will be the face of the Victorian fashion event, now in its 25th year.

Catwalk commander! Sudanese-Australian supermodel Adut Akech (pictured) was announced as ambassador for Melbourne Fashion Week on Monday

Melbourne Mayor Sally Capp made the announcement on Monday.

The event will go for nine days and will feature more than 300 designers.

Adut said: 'I am super excited to be back home and to be back in Melbourne and be involved. It has almost been four years since I last did a Fashion Week here so I am really looking forward to seeing what everybody's going to showcase.'

Excited: Adut said, 'I am super excited to be back home and to be back in Melbourne and be involved. It has almost been four years since I last did a Fashion Week here so I am really looking forward to seeing what everybody's going to showcase'

'I love the clothing. It's things that I feel I can wear on a daily [basis] and that's what I'm really looking forward to the most,' she added.

'It's going to be a chilled, fun Fashion Week.'

Adut has walked the runway for major international brands, including Chanel, Dior, Prada and Burberry.

Fans of the Australian-Sudanese beauty will be delighted with the news, just months after Adut was named the world's top model at the Models.com Industry Awards.

Success has not come easy for the Adut, however, as she has struggled with anxiety and depression for years.

Taking to Instagram on New Year's Day this year, Adut revealed that she cried every morning and night in 2018.

'I'm learning to handle it better now but it's a daily struggle and not every day is a ''good'' day,' she wrote.

'Every single day of my life in 2018 was a challenge, filled with some serious obstacles to overcome.

'I would wake up every morning crying but put the biggest smile on my face and tried my hardest to push through the day pretending I was fine, then I'd come home and cry some more and go to sleep.'"
"Much of the clothing comes from charitable donations in wealthy countries. The garments are shipped in colourful containers. Once they arrive, they are sorted, repacked and sold in ever smaller bales.

Impact on local textile industry

While the imports provide affordable clothing for poor consumers, they have also undermined local textile manufacturing industries. Some countries have tried to control the trade. Last year the East African Community, an intergovernmental organisation of six countries in the African Great Lakes region, placed high tariffs on second-hand clothing imports with the intention of banning them by 2019.

The organisation hoped to protect and foster local textile manufacturing industries. The Office of the US Trade Representative threatened to kick the countries out of the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act if they did not remove the tariffs. Only Rwanda maintained the trade restrictions, and in March the United States announced it would suspend the country from the preferential trade deal.

Nigeria has long banned second-hand clothing imports. But this has only shifted demand. Used clothing is smuggled into Nigeria, and in Lomé, Nigerians dominate the resale industry.

Amah Ayivi, a designer and clothing dealer in Paris, displays his vintage collection from Togo at an upscale showroom in Paris. NYT

Victor Chukwu, a Nigerian who has worked in Togo since 1983, has a boutique in the market and a warehouse nearby packed to the ceiling with sacks of karate uniforms and engineer wear. At the storeroom, Ayivi covered his mouth with a bandanna to protect from the dust, while Chukwu's employees clambered atop the piled sacks looking for buried treasures.

""Careful, careful, careful! They are heavy!"" Chukwu shouted. One sack rolled down the mound, a spare Santa hat poking out the top, and Chukwu fell back into the sacks, treating them like a giant pillow mound, laughing. ""Fashion is always bringing back the old thing,"" he said.

﻿Exposing fashion's excesses

Marché Noir includes vintage pieces, a selection of African handicrafts and original women's and menswear designs. For women he selects funky silk dresses and skirts. For men he has a penchant for uniforms: military, work wear and boxy denim, which he sometimes prints with his logo.

""It used to be Marché Noir Paris, now it's Lomé-Paris,"" Ayivi said. ""I changed because as I'm working here a lot, I want to keep the African identity."" Lomé is where his business is registered, and it's where the vast majority of his vintage garments come from – even the French ones. But he makes his money in France.

During Paris Men's Fashion Week in March, Ayivi assembled his goods inside the Supermarket, a concept space in the chic Marais neighbourhood. Like the market rows in Lomé, the streets of the Marais in Paris are tight alleyways. But in Paris, juice bars and cafes stand in for beverage hawkers, the roads are cobblestone instead of dirt and concrete, and the displays are contained behind glinting glass vitrines.

Passers-by observed while Ayivi installed the shop. He and a couple of assistants steamed rumpled garments and hung vintage nightgowns and screen-printed denim jackets alongside batakali tunics of Ayivi's own design. They stacked Moroccan rugs, leather bags, Tuareg rings and plastic woven basket bags.

Downstairs was a small speak-easy, a red-lit cellar with textiles and Malick Sidibe photographs on the walls, and a record player atop dated speakers, playing Bob Marley and Manu Dibango.

Ayivi frames his participation in fashion as commentary on consumerism. ""Fashion is too fast,"" he said. ""Overproducing. We have to think about how to create a style with what we have.""

The clothes he carries back to Europe make visible normally unseen global supply chains, the spidery pathways clothing takes after it is discarded. ""I bring them back to prove, to show that the fashion industry is too much, is going too far,"" he said.

Marché Noir's business model feeds on this overproduction. The clothes are cheap where he buys them. The pieces change value as they change context. In Lomé, the vintage coveralls he seeks are dated, out of fashion. In Paris, they are modern and stylish. He is preparing another pop-up for Paris Fashion Week in September.

The African touch

Ayivi's globally sourced garments reflect a life lived between countries. ""I want to bring this African touch also. For me the African touch is not just about African fabric or African dresses,"" he said. ""In Africa I find a lot of style in the street. The kids in the streets, the women selling fish, they have this touch of style you don't find everywhere. This inspires us.""

He calls it ""Afro aestheticism"". The reclamation of traditional African cloth into contemporary design is a growing movement across the continent and diaspora. Maki Oh is a successful Nigerian designer who incorporates traditional dyeing techniques and layers local stories and meanings into her line. MaXhosa by Laduma is a South African brand doing similar work incorporating traditional Xhosa aesthetics into knitwear.

"All too often, sustainability is treated as a one-off topic, rather than a practice to be embraced by all

When Amy McCranor got her first job in fashion, she didn’t like what she saw. During a trial period at an e-commerce fashion brand, she witnessed a rapid turnover of unhappy staff, garments sewn with competitors’ labels entered into the inventory, and stock priced at impossibly low figures. So exploitative were overseas manufacturing costs that anything priced over £5 brought in a comfortable profit for the company.

It all caused her to question whether she had a place in the fashion industry at all. “I think it’s wrong,” McCranor says. “It’s a minefield for fashion graduates because you just think, how can I do what I want without feeling like a hypocrite? And I really did feel like one being there.” McCranor left the brand and sought opportunities beyond fashion. “I’ve worked out what I stand for morally, ethically, creatively,” she says. “I can now take a stand early on in my career.”

Despite assumptions that Generations Y and Z are poised to save the planet, many students – like McCranor – embark upon their degrees unaware of the harm fast fashion does. They have little knowledge of the excessive water usage, or the many deaths of garment workers. Campaigns for industry reform, such as Fashion Revolution, deploy Instagram-friendly fact graphics and hashtags, yet the message doesn’t seem to be getting through.

It’s down to universities, then, to educate them on sustainability. The UK is the world’s top destination for fashion students, readying thousands of young people to enter into the £66bn industry each year. But as sustainability shifts into the spotlight, are universities ready to lead the charge for a healthier, fairer industry?

There is no curriculum that dictates the content of fashion degrees. While freedom in teaching at universities is important, the variation between fashion courses can create a stumbling block where sustainability is concerned. While one lecturer may consider it vital to educate students on child labour or water pollution, another may choose to skip it entirely.

The result is a disparity in students’ knowledge. “In the whole first year, we had one lecture on sustainability and ethics,” says fashion communication student Ruth MacGilp. “In the second year, I had various discussions with teaching staff about it, but a lot of the time I was educating them on the topic.”

Meanwhile, MA student Niamh Carr, who studies at Manchester Fashion Institute, says sustainable thinking and awareness of ethics were built into each of her modules and upheld by staff in their teaching.

Other current approaches to sustainability include working with donated surplus fabrics, experimenting with zero-waste pattern cutting and making fewer, higher quality garments. Lecturers are questioning and challenging the ethics of the fast fashion supply chain. The trouble is, these practices aren’t uniform across the UK.

All too often, sustainability is taught in the form of a one-off, optional module, and it’s treated as a market sector, rather than a practice to be embraced at all points of the chain. Students are keen to avoid pigeonholing their portfolios, explaining that they “did” sustainability for their last project.

It’s an understandable stance when you consider how the issue is presented within the media students consume. Eco collections, one-off sustainability magazine issues and consumer-focused campaigns for change imply that the fashion world and sustainability are mutually exclusive.

For lecturers working hard to address sustainability within their teaching, the present fashion economy cannot be ignored. Part of their job is to get their students industry-ready. Graduate employability affects university rankings, and, while fees remain high, students expect a return on their investment.

McCranor left the fashion industry – but could she not have wrought change from within? Fiona Armstrong-Gibbs, a senior fashion lecturer at Liverpool John Moores University, believes that’s asking too much right now.

“Graduates aged 21 or 22 are in a vulnerable position,” she says. “I don’t think we should be putting that on their shoulders to be seen to openly challenge it because they have to earn a living, they have to build a career. I think it’s our responsibility.”

Universities are beginning to take on that mantle. But there is some way to go: from wastage targets and the closer scrutiny of brands universities partner with, to equipping students with a thorough understanding of the the supply chain. And the strongest foundation for this? Sustainability, embedded as practice from day one, is the only answer.

"For years, the Instagram account was anonymous and a little mysterious.

Noihsaf Bazaar became a hub for women to resell their high-end clothing and accessories from mostly independent, women-led labels. Things that you’d imagine a gallery owner might wear. Thousands of women followed the addictive stream, buying and selling, then tens of thousands. The feed was curated, that much was clear. But who was doing the curating?

Then, a few months ago, a face appeared.

“What up, Noihsaf!” Kate Lindello said. “You’re probably wondering who I am.”

Sporting a gray Carhartt beanie and beautifully arched brows, Lindello introduced herself and told the story of how Noihsaf Bazaar began — not in Los Angeles or New York City but in Duluth, during a dark winter. At first, she posted her own items to the account. Then friends joined in, selling their frocks and clogs.

“We never made it private,” Lindello said by phone, “and it kept growing.”

Today, some 22,000 people follow the feed. On an average week, it gets more than 2 million impressions, Lindello said.

The account is filled with floral, bohemian dresses from Dôen, pleated pants from Ilana Kohn and mules from Rachel Comey. No “fast fashion” allowed. Each item is picked and posted by Lindello, a 35-year-old stylist whose eye for emerging designers and passion for sustainable fashion created Instagram’s most covetable resale account.

All from northern Minnesota.

“I don’t want Noihsaf to be this precious style site,” she said. “I want it to be an organic tool for seeing, finding and cultivating style ... whether you live in the middle of nowhere, a metropolis or a suburb.”

Her business is part of a larger push against cheaply made, mass-market clothes from the likes of Zara, in favor of small-batch brands such as Maryam Nassir Zadeh. Those independent brands can be pricey, but buying them secondhand makes them more affordable.

Noihsaf Bazaar has “captured the desire for a very specific audience, to find what they’re looking for in a way that’s becoming much more difficult at brick-and-mortar consignment and resale stores because of what fast fashion has done,” said Gretchen Jones, a New York City-based business adviser and former fashion designer.

That audience has a strong aesthetic, Jones added: “elevated contemporary hipster.”

Count Jones, who won the eighth season of “Project Runway,” among its devotees. She’s bought and sold on Noihsaf and, just last week, nabbed a tough-to-find jumpsuit from Horses Atelier, a small Canadian clothing label founded by two best friends.

‘A special community’

In 2013, Lindello had a pair of Rachel Comey flats that didn’t quite fit. The brand was high-end but little-known — especially in Duluth.

This was amid a dark winter there, in more than one sense. There had been dozens of below-zero days in a row. Lindello had left her job to be home with her daughter and, in the weeks after her birth, was overcome with postpartum depression. “It was the most painful, debilitating, deep sadness,” she later wrote, “on top of feeling like I had electricity running through my veins.”

After therapy and medication and time, Lindello was feeling better, but a little off. She remembers thinking: “What am I doing with my life?”

The idea for Noihsaf came to her in the kitchen, she told followers in a recent series of 10-second videos. She posted the Comey flats and some clothes on Instagram, where friends she made via her fashion blog had recently migrated. “And, on a freezing-ass winter day in Minnesota, Noihsaf Bazaar was born.” Then she shared a fact that blew some followers’ minds: “If you haven’t caught on, Noihsaf is backwards for fashion.”

For two years, it was free. Lindello just got first dibs. (Her best score? A vintage Dior jacket.) As its popularity grew, Lindello charged a small seller’s fee for her time — $1.80 per item at first, then $2.80.

She started sister accounts for vintage clothes, menswear, kids and more, selecting friends to run them. But she’s still the sole curator of the main account, picking items she loves from brands she loves.

Lindello’s style is integral to Noihsaf Bazaar’s success, said Annika Kaplan, a Minneapolis jewelry designer whose work occasionally pops up on the account, which she considers a compliment.

“She’s into clothes and fashion, but in an irreverent and funny, approachable way,” Kaplan noted. Because Lindello likes to have beautiful things around her, “she created a platform for those things to come to her, and for other people to trade in those things, too. And I think that’s really cool.”

When Lindello posted giveaways last fall, Kaplan donated one of her friendship rings, a gold, textured bauble. It made sense, she said, since “Kate got one of the first ones I ever made.”

Unlike other Instagram giveaways, Noihsaf did not require people to “follow” or “repost” or “tag two friends.” (She wanted it to feel like a true thank-you, she said. No strings attached.) Lindello refuses to promote her account — or even spend money to market it.

For a while, rules like “no hashtags, please” actually discouraged people from finding Noihsaf. “I wanted to keep it on the DL a little bit,” she said. “So it’s grown slow and steady but totally organically.”

Women hear about it — via a podcast they love, a style website they follow, a fashionable friend. It’s the answer to the question “Where did you get that jacket?” The brag behind a cult item find. Often, on one of Noihsaf’s posts, someone will tag a friend and say, “This is the account I told you about.” It’s become a kind of refrain.

“People are really exhausted of being oversold to,” said Rita Mehta, creator of the website the American Edit and head of merchandising and retail strategies for the Minneapolis Institute of Art. Noihsaf feels different, she said. “It’s not a secret. But it feels like a special community that you’re a part of.”

Staying sustainable

Noihsaf’s motto, if you can call it that, is “bleeding your feed since 2013.”

Each day, dozens of photos pop up on the Instagram account, which can be overwhelming for a follower. Still, Lindello could post more. Stuff she likes, stuff that would fit. But she knows there’s a limit to the form: “Instagram itself was never meant for this sort of thing,” she said.

The selling process, too, is imperfect: A buyer nabs an item by posting her ZIP code in a comment, communicating with the seller via direct message and arranging payment via PayPal. There’s no searching for a particular size or brand. Plus, posting daily means that Lindello is on her phone a lot. Too much.

Noihsaf has become “a full-on business” and Lindello’s full-time focus. Together, some 43,000 items sold across the accounts last year. She’s working on launching an e-commerce site, streamlined and searchable, and is meeting with potential investors in the next few weeks. The fee would stay low. The fashion would remain hand-picked.

“The end goal, the highest priority, is to keep it curated — and harness this community it’s grown,” Lindello said. “It’s never going to turn into a Poshmark,” a popular resale app. “It’s going to stay focused on these independent and boutique lines.”

Doree Shafrir first heard about Noihsaf Bazaar from “a friend who always has cool clothes.”

The account inspired the author and “Forever35” podcast host as she worked to shift her wardrobe to sustainably made clothing. “It exposed me to fashion brands I had never heard of,” Shafrir said. It offered her a place to buy secondhand, the most sustainable option of all, and to sell, paring down her closet.

Other sites, such as Poshmark, have a robust feedback system, “so that if someone does screw you over,” you have recourse, Shafrir said. Noihsaf doesn’t boast the same sort of public mechanism. But selling via the account has demonstrated to Shafrir that “for the most part, people are good,” she said. “By and large, it’s a very trustworthy community.”

Selling also introduced her to Lindello. After submitting her items, she got an e-mail back with instructions, including where to send the $2.80 fee.

“I was like, ‘Who’s Kathryn Lindello?’ and I googled her,” she said. “Up until that point, I didn’t know if this was a collective or what. ... I love that it was this woman who thought: I’m going to start this thing.”"

"Londoner Jenessa Olson has always loved clothes, but she distinctly remembers the moment she realized her love of cheap fashion came at a cost.

It was 2013, and Olson's undergraduate business ethics course was discussing the Rana Plaza building collapse. The industrial disaster killed 1,100 people, many of whom were garment factory workers for fast fashion brands like Joe Fresh.

Olson says she walked out of class 'heartbroken.'

""I've always loved fashion, I've always loved being on top of the latest trends. But I was like, 'How is my demand for a $15 trendy t-shirt worth somebody's life?'"" said Olson, now 27.

That moment was the germ of an idea that's grown into STMNT, a clothing rental start-up that Olson launched with her sister, Madison, this year. The aim is to reduce demand for fast fashion—without denying shoppers the pleasures of a new outfit—by helping them find pre-existing garments in other people's closets, Olson said.

""It's a way for people to participate in conscious consumption, by decreasing the demand for new items [and] increasing access to items that are already out there,"" she said.

Officially, the business is now just three weeks old, and has so far operated largely through Instagram transactions and a 'pop-up' shop, according to Madison Olson, 24.

At the first STMNT pop-up, renters met in-person to sift through racks of garments, and booked clothing in advance of future social engagements. The day before the event, they'll pick their new-to-them outfit up at STMNT's headquarters at Somerville House on Western University campus, then bring it back the next day.

""It is really making income off the clothes that are literally just hanging in your closet,"" said Madison Olson.

So far, 'about half' of STMNT users have been sorority girls, who typically have about six to 10 events in the month of November alone, Jenessa Olson said.

""That is a lot of outfits,"" she said.

And while not everyone's social calendar may be quite so full, Jenessa Olson said STMNT has also seen demand from other demographics, like young professionals and moms.

""Basically people that don't have time to shop and look for new things, because they have super busy schedules and they have financial accountability to their families and their businesses,"" she said.

""So they have been a big market that we weren't initially anticipating would be so big.""

Next step: going mobile

""The fast fashion industry is one of the biggest polluters, one of the biggest contributors to global warming around the world,"" said Madison Olson. She hopes STMNT will help reduce demand for fast fashion by pairing shoppers with clothes that are already out there. (Paula Duhatschek/CBC)

Given the current time of year, the business' focus has so far been on Christmas and New Year's outfits, but the sisters say they have broader aspirations.

In the works for 2019 is a STMNT app, similar to AirBNB, that will ultimately serve as the main platform for the business. Lenders will post photos of their garments online, and organize their clothing hand-offs independently.

STMNT earns money and pays for overhead charges, like app development and dry cleaning, by tacking on a 15 per cent administration fee, Jenessa Olson said. They also enforce a strict ""you break it, you buy it policy"" for damaged garments.

Although Jenessa said the business is turning a profit, it is also primarily self-funded (""Madison and I dipped into the wedding funds. We're both eloping!"" she said).

Jenessa works on the business full time, and Madison works part-time while finishing her degree. The staff also includes six other employees, who either work on a volunteer basis or on commission, although Jenessa said the aim is, ultimately, to pay them.

Citing the recent explosion of sharing economy platforms like Uber and AirBNB, Jenessa said she's confident STMNT will do alright.

""When we talk about being a business that doesn't own any inventory, and you give the rap sheet of these massive companies that are the behemoths of our time, it really hits home with people,"" she said."
"MILAN (Reuters) - Italy’s fashion elite and celebrities such as film stars Cate Blanchett, Julianne Moore and Colin Firth gathered at a “green-carpet” event on Sunday at Milan’s fashion week to urge greater environmental sustainability in the global fashion industry.

The black-tie gathering was the closing event to the city’s six-day fashion extravaganza, a week after London’s fashion week declared itself fur-free for the first time.

Fashion brands have begun paying more attention to their companies’ impact on the environment and their production methods as customers are becoming increasingly ecologically aware in their choices.

A total of 13 awards were handed out at the second edition of the ‘Green Carpet fashion Awards’, promoted by Italy’s national fashion association, CNMI, and sustainability consultancy Eco-Age, founded and directed by Italian film producer Livia Firth, the wife of Colin Firth.

“Fashion can be very beautiful and lucrative, but to be here for a real purpose for me is important,” model Elle Macpherson said.

Winners, who have demonstrated commitment to and investment in change, included McPherson and the cobblers of fashion house Salvatore Ferragamo SpA.

Colin Firth told Reuters that the event, held at Milan’s La Scala opera house, meant that the message could spread and “inspire all sorts of other people”.

Moore said she was impressed by the commitment of everyone in the fashion industry toward sustainability, with people “really taking responsibility.”

“No one industry can tackle climate change and the sustainability issue by itself,” Blanchett said, adding the fashion industry, however, was influential enough to spearhead change.

CNMI President Carlo Capasa said sustainability was not just about fur but upgrading rules on the use of chemicals, recycling, production methods and work conditions.

The CNMI is drawing up a set of guidelines, some of which are already published on its website.

A growing number of luxury groups, including Versace, Gucci and Armani, have given up fur in their collections. Others are finding new techniques to make their supply chains more green, including dying techniques and recycling.

“Sustainability is important as it is the future. There is only one way forward”, Livia Firth said, adding that fashion companies had to look to sustainability to be profitable in the long run.

But brands, producers, designers and industry experts agreed the process was initially costly and would take time.

“You have to start somewhere ... (it) takes years (and) you can’t change overnight, but you have to start, be courageous and have a vision,” Livia Firth added."

"Most New Zealand fashion retailers are doing a good job of looking after the people who make their clothes, but some brands have work to do.

Department store Farmers was among those who got a poor ranking in this year's Ethical Fashion report by relief and development groups Tearfund and Baptist World Aid Australia.

Farmers is one of 10 New Zealand retailers to receive an F or D ranking for supply chain transparency, worker rights and policies to prevent child and forced labour. Others include Baby City, Trelise Cooper, World and Merric.

One hundred and thirty companies were graded by Tearfund on their ethical supply and manufacturing practices.

Three of the top five graded companies were from New Zealand, with seven local retailers achieving A grades in this year's report, compared with five a year earlier.

One myth about the gradings is that companies which did not directly engage with the research automatically received a low ranking. In fact, some companies which did not engage still received reasonably high scores, such as Karen Walker, which got a B grade, and Barkers which received a C+.

In the past year, said Tearfund, about 38 per cent of companies had improved their overall grading.

Tearfund education and advocacy manager Claire Hart said many brands had progressed in the areas of gender equality, transparency, responsible purchasing and practices to combat child and forced labour.

""The fashion industry is only moving in one direction when it comes to this, it is moving towards visibility, transparency and care of workers, and companies that aren't on that journey ... are going to be outliers very soon,"" Hart said.

She said it was wrong to assume that more expensive garments were associated with better work practices. ""The companies that sit in lower grades, you've got everyone from high-end designers through to companies that sell very cheap clothing,"" she said.

""You have companies like Cotton On that grade in the A range and they have quite a cheap price point ... any type of company, size, price point, can create good systems to protect workers.""

Retail and brand specialist Jill Brinsdon said consumers today expected more from the companies they did business with, but many people weren't as concerned about ethics in the clothing industry as they were in others such as food.

""Fashion is unfortunately still quite disposable,"" Brinsdon said.

The F grades

Farmers chief financial officer Michael Power said he believed the company received its low grade because it chose not to take part in the survey. Trelise Cooper also said this was the reason behind her F grading.

""Farmers operates all of its business in an ethical manner and is committed to improving social, ethical and environmental standards throughout its supply chain and in all aspects of its operations,"" Power said.

But Hart said: ""Farmers ... choose not to engage in the research and they also make very minimal public disclosures, which means we are unable to find out any information about what is going on in their supply chains.""

The Herald has approached 3 Wise Men, Baby City and Merric, which all received a F grading, for comment. It also contacted World, Hunting & Fishing NZ and Kate Sylvester, which received D grades, for comment.

Kate Sylvester was unable to answer the Herald's questions but said it had chosen not to participate in the research and therefore got a ""poor score"".

""Whilst this survey goes towards creating a positive, broad brushstrokes framework for responsible practice, we feel it has limitations for small, boutique fashion businesses.""

Kate Sylvester said it was instead working on Mindful Fashion New Zealand, an initiative it co-founded to support the local garment industry.

A representative of T&T said the retailer did not participate in the research conducted by Tearfund and that it was satisfied its suppliers operated in an ethical manner and in accordance with stricter European standards.

""T&T supports the objective of ethical supply chains, but does not agree with the form of the Tearfund survey which has allocated a negative grade without any evidence that T&T is not operating an ethical supply chain,"" it said.

""T&T is extremely proud of its business practices and the contribution it has made in New Zealand for many decades.""

Rising among the ranks

Nature Baby was recognised as the highest performing new company to be part of the research.

Co-founder Georgia Faull said the company was proud of the result. ""Being one of the smallest companies in the survey and being scored highly reflects what we have been doing and focusing on for the last 20 years.

New Zealand's largest retailer, The Warehouse, scored a B- grade this year, up from last year's C rating.

Tania Benyon, chief executive office of sourcing at The Warehouse, said the retailer was pleased its efforts had been recognised. ""Over the past 12 months, we have joined new worker welfare initiatives like Nirapon in Bangladesh, HER Project in Bangladesh, and the Responsible Workplace and Recruitment programme in Malaysia,"" Benyon said.

Whilst this survey goes towards creating a positive, broad brushstrokes framework for responsible practice, we feel it has limitations for small, boutique fashion businesses.

Karen Walker, which received a B grade, said it chose not to participate in the research because it believed it could use its resources in a more effective way.

""By not participating in the survey, we've been given a grade by Tearfund solely based on what information was available online at the time of grading. The grade is therefore Tearfund's evaluation of information online and is not a complete representation of our ethical standards or our social responsibility programme.""

Barkers, which again scored C+ in this year's survey, said the grading did not reflect its efforts to be an ethical retailer and it had recently put out its first ever annual transparency report.

Outdoor clothing retailer Macpac which received a B- grading said in the past year it had increased the percentage of Bluesign approved fabrics it used in its products and had joined the Sustainable Apparel Coalition, which gives it access to tools that can help measure the impact of our products and practices.

Cotton On Group general manager Alice Polglase said the retail company was happy with the A grade it received.

""We really hope that this provides customers with confidence when they decide to purchase a product... knowing that there is a commitment to doing good behind our good value products,"" Polglase said.

Clothing retailer Kowtow, which received among the highest of gradings for its ethical practices, said it was proud of its A+ grade.

""As designers, we're responsible for the entire lifetime of a garment, and that starts with the conditions of how it was made,"" Kowtow founder and director Gosia Piatek said.

""Our entire collection is made without putting worker safety or the environment at risk, which goes to show the future of fashion is ethical and sustainable.""

• An earlier version of this story wrongly stated T&T was approached for comment. The company has since provided a response, which is now included in the story."
"Walmart.com is further burnishing its ambition as an affordable go-to fashion retailer by embracing the e-commerce trend of customizable subscription boxes.

But instead of elbowing into the crowded women’s apparel subscription arena, the discount giant is delivering upmarket kids’ clothes—such as C&C California dresses, BGBG pants, and Puma hoodies—through a partnership with Kidbox, announced earlier this week.

“We’ve been working very hard to make Walmart.com a destination for fashion,” Denise Incandela, Walmart’s head of Fashion Group for U.S. e-commerce, tells Fortune.

Consumers can receive four to five kids clothing items for $48 a box, up to six times a year. A stylist, without charge, picks the clothes based on results of a child’s Kidbox personality quiz, as well as their favorite color, aesthetic preferences, time of year, location, and size (0 to 14 for girls, and 0 to 16 for boys). Kidbox is bringing a roster of 120 designers to the partnership, some of which overlap with brands Walmart.com already carries, but many of which are new to the retailer’s offerings.

In plotting Walmart.com’s fashion renaissance, “we started with women,” says Incandela, who joined the company in the fall of 2017, bringing high-end fashion credentials such as president of Ralph Lauren Global Business and its consumer insights management, and earlier as EVP at Saks Fifth Avenue for marketing and president of Saks Direct, launching Saks.com.

Incandela began tapping into the influencer market, introducing online shoppers to hundreds of new brands through partnerships with companies like Lord & Taylor or new, exclusively online clothing, such as Sofia Vergara’s recent denim launch.

“Now we are leaning into kids,” she said.

And while Walmart.com’s fashion overhaul is similar to what the company has undertaken at its stores to attract more fashion focused, middle-class shoppers, Inclandela noted, the online “objective is to materially expand our product assortment beyond what we offer in the stores,” which is better known for having value items.

“Because we don’t have real estate constraints online, we can go well beyond the value product into the good, better, best,” she said. “And our customers have told us that they are open to those good, better best price points.”

Winning the Kids Fashion Frontier

Why kids?

“Kids make sense,” says Marshal Cohen, The NPD Group’s chief industry adviser for retail, in an email to Fortune. “They always outgrow or out wear their clothes a lot faster than adults.”

Kickbox started in 2015 and its first apparel season was back-to-school 2016. It’s received $28 million in venture capital funding as of April 2018.

“Even in the day of smartphones and Xboxes kids still love to receive things in the mail,” Kidbox CEO Miki Berardelli explains to Fortune. “And millennial consumers”—parents—”are very much an on-demand consumer.”

The market for children’s clothing, like other apparel, is exceedingly competitive, even more so since Gymboree’s January bankruptcy and closing of its 900 stores. That’s left a market gap for big box retailers, e-commerce giants, and niche markets to fill.

“With Amazon pushing to become the leading apparel retailer, Walmart is responding by continuing their drive to acquire the customer segment focused on kids’ apparel,” said Tyler Higgins, retail practice chief of consultancy AArete, in an interview with Fortune.

“With Walmart’s competitive position of low price, they are now able to add brands kids and parents know, along with style advice, to gather greater market share,” Higgins says. “The dynamics are quickly changing as parents continue to trust clothing from retailers such as Target and Walmart, and finding themselves not needing to make special trips to youth-focused retailers for clothing alone.”

Kidbox’s regular subscription costs $98, which is $50 more than at Walmart.com, but it includes more items—seven to eight, instead of four to five from the retailer, and allows customers to try on the items prior to paying.

Berardelli said that Incandela “knows her customers” and the $48 Kidbox price for Walmart.com was the right threshold to test the concept.

However, Incandela said Walmart.com’s Kidbox apparel could eventually have a $98 price range on Walmart-owned Jet.com.

Breaking Into The Box

According to a 2018 McKinsey & Company survey, the subscription box industry has grown by more than 100% in the last year, with revenues jumping to $2.6 billion in 2016 from $57 million in 2011.

Although Walmart launched a $5 quarterly Beauty Box in 2014 that delivers makeup and product samples, this is Walmart’s first foray into the highly saturated subscription box apparel model.

And while there is competition in the children’s subscription services, Higgins said the niche remains relatively “untapped.”

High fashion clothing rental company Rent the Runway announced the launch of Rent the Runway Kids earlier this month and Foot Locker took a minority stake in kids subscription box Rockets of Awesome in February.

There’s also Stitch Fix Kids, which charges a $20 per box styling fee and sends consumers eight to 12 items between $10 and $35 each, which can be partially returned or entirely kept for a 25% total discount. (As a company, Stitch Fix also has faced recent market slumps over worries about its ability to compete with Amazon.)

Although Kidbox allows consumers to trade individual items due to incorrect size or style, they are required to either relinquish the whole box for a refund or keep the entire box—and then choose one out of four charities to donate new clothing to as part of the company’s social mission.

“The most diversified customers I’ve ever seen”

There are similarities between Walmart’s and Kidbox’s customers.

“We were delighted in our first few meetings that we have very similar customer bases from a geographic and socioeconomic perspective,” Berardelli said. “I like to say we are building a brand for the heartbeat in the country. And while we have strong customer bases on the coasts, our strongest base is in middle America.”

Unable to give specifics, Berardelli noted that Kidbox has “the most diversified customers I’ve ever seen” in terms of race, location, and socioeconomic status, ranging from $50,000 per year households to families that fall in the $250k and up bracket. (Prior to joining Kidbox as CEO, she held executive positions at Chico’s FAS, Tory Burch, and Ralph Lauren.)

Kidbox says it has a 1.5 million-person “community of consumers,” which includes customers and members of its email lists and social following.

This partnership has the potential to increase both Walmart.com’s and Kidbox’s reach.

“If we go back to Walmart we have over 100 million unique viewers visit on our site every month,” Incandela said. “One reason why we’re on path to improve is that there’s a huge opportunity to capture more of their share of wallet.”

As is reflected with this new endeavor, Incandela said one way Walmart.com plans to do this is by “playing offense with strategic partnerships.”"

"Fashion in modern times has put the spotlight on the value of artisanal creations and sustainability. This is proven by the endless trade and trunk shows that showcase a plethora of outstanding creations that are currently challenging fast fashion.

Tela, the new David in the local landscape of retail Goliaths, is not just another brand that offers RTWs. The refreshing brand exemplifies the essence of modern fashion — style with relevance — as it focuses on imperative issues like sustainability.

Tela is all about a collective effort of collaborations. It has three collections: Revive, Renew and Refresh.

Revive honors the tradition of weaving by using up-cycled fabrics (woven by the Argao community in Cebu, through the assistance of Anthill fabric gallery) from the Bayo Foundation. Basically, clothing company Bayo donates its scraps to its foundation, which sends these to the Argao community for weaving. Tela is the first brand to purchase fabrics from Bayo Foundation.

Renew is a collection that also uses textile scraps. The collection is in collaboration with Retaso, a sustainable brand that uses fabric to make furniture.

The proceeds from both the Revive and Renew collections will directly benefit the Bayo Foundation and Bye Bye Plastic Bags.

Alyssa Lagon.

The third collection Refresh uses fabrication with natural fibers.

“I partner with like-minded people to create unique items that are ethically and sustainably made. It is important for me to be part of a movement that aims to generate a more conscious generation,” says 19-year-old visionary Alyssa Lagon, owner of Tela.

Alyssa belongs to the future of fashion, what with her vision, purpose and relevance.

She adds, “I want not just to be part of it but to build a brand that can help make a bigger community for a more sustainable future. Even the tiniest detail matters with a lot of consciousness. Our hang tags are made out of seed paper, which you can plant. Our packaging was made by a community in Payatas to help support their livelihood program.”

Fashion is not new for this third year Communications Technology Management student from the Ateneo de Manila University. She grew up looking forward to going to their factories as her parents own Bayo, one of biggest names in retail fashion industry.

Alyssa says, “Seeing for myself how a simple piece of cloth can transform into something I would be proud of wearing, really excites me. The process is so interesting especially when one becomes part of the entire production chain, including the design process.”

But fashion with a purpose isn’t just a genius of creativity and collaboration but it also has a big heart. More so, deeply instilled in her are precious values that her modest parents imparted to her.

“I also saw how my parents made sure that our people felt important. Seeing how well they regarded our employees with respect, appreciation and how they shared values of hard work and compassion to them made my whole experience complete.

“I was taught to find what motivates me and use that as a driving force to achieve my goal. In search for that, I needed to find a compelling purpose that will give more meaning to what I will do,” she says.

Set to study in Paris as an exchange student for a semester, Alyssa is armed with a vision of a genius, heritage history of retail and heart of gold as she prepares Tela for the world of fashion consciousness wherein every integral part is important.

“It’s not just a business but a way of life, not only for our family but also for the community who becomes part of it,” she concludes.

(Tela, the new sustainable Filipino fashion label with a heart, will be launched on Aug. 13, 2 p.m. at the Palmera Room, Manila House, 8/F Net Park Building, 5th Avenue, Bonifacio Global City. Beginning Aug. 18, Alyssa will do a one-month pop-up in Manila House. After the pop-up, she plans to continue to sell the clothes on Instagram.)"
"MILAN/PARIS (Reuters) - Fur trimmings were scarce on the past month’s spring catwalk collections in Milan and Paris, but the two leading luxury centers are some way off following London Fashion Week in going fur-free.

Some top brands are resisting pressure from animal rights groups and more environmentally sensitive consumers, fuelling an industry debate that is far from played out.

Britain’s Burberry and Kering’s Gucci are among the latest household names to abandon fur.

Yet Fendi for instance - the Rome-based, LVMH-owned brand famed for its luxurious coats - is holding its ground on what is one of its signature traits.

“It’s part of our history... and everyone is free to make their choices,” Silvia Venturini Fendi, one of two creative directors at the Rome-based brand, told Reuters before the Milan catwalk show.

Others prefer to sit on the fence.

France’s Hermes said last month it had made no decision, and Prada dropped fur from advertising campaigns and shows to discourage demand but not from all its clothes, even if usage is minimal.

PLENTY OF PYTHON

Luxury online retailer Yoox Net-A-Porter has also abandoned fur, and Los Angeles moved in September to outlaw its sale and manufacture within the city limits.

Few are yet to ditch the use of exotic skins like crocodile, however - less of a hot-button issue among consumers, but just as controversial for campaigners, even if some manufacturers have invested in their own farms to improve breeding conditions.

At Gucci’s Paris show, snake skins came in trouser and dress form, while Kering’s Saint Laurent channeled python boots. In Milan, snake skin ran through collections at Cavalli.

Anissa Putois, France spokeswoman for animals rights group PETA, said it wanted brands to ditch all types of animal skins, but that its anti-fur campaigns had been the most successful.

“Leather is the real impact on the industry,” said vegan-friendly British designer Stella McCartney after presenting her brand’s collection in Paris on Monday.

“Anything is better than nothing though.” The next fashion weeks focused on winter would be the real test of the fur-free movement, she said.

But with sustainability the buzzword for many in fashion, some have argued fur could be more eco-friendly than some synthetic materials, and pushed for pelts not to be wasted.

“If we look at sustainability seriously... it is better to use leather and fur from the food chain rather than dumping them in a landfill,” said Carlo Capasa, President of Italy’s national fashion association CNMI said, stressing a regulatory framework was needed."
"A girl who was given life-saving open heart surgery at the age of just two has taken the fashion world by storm after she walked at New York and London Fashion week.

Freya Ingham, eight, from Manchester, overcame the insecurities she had about a six-inch (15cm) scar on her chest following surgery in 2013 to fix a hole in her heart - and now asks photographers not to airbrush it out of images.

Her mother, Claire Ingham, kick-started her career when she spotted a page on Instagram looking for child models last year.

Freya Ingham, eight, from Manchester pictured on the catwalk at London Fashion Week has a six inch (15cm) scar on her chest as a result of the surgery, which she use to 'pick at' but has learned to accept

Freya (pictured in London Fashion Week) has now modelled for small designer brands called House of Ikons, Me Clothing, Eye Candy. She wasn't paid for any of her shows but got to keep the clothes

The scar the youngster used to try and 'peel off' is now something she's proud of, says mum Claire, and the family ask photographers not to airbrush it from modelling photos

The opportunity led to Freya appearing in her first ever modelling show at London Fashion Week in September. Soon after, she was asked to walk in New York Fashion Week too.

Claire, who is a primary school teacher, said: 'Freya is wise beyond her years, she tells people she got her scars for being a brave girl when they ask how she got it.

'When she was younger she'd try to peel it off, when we went on holiday we would put plasters to cover it when she was in her swimsuit so people wouldn't ask questions.

'When people saw the scar, they'd go up to her and ask to touch it, it really bothered her.

Freya, pictured as a newborn, was in her first ever modelling show at London Fashion Week in September, after needing life-saving open-heart surgery as an infant

Freya Ingham, eight, from Manchester, was born with a hole in her heart and needed life-saving surgery aged just two. Last month, aged eight, she modelled in New York Fashion Week (pictured)

'Her insecurity got worse when she realised other kids didn't have scars on their chests when she was changing for PE in school.

'During both shows in London and New York in February, it was just amazing to see her on the runway, she was so proud of herself.

'I'm so proud of her too, it makes me happy to see how much her confidence has boosted, she wants people to know that she got her scar for being a brave girl, she's an inspiration.

Freya's mother Claire Ingham kick-started her modelling career when she spotted a page on Instagram looking for child models last year, it took her to London Fashion Week (pictured in September getting her make-up done) and New York last month

Keen to make the most of her journey, Freya saw the sights in New York when she went there to model last month (pictured in front of the Statue of Liberty)

'I always tell the photographers not to airbrush her scars if they ask, she's very proud of it.'

Freya has now modelled for small designer brands called House of Ikons, Me Clothing, Eye Candy.

She was not paid for appearing on the catwalk but was able to keep the clothes by the British and American designers.

In the lead up to the event, she practised perfecting her walk and poses for the runway in her living room at home.

Her dad, Phil Ingham, 42, her twin brother Alex, who was not born with the same condition and older brother Dylan, 13, did not attend her shows because of the costs but they supported her from home.

Phil said: 'Freya wants to share the message that you can still be beautiful with a scar or even if you're slightly different.

"If you want to lessen your impact on the environment, domestic changes add up

I’m expecting two visitors this afternoon. One of them is Kate Haines, an environmentalist who runs greenfinder.co.uk, a website that salutes the most eco-friendly products on the market.

The other is the delivery man who’s dropping off a thick parcel of cheap clothes I bought online the other day, a transaction through which I’ve supported both the fossil fuels industry and the fast fashion industry. This could be embarrassing. I nervously check the delivery email. Yep: it’s this afternoon. Gulp.

An hour later, the doorbell rings. I dash downstairs – it’s the delivery man. “Thank you,” I say. Thank God, I think...."
"Ringly was another American wearables brand that targeted stylish women, in this case with a range of cocktail rings featuring semi-precious stones and smart connectivity. They stopped production in 2018.

The most famous failure-to-launch in this category is Google Glass, which came out in 2013 (although only for a chosen few), then fizzled out two years later amid criticisms that it was pointless, expensive and uncool. (In 2014, the New York Post ran a story titled ""The Revolt Against Google Glassholes"".)

Levi's turn with Google has garnered a much warmer reception. Although not without its limitations – you still need your smartphone to operate it – the general consensus is that the textile innovation is exciting. Also, the smart jacket looks as cool as an analogue jacket because they are essentially the same design. The Trucker is a classic Levi's denim style; it's just that this one has been pimped with a panel of connective copper wiring on one sleeve, powered by a tag with a battery in it (yes, you need to keep it charged) and controlled by an app.

According to IDTechEX, the wearables sector is predicted to be worth $US150 billion ($209 billion) by 2027. That includes devices such as the Apple Watch, which Business Insider reported last year is now outselling the entire Swiss watch industry; fitness trackers such as Fitbit; and wearable medical gadgets that can help diagnose and assist with managing health conditions. While the fashion segment gets more than its share of attention, success stories likes the Commuter remain uncommon.

Serious fun

Dillinger, who spearheaded the Levi's project, is a charismatic visionary, with big ideas about what the future of fashion and tech might look like, and the ways in which brands can engage with it. He's at a fashion expo in Los Angeles, where his team is showcasing the Commuter Trucker jacket to the delight of the crowds. If you've never come across it before, this thing is seriously fun.

Not just any jacket: the Levi’s Commuter Trucker can hail an Uber and control music.

""It understands pressure and speed,"" explains Dillinger. ""It has a little computer that interprets the stimulants on the individual yarns, and turns those gestures into meaning. Through Bluetooth, your phone can then translate these gestures into actions."" Like summoning a ride, telling the time or playing music.

""When we started to teach our retail associates about it, the first thing they did was figure out how to take over the speakers and start DJ-ing,"" says Dillinger. ""We'd been busy thinking about functionality; it never occurred to us that this kind of play would appeal to people.""

But do we really need our clothing to be clever? We have Siri and Alexa at our beck and call, and a whole world of smartphone apps to help us find everything from love to directions. So what do wearables add? What do these new-gen smart clothes actually mean, and how might they reshape the fashion industry as we know it?

Beyond the catwalk

Ruth Marshall-Johnson is a London-based futurist, researcher and consultant. She's excited about the possibilities of smart woven materials but says, ""I think where it's going is that wearables will be able to collect and analyse data, and from that data, brands will be able to develop services that go beyond the product or garment they sell you.

Couture meets computing: models at Chanel’s Spring/Summer 2017 show. Estrop

""It's part of a bigger mindset shift we're going through,"" she continues. ""Fashion is not just about identity, fun and cultural expression in a purely physical way any more. We have different expectations. We've moved into a realm that's both physical and digital. We're looking for our products to be functional, economical and sustainable.""

ArtificiaI intelligence and machine learning offer solutions we're only beginning to understand the scope of. ""At the moment, I feel like it's architecture that's leading this,"" says Marshall-Johnson. ""Smart cities and buildings are using data and sensors to manage things like pollution filters and lighting. How cool will it be when we figure out how to change the scale, and apply that to the clothes we put on every day?""

Matthew Drinkwater heads up the Fashion Innovation Agency at London College of Fashion. ""Tech is becoming fundamental to the fashion industry, and it's gone way beyond placing it on a catwalk,"" he says. ""It has to have a purpose the customer can identify with, though. When you consider buying a dress or suit, you don't tend to ask, 'What can it do?' ""

Cross-industry collaborations

Drinkwater agrees with Marshall-Johnson that it's the data capture element that makes these innovations so appealing to brands and investors. ""The potential upside for retailers is beginning to understand things like: how do you wear something? When do you stop wearing it? What does that then allow the brand to do in terms of modifying their production, and tailoring their offering to you?

The Apple Watch is outselling the entire Swiss watch industry.

""From a consumer upside, I think we need to work out what is the benefit beyond showing off in the pub. Does this garment become a potential platform for services? If you've stopped wearing it because it's developed a hole, for example, is there a repair service that could be attached to it?

""The fashion and tech worlds used to be very disconnected, but that's changing,"" says Drinkwater. ""What's interesting is when they work together to create new systems and ways of designing, accessing and enjoying clothes. There's growing excitement around cross-industry collaboration today – I think that's where the business opportunities lie.""

Natasha Franck is the New York-based cofounder of EON, a circular economy company that works with Microsoft and uses radio-frequency identification (RFID) tagging to create unique digital IDs for fashion products. The goal is to better enable traceability, recommerce and recycling.

Franck was working in urban planning in Shanghai and Beijing when the idea of using the Internet of Things to track assets in the fashion supply chain occurred to her.

Ringly targeted stylish women with a range of cocktail rings featuring semi-precious stones and smart connectivity.

""We can create the equivalent of product 'birth certificates' or 'passports' that encode information about where and how a product is made, its material content, country of origin, and also things like the chemical content and info about the dyeing process which you need in order to recycle a product like denim efficiently,"" she explains.

It doesn't work in isolation, though. In April, EON will announce its first brand partners for an industry-wide collaboration.

""Fashion design is still driven by beauty, functionality, fabric and craft,"" says Franck. ""I think of the tech as supporting different modes of consumption and changing the patterns of consumption, not changing the design of the product. Applying tech to the fashion business model is to me more exciting – using it to allow consumers to have new and different relationships to products."""
"Shoppers have vowed to ditch fast fashion after watching Stacey Dooley's 'mind blowing' documentary on the toll cheap clothes has had on the environment.

Stacey, 31, revealed how an entire sea has disappeared due to cotton farming in Uzbekistan on BBC show Fashion's Dirty Secrets - with viewers admitting they were 'shocked'.

The documentary maker also looked at how the fashion industry is one of the top five most polluting industries in the world, with chemical waste being a major issue.

Viewers quickly took to Twitter to comment on the revelations from the programme, including many who said their attitudes towards shopping will now change.

Shoppers have vowed to ditch fast fashion after watching Stacey Dooley's 'shocking' new documentary Fashion's Dirty Secrets. Stacey is pictured at the site of the Aral Sea in Kazakhstan, which has dried up due to cotton farming

One wrote: 'I literally have so many things I need to change. stop impulse buying clothes because I can and watch where I'm buying from'.

Another added: 'How have I got to 45 years and NEVER heard of the demise of the Aral Sea? This is incredible! A whole sea gone in less than 40 years, for what? Bloody clothes!!'

Many shoppers said their eyes have been opened by the documentary, which showed the devastating impact the fashion industry has had on the environment.

One viewer commented: 'Crazy how much we are ruining the world and we don't even know it... @StaceyDooley schooling us again'.

Viewers vowed to change their shopping habits after watching the programme, with one commenting 'Our species needs to wake up'

During the programme, Stacey visited the site of the Aral Sea - situated between Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan - which has nearly completely dried up since the 1960s due to cotton farming.

'The main rivers feeding the Aral have been diverted, primarily to provide water for giant cotton farms,' she explained.

'Today, the region is producing so much cotton that this river is drained before it reaches the sea.'

Spotting a camel while driving across the sea bed, Stacey said: 'I feel like this portrays perfectly what’s gone on. There used to be fish, tens and thousands of fish, and now there’s a camel.'

Stacey also visited Indonesia, where she discovered the impact that pollution from clothing factories is having on the Citarum River

Viewers praised the documentary for being 'eye-opening', with one questioning 'Who knew any of this stuff???????'

She added: 'Where I’m stood now, I would be at the bottom of the sea bed. And there would be sea all around me.'

During the show, viewers discovered that it can take over 15,000 litres of water to produce the cotton needed to make a pair of jeans.

Stacey also visited Indonesia, where she discovered the impact that chemical waste from clothing factories is having on the Citarum River.

'To me, this feels like a complete catastrophe, and it's worth bearing in mind that Indonesia isn’t even in the top five [of clothing manufacturing countries] globally,' she said.

'It fills me with dread. It’s hard to think that the clothes I’m wearing could do so much damage, but I now see how the industry is such a threat to the planet.'

"Miami-based label Chromat debuted a new line of swimwear made from recycled plastics. Credit:Sipa USA Alysha Buss, a curator at Sydney's Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences says consumers are more empowered than ever. “I do think consumers are now holding fashion brands to higher standards and calling them out on social media when they don’t act responsibly – a recent example being the uproar around Burberry burning unsold stock,” she says. What’s more, brands who don’t engage with ethical fashion and social issues risk becoming the worst thing possible in fashion: irrelevant. In its 2019 State of Fashion report, the influential fashion news website Business of Fashion said 2019 would be the turning point for brands when it comes to being socially aware. “Younger generations’ passion for social and environmental causes has reached critical mass, causing brands to become more fundamentally purpose driven to attract both consumers and talent,” the report noted.

The wokeness is everywhere, from the Duchess of Sussex wearing sustainable sneaker brand Veja during the Australian Royal Tour last year, to the rise of genderless fashion at luxury houses such as Louis Vuitton, to Tiffany & Co donating $1.4 million to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation last year. Not all wokeness is equal though. In March 2018, the millennial-skewed website Refinery29 invented a sort of “Bechdel test” (the famous test invented by illustrator Alison Bechdel to measure whether a movie is sexist) to compare the influx of brands designing International Women’s Day capsule collections that year. Younger generations’ passion for social and environmental causes has reached critical mass Business of Fashion The editors wanted to see which brands were actually putting their money where their slogan T-shirt was by donating at least 20 per cent of profits or supporting gender parity all year around. The answer was: not many. However, the fact that formerly crunchy ideas such as feminism, sustainability and ethical fashion have become go-to for fashion marketing teams signals a change. While style has long represented the mood of the time — sexual liberation and mini-skirts in the 60s, say, and Diane von Furstenberg revolutionising the new working woman's wardrobe with her wrap-dress in the 70s, the fashion industry buy-in today feels especially right for now.

When Anna Wintour, editor-in-chief of US Vogue and fashion’s official gatekeeper denounced tennis great Margaret Court’s homophobia and Prime Minister Scott Morrison's record on LGBTQ rights in a speech during the Australian Open in January, she reinforced the idea that it has become acceptable, if not chic, for fashion to engage with hot-button societal and political issues. Loading Graeme Lewsey, the CEO of the Virgin Australia Melbourne Fashion Festival (VAMFF), Australia’s largest consumer fashion festival, says Wintour’s impassioned speech was a “sign of the times”. Lewsey has worked in the fashion industry for decades and says he doesn’t recognise the industry now “and thank goodness for that”. Examples of this change, he says, include the diversity of models that casting agents are scouting, the increased interest in sustainability and the positive reaction to the diverse models VAMFF showcases on its runways. He says feedback from attendees at the festival is that they want their communities to be represented - whether in race, gender fluidity and body shape. And, while he acknowledges the festival (and the fashion industry) isn’t perfect, this change, even though for some it remains token, is positive and something that should be continually worked on. “We have to keep the conversation going and keep championing for better,” he says.

One of the biggest conversations in this space is around sustainability. Loading Global fashion search platform Lyst reports searches for ethical fashion surged 47 per cent in 2018. Many of the luxury brands have banned fur in recent years, and celebrities such as actress Emma Watson have become quasi-evangelists when it comes to ethical fashion. Sandra Capponi is the co-founder of app Good On You, which helps consumers find brands operating ethically and now has 200,000 users. Capponi says she’s seen an increase in consumer interest in sustainable and ethical fashion. “There’s a huge movement to make fashion more ethical and sustainable, especially in the last year or two,” she says.

Capponi says this is evident in the work of designers such as Bianca Spender, who manufactures her clothes in Australia, uses ""dead stock"" and recycled fabrics, is accredited by Ethical Clothing Australia and has worked with ethical fashion brand The Social Outfit on a capsule collection made with refugee and new migrant sewers. Other examples, she says, include the increasing use of sustainable materials such as Econyl [a Nylon made from recycled plastics], and the growing influence of global industry events such as the Copenhagen Fashion Summit. Dubbed the ""Davos of fashion"", this year the summit marks its 10th anniversary as one of the world's leading sustainable fashion business events. A piece from Byron Bay label Spell and the Gypsy Collective. ""We’re hearing about new ethical brands and initiatives just about every day, and there’s a real sense that it’s not only necessary but desirable to reduce the impact of fashion and wind back the excesses of fast fashion.” Elizabeth Abegg, one half of cult Byron Bay label Spell and the Gypsy Collective, has been on a long road of sustainability and ethical accreditation, and taking her customers along for the ride.

She warns against tokenism in the fashion industry when it comes to sounding off about sustainability and ethical fashion. “I think greenwashing is a huge obstacle to overcome … in everyone’s rush to brand themselves as remotely ethical it’s easy to make broad-brushstroke statements without the data to back it up,"" she says. ""So there’s a lot of consumer education that needs to happen too. Loading “I think over the next five to 10 years it’s going to become more critical for brands to be more transparent about their supply chain and their environmental impacts. When you consider how far sustainability has moved up the agenda over the last, even two years, it’s quite astounding. I do think there may be a stronger focus on environmental sustainability as the planet continues to deteriorate, but the social and environmental go hand in hand.” However Abegg believes the movement has moved beyond a trend and that fashion has the ability to empower. “It’s here to stay. I guess that’s why we’re so keen to speak loud and proud about our journey, because the more brands that shine a light on their supply chain, the more mainstream it will become.” Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences' Buss agrees fashion’s wokeness can go beyond slogan T-shirts and lip service.

“Fashion can engage in social issues and contribute in positive, meaningful ways, especially when it is a core part of a brand’s identity and business model,” she says. “Take for example Outland Denim, whose jeans are made by Cambodian women who have been rescued from sexual exploitation and human trafficking. Outland Denim aims to train and equip these women and for the positive effects to flow on to their families and community.”"

It was meant to be simple - Boss Brewing, based in Swansea, had only applied to trademark its name.

But rather than spending £300 to make sure no one could copy their branding, they've ended up shelling out nearly £10,000 defending itself in a four-month legal battle against international fashion titan Hugo Boss.

As a result entire pallets of their best-selling beer have been re-labelled and all their branded clothing merchandise binned.

""This has been a horrible experience, and so stressful,"" brewery co-owner Sarah John said.

""We have worked so hard to create all of this and what should have been a simple process ended up making us question whether everything was going to be OK going forward in the future and whether we were going to lose everything.""

After months of negotiations, it was resolved that the names of the brewery's award-winning beers, Boss Black, and Boss Boss, which is one of its highest selling products in supermarkets, would have to change.

Boss Black will now become known as Boss Brewing Black, whilst Boss Boss will become Boss Bossy.

Oh, and the brewery can't sell branded clothing anymore either.

Sarah revealed how the brewery currently had pallets worth of Boss Black, which they would have to go through and change the labels of. They will also have to get rid of hats and t-shirts.

""At the moment we are investing in a new bottling line and that money wasted in legal fees could have been invested in new kit,"" Sarah said.

""I understand brand identity, you have to look after your brand. But I think it's a bit unnecessary that this massive clothing company has gone after a small brewery.""

A spokeswoman for Hugo Boss said they took action because of a potential ""conflict and potential misunderstanding"" between the high-end, international fashion brand and the beermakers from Swansea.

""Following the brewery’s application to register a trademark, we approached them regarding the use of BOSS in relation to two beer names in the portfolio,"" she said.

""This was to avoid conflict and potential misunderstanding regarding the brands BOSS and BOSS Black, which had been used by the brewery but are (longstanding) trademarks of our company.

""The discussions clarified the situation in respect of these two brands as well as in relation to textile merchandising for the future.

""The brewery is able to proceed with the majority of their products without impact on their current branding."""
"British Fashion Council says LFW in September will be first of big fashion weeks to ditch animal fur

London has become the first of the main fashion weeks to ditch animal fur in its shows after the British Fashion Council (BFC) said none of the designers participating on the official schedule would be using it.

The BFC made the announcement after carrying out a survey asking designers if they planned on using fur in their shows, and comes after rising numbers of anti-fur protesters demonstrating at London fashion week (LFW), from 25 in 2016 to more than 250 last September.

The council’s chief executive, Caroline Rush, said the 100% fur-free event this month “highlights a trend we have seen over the past few years, with more and more brands deciding to use alternative materials to fur”.

One such brand is Burberry, which announced it had implemented a fur-free policy before the debut of its new creative director, Riccardo Tisci, at LFW, with all remaining fur items being phased out. “I don’t think it is compatible with modern luxury and with the environment in which we live, and Riccardo has a very strong view as well on this,” its chief executive, Marco Gobbetti, told the Business of Fashion. “It’s part of what Burberry is today.”

Wendy Higgins, the director of international media at Humane Society International UK, said the organisation first met Burberry almost a decade ago to urge the company to drop fur.

“Most British consumers don’t want anything to do with the cruelty of fur and so this is absolutely the right decision by this quintessentially British brand. And as fashion week kicks off in New York, Burberry’s compassionate stance couldn’t have come at a better time, sending a strong message to designers like Prada still using fur, who are looking more and more isolated and outdated by the day.”

This week, the animal rights group Peta published an open letter by the singer Paloma Faith to the BFC’s recently appointed chair, Stephanie Phair, asking her to take a stand on behalf of the organisation and introduce a fur-free policy.

“The BFC shouldn’t be endorsing a material whose production is deemed so cruel that it is outlawed in the UK,” she wrote, referring to the ban on fur farming which was implemented in the UK in 2003, despite the import of animal fur remaining legal.

Rush says although “as an organisation we believe in the rights of people and animals and encourage designers to make ethical choices”, the BFC has not implemented a complete ban as it does “not define or control the creative process of the designers” showing their collections. “Using fur is not illegal in the UK and it needs to come down to the choice of both the designer and ultimately the consumer.”

The survey is a part of the BFC’s positive fashion initiative, designed to encourage designers and business to consider sustainability, equality and diversity, and craftsmanship and community in their processes. Rush says its results show the industry is “seeing a cultural change based on ideals and choices made within brands”.

“The fur dialogue is ongoing and the stance of brands such as Burberry, Stella McCartney, Gucci, Yoox Net-A-Porter, Versace and Vivienne Westwood, among others, to look at alternative options to fur will encourage more brands to consider what options are available to them.”

Concerns surrounding the environmental impact of sourcing alternatives to animal fur, such as synthetic faux fur, continue to be one of the most pressing issues to stem from the shift by the industry. After news that Helsinki fashion week was banning leather last month, Rachael Stott, the senior creative researcher at The Future Laboratory, told the Guardian “animal-free doesn’t automatically mean guilt-free”.

“[Animal-free alternatives] can give rise to low-value synthetic alternatives [which] harbours its own environmental and ethical issues,” she said. “The manufacturing processes used to create these involve toxic chemicals and cause pollution in surrounding rivers and landfill sites.

“Currently there is currently no safe way to produce or dispose of PVC products, therefore consumers can be misled into thinking ‘vegan’ is entirely environmentally friendly.”

In an effort to help designers trace their fabric supply chain, the BFC established the British high-end manufacturers database in 2017, an open-source directory that helps them “gain ethical supply-chain certificates and facilitate successful relationships between designers and production units”.

Many high-profile fashion businesses have recently distanced themselves from the animal product. In the past year, Gucci, Michael Kors and Versace were among the international fashion houses to ban fur. Asos updated its animal welfare policy in June to ban the use of feathers, silk, cashmere and mohair, in addition to fur, which it had already prohibited."
"THE marriage between Mongolia and Multrees Walk - the Edinburgh avenue where Harvey Nichols and Louis Vuitton are neighbours - has to be sustainable, says Simon Cotton.

The chief executive of the luxury knitwear firm Johnstons of Elgin - which has just opened a flagship store in the Scottish capital’s exclusive shopping precinct - has set up a critical link between its mills and the cashmere farmers of Mongolia who supply the raw materials for their products that are sold under their own brand and for names like Burberry, another Multrees neighbour.

The 222-year-old firm is also investing in its Scottish future with a new £500,000 development centre set to open in Hawick later this year where it will centralise the design of new techniques and new types of fabric.

Mr cotton, 49, said there is growth across the company, which now has five stores in the UK, with others located on London’s Bond Street, in mills in Hawick and Elgin, and in St Andrews, and a further store could follow.

He said: “There’s two sides to our business. We have our own brand, and that’s about a third of our turnover.

“We have the private label business where we manufacture for other brands. Both sides have been growing.

“On the private label side, it’s been about having fantastic relationships with the best brands in the world, which we are doing very well, and we make iconic products for them, which the customers want.”

The firm tends not to mention private clients but customers such as Burberry are happy to make the association in their accounts.

“On the brand side, it has been very much about that new consumer interest in authenticity, and brands that have a provenance and a history.”

The firm sources merino wool mostly from Australia and cashmere from China, Mongolia and Afghanistan.

He said: “I was involved in the setting up of an organisation called the Sustainable Fibre Alliance.

“Ourselves and a few other companies set this up to work in Mongolia particularly on the sustainability of cashmere, and just making sure that the nomadic herders that produce it are able to deal with issues like the challenges of global warming, because they’ve got warming there of 2.8C.

“That’s affecting the grassland, increasing animal numbers are affecting the grassland. The nomadic herding practices that have been in place for centuries really now have to deal with a lot of new challenges.

“Cashmere is a great, romantic story. You know, wild goats roaming the grasslands and all that stuff. But if we want that to be around for the next 100 years, we’ve got to support the people and the supply chain.”

Claimed as a world first, it has introduced lighter weight technology which it says allows customers to wear knitted products year round.

Last year the company committed £4.5 million, an 800 per cent increase from 2012, to introducing its new technology and R&D capabilities.

Owned by the Johnstons for the first four generations and then the Harrison family since 1920, it last year booked £9.9m, profit before tax, a 59% increase year-on-year.

The firm employs 1,000 over its Hawick and Elgin mills, and is responsible for one third of Scotland’s textile apprentices.

It again looks to the future by running school visits, with 2,500 children seeing the mills each year. “They’ll do tours, but they’ll also do face to face interviews with young people in the company. They’ll do hands-on projects as well. So really, it’s trying to engage with the next generation and let them see that textiles is a vibrant industry with a good future, which has not always been how it’s been portrayed.

“Obviously the industry as a whole has gone through some decline for a period of time, but there’s now definitely a resurgence as people get much more interested in things like authenticity and how things are made, who’s making the products, and things like that.”

The company says it has the most advanced weaving looms and knitting machines in the UK.

Mr Cotton said: “We’ve invested a lot in finer gauges for the weaving and the knitting. That’s to give us a more international appeal, more year-round appeal, and broaden our products, so it means that we can remain relevant to the private label customers regardless of what their fashion cycle does. But it also means that from our own brand, we can give a much wider range of products.

“The technology and investment in machinery certainly is part of it. Take, for example, the fine gauge knitwear, which we’ve developed, so a really fine knit where you can wear it under a suit jacket. We developed that with whole garment technology, so basically very little sewing required. It’s a product which is made almost entirely on a single machine. We did that in collaboration with a very high end, very well respected yarn spinner in Italy, and the Japanese technology leader in the sector, Shima Seiki. You needed all three parties to do that. Just buying the machinery on its own was certainly never going to get us there.

“We’re in the process of launching our innovation centre in October in Hawick, where we’ll have all our design team, all the technical developers, all our programmers together under one roof. The magic happens when you’ve got designers and technical people working together, and then you can do things which maybe can’t be done if you’re designing in one office and sending things down the modem to another office.”

He said so far Multrees Walk living up to expectations and some international shoppers are “engaged by the idea that there’s actually a Scottish luxury brand which can sit beside the Louis Vuittons and the Burberrys and the Max Maras very comfortably”.

Q&A

Q What countries have you most enjoyed travelling to, for business or leisure, and why?

A I have a particular fondness for Mongolia. Alongside two other companies, Johnstons was the original member of the Sustainable Fibre Alliance, which works with the nomadic herders in Mongolia to improve all aspects of the sustainability of cashmere production.

Q When you were a child, what was your ideal job? Why did it appeal?

A I don’t think I had a clear idea until I was in my mid-30s and realised I had the opportunity to lead a business.

Q What was your biggest break in business?

I joined Russell Europe Ltd as a marketing manager and, although incredibly hard at the time, I learnt very quickly as part of that process, and when we did achieve the turnaround it was extremely satisfying.

Q And your worst moment?

A For my first MD role in 2007 I took over a company that had never made a profit. I learned a lot about the value of “lean” in manufacturing and how to balance the need to fill factories with the need to stay profitable.

Q Who do you most admire and why?

A My wife runs a charity that brings to Scotland children from the areas of Belarus affected by the Chernobyl disaster. Somehow she manages to completely energise herself to work with the charity and can make some incredibly tough decisions when necessary.

Q What book are you reading, what music are you listening to?

A I am reading Alistair Gray’s new book The Game Changer and listening to a young local musician called Calum Jones – he has a fantastic future.

Q What was the last film you saw?

A My son Seth took me to see Spider-man: Into

The Spider-Verse. I thoroughly enjoyed it."

"March 1 will be a special day for Linda Kay Peters.

Standing beneath the Eiffel Tower, the Hope-based designer will watch as 15 of her handmade, couture-quality creations are showcased on the runway as part of Indigenous Fashion Week. It will be a proud moment that she will never forget.

The Paris fashion week appearance will also provide the 65-year-old designer with the opportunity to share with the fashion world what matters to her most: her Cree and Ojibwa heritage.

“It’s exciting and it’s important because I’m very proud to be a First Nations person. And I like to produce and create clothing that symbolizes us,” Peters, who is a member of the Sto:Lo Seabird Island First Nation in Agassiz, says of her garments. “There’s a lot of pride in sharing who you are.”

Through her brand, Ringing Bell Robes, Peters creates garments that proudly showcase both her design talents — and her culture. In total, there will be 10 international Indigenous designers joining the Paris Indigenous Fashion Week event. Peters will be joined by Melissa Attagutsiak, Ingrid Books, Chermene Castle, Jolonzo Goldtooth, Yolonda Skelton, Sho Sho Esquiro, Della Stump, Victor Buguilat Jr. and Victoria’s Arctic Fashion.

While each is singularly unique, portraying symbols and design components of each designer’s heritage, the creations showcased on the Paris runway will look to present one message to the fashion world — at a time when so many industry eyes will be watching.

“I want people know that that Indigenous designers are people, too, and they deserve the recognition,” Chelsa Racette, the executive director of Indigenous Fashion Week, says.

While some steps has been made in the right direction (Valentino partnered with Métis artist Christi Belcourt in 2015, for example), the fashion industry has had a troubled past with appropriation, including Indigenous designs. DSQUARED2, Forever 21, Givenchy and Urban Outfitters are just a few of the brands and retailers who have featured designs and symbols on their clothing.

It’s a practice that doesn”t sit right with Peters and Racette.

“Designers who want to have an ‘Indigenous-inspired’ line need to work alongside an Indigenous designer,” Racette says. “Most Indigenous designers have a story to tell with their designs. It’s the way they express their art and their history. It’s not only a ‘what’s in for this season’-type of line, it’s based on their traditions and values. It’s an everyday thing for them.”

“Appropriation is happening everywhere you turn around,” Peters adds. “It bothers me a lot when I see this happen as Indigenous people have lost so much already — our land, our languages, our culture — and this is just another form of taking away from us again.

“That is why we are trying to hang on to what little we have left — the land, the resources — and trying our best to revive our culture.”

Peters hopes showcasing Indigenous designs at an international fashion event like Paris Fashion Week will be a way to “present to the world that we are still here — ‘alive and thriving’.”

The increased awareness, Peters says, is especially important as Indigenous symbols become increasingly of interest.

“First Nations styles and symbols are becoming very popular. Where before they weren’t. And I think that’s why there is more appropriation now,” she says. “We’re just starting to get the recognition and not have somebody just take one of our designs and make it their own.”

Some steps have been taken too help protect Indigenous designers and artists, she points out. In B.C., a non-profit group, the Aboriginal Tourism Association of B.C., created the Authentic Indigenous Arts Resurgence Campaign to help people identify authentic creations. Similar programs have also popped up in other communities across Canada and around the world.

The message of protection — and proper representation — is especially poignant for Peters, who recalls how, when growing up in Red Lake, Ont., she once felt very differently about her heritage.

“There’s been so much prejudice against First Nations people. And I grew up in a world where being First Nations wasn’t accepted. So, I grew up with a lot of racism. And, as a child, I wasn’t proud to be a First Nations person. But I am now,” she says. “Sharing my clothing with First Nations symbols and design is a real source of pride for me. And I enjoy being able to share that with the world.”

At the fashion event in Paris, Peters will be joined by four models who have been longtime supporters of her designs, helping to showcase and support her creations from the start.

“My First Nations models — Charity Joe and Judith Pete from Chawathil First Nations, Dayna Nelson from Long Plains First Nations … and Rena Louis from Seabird Island First Nations — these four ladies have modelled for me since they were in their teens and I wanted to give them the opportunity to model in Paris as a show of my appreciation for presenting my clothing over the years at various fashion shows,” she says. “They helped to get me where I am today.”

But talent, perseverance and an unerring love of learning have also contributed to Peters’ success. Not to mention a longtime appreciation for the art of sewing.

“I’ve never taken any formal training. I’m all self-taught. So everything is a bit of a challenge,” she explains. “I started sewing as a child, hand-sewing. My grandmother taught me how to use her treadle machine.”

Peters soon graduated to making curtains. Then, in her teens, she recalls how she started to make her own clothes. After taking a break from the hobby in her teens, she returned to the craft in 1996. Peters credits Carol Mason, an Indigenous designer from the Blood Reserve in Alberta, with helping bring her back to her craft.

“She kind of got me going and mentored me. She brought her portfolio to work and showed me. And I started sewing and designing from then,” she recalls.

After mastering outerwear, with Peters laughingly points out was “the hardest thing to start with,” she segued into creating vests and formal wear designs. Since retiring three years ago from a career that saw her work for 30 years in Aboriginal Health, she’s tackling a new challenge in design.

“Within the last few years, I’ve started making buckskin clothing,” she explains. “With the buckskin, I’ve gotten into complete hand-lacing. There is no machine stitching on it. It’s totally different, for sure.”

The first buckskin she made was for herself, as a traditional dress for her to dance in. Peters’ initial design caught the eye of a bridal magazine in Calgary that was looking to feature a gown from an Indigenous designer. She made them an impressive white buckskin gown with 10 feet of fringe, she recalls. And her business took off from there.

She went on to make a white buckskin for Ashley Callingbull of the Enoch First Nation, which she wore during the Mrs. Universe competition in Russia. Callingbull won the title, becoming the first Indigenous woman to do so.

“She put a call out on Facebook looking for First Nations designers because she wanted to wear a buckskin for her cultural portion of the pageantry. And a few people recommended me. So, I got ahold of her and sent a picture of that white buckskin that I did for the bridal magazine and she liked it and wanted to wear it,” she says. “When I heard she won the title, I was so excited.”

“She really used her platform to come back and talk about some of the issues facing First Nations people. I was very proud of her.”

Now in ‘retirement’, Peters’ new goal is to tan her own hides. Creating the designs, which average from $600 to $2,000 for a handmade buckskin design, has become not only a constant source of pride for the designer — they’ve become a constant source of excitement, too.

“As it materializes, when I first start with either a fabric or a hide, it’s exciting to me to see the end result. I’ve never seen myself as being able to produce something so beautiful, and when (a design) turns out to be what it is, it’s exciting,” she says. “It’s like walking, wearable art.”

Could Veja sneakers be the most sustainable shoes in the world?

The French fashion brand's founders, Sébastien Kopp and François-Ghislain Morillion, certainly hope so.

The two childhood friends visited clothing and food factories in South America, Asia and Australia while running a nonprofit group — and were appalled by what they saw.

""We realized that we did not know how products were made, and that if we knew, we would consume differently,"" said Kopp.

In 2005, they founded Veja in France, with the mission of making sneakers using the most ecological materials and ethical suppliers they could find.

Today, Veja supplies its shoes to 1,800 retailers in 45 countries. The company says it sold 550,000 pairs last year, generating $21 million in revenue.

Rethinking a popular product

Kopp and Morillion, who are both 40, didn't start out in fashion. They worked in finance in Washington and New York until 2002, when they made the switch. They founded a non-profit that studied companies' corporate social responsibility policies around the world, and then launched Veja three years later.

Veja means ""look"" in Portuguese, the official language of Brazil, where Kopp and Morillion source their materials.

The idea behind the brand is to ""rethink the creation of a popular product,"" Kopp said.

A pair of Veja retails for $95 and up.

The two men each put in about $8,000 and took out a small loan to launch Veja.

They started buying wild rubber from rubber tappers in the Amazon even though it costs more than synthetic materials. ""It helps to fight against deforestation, as [they] prefer to work for us than to cut trees to raise cattle,"" he said.

The business partners also decided to use ecological cotton that's grown in a way that enriches the soil rather than damaging it with chemicals.

But their most striking move was to invent the waterproof ""bottle mesh"" used to make the upper part of some of their sneaker models.

It takes three recycled plastic bottles to make one pair of shoes, according to the company. The bottles are collected from the streets of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, then sent to a factory where they're crushed into flakes and transformed into fiber.

None of this comes cheap. Making Veja sneakers costs between five and seven times as much as an average pair of sneakers, according to the company.

Founders Kopp (on the left) and Morillion.

""A lot of our clients are discovering what is behind Veja after they buy one or two pairs,"" he explained, adding that they come back for more after finding out the brand's story. Veja sneakers' prices range from $95 to $195.

Other ethical fashion brands on the market include US-based Alternative Apparel, which uses eco-friendly materials, and UK womenswear brand People Tree, whose products are made out of organic materials.

International growth

The company, which employs 100 people, is headquartered in Paris. Kopp, who taught himself shoe design by visiting sneaker factories, leads the design team.

Celebrities such as Emma Watson and Marion Cotillard have been photographed wearing Veja shoes, which are known for their minimalist design and signature ""V"" logo.

Sales have taken off in recent years, growing 50% annually since 2015, according to the company. It supplies its sneakers to high-end retailers in the United Kingdom and started selling them in the United States in 2016.

Kopp believes awareness of ethical fashion is growing.

""People want to change the way they are consuming much more than before,"" he said."
"It is a by-product of the paper making process, but the company’s new waste water treatment process creates sustainable and renewable energy. The waste water runs through an anerobic digester where microbes eat the waste nutrients and then produce methane. The water is then run through to an aerobic digester to become cleaner waste water for discharge to the sewer.

The methane, meanwhile, is used to power an engine generating 12 million kilowatts of energy every year, providing power to help run the site. The heat from the engine is captured and used to preheat the water in the mill, leading to even more power savings.

The company says that 90 per cent of the energy used in this process is captured and reused.

Along with the obvious environmental benefits, it is delivering a 20 per cent return on the $23 million investment in the waste water treatment facility.

Cars from recycled plastics

When passengers rest their feet on the floor mats in Volvo cars in coming years, they might not realise that the carpet underfoot actually contains fibres made from PET plastic bottles and a recycled cotton mix from clothing manufacturers’ offcuts.

The initiative forms part of Volvo’s broader ambition that at least 25 per cent of all plastics in cars launched after 2025 will be made from recycled material, which Volvo says is the most progressive statement around the use of recycled plastic by any premium automotive manufacturer.

The company recently unveiled a demonstration version of its XC60 T8 plug-in hybrid, which looks almost identical to the existing model, but has had more than 60kg of its plastic parts replaced with parts made of recycled materials.

Some of the 170 recycled plastic parts in the car include the tunnel console that runs down the centre of the front seats, made from renewable fibres and plastics from discarded fishing nets and maritime ropes, for example.

The seats in the XC60 T8 plug-in hybrid SUV use PET fibres from plastic bottles.

The seats are sewn from two different kinds of textiles, both of which are made from recycled plastic bottles, while the vacuum reservoir under the bonnet, which helps to regulate the turbo engine pressure, is made of recycled fabrics from airbags.

Sustainable aquaculture

As wild fisheries become depleted and need protection, the world is increasingly turning to farmed fish to meet the demand for seafood.

But without safeguards, aquaculture carries its own environmental risks. Poorly sited operations can result in the clearing of valuable and highly productive habitats such as mangroves and seagrass beds. Irresponsible operations can also result in extensive nutrient pollution, the release of harmful chemicals, the introduction of non-native species and the spread of disease into native fish populations, the World Wide Fund for Nature says.

But it doesn’t have to be this way. The WWF has been working with Australia’s largest aquaculture business Tassal since 2012 to provide expert advice on its sustainability strategy and in November 2014 Tassel became the first producer of farmed salmon in the world to achieve full Aquaculture Stewardship Council certification.

Among other things, Tassal stopped the use of copper-based net-cleaning chemicals, reduced antibiotics use by 95 per cent and cut back on the use of wild fish for salmon food.

It’s just one of hundreds of initiatives around Australia that are helping to preserve our marine environment, including the Volvo Living Seawall. In this project, the Sydney Institute of Marine Science is teaming up with the Reef Design Lab to put tiles reinforced with recycled plastic onto a seawall in Sydney Harbour to provide a habitat for marine life.

In late October the project will install 50 tiles at a site in Milsons Point on the harbour’s northern shore to build one of the largest living seawalls in the world at approximately 10 metres.

More sustainability in the clothing industry

Customers often return damaged or unwanted clothes to the retailer for very minor reasons, such as a loose seam or unaligned zip, which nevertheless render these items unsellable and then creates a large amount of waste which can end up in landfill.

Outdoor clothing brand Kathmandu has teamed up with SORT Recycling to make better use of these unwanted items. SORT Recycling sorts, tests and repairs a range of items that could then be gifted to local charities. SORT also partners with the NSW Government’s Work for the Dole program, enabling workers to develop useful skills repairing items.

It forms part of Kathmandu’s broader commitment to reducing its waste.

The company has responded to an increasing demand for polyester – which is made from unsustainable fossil fuels – by recycling instead. The company uses REPREVE polyester, which is made from plastic bottles. In fact, polyethylene terephthalate plastic (better known as PET) is the same material as polyester.

The company has shifted to recycled polyester and in 2017/18 recycled 6.9 million plastic bottles.

Game changing ideas in partnership with Volvo Car Australia.

At Volvo we don’t just think before we act – we think, we rethink, and then we think again. In Sweden we call this Omtanke. It means taking a considered approach in all that we do. From ensuring all new Volvo’s launched from 2019 will include an electric motor variant - to tackling ocean pollution with Living Seawalls. A game changer rethinks where others move on.

We don’t just look differently at cars, we look at the world differently. Omtanke drives those innovations that make life more effortless. More considerate, more sustainable. We welcome you to try it. It could be your first step in becoming a game changer.

"The British high street is notorious for its deeply confusing sizing system, with baffled women regularly complaining that they are a size 10 in one shop and a 12 in another.

But an online fashion marketplace claims to have created an online tool that shows what size customers really are at some of the most popular high street and online stores.

Sewport.com developed the tool after it emerged that 90 per cent of women are unsure of their clothing size - and so Femail put it to the test.

MailOnline's senior video editor Alicia Watts, 24, (pictured) volunteered to try out the online tool. Her measurements are 32-23-32 and she usually wears a size 6 or 8

To create the sizing tool the company collected data from some of Europe's leading female clothing retailers to compare sizes and discovered huge variances in measurements across the brands.

Now, using the tool women can find out what size they are in each shop simply by putting their bust, waist and hip measurements into the system.

It gives sizing information on clothing from Topshop, H&M, New Look, River Island, ASOS, Boohoo, Missguided, M&S, Zara, Bon Marche, Dorothy Perkins, Miss Selfridge, Primark, Warehouse, Oasis, Next, Monsoon, Urban Outfitters, Matalan and PrettyLittleThing.com.

MailOnline's senior video editor Alicia Watts, 24, volunteered to try out the online tool. Her measurements are 32-23-32 and she usually wears a size 6 or 8.

Alicia normally wears a size 6 or 8 - but the results suggest she should be wearing smaller

While Alicia is an XXS in PLT and Missguided, the tool says she's a 4 in the majority of shops

She said: 'I mainly shop at Asos, Topshop, Pretty Little Thing and Missguided.

'At Missguided and Pretty Little Thing I always get the smallest size because the sizes are so big. Everywhere else I would say I'm a size 6, but in H&M I'm an 8.'

When Femail popped her stats into the online tool, the results were surprising. While she is an XXS in PLT and Missguided, as she'd suspected, she is a size 4 in the majority of shops, including H&M.

But she is a size 8 at Bon Marche - and a size 10 in Primark.

Although Alicia normally wears a size 6 or 8, at Topshop (left) she would need a 4. Right: Monsoon jeans, where Alicia would wear a 6

Alicia said: 'I'm so surprised! There's a huge difference being a size XXS at PLT/Missguided and then going to a size 10 in Primark.

'I didn't think I'd be a size 10 in Primark. I've never bought anything that's been size 10. I'm also shocked about H&M as I can never fit into the smaller sizes there.

'I usually buy a size 8, so I think if I went in there to try on a size 4 I wouldn't be able to fit into it.

'It's disappointing that high street shops don't have matching size guides, as it can be very time-consuming to try on several sizes.'

The data also revealed that a size 12 has the most variation across retailers on average, and can range from a 90cm bust measurement in Next to 96cms at PrettyLittleThing.com.

Alicia needs a size 8 in jeans from Bon Marche (left) and a size 10 in Primark (right)

Overall ASOS has the smallest sizing guide and Boohoo.com has the largest. If a customer wears a size 8 from ASOS, they'll be a size 4 at Boohoo.com.

The tool was created in response to research conducted on 2,614 women, which discovered that nearly all of respondents (90 per cent) are unsure of their clothing size, and three quarters (74 per cent) of them have previously bought more than one size of an item.

More than four fifths (84 per cent) are unaware of vanity sizing and two thirds (61 per cent) find shopping less enjoyable due to not knowing their size. 94 per cent of respondents feel there should be a standardised sizing guide that retailers should adhere to.

Size 14: Femail put standard size 14 measurements in the tool to see what sizes brands suggest

While most of the brands agreed that the measurements required a size 14, Urban Outfitters suggested a 16 and Pretty Little Thing suggested a size 12 would fit best

Boris Hodakel, Sewport founder, said: 'Sizing has become a big issue in the industry, especially now that online shopping is more popular.

'Online shopping is great and gives consumers a convenient way to buy clothes, but it's also made it harder for shoppers to find out what size they are and return items that don't fit. What's even more frustrating for shoppers is to think you are a size, to then discover you are a larger or smaller size depending on what shop you're in.

'All of this has contributed to shoppers feeling confused, sometimes upset, and annoyed and it's about time the fashion industry responded.

'It makes sense that every fashion brand should adhere to a standard sizing guide globally, however I think we're a way off that happening.

'In the meantime I hope our sizing tool will enlighten women on what size they are, where, and make shopping enjoyable again!'

"An award-winning eco-campaigner, an era-defining activist and multiple world-renowned designers: London fashion week men’s takes place this weekend and brings with it a heady mix of budding and established talent.

Attracting attention will be the leaders of the new vanguard of brands blazing a trail including Craig Green, Charles Jeffrey Loverboy, Liam Hodges, Edward Crutchley, A-Cold-Wall and Martine Rose. They are joined by high-profile fashion houses Iceberg, E.Tautz, Chalayan and Alexander McQueen – the latter a new addition to the regular schedule – as well as a crop of designers breaking with convention such as Art School, Stefan Cooke, Paria/Farzaneh and Xander Zhou.

Proving that the UK remains fertile ground for the freshest of fashion talent, the incubator Fashion East will once again showcase the work of three emerging talents. This season, its ones to watch are Mowalola, Robyn Lynch and Saul Nash. Notable absentees include Kent & Curwen – David Beckham’s brand – and the award-winning Cottweiler, which has opted for an online presentation instead of a show.

“It’s a strong season with amazing names,” says Dylan Jones, chair of the British Fashion Council and editor-in-chief of GQ. “London seems to be the only fashion capital of the world regenerating itself on a regular basis. It’s always had an innate ability to produce creative people, whether it’s in music, art or fashion design.”

The busyness of the schedule is rivalled by only Paris, with this summer’s New York and Milan events struggling to secure back-to-back highlights. It lands in London as new figures reveal that the UK menswear market is estimated to have grown by 3.5% since 2017. In order to maintain momentum, Jones says that it’s imperative to surprise people. “Consumers are curious – we all want the new, the fresh, the modern.”

The new is currently proving tricky ground to navigate, with an increased focus on sustainability and efforts to curb the insatiable consumption of clothes in particular. It can make for bittersweet appreciation of a showcase designed to present copious amounts of newness. Jones says that “it’s incumbent on the fashion industry to find new ways of engaging with the consumer” and that while menswear – with its focus on functionality – tends to lend itself more naturally to a buy less, buy better model, the responsibility lies at the door of fast fashion and poorly made product.

“Obviously we’re all in the business of selling and commerce – its a transactional industry, but there needs to be a tradeoff,” he says. “In the main [this argument] should be directed at the high street. Fast fashion is terrible, not only for the environment, but for the halo effect it has on the whole of the industry in total. If you look at a lot of the luxury brands, they are making goods to last. Think of a Hermès handbag, you’re not buying a new one every six months. That’s investment buying, which is what menswear has always been about.”

Presenting their collections this weekend are several designers celebrated for adopting an ethical and considered approach, including Ahluwalia Studio, Samuel Ross and Bethany Williams, who was awarded the Queen Elizabeth award in February for her endeavours. Also joining proceedings will be sustainable designers Christopher Raeburn and Duran Lantinck, who will take part in an upcycling masterclass with producer, actor and activist Lena Waithe.

While LFWM is held in London, the BFC is currently actively incubating talent from around the UK. Three years ago, it launched its Saturday Clubs in collaboration with the Sorrell Foundation. It’s an initiative that aims to give young people aged 14 to 16 the chance to study at a local institution for free. The aim, says Jones, is to give future talent the support and advice needed to be pursue successful careers.

“It’s a version of apprenticeship,” says Jones. “One of the things that’s missing is a vertical line of people getting into our industry. People think about the fashion industry and think you can only be a fashion designer but think about the hundreds of different jobs involved in fashion. From design to manufacturing to content to production, it’s a huge business and it’s always very important to try and encourage young people. A lot of these teenagers don’t leave their borough and its difficult to draw a line between their situations and people in the fashion industry. It’s incumbent on us to do the outreach – we need to go into these communities to try and help.”"

"The retail world has long seemed to favour womenswear. While options abound for women’s clothing and accessories, the landscape has often seemed comparatively small for men’s shopping options.

“I think that is still largely true, although menswear is enjoying a bit more notoriety and attention these days,” Chris Gibbs, the co-owner of the Los Angeles-based streetwear boutique Union, explains. “I think this is because, historically, it was a bit of a taboo for men to express themselves though fashion outside of a suit or jeans and white T-shirt.”

The focus has shifted slightly in recent years, with more brands and companies (beyond the suiting realm, of course) courting more male shoppers, but the imbalance still remains very much intact. But, change is definitely underfoot.

“Now those social taboos largely don’t exist and there is a whole industry built around new men’s fashion,” Gibbs says of the shift. According to Gibbs, the shift has largely been pushed along by the evolution and influence of men’s fashion categories, such as streetwear, which has boomed in the recent decade thanks to pop culture references and social media sharing.

“From my point of view, the main change is the residue of an industry, in particular the streetwear industry, which has finally become fully mature,” Gibbs explains. “Now that streetwear is here and fully developed, there are an overwhelming amount of options. Back in the day there were only a handful of good brands … now there is a mix of incredible product in the marketplace.”

That popularity has led to an increase in the number of brands offering styles. And with that increase, Gibbs says, has come a sense of confusion for some shoppers.

“With so many options, we’ve found the customer can get a bit overwhelmed, so the solution has been for brands to really focus on ‘their story’ and the customer is really into that,” Gibbs says. “So, now the story and provenance of the brand is what gets most of the attention and is what most people are buying into as opposed to the actual design. It’s interesting to see this develop and I’m curious to see where we go next.”

Putting that purchasing theory to the test, as well offering shoppers an edited selection of pieces that will allow them to shop for new styles that speak to their own unique personal fashion sense, Nordstrom has introduced a New Concepts shop dedicated to men’s fashions.

“New Concepts is our platform to tell the stories of some of the newest, most interesting and compelling brands and products from within the menswear industry,” Sam Lobban, the vice-president of men’s fashion at Nordstrom, explains. “Through unique product curation, immersive in-store pop-ups and digital website experience we hope to show our customers some of the coolest ideas from around the world.”

Offering a selection of pieces (170 exclusive items, to be exact) hand-picked by Gibbs and Lobban from 13 brands at prices ranging from $55 to $1,683, the space is meant to be as much about shopping as it is about offering a source of discovery and inspiration.

“Chris and I have known each other for a while, and I’ve always been a huge fan of both the Union store and the brand and product selection, as well as Chris’s vibe and take on what’s happening in the industry,” Lobban says. “Working with Chris gives us a great opportunity to give Nordstrom customers something new and exciting, while giving more people the opportunity to learn about the Union business.

The items on offer within the shop-in-shop, is expected to change regularly in order to keep the shopping option fresh.

“The New Concepts team is constantly scouring the market for interesting ideas, people who are doing cool stuff, across brands, products, other retailers, media; anywhere really,” Lobban says.

“People can expect to find what we always strive to create: a colourful, highly curated mix of new designers who are the future of menswear,” Gibbs adds.

For Gibbs, the opportunity to partner with the Seattle-based retailer allowed his company to work with unique brands they hadn’t had access to before.

“As an independent store, it’s rare that we get to work with such big teams and projects,” Gibbs explains. “The many locations and bigger reach has enabled us to do a full capsule collection with Marni, which would not have been possible without a big partner.

“This partnership opportunity has really allowed us to think freely and put together a rather aggressive and robust offering. We are quite excited about this.”

The exclusive collection will be available at select Nordstrom locations including New York City, Seattle, Los Angeles and more through Sept. 1. Nordstrom Pacific Centre in Vancouver will be the only Canadian location to carry the range.

"One of the world's most recognisable fashion models has said the advent of social media has radically transformed the industry – with models struggling to get jobs if they do not have hefty social media followings.

Natalia Vodianova, a Russian supermodel whose nickname is Supernova, said the rising influence of social media has seen a far greater emphasis on personality over beauty since the industry.

But the 35-year-old – who had a seven-figure contract with Calvin Klein – said this shift had not manifested itself among catwalk models and it had instead moved in the other direction.

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.

“When it comes to the catwalk, unfortunately, you see that kind of ‘ideal’ of very, very skinny girls who have an edge, a look, but it’s not really about personality,” Vodianova told The Independent.

“Even from my time when in fact girls were more themselves, we were allowed to smile, breathe and try to do our thing on the catwalk, even fifteen years ago. Now it’s more faceless. It’s not about them - the character - but the character imposed by the designer.”

Vodianova – who was the world’s third highest earning model in 2012 and is currently ranked by models.com as one of the fashion industry’s New Supers – said the proliferation of social media has changed the whole fashion industry.

“For young models, it’s really, really hard. It’s really hard without this following. I know a lot of brands are asking models how many followers they have – this dictates whether they get the job or not.

“It’s interesting because that means personality is celebrated and it’s not really about the brand's ideal of the, let’s say, face. It’s crazy because very beautiful girls, or whatever that means, will miss out and the job will go out to someone who is very charismatic and funny and has a lot of personality. Some people find it unfair but I think it’s interesting.”

The model, who does a range of campaigning work, noted the “competitive” nature of this shift but said it allowed for a greater diversity of models.

She argued the growing influence of social media has led the industry to embrace a greater range of body shapes but it still had a long way to go.

“A lot of it is forced by social media and by the fact more and more of these conversations are surfacing. The industry sort of follows it like a trend. Unfortunately, it is still not normalised enough.

“The issues of one type of body and perfection are changing a lot because we now see consumers wanting to see more diversity,” she added. “Big influencers and the brands themselves now have a great presence on social media so they can hear from their consumers directly about what works and what does not. I think this is really positive.”

She added: “Influence has gone from the industry-at-large to a mix of important influencers. The newcomers and Instagram stars mean it is a very different landscape. It’s very interesting.”

But she said the issue of body diversity has yet to revolutionise the world of catwalk high fashion – noting such designers create their clothes with slim women in mind.

“That is the way they want to see it. But then often what is in the catwalk is not what you find in the shop,” she said.

Asked whether she thought this provided a negative role model for young girls, she said the responsibility needed to lie with designers rather than the models themselves.

“What is it to do with catwalk models? We can’t blame catwalk models. They are beautiful. And they are often very healthy. They are naturally skinny,” she said. “Whether there should be more diversity, that is another story. A lot of these girls and a lot of these models were born this way. I was born this way so I can speak on their behalf.”

She called for a greater variety of female body types to be represented on the catwalk. “There will always be a place for girls who are naturally slim, but I would love to see more beautiful, curvy women on the catwalk. I see a lot of these shows and I think it should be more like in real life.”

Vodianova joined the United Nations Population Fund to lead a global symposium on tackling the taboos surrounding women’s health around the world in Antalya in Turkey on Thursday and Friday of this week. The event, called “Let’s Talk!”, was powered by her digital charitable platform Elbi and run in conjunction with the United Nations sexual and reproductive health agency.

“Too often women’s health issues go unheard and unnoticed because of unwarranted stigmas and taboos which have let far too many women down for generations,” she said.

She said the global issue of period poverty was close to her heart – revealing she was subject to fierce trolling after sharing a photo of herself holding a sanitary pad with her two million Instagram followers.

The model said she received around 5,000 comments in less than ten hours and the reaction of Russian women to the image was “crazy”.

“Most of it was harsh criticism saying ‘How can you do this? There are teenagers following you. Why don’t you start posting pictures sitting on the toilet? Why don’t you post toilet paper?’ I could not believe my eyes. I am not used to so much hate and criticism thrown my way.”

“Then I thought this is really cool actually. iIt proves my point that these conversations are so important. I just did not realise this shame and stigma was so close to home in Russia.”"
"Kate Hudson may be the busy mother of three, but she's still proving women can have it all.

The actress, 39, started her day by appearing on Good Morning America where she talked about her new new eco-friendly clothing line with a 30-piece collection.

Later she was seen going for a stroll with her boyfriend, Danny Fujikawa, 32, and new daughter, Rani Rose Hudson Fujikawa, aged six months.

Wearing tan khaki trousers and suede boots, Kate threw up a peace sign as she was followed by her team onto the talk show set.

Facing the chilly city weather, she wore a long white coat that made its way all the way down to her ankles.

Her face, which popped through the neutral colors with a dash of pink lipstick, was shielded from the sun by octagon sunglasses.

After her visit, Kate spent some time with her loved ones and pushed Rani's stroller around while walking beside Danny.

Danny wore grey sweats and an orange sweater as they soaked up the sun with their first child in tow.

Kate's time on the show follows the release of her Happy X Nature clothing range, which she promoted during her interview with Michael Strahan, 47.

Clasping her hands in absolute joy, Kate was nothing but smiles as she dished on all things baby and her line.

Hudson’s previous foray into fashion was through her activewear collection, Fabletics.

Happy x Nature is the daughter of Goldie Hawn's 'first ever ready-to-wear line,' which she pointed out in an Instagram post to her more than 10 million followers.

Celebrating the big release, Hudson posted a photo of her sporting her own line in a strapless yellow dress.

She captioned it explaining the brand further saying, 'Our story is a love story really. A love of nature and all things natural. We love how nature makes beauty look so easy and effortless. And, that’s been our inspiration for our fashion and for our commitment to the environment.'

The Almost Famous star detailed the company's goal saying they want to make consumers happy with 'free-spirited fashion that minimizes our impact on non-renewable resources.'

Using fabrics that are recyclable and safe for the planet, along with no throw-away paper and eco-friendly fabric tags, Kate has covered all the bases.

Shoppers can find an impressive rundown of options from the line including: pants, tops, dresses, jumpsuits an jackets.

The options will feature '70s inspired looks with a Penny Lane goes-to-Coachella vibe.

And relishing in a job well done, Hudson posted about the launch on her Instagram stories before taking the stage at GMA.

In a video she said: 'Today’s the day we’re launching, everyone’s a little excitedly nervous, on the edge…' before going off into a short ballad of Lady Gaga's The Edge Of Glory.

She then went on to talk about how tired she was, but explained her exhaustion was a result of her new baby, not the line.

The collection will be available at HappyxNature.com as well as nyandcompany.com and select New York & Company store locations. Customers can expect new drops monthly and pieces to regularly stay between the $50 and $200 price range.

On October 2 this past year, Kate gave birth to her first daughter and youngest of three children, Rani Rose Hudson Fujikawa.

Kate is co-parenting the bundle of joy with her longtime boyfriend.

The actors first met when Kate was pregnant with her eldest child 15 years ago through Danny's step sisters, who are also close to the blonde.

The bombshell shares her two other little ones, Ryder, 15, and Bingham, 7, with her ex-husband, Chris Robinson.

Chris, who's the singer for rock and roll band, The Black Crowes, was wed to Kate from 2000 to 2007.

Now, after giving birth to her third child last year, Hudson says she 'deserves a hangover.'

The actress is set to celebrate her 40th birthday later this month, and has said that since becoming a mother of three she feels like she’s earned a night of partying that will leave her with a “really good hangover” the following morning.

Still an item: The actors first met when Kate was pregnant with her eldest child 15 years ago through Danny's step sisters, who are also close to the blonde; seen in 2017

Asked how she plans to spend her birthday, she said: 'At this point, I just want to tell everybody, ‘Hey, I’m gonna have a party,’ and then everybody shows up.

'I personally, with having a baby, feel like I deserve a really good hangover. I’ve been so good, I’ve been so busy. I’ve been breastfeeding like crazy and I just want some martinis. I want to sleep in. [That’d be] really nice.'

But despite wanting to unwind from the pressures of motherhood, Kate says she almost cries 'every day”' from watching her two sons dote on their little sister, who is her first child with boyfriend Danny Fujikawa.

She added: 'Seeing the boys with her … I feel like I tear up every day. To see [Ryder] with his sister and to be a real helper and for me to be able to walk away and go, ‘Hey, honey, can you just take the baby?’ And I turn around and I’m like, ‘Oh, my gosh.’

And the Bride Wars star says her family are 'so happy,' as although there’s a level of chaos at home, the 'energy is calm and loving.'

Speaking on Good Morning America, Kate said: 'I’ve been having babies a long time, let’s put it that way. But it’s good. Everyone’s so happy and I feel, right now … even though it’s chaotic, the energy is calm and loving and peaceful right now and I’m just in a great place.'"
"Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez explained that they wanted the president to see ""a wave of white"" - a colour which historically has associations with the Suffrage movement and was worn by Hillary Clinton during her presidential campaign.

It was a striking yet simple way for the female Democrats to assert their presence as the majority force in the House and to serve warning to Trump and the Republicans that they will fight them at every opportunity. Trump may have referenced bipartisanship in his speech but the women's adoption of white protested his brand of toxic, divisive politics and defined their mission to clean up government.

The tradition of protest dressing isn't new, but it has been revived dramatically of late, with incarnations including the appearance of women dressed as Margaret Atwood-inspired Handmaids in Washington to protest Brett Kavanaugh's appointment, the ""Pussy"" hats adopted by thousands of women on marches after Trump's election, and the wearing of black on the red carpet at the 2018 Golden Globes for the Time's Up campaign. It seems that everything from gender inequality to racism to workplace bullying is now being protested via fashion.

Social and political tensions globally have re-asserted the role of fashion as a vehicle for protest. Scandals and discord in institutions such as Hollywood, the Catholic Church, the US government and the Brexit-stricken UK House of Commons have shaken beliefs and provoked a visible reaction, particularly from women. Now choosing what to wear is no longer simply about style.

Fashion is a vivid and fascinating reflection of popular culture and social trends. Our clothes are more than a modest shield from the elements - they denote social rank, status or political and class affiliations and aspirations. Every day when we get dressed we choose which identity we present to the world - now that said world is in a state of crisis, it is not surprising that people are re-assessing the messages conveyed in their clothes. From the Gilets Jaunes of Paris to the red capes of the Handmaids to the ubiquitous REPEAL jumpers, statement-making clothes have been adopted as a potent form of expression and protest.

The pussyhatproject.com have stated: ""The more we are seen, the more we are heard."" Adopting a bold colour, like vibrant pink to protest within a male-dominated space, is empowering because women are simultaneously making themselves more visible and subverting the traditional associations of pink with passive femininity."" Delete 'Pretty in Pink' as the mood board for S/S 2019 and replace with 'Protest in Pink' instead.

Even what you don't wear can be a protest - recall Pussy Riot's use of nudity to protest Putin, the Supermodels' PETA poster where they posed nude with the slogan: ""We'd rather go naked than wear fur"" and the '70s socialite, who on being refused entrance to the conservative Côte Basque in New York (because she was wearing a Le Smoking trouser suit), simply removed the trousers and wore her jacket as a mini dress, in an example of sophisticated subversion.

Historically, protest dressing has had multiple expressions: the French Incroyables of the 1790s, the Suffragettes' adoption of white, purple and green or punk's distressed and slashed aesthetic which protested recession, dole queues and the Establishment's indifference. Hollywood has also utilised clothing to protest issues and dress codes: Jane Fonda's Mao collared suit worn to collect her Best Actress Oscar in 1972, when she stated that she ""wasn't dressing for men"" and Kristen Stewart's pointed removal of her Christian Louboutin heels on the Cannes red carpet in 2018. Now with pressing environmental issues such as global warming, plastics pollution and over-consumption joining concerns about misogyny, sexual exploitation and discrimination, sartorial and socio-political statements are appearing side by side with increasing frequency. They may be strange bedfellows thrown together by circumstance but have developed a new affinity.

One of the most striking images of the 1980s was that of Katharine Hamnett wearing her infamous '58% Don't Want Pershing' T-shirt to Downing Street, to confront Margaret Thatcher. Hamnett has revived her slogan T-shirts successfully with her 'Cancel Brexit' version particularly topical. Other slogans from the designer include, 'Fashion Hates Brexit', 'Second Referendum Now' and 'Vote Trump Out' (which is currently sold out).

Vivienne Westwood (left) with models including Rose McGowan (centre), protested climate change and consumerism at her LFW show last month

Vivienne Westwood has been a strong advocate for climate change protest for decades and her recent London Fashion Week show featured Rose McGowan - a driver of the #MeToo movement since making allegations against producer Harvey Weinstein - delivering a speech on consumerism, models wearing T-shirts that berated politicians and bags sporting the statement 'I Heart Crap'.

The mood overall at LFW this year was muted: the event opened with Justice 4 Grenfell staging an event with 72 people including Emeli Sandé and Adwoa Aboah standing in silent protest wearing T-shirts asking: '72 dead and still no arrests? How come?'

As fashion is an industry with a dubious legacy including pollution, body fascism and human rights violations in its supply chain, some might find designers pontificating on politics and protest hard to swallow, but that hasn't stopped them expressing their views. This needn't always be at a high pitch like Dior's 'We should all be feminists' T-shirt. Sometimes the expressions can be subtle and nuanced - Simone Rocha's use of a diverse mix of models of all ages and sizes in her recent A/W 2019 show.

Fashion feeds off an innate collective intelligence and will always reflect what women are experiencing in their lives. Coco Chanel vividly expressed this relationship between fashion and life: ""Fashion is not something that exists in dresses only; fashion is something in the air. It's the wind that blows in the new fashion: you smell it. Fashion is in the sky, in the street, fashion has to do with ideas, the way we live, what is happening"".

Certainly, what women are choosing to wear has never been so scrutinised for overt or hidden meanings. Thousands of words were written trying to parse Melania Trump's message on that Zara coat while events such as the Slut Walk marches in Toronto and women discarding their hijabs on the streets of Tehran all reflect a sense that the mood globally is discordant, angry and exasperated.

Women may not be burning their bras but they are spectacularly pissed off. Using style to semaphore inflamed sentiments has become a common shorthand. In the age of Instagram, a potent visual can have a global impact.

What powerful and visible women choose to wear can deliver messages of support to causes they care about - Ruth Negga wearing the blue ACLU ribbon to the Oscars; Beyoncé's Black Panthers-inspired costume at the Super Bowl (in the midst of the Black Lives Matter protest) or singer Lorde stitching a poem by Jenny Holzer, The Apocalypse, onto the back of her Valentino gown at the Grammys in 2018. It stated: ""Our times are intolerable. Take courage, for the worst is a harbinger of the best. Only dire circumstances can precipitate the overthrow of the oppressors.""

Critics might think that fashion is too superficial a vehicle for serious protest, others disagree. Turning social movements into an income stream is cynical and, certainly, there are brands that will attempt to ride the trend, but designers such as Maria Grazie Chiuri at Dior, Phoebe Philo when she was at Celine, Miuccia Prada and Stella McCartney do seem to be genuinely attempting to promote debate and change via their designs.

With younger consumers rejecting traditional models of consumption by recycling, shopping second hand or just not shopping due to ethical concerns or lack of funds, labels have had to find ways of communicating with them through innovative strategies. Increasingly brands need to be sustainable, socially engaged and pro-active in terms of auditing their carbon and human rights policies to gain millennials as clients. If they are credible and display a sense of social responsibility, younger people may shop their goods.

The blending of business and ethics will be the defining trend of successful brands in the future. It simply won't be enough to have nice dresses - labels will have to ensure that the ethics of their brand speaks to their client's conscience as well as their desire to be stylish.

Clothing can comment on social and political issues and is an accessible tool for women to engage in debate or protest in an immediate way. Fashion can be an empowering method of expression and the current conversation seems to have only started. If fashion gives an account of its era and the desires of the moment then the fashion pages are now as relevant and revealing as our news reports. Wearing your sleeve on your sartorial heart has assumed a new urgency.

"Kate Hudson may be the busy mother of three, but she's still proving women can have it all.

The actress, 39, started her day by appearing on Good Morning America where she talked about her new new eco-friendly clothing line with a 30-piece collection.

Later she was seen going for a stroll with her boyfriend, Danny Fujikawa, 32, and new daughter, Rani Rose Hudson Fujikawa, aged six months.

Wearing tan khaki trousers and suede boots, Kate threw up a peace sign as she was followed by her team onto the talk show set.

Facing the chilly city weather, she wore a long white coat that made its way all the way down to her ankles.

Her face, which popped through the neutral colors with a dash of pink lipstick, was shielded from the sun by octagon sunglasses.

After her visit, Kate spent some time with her loved ones and pushed Rani's stroller around while walking beside Danny.

Danny wore grey sweats and an orange sweater as they soaked up the sun with their first child in tow.

Kate's time on the show follows the release of her Happy X Nature clothing range, which she promoted during her interview with Michael Strahan, 47.

Clasping her hands in absolute joy, Kate was nothing but smiles as she dished on all things baby and her line.

Hudson’s previous foray into fashion was through her activewear collection, Fabletics.

Happy x Nature is the daughter of Goldie Hawn's 'first ever ready-to-wear line,' which she pointed out in an Instagram post to her more than 10 million followers.

Celebrating the big release, Hudson posted a photo of her sporting her own line in a strapless yellow dress.

She captioned it explaining the brand further saying, 'Our story is a love story really. A love of nature and all things natural. We love how nature makes beauty look so easy and effortless. And, that’s been our inspiration for our fashion and for our commitment to the environment.'

The Almost Famous star detailed the company's goal saying they want to make consumers happy with 'free-spirited fashion that minimizes our impact on non-renewable resources.'

Using fabrics that are recyclable and safe for the planet, along with no throw-away paper and eco-friendly fabric tags, Kate has covered all the bases.

Shoppers can find an impressive rundown of options from the line including: pants, tops, dresses, jumpsuits an jackets.

The options will feature '70s inspired looks with a Penny Lane goes-to-Coachella vibe.

And relishing in a job well done, Hudson posted about the launch on her Instagram stories before taking the stage at GMA.

In a video she said: 'Today’s the day we’re launching, everyone’s a little excitedly nervous, on the edge…' before going off into a short ballad of Lady Gaga's The Edge Of Glory.

She then went on to talk about how tired she was, but explained her exhaustion was a result of her new baby, not the line.

The collection will be available at HappyxNature.com as well as nyandcompany.com and select New York & Company store locations. Customers can expect new drops monthly and pieces to regularly stay between the $50 and $200 price range.

On October 2 this past year, Kate gave birth to her first daughter and youngest of three children, Rani Rose Hudson Fujikawa.

Kate is co-parenting the bundle of joy with her longtime boyfriend.

The actors first met when Kate was pregnant with her eldest child 15 years ago through Danny's step sisters, who are also close to the blonde.

The bombshell shares her two other little ones, Ryder, 15, and Bingham, 7, with her ex-husband, Chris Robinson.

Chris, who's the singer for rock and roll band, The Black Crowes, was wed to Kate from 2000 to 2007.

Now, after giving birth to her third child last year, Hudson says she 'deserves a hangover.'

The actress is set to celebrate her 40th birthday later this month, and has said that since becoming a mother of three she feels like she’s earned a night of partying that will leave her with a “really good hangover” the following morning.

Still an item: The actors first met when Kate was pregnant with her eldest child 15 years ago through Danny's step sisters, who are also close to the blonde; seen in 2017

Asked how she plans to spend her birthday, she said: 'At this point, I just want to tell everybody, ‘Hey, I’m gonna have a party,’ and then everybody shows up.

'I personally, with having a baby, feel like I deserve a really good hangover. I’ve been so good, I’ve been so busy. I’ve been breastfeeding like crazy and I just want some martinis. I want to sleep in. [That’d be] really nice.'

But despite wanting to unwind from the pressures of motherhood, Kate says she almost cries 'every day”' from watching her two sons dote on their little sister, who is her first child with boyfriend Danny Fujikawa.

She added: 'Seeing the boys with her … I feel like I tear up every day. To see [Ryder] with his sister and to be a real helper and for me to be able to walk away and go, ‘Hey, honey, can you just take the baby?’ And I turn around and I’m like, ‘Oh, my gosh.’

And the Bride Wars star says her family are 'so happy,' as although there’s a level of chaos at home, the 'energy is calm and loving.'

Speaking on Good Morning America, Kate said: 'I’ve been having babies a long time, let’s put it that way. But it’s good. Everyone’s so happy and I feel, right now … even though it’s chaotic, the energy is calm and loving and peaceful right now and I’m just in a great place.'"
"H&M’s profits fell 20 per cent in the third quarter of 2018, despite the Swedish brand recording a 9 per cent increase in sales, helped by a 32 per cent rise in online sales.

Revenue rose to SEK 64.800m (£5.59m) despite sales decreasing by 8 per cent in the US, French, Italian and Belgian markets because of “the implementation of new logistics systems”, costing around SEK 400m.

H&M has invested heavily in making its online and in-store offerings more seamless, in an effort to compete with online retailers like Asos and Zalando.

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.

The group has seen profits shrink and struggled to shift stock in recent years due to competition from both those brands, as well as high-street rivals such as Primark.

However, the company reassured investors on Thursday that it would not need to cut costs to move unsold clothing in spite of the quarterly dip in profit, and shares in H&M rose more than 11 per cent.

The fashion company’s CEO, Karl-Johan Persson, said: “The rapid changes in the fashion industry are continuing and the H&M group is in an exciting transitional period. Our transformation work has contributed to a gradual improvement in sales development with increased market share in most markets during the third quarter, particularly in Germany, Sweden, Eastern Europe, Russia and China.

“In the US, France, Italy and Belgium, however, store sales were negatively impacted by the problems that arose when we introduced new logistics systems in these markets. The new logistics systems are an essential part of our work to make our supply chain faster, more flexible and more efficient, and to continue the integration of stores and online.”

As of May this year, H&M had 4,801 stores in 69 countries and is looking to expand its reach even further.

In its nine-month report, the company announced that Uruguay will become a new store market in Autumn 2018 and that contemporary fashion brand COS (part of the H&M group) will launch online in China in Autumn 2018 as well.

The fashion brand has also recently launched new brand Afound both in stores and online in Sweden.

Meanwhile, the retailer is revamping its Swedish stores after being criticised for its cluttered environment. The company created a pilot store in Stockholm with a smaller range of clothes on show and an airier design, which features invitation-only events and where customers can order coffees while they shop.

H&M was recently accused of failing to pay the garment workers who supply its high-street stores a fair “living wage”.

The Clean Clothes Campaign (CCC) said the group had failed to meet a commitment it made in 2013 to ensure its suppliers would pay a living wage to around 850,000 textile workers by 2018.

However, the Swedish company said it had reached at least 600 factories and 930,000 garment workers with its fair living wage strategy.

A spokeswoman for H&M said: “There is no universally agreed level for living wages, and wage levels should be defined and set by parties on the labour market through fair negotiations between employers and workers representatives, not by Western brands.”

"The roots of the luxury watch industry run deep — back hundreds of years — and most brands today lean heavily on that heritage, believing that it gives their products a special appeal and legitimacy.

Current lines are dominated by what the industry calls “vintage-inspired” designs, often supported by archive stories linking products to historic events, like the Omega Speedmaster Professional that Buzz Aldrin wore on the Moon 50 years ago.

While growing exports have suggested that this strategy was working (they were up last year by 6.3 percent year-over-year, according to the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry), some brand experts have been warning for a while now that it leaves the next generation of consumers cold.

Elspeth Cheung, global valuation director for the BrandZ unit of the marketing research group Kantar Millward Brown, said the industry’s obsession with looking backward was a “ticking time bomb.”"
"One of the world's most recognisable fashion models has said the advent of social media has radically transformed the industry – with models struggling to get jobs if they do not have hefty social media followings.

Natalia Vodianova, a Russian supermodel whose nickname is Supernova, said the rising influence of social media has seen a far greater emphasis on personality over beauty since the industry.

But the 35-year-old – who had a seven-figure contract with Calvin Klein – said this shift had not manifested itself among catwalk models and it had instead moved in the other direction.

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.

“When it comes to the catwalk, unfortunately, you see that kind of ‘ideal’ of very, very skinny girls who have an edge, a look, but it’s not really about personality,” Vodianova told The Independent.

“Even from my time when in fact girls were more themselves, we were allowed to smile, breathe and try to do our thing on the catwalk, even fifteen years ago. Now it’s more faceless. It’s not about them - the character - but the character imposed by the designer.”

Vodianova – who was the world’s third highest earning model in 2012 and is currently ranked by models.com as one of the fashion industry’s New Supers – said the proliferation of social media has changed the whole fashion industry.

“For young models, it’s really, really hard. It’s really hard without this following. I know a lot of brands are asking models how many followers they have – this dictates whether they get the job or not.

“It’s interesting because that means personality is celebrated and it’s not really about the brand's ideal of the, let’s say, face. It’s crazy because very beautiful girls, or whatever that means, will miss out and the job will go out to someone who is very charismatic and funny and has a lot of personality. Some people find it unfair but I think it’s interesting.”

The model, who does a range of campaigning work, noted the “competitive” nature of this shift but said it allowed for a greater diversity of models.

She argued the growing influence of social media has led the industry to embrace a greater range of body shapes but it still had a long way to go.

“A lot of it is forced by social media and by the fact more and more of these conversations are surfacing. The industry sort of follows it like a trend. Unfortunately, it is still not normalised enough.

“The issues of one type of body and perfection are changing a lot because we now see consumers wanting to see more diversity,” she added. “Big influencers and the brands themselves now have a great presence on social media so they can hear from their consumers directly about what works and what does not. I think this is really positive.”

She added: “Influence has gone from the industry-at-large to a mix of important influencers. The newcomers and Instagram stars mean it is a very different landscape. It’s very interesting.”

But she said the issue of body diversity has yet to revolutionise the world of catwalk high fashion – noting such designers create their clothes with slim women in mind.

“That is the way they want to see it. But then often what is in the catwalk is not what you find in the shop,” she said.

Asked whether she thought this provided a negative role model for young girls, she said the responsibility needed to lie with designers rather than the models themselves.

“What is it to do with catwalk models? We can’t blame catwalk models. They are beautiful. And they are often very healthy. They are naturally skinny,” she said. “Whether there should be more diversity, that is another story. A lot of these girls and a lot of these models were born this way. I was born this way so I can speak on their behalf.”

She called for a greater variety of female body types to be represented on the catwalk. “There will always be a place for girls who are naturally slim, but I would love to see more beautiful, curvy women on the catwalk. I see a lot of these shows and I think it should be more like in real life.”

Vodianova joined the United Nations Population Fund to lead a global symposium on tackling the taboos surrounding women’s health around the world in Antalya in Turkey on Thursday and Friday of this week. The event, called “Let’s Talk!”, was powered by her digital charitable platform Elbi and run in conjunction with the United Nations sexual and reproductive health agency.

“Too often women’s health issues go unheard and unnoticed because of unwarranted stigmas and taboos which have let far too many women down for generations,” she said.

She said the global issue of period poverty was close to her heart – revealing she was subject to fierce trolling after sharing a photo of herself holding a sanitary pad with her two million Instagram followers.

The model said she received around 5,000 comments in less than ten hours and the reaction of Russian women to the image was “crazy”.

“Most of it was harsh criticism saying ‘How can you do this? There are teenagers following you. Why don’t you start posting pictures sitting on the toilet? Why don’t you post toilet paper?’ I could not believe my eyes. I am not used to so much hate and criticism thrown my way.”

“Then I thought this is really cool actually. iIt proves my point that these conversations are so important. I just did not realise this shame and stigma was so close to home in Russia.”"
"Save the turtles! There’s no arguing that our modern world has a plastics problem: A stunning 18 billion pounds gets dumped into the ocean each year, wreaking havoc on marine ecosystems.

So rather than contributing to the plastic waste, try and do the exact opposite. Why not splash in the sea this summer with a clean conscience, in an (environmentally) clean swimsuit?

This week, Madewell launched its first ever sustainable swimwear line called “Second Wave,” composed of 32 bathing suit styles for women. Ranging from fun prints (stripes or florals) to classic solids, the pieces retail at friendly price points of $100 or less.

The entire collection has stopped approximately 50,920 bottles from entering landfills or the ocean so far: A one-piece suit is equal to about eight bottles, while the ‘kinis are equal to four.

Upcycling plastic water bottles isn’t an entirely new idea — Patagonia has been doing this since ’93, and Everlane recently got into the business with its ReNew line — but it’s notable that a brand like Madewell, whose original ethos isn’t based in sustainability, has hopped on the trend.

It’s part of a growing trend of fashion brands adopting sustainable practices."
"Press Release – Tourism Industry Aotearoa

New research offers more incentive for tourism businesses to become more sustainable and share their efforts with international visitors, Tourism Industry Aotearoa says8 July 2019

Tourism businesses can encourage sustainable behaviour among travellers

New research offers more incentive for tourism businesses to become more sustainable and share their efforts with international visitors, Tourism Industry Aotearoa says.

The research was carried out by the University of Canterbury and ChristchurchNZ, and funded by the Tourism Industry New Zealand Trust.

It found that international visitors to Canterbury believe environmental sustainability is important but tourism operators could be doing more to promote eco-friendly practices to travellers.

TIA Industry Strategy Manager Bruce Bassett says the research confirms the importance of tourism businesses acting sustainably.

“It provides evidence that visitors want to protect the environment in New Zealand but we need to make it easier for them to do so. If the tourism operator is sustainable then they can talk to the visitor about how they can support the business’ efforts.”

Almost 1200 New Zealand tourism businesses have now signed up to TIA’s New Zealand Tourism Sustainability Commitment, which is also supported by the Tourism Industry New Zealand Trust.

The TSC sets 14 commitments for tourism businesses to achieve environmental, economic, host community and visitor sustainability. They include objectives to reduce carbon; contribute to ecological restoration; reduce waste; and actively engage with visitors on the importance of restoring, protecting and enhancing New Zealand’s natural environment.

“By showing our visitors that we are taking responsibility for looking after our environment and communities, we can encourage them to follow our lead,” Mr Bassett says.

"Black Friday may be one of the biggest shopping days on the calendar, but it has also spawned a flurry of alternatives to the consumer frenzy from brands and charities.

Greenpeace has teamed up with partners including Fashion Revolution and Shareable to back Make Smthing week, during which artists and crafters lead workshops on creative ways to reuse, repair or recycle goods.

Events taking place over the weekend include ShareFest in Totnes, Festival of Sustainable Fashion in London’s Hackney and Leeds Community Clothes Exchange.

The Charities Aid Foundation is backing the UK’s efforts for global charity event Giving Tuesday on 27 November, which encourages people to do something for – or give something to – a charity they care about. Celebrities including blogger and Strictly Come Dancing participant Joe Sugg, Ricky Gervais and Martin Lewis are supporting the day which last year raised £213m online alone around the world.

In the UK, PayPal will match donations made on the day via its fundraising page or app up to a total of £50,000.

Some brands will also be supporting charitable efforts on the day including clothing chain FatFace, tea label Pukka Herbs and Pret a Manger.

Fatface will donate up to £100,000 of profits made over the weekend to charities including Nepal Appeal, the Prince’s Trust Tomorrow’s Talent programme and recycled swimwear maker Ocean Positive. It will also give the top 10 trading stores £2,000 each to donate to local community charities.

“The whole Black Friday thing is fake and customers are getting wise to it,” said FatFace boss Anthony Thompson.

“Bigger brands and retailers should look very hard at what they are doing. They are damaging the high streets and local independent traders who can’t compete with these fake promotions and customers are getting ripped off.”

However, FatFace was offering up to 50% discounts on its website on Friday.

Pret is giving the chance for customers to spread some cheer by handing out 300,000 free drink tokens over this week that can be handed on to someone in need. Pukka will be donating 100% of sales made via its own website from 23 November to 26 November to the Treesisters reforestation charity."

"Spanish group Inditex reported a 3pc rise in net income to €1.4bn for the six months to July 1 - its highest ever half-year result.

The world's largest clothing retailer said group like-for-like sales rose by 4pc and were higher across all regions including Europe and the UK, although this marks a slowdown on the 6pc growth seen a year earlier.

Net sales also reached a milestone, smashing past €12bn for the first time to hit €12.03bn.

It also estimates that like-for-like sales growth has picked up pace in the second half so far to between 4pc and 6pc, as it said its autumn/winter initial collections have been ""well received"".

The group's profits hike comes despite fears over an impact from the stronger euro, which had been expected to take its toll.

"Spanish group Inditex reported a 3% rise in net income to 1.4 billion euro (£1.2 billion) for the six months to July 1 – its highest ever half-year result.

The world’s largest clothing retailer said group like-for-like sales rose by 4% and were higher across all regions including Europe and the UK, although this marks a slowdown on the 6% growth seen a year earlier.

Net sales also reached a milestone, smashing past 12 billion euro (£10.7 billion) for the first time to hit 12.03 billion euro (£10.7 billion).

It also estimates that like-for-like sales growth has picked up pace in the second half so far to between 4% and 6%, as it said its autumn/winter initial collections have been “well received”.

The group’s profits hike comes despite fears over an impact from the stronger euro, which had been expected to take its toll.

"Press Release – Tourism Industry Aotearoa

New research offers more incentive for tourism businesses to become more sustainable and share their efforts with international visitors, Tourism Industry Aotearoa says8 July 2019

Tourism businesses can encourage sustainable behaviour among travellers

New research offers more incentive for tourism businesses to become more sustainable and share their efforts with international visitors, Tourism Industry Aotearoa says.

The research was carried out by the University of Canterbury and ChristchurchNZ, and funded by the Tourism Industry New Zealand Trust.

It found that international visitors to Canterbury believe environmental sustainability is important but tourism operators could be doing more to promote eco-friendly practices to travellers.

TIA Industry Strategy Manager Bruce Bassett says the research confirms the importance of tourism businesses acting sustainably.

“It provides evidence that visitors want to protect the environment in New Zealand but we need to make it easier for them to do so. If the tourism operator is sustainable then they can talk to the visitor about how they can support the business’ efforts.”

Almost 1200 New Zealand tourism businesses have now signed up to TIA’s New Zealand Tourism Sustainability Commitment, which is also supported by the Tourism Industry New Zealand Trust.

The TSC sets 14 commitments for tourism businesses to achieve environmental, economic, host community and visitor sustainability. They include objectives to reduce carbon; contribute to ecological restoration; reduce waste; and actively engage with visitors on the importance of restoring, protecting and enhancing New Zealand’s natural environment.

“By showing our visitors that we are taking responsibility for looking after our environment and communities, we can encourage them to follow our lead,” Mr Bassett says.

"Eco fit: dump your plastic water bottle and wear sustainable clothing

Seven ways for you to make your workout more eco-friendly this summer BelfastTelegraph.co.uk If you've already cut down on your meat consumption, carry a reusable coffee cup and always separate your recycling, then you might want to consider the impact your gym routine is having on the environment too. https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/life/features/seven-ways-for-you-to-make-your-workout-more-ecofriendly-this-summer-38334879.html https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/life/features/article38334878.ece/a7979/AUTOCROP/h342/2019-07-23_lif_52017793_I1.JPG

If you've already cut down on your meat consumption, carry a reusable coffee cup and always separate your recycling, then you might want to consider the impact your gym routine is having on the environment too.

As great as a sweaty workout can be on a personal level, there are plenty of elements to exercise that may not be all that sustainable - which most of us don't even realise.

Given that the Government has pledged to make the UK the first major economy to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, finding ways to reduce your individual carbon footprint has never been more pressing. And with the war on plastic raging on, many of us are thinking about how we can make our lifestyles more gentle on the planet.

That doesn't mean you have to give up your journey to sculpting a summer six-pack altogether, but a few simple swaps could help make your gym game a lot greener...

1. Choose sustainable workout gear

Popular performance fabrics like nylon and polyester might look great in the weights room, but they require a lot of energy to create and aren't biodegradable. Thanks to celebs like Emma Watson and Rooney Mara though, the sustainable fashion market is growing - and the same goes for gym gear.

Peak + Flow (peakandflow.com) are a running brand that create all the essentials (tanks, sports bras, leggings) from recycled materials like ocean plastic and eucalyptus pulp. After two years of use, you can send your worn-out kit back and they'll recycle it for you, while gifting you a shop discount in return.

BAM (bambooclothing.co.uk), meanwhile, create super comfy yoga gear that's made from biodegradable bamboo cotton, which is naturally moisture-wicking, breathable and antibacterial too."

"This disparity in revenue growth suggests Cotton On's Australian business is performing strongly relative to its offshore siblings, as well as most of its Australian-based competitors.

Cautious consumer spending

IBISWorld forecast the local clothing retailing industry would grow at an annualised rate of just 2 per cent for the five years through 2018-19, as it battled cautious consumer spending, intense competition and rising rent costs.

However the profitability of Cotton On's Australian business is unknown as it operates under a series of discretionary and unit trust structures with no requirement to file statutory financials.

A Cotton On spokeswoman said lower initial returns were ""expected"" as the group expanded its footprint in Brazil, Namibia, Thailand, the UK and the US, where over 140 stores have opened since 2009.

Cotton On was also a newcomer to many of these markets in comparison to global giants like Zara and H & M, said IBISWorld analyst Hayley Munro-Smith, making competing with their established supply chains and brand loyalty an expensive proposition.

Cotton On's spokesperson said the past financial year had also seen a ""significant shift in channels"", with sales through Cotton On's own websites and third-party marketplaces becoming a much bigger driver of group revenue. Online sales are booked to both the Australian and international businesses but the split is undisclosed.

In time for the Christmas rush, Cotton On recently opened a 35,000-square-metre automated distribution and fulfilment centre at Avalon Airport, for which it partnered with Linfox and invested $40 million.

Founded in Geelong in 1991 by Neil Austin, now an AFR Rich Lister, the Cotton On group operates the Cotton On, Cotton On Body, Cotton On Kids, Factorie and Supre clothing brands, the Rubi footwear brand and Typo stationery brand.

This year it launched a loyalty program across all seven, which had had more than three million sign-ups worldwide, ecommerce chief Brendan Sweeney told July's Online Retailer conference.

Three new brands have also just been launched - Rubi Beauty, a new kids line called Sunny Buddy, and travel accessories brand Lost.

Such multichannel strategies and niche markets would be required to flourish in the fashion retailing industry, which would only grow more competitive with the entrance of more offshore players, IBISWorld said in its August 2018 report into the sector.

It forecast annualised growth in the clothing retail business to slow to 1.9 per cent out to 2023-24."
"With the numbers of women wanting to know that the brands they are buying are environmentally friendly on a sharp incline, it’s safe to say that ‘tis the season to be mindful when it comes to your party dressing. Cue Amy Powney’s 22-piece eveningwear capsule collection for Mother of Pearl.

London-based Powney is a rising star on the fashion scene and is known for her frank approach when it comes to sustainability, admitting that “fundamentally we all need to stop shopping”. She is also, however, respected for her realism and is one of a growing fleet of designers who promote the philosophy to “buy less and buy better”.

As the creative director at MOP, she has made it her mission to equip herself with the research and knowledge that allows the brand to deliver sustainable and ethical collections that still have star appeal (Gwyneth Paltrow, Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Laura Jackson are fans). To create her new eveningwear collection, she started to develop her own fabrics to dispel the notion of “hempy, hippy” clothes and “offer a more elevated product to show what can be done under a sustainable umbrella”.

Mother of Pearl: 'I struggled coming into the fashion industry – I’m not a natural fit' Read more

Her design ethos has always revolved around a day-to-night identity, which delivers fashion that can easily adapt to myriad occasions. It is a mood she has extended to the capsule collection, which comprises high-neck, asymmetric and bateau-neck dresses in black, beige, red and floral prints, strap tops, tailored trousers, coats and blazers. Featuring the brand’s signature dropped-shoulder and pearl-embellished ruching, Powney says the idea is to feel comfortable as well as special, reflecting the sentiment that “women have got to a point where they dress for themselves rather than onlookers”. To hit her message home, however, another shift in perception needs to happen in tandem.

“What needs to change more than anything, specifically with eveningwear, is the idea you can only wear a dress to an event once and then [have to] put it away because you feel like you can’t wear it again in case someone says something mean about it, which is totally driven by the media and advertising,” says Powney. She wants her customers to “buy something, look after it and treasure it” without being worried that it’s going to go into sale a few weeks later, which her core product never does. For one-off black-tie outfits, she cites rental sites such as Renttherunway.com as a good option.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest “Women have got to a point where they dress for themselves rather than onlookers”: Amy Powney

It’s the second step in MOP’s No Frills campaign, which saw Powney and her team spend the past three years drilling down on the brand’s supply chain so that they could start to understand what can be a very opaque and complex process.

“I decided that we were going to work it out for ourselves, so we went and met with farmers and spinners and weavers to try to piece the supply chain together so we could see how it works, what the environmental and ethical impacts are along the way, what can we do to improve it and what fabric companies are legit and sustainable and who are not,” she says. As such, all her pieces, including the new capsule (with prices ranging from £350 to £995), are made from Italian fabrics in Portugal, and Powney has eyes on everything. Off the back of her findings, she is in the process of visiting publications and fashion houses to give them bitesize lessons on how to judge if a brand really is sustainable or is missing the point entirely.

“Lots of people don’t understand what sustainability really means … it’s not just the factory where something is made … the biggest environmental impact happens before that, when it’s being grown or synthetically produced.”

The next plan is to have sustainability “infiltrate into the office and the entire brand, from a single-use plastic ban [to] packaging”, says Powney. “There are aways things you can improve; we just take every decision we need to make and try to make the one with best practices.”

"Courtesy of the latest round of what seems to be the interminable conveyor belt of London Fashion Week, we know that beige is the new black — but the law around the industry is nothing like as simple.

Concerns about sustainability and proposals for a tax to support clothing recycling marked the end of the catwalk fest. But they just added to a thicket of legislation and monitoring crowding around the fashion sector, like paparazzi.

For example, fashionistas tweeting to millions of followers in recent days about their favourite designs must be frank about their links to brands. “New guidance from the Competition and Markets Authority reinforces that celebrities must make disclosures upfront about their relationship to the product,” says Jason Rawkins of the law…"
"Just in time for spring cleaning — and Earth Day — Target Corp. has launched an expansive line of household cleaners and paper products made with biological or recycled materials and natural fibers.

The new line, known as Everspring, has been more than a year in the making and will offer about 70 different items when the rollout is complete.

Products include laundry detergent, dish soap, napkins, paper towels, candles and essential oils. The retailer plans to price the merchandise about 20% lower than comparable brand-name products such as Mrs. Meyers and Seventh Generation.

""It's a big step in a category where we haven't done as much owned-brand development,"" said Christina Hennington, a Target senior vice president who oversees merchandise such as essentials and beauty.

""It takes a long time to build the expertise — to source and develop, and do the chemistry behind the formulations as well as the packaging,"" she said.

Target Corp. has been rolling out in-house brands at lightning speed since 2017, a strategic move aimed at regaining the trend-forward luster it lost during the recession, when consumers were focused on basics at a good price. By the end of this year, the Minneapolis-based retailer plans to have on its shelves 25 new brands that it either owns or are exclusive to it.

Target Corp. launched a line of earth-friendly products on April 22, 2019 called Everspring. It is one of the Minneapolis-based retailer’s first major foray into the natural products space, which has grown by double digits since 2016.

Many of the private-label brands have been in apparel or home, such as Cat & Jack children's clothing, Project 62 household decor and the new Stars Above sleepwear for women.

These owned brands, which are designed internally and sourced globally, have higher margins and also give the company more control over inventory, which is becoming increasingly important as customers gravitate to online and digital shopping.

With the launch of Everspring, the retailer is riding a trend driven by consumers who are increasingly pushing for products that are sustainably sourced, haven't been tested on animals, are free of chemicals and other toxins and take less of a toll on the environment with their ingredients and packaging.

Target said its natural-products category has grown by double digits since 2016. That growth has been driven in large part by the retailer's core market of millennials — now ages 23 to 38, according to the Pew Research Center's demarcations — who are buying homes, starting families and rising the career ladder.

A Nielsen survey in 2015 found that 73% of millennials around the world are willing to pay extra for sustainable offerings, up from 50% the year before.

Everspring is one of Target's first entries into the natural products space. Target's Hennington said the retailer designed labels, bottles and packaging to be ""counter worthy"" and to feel like a cohesive product line. The retailer's chemists worked up scents such as a mandarin and ginger all-purpose cleaner, a lavender and bergamot cleaning wipe and geranium and herbs liquid hand soap.

The line also includes a scent-free option.

About half the product line was available in stores nationwide on Monday with more products rolling out in the months ahead.

The launch includes a website with more detailed information about the ingredients and uses. The products align with an initiative called Target Clean, that uses signs in stores and on target.com to help shoppers find products that don't contain harmful chemicals.

The launch of Everspring gives Target another offering in the household essentials aisles. Last October, Target launched its Smartly brand aimed at budget-conscious consumers. Up and Up, which launched in 2009, is positioned to go head-to-head with national brands.

Everspring, with items priced between $2.79 and $11.99, adds an Earth-friendly offering to that mix in hopes of bringing in shoppers for higher-margin offerings.

""When we think about what drives guests to Target, it's often the things they need regularly, like toilet paper and laundry detergent,"" Hennington said. ""And when they're at Target, they enjoy the breadth of what we have, whether that's apparel, the home decor section, candy or seasonal goods."""
"Within a year of launching his men's clothing line, Christian Kimber has been crowned Australian's best new designer.

The Melbourne-based designer behind the eponymous label beat five other finalists to claim the National Designer Award on Friday.

British-born and raised, Kimber moved to Melbourne with his Australian wife in 2011 and began designing men's footwear and accessories.

In 2018 he introduced clothing to his label with the goal of ""redefining"" Australian menswear.

""Australian men, in my experience, don't just wear board shorts and singlets, but it's not really formal suits and ties either,"" Kimber told AAP.

""I consider our label to fill in the grey area in between - not too formal, not too casual.""

Kimber's prizes include $10,000 cash, business mentoring and a spot in a Melbourne Fashion Festival runway show presented by the competition's main sponsor David Jones.

He hopes the award will help drive the brand's expansion in Australia and overseas.

""For the Australian fashion industry to say 'that's amazing Christian we love what you're doing', it's made me feel more confident about myself and our business to grow,"" Kimber said.

""I'd like to start wholesale again and I would love to meet some American and European buyers as well. Maybe David Jones might be interested in us now too,"" he said.

David Jones head of menswear Chris Wilson said this year's competition included the most menswear designers in the award's history, reflecting the growth of the menswear category.

""Men are becoming more fashion conscious and experimenting with expressing their personal style so there is a constant demand for new and unique brands,"" he said.

""Christian Kimber has established a foundation of high-quality, easy-to-wear, enduring pieces complemented by bolder statement pieces - the perfect mix for the modern gentleman's wardrobe.""

The other finalists for the award were BLAIRARCHIBALD, Chris Ran Lin, Double Rainbouu and MNDATORY.

The only women's label in the competition - Arnsdorf - won the inaugural sustainability prize.

On the day, the girls both appeared in high spirits, with Robyn taking to Instagram to share a selfie of the two together.

'Look at this babe,' Robyn captioned the snap, which was shared to her story.

Marina Rinaldi is a brand that offers clothing and accessories for 'curvy women.'

Robyn meanwhile, has long been open about her thoughts on the fashion industry and the use of the term 'plus-size.'

The stunner - who is an Australian size 12-14 - is a strong advocate for body positivity.

In November last year, she told Marie Claire Australia that the term 'plus-size' is 'detrimental and damaging.'

'I have been called Australia's top plus-size model, but I would never use that label to describe myself,' Robyn said.

'I find the term detrimental and damaging because girls will compare their bodies to mine and think, 'If she's plus-size, what does that make me?' Some brands only go up to a size 12, which is ridiculous because the national average women's size in Australia is 14-16.'

However, the mother-of-one praised the fashion industry, saying that she thinks that there is more 'diversity' on the runway."
"Press Release – Earthwise

Earthwise is proud to announce it will be introducing 75% recycled plastic bottles across its environmental cleaning range as part of its commitment to the New Zealand Plastic Packaging Declaration. Starting with 1L laundry liquid bottles, 75% of each …Earthwise is proud to announce it will be introducing 75% recycled plastic bottles across its environmental cleaning range as part of its commitment to the New Zealand Plastic Packaging Declaration. Starting with 1L laundry liquid bottles, 75% of each bottle will be made from plastic sourced from recycled milk, juice and water bottles. The new bottles will be manufactured in New Zealand and will be seen on shelf from October 2018.

Joining other Kiwi-based businesses, Earthwise has pledged to support the New Zealand Plastic Packaging Declaration, making a commitment that 100% of its packaging is recyclable, reusable or compostable by 2025 or earlier.

Owner and director of Earthwise, Jamie Peters, says the business is committed to reducing its use of virgin plastic in its packaging. “Making the pledge was easy for us because our bottles are already recyclable but given New Zealand’s current plastic packaging problem we know an effective solution must include more than just recycling. Kiwi companies need to take greater responsibility for the materials they are putting into the environment and we are working hard to ensure we are doing this.”

Jamie adds, “We’ve started with our 1L laundry liquid bottles and will include 75% recycled content into all bottles across our household cleaning range by mid-2019. But that’s just the first step. We’re also working on launching 100% recycled bottles across our personal care brands, Earthwise Nourish and Glow Lab.”

“You will notice a slight change in colour of our bottles as they become more eco-friendly,” he says.

Earthwise is also one of ten leading businesses backing a diagnostic study of New Zealand’s entire plastic packaging system. The study is being completed by the Sustainable Business Network’s Circular Economy Accelerator (CEA), and has widespread support from across the packaging sector. It will help identify what is needed for a circular economy approach to plastic.

“It’s important that we manage the full life cycle of plastic, not just at the end of the process, so that all plastic can be reused instead of sent to landfill. We know that we can’t tackle the plastics issue alone and are proud to be part of the ground swell of change,” says Jamie.

"JUST Water, which is backed by celebrity investors including the Smiths, Lionel Ritchie and DJ Calvin Harris, hopes to take market share by promoting its environmentally friendly packaging.

""Our aim is to become the most prominent and recognised sustainable water in Australia by offering people an alternative to the default plastic packaging for water,"" said chief executive Ira Laufer.

""We're not just another bottled water that's launching in the market,"" Mr Laufer told The Australian Financial Review.

""It brings something incremental, innovative and unique [to the category] and is addressing plastic pollution concerns,"" he said.

JUST Water launches this weekend in Woolworths and 7-Eleven stores and hotels such as Novotel in Melbourne, backed by a social media campaign and in-store appearances by 20-year old Jaden Smith, who starred in The Pursuit of Happyness, a remake of The Karate Kid and Netflix series The Get Down.

Mr Smith is said to have been inspired to create an environmentally friendly alternative to plastic water bottles after coming across mounds of plastic while surfing in Hawaii.

JUST Water is also using the Slades Beverages bottling facility as a base from which to launch into south-east Asia, starting with Singapore and Hong Kong.

The launch may increase pressure on CCA and rival Asahi to switch to more sustainable packaging. CCA announced earlier this month that all single-serve bottles of still water would be made from 100 per cent recycled plastic.

Woolworths category manager Justin Heffernan said customers were seeking more sustainable packaging options and JUST Water was sure to be a hit.

Mr Laufer said there was nothing to stop other bottled water brands from switching to plant-based packaging to appeal to environment-conscious consumers.

The Made Group, for example, uses Tetra Pak cartons for Cocobella coconut water. CCA and its 30 per cent shareholder, The Coca-Cola Co, acquired a 45 per cent stake in Made Group last October.

""Competition is good. I think every company should launch sustainable products,"" he said.

""I've seen another brand in Woolworths made out of paper [packaging] - I'm glad to see the sector is growing and I'd love to see every brand out there launching sustainable packaging.""

""Our goal is more at a global level to create more education and awareness and grow the category.""

JUST Water sales doubled in the US last year - boosted by partnerships with airlines, schools, hotels, colleges and cruise ships - and the company is aiming to grow sales threefold this year after launching in the UK last August.

JOHANNESBURG - A few months ago, we hosted a business forum focusing on the clothing, textile, leather and footwear sector, which, while once thriving, has been decimated over the years by the flood of cheap imported garments. Thanks to a commitment to increased localisation by many of our major retailers, the clothing sector specifically is showing signs of a revival.

Our cotton industry is being re- established. Young designers are being given opportunities, and there is hope for the sector's continued upturn.

Now, as part of an import replacement programme on which we are working and where we are relying heavily on the DTI (Department of Trade and Industry) for support, we are looking at shoes.

The DTI sector classification rather quaintly includes ""gaiters"", but I think this is a segment on which we can safely allow the sun to set, as no one seems to know what gaiters are!

Here are some astonishing statistics on South Africa and our shoes, which seem to suggest that there is an Imelda Marcos in all of us.

In 2009 we collectively bought 260million pairs of shoes, of which we produced only 18million locally. Between April 2017 and March this year we imported shoes worth R3.3bn.

Thanks to ongoing DTI-led efforts to save the sector, the 18million pairs produced in 2009 rose last year to 75million, with an ambitious target set by the DTI of 100million pairs over the next year or so.

According to a report compiled by B&M Analysts as part of the research that contributed to a draft retail Clothing, Textiles, Footwear and Leather Masterplan that is scheduled for release by the DTI soon, the country’s footwear sector employs nearly 10000 people, with the capacity to support many more jobs if our retailers were to commit to procuring their footwear locally, as many have done with textiles and clothing.

A number of the local companies that are still in business are family- established enterprises that have been going for many years.

Some have also carved out a niche for themselves in safety and industrial protective footwear and shoes for the police and military.

One Proudly South African member company, Palm Footwear, specialises in school shoes.

Some have made names for themselves as bespoke hand crafters of fine shoes, in the old-fashioned way.

Shoe-making requires skills that we still have - the SA Footwear and Leather Export Council has about 150 members, but as its name suggests, they are all about accessing external markets.

Some of the supply-side lessons that have come out of the B&M Analysts’ research include more support for skills development as well as a greater investment in the sector in general and in the upgrade of manufacturing facilities.

There is also a need for design and product development support, and in that design process we need to find a real value-chain differentiator that will allow our domestic shoe sector to thrive once again.

For example, we are a nation of takkie wearers.

We know there are young designers who are exploiting our love for this style, and designing and making cutting-edge canvas shoes.

We make sandals from our animal hides, our beautiful printed fabrics and many other materials, demonstrating our resourcefulness and creativity.

There is room for more.

I have to pay tribute in my customary song to HHP, who we lost so tragically last week.

The song is Bosso ke Mang who's the boss?

Well, we are the bosses of our own economy, and by producing and buying local we can take back the future direction of the local footwear industry.

In the same way as we have worked hard with retailers on clothes, we are starting the fight to promote local footwear.

With a market that has such a high demand, we are encouraging all local shoemakers to come and be part of the “buy local movement”, and Proudly South African will support you every step of the way (pun intended!).

Watch the trends, be on point, concentrate on quality, and there is a market out there just waiting to be tapped.

Eustace Mashimbye is the chief executive of Proudly SA.

"Target is making its largest foray into selling food under its own brand, as it it attempts to energize grocery sales.

On Sept. 15, the discount chain will introduce 650 products to its grocery shelves under the brand Good & Gather. That will expand to 2,000 private label supermarket products by late next year.

At the same time, Target is phasing out its house food brands Archer Farms and Simply Balanced, as well as reducing its Market Pantry line. The company expects that Good & Gather to be a multi-billion dollar business by the end of next year.

The goods sold under the new brand range from pastas and meat to milk and eggs. Target said Monday the products will not have artificial flavors, synthetic colors, artificial sweeteners, or high fructose corn syrup.

The launch builds on Target's food and beverage business momentum, which includes seven straight quarters of sales growth at established stores and six straight quarters of market share growth with gains across almost every category of food.

It's also part of the retailer's broader effort to expand in house brands, which typically carry higher profit margins. By the end of 2019, Target will have more than 25 exclusive brands, including its children's clothing label Cat & Jack and men's clothing brand Goodfellow & Co.

Industry analysts say Target has to become more competitive in the grocery aisles.

""The new label is a major step forward that introduces excitement and interest to the food department,"" says Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail. ""Good & Gather both creates a more cohesive and compelling food offering as well as being a platform for the launch of some new and interesting lines which should entice consumers.""

As temperatures continue to soar, there's still time to find your perfect fan. We've tracked down six of the best still available to buy — including the one seen in photographs taken at Buckingham Palace yesterday."
"Fee G, a label run by husband and wife team Don Gormley and Fiona Heaney, has been shortlisted for the coveted 'Womenswear Fashion Brand of the Year' category.

Organised by 'Drapers Record', the acknowledged bible of the fashion retail scene, the awards recognise the best independent fashion retailers and brands throughout the UK and Ireland.

Set up 15 years ago, fee G has been shortlisted in the category alongside international brands such as Barbour, Gianni and Essentiel Antwerp. They will be judged on their performance, margins, after-sales service, most improved line and most commercial direction.

The success of the Ballymount-based label means it has a loyal customer following and the designs are worn by Susanna Reid on ITV, Hannah Vaughan Jones on CNN, Nuala Carey on RTÉ and president's wife Sabina Higgins.

Fiona, the creative director and designer, said: ""This is an exciting time for the fee G brand, which is evolving, and we are focused on international growth.

""The deliveries of our AW19 collection start this week and it is an exciting time for the company in a very challenging industry.

""Brexit has been going on for so long, timescale plans keep moving, but we have always focused on designing and delivering great collections and will continue to do this in the midst of Brexit.""

Meanwhile, Cairenn Foy from Sandymount has been shortlisted for the 'Best New Brand' category for her range of luxury children's clothing, and she is fortunate to have her very own house model, her daughter Ava (5).

The growing childrenswear trend is heavily influenced by Princess Charlotte-style traditional dresses and cardigans, a style that has certainly helped sales of Cairenn's lace-embellished and smocked dresses.

"Donatella Versace to stay on at Italian label and US fashion group to rebrand as Capri

Versace has been sold to the US clothing and handbags group Michael Kors for $2.1bn (£1.64bn) in the latest example of a family-owned European brand taken under the control of a global fashion conglomerate.

Michael Kors, which last year bought London shoemaker Jimmy Choo for almost £900m, confirmed on Tuesday that it had bought Versace and would fold all three brands into a new company called Capri Holdings – named after the favourite holiday island of wealthy fashionistas.

The deal will cement the fortunes of the heirs of Gianni Versace, the designer who founded the label 40 years ago and built its reputation by dressing some of the world’s most glamorous women, including Princess Diana, Demi Moore and Elizabeth Hurley.

The family owns 80% of the business, with Gianni Versace’s niece Allegra Versace Beck, 32, holding a 40% stake worth €732m (£654m). Allegra’s mother and Gianni’s sister, Donatella Versace, holding 16%, and Gianni’s older brother Santo owning 24%.

Q&A Who is Michael Kors? Show Hide Michael Kors quit studying at New York’s acclaimed Fashion Institute of Technology just nine months after enrolling in 1977 when he was offered the chance to sell his own designs at Manhattan’s Lothar’s boutique, where he had a part-time job. Kors – born Karl Anderson Jr – soon had his designs in Bergdorf Goodman, Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus and Bloomingdale’s. However, his company filed for bankruptcy protection in 1993, after a partner firm stopped selling his lower-priced designs under licence. The company was revived by an investment from LVMH, which was part of a deal when Kors joined as the group’s Céline brand as creative director. Kors floated the company on the NYSE in 2011. The shares soared in 2014, making Kors a billionaire. In recent years his signature tote bags, with gold MK swing fobs have become the brand’s trademark – at around £250 they are seen as affordable luxury. However, the company has been struggling with falling sales and in 2017 announced plans to close 125 stores to re-establish the label as a more exclusive brand.

The family, who inherited the company after the murder of Versace outside his Miami mansion in 1997, will maintain a €150m stake in Capri Holdings. US private equity firm Blackstone, which bought 20% of Versace in 2014, will sell all of its holding.

Donatella Versace, 63, who is Versace’s vice-president and artistic director, has committed to stay on at Capri Holdings and “lead the company’s creative vision”.

“This is a very exciting moment for Versace,” she said. “It has been more than 20 years since I took over the company along with my brother Santo and daughter Allegra. I am proud that Versace remains very strong in both fashion and modern culture. Versace is not only synonymous with its iconic and unmistakable style, but with being inclusive and embracing of diversity, as well as empowering people to express themselves.”

She said the family believed that Versace had to be sold in order for the brand to “reach its full potential”. “We believe that being part of this group is essential to Versace’s long-term success,” she said. “My passion has never been stronger. This is the perfect time for our company, which puts creativity and innovation at the core of all of its actions, to grow.”

John Idol, chairman and chief executive of Michael Kors, said buying Versace was an important milestone for the US company and that creating a “family of luxury brands” would deliver shareholders “multiple years of revenue and earnings [profits] growth”.

Michael Kors, which was founded by its namesake designer in 1981, is closing more than 100 stores and streamlining its products to reposition the brand as a more luxurious label. Kors is a minority shareholder of Michael Kors Holdings with US investment firms holding the largest stakes.

“For over 40 years, Versace has represented the epitome of Italian fashion luxury, a testament to the brand’s timeless heritage,” Idol said. “With the full resources of our group, we believe that Versace will grow to [sales of] over $2bn [up from $509m in 2016, the latest year available].

“We believe that the strength of the Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo brands, and the acquisition of Versace, position us to deliver multiple years of revenue and earnings growth.” The company said it would increase the number of Versace shops from 200 to 300, and would increase the share of revenue raised from accessories and footwear from 35% to 60%.

Idol said Donatella Versace’s “iconic style” would remain at the heart of Versace’s design aesthetic.

However, fans of Versace took to Instagram and Twitter to implore the family to reconsider and not sell the brand. “Don’t let MKors buy any % of Versace. He will ruin it. He will kill it,” one person commented on Versace’s official Instagram account.

“You sell off your heritage and Gianni’s memory for decadent money. I really hope you don’t, but if it’s so, I will never buy from you anymore,” another person wrote.

femme fatale (@eliesaaab) ""Michael Kors is reportedly set to buy Versace for $2 billion this week"" Gianni Versace sweetie, I’m so sorry

Donatella Versace said the company’s decision to become shareholders in Capri Holdings “demonstrates our belief in the long-term success of Versace and commitment to this new global fashion luxury group.”

The takeover of Versace follows the sale of several other independent high-end brands to large conglomerates. Dior was sold to French group Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH), which owns Louis Vuitton, for $13bn last year. French billionaire François-Henri Pinault’s Kering group assumed full control of Gucci in 2004 and also owns Yves Saint Laurent, Balenciaga, Alexander McQueen and Bottega Veneta.

This summer Italy’s Missoni family sold a 41% stake in the eponymous brand to a private equity venture backed by the Italian state for €70m, and Belgian designer Dries Van Noten sold a majority stake to Spanish luxury group Puig.

Chanel is the last major European luxury brand to remain in private hands. The company is owned by brothers Alain and Gérard Wertheimer, grandsons of Pierre Wertheimer an early business partner of Gabrielle Bonheur “Coco” Chanel.

Michael Kors said the Capri Holdings name was “inspired by the fabled island which has long been recognised as an iconic, glamorous and luxury destinations”. It said the island’s Faraglioni three-rock formations that juts out from the island’s coast would act as a symbol of the “timeless heritage and strong foundation that is at the core pf each of the three founder-led brands in our global fashion luxury group”."

Una Healy and Emeli Sande rubbed shoulders with supermodels as they took to the catwalk for Oxfam’s show during London Fashion Week.

The music stars joined top models such as Stella Tennant and Laura Bailey at the Fashion Fighting Poverty event at Ambika P3 in London.

All the models showcased Oxfam clothes – which were picked by stylist Bay Garnett from the organisation’s online and high street shops – in a bid to highlight sustainable fashion.

Emeli Sande (Aaron Chown/PA)

Garnett said: “I’m styling this show for a very simple reason. I love clothes, and the opportunity to work with them in a way that can actually help people is so exciting.

“I get a lot of pleasure from knowing that.

“I love second-hand clothes, and I love Oxfam’s commitment to fighting poverty. This collaboration is a no-brainer for me.”

Stella Tennant (Aaron Chown/PA)

Fee Gilfeather, Oxfam’s sustainable fashion expert, said: “Here at Oxfam we never lose sight of the reason we sell fashion, which is to raise money to help the world’s poorest people.

“The clothes in Oxfam shops really do transform lives. A £10 dress can provide clean water for 10 people in an emergency.

“The outfits created by Bay illustrate beyond a shadow of doubt that our affordable, stylish clothes look incredible.

“Even better are the beautiful things they do, which is save lives and slow down fast fashion by giving clothes a second chance to be sold and prevent them blighting the environment in landfill. So, it’s clearly perfect shopping sense to buy our fashion!”

Tennant said the organisation was “a fabulous wardrobe of opportunity”. “I don’t like waste!” she added.

Laura Bailey (Aaron Chown/PA)

Oxfam works across many areas of fashion, collaborating with big brands to recycle and reuse stock, joining forces with fashion houses to improve conditions in their supply chains and fighting to improve garment workers’ rights.

All profits from the organisation’s fashion sales fund Oxfam’s work fighting poverty and suffering around the world.

"For Holt, this has meant an overhaul of design direction. Her first handbag collection for Oroton in February gave an insight into what to expect: a loosening up of sorts, more colour, different materials such as raffia and canvas, and sculptural shapes. A campaign image from Oroton's new clothing range. This week the brand will roll out its new look concept stores. The Canberra boutique, designed by architect Don McQualte, will be the first to reflect the new direction for the brand when it relaunches on August 9. On Thursday, Oroton will drop its first full range of apparel in stores, a seasonless and sophisticated collection of shirtdresses, trench coats and tailoring in fabrics such as linen, silk and leather. The brand has previously only ever dabbled in ready-to-wear fashion.

It is undeniably courting a younger, fashionable clientele, and Holt is aware that may mean losing some customers. ""Always in this situation you lose some, but you will keep a lot too ... and it's about setting the brand up for a sustainable future. For that you need to have younger customers."" A campaign image from Oroton's new clothing range. The aesthetic for the new clothing line is a blend of what Holt calls ""utility"" and ""vintage"". Holt sees the clothing as the opportunity to tell the ""full story"" of the brand that she says is unlike anything else on the Australian market. The price points for the clothing sits above the high street, but below Australian designer.

""It's quite casual, quite seasonless, polished but relaxed. I think it looks international, but with the natural raw materials used and the resort element to the pieces it has an Australian feel to it,"" Holt says. Relevancy is something Holt thinks about a lot. It can be a delicate dance when taking on a brand with a storied history. ""You need to have an affinity with the soul of brand. [Oroton] has an iconic heritage that talks to quality craftsmanship, so you keep that. [But it's] less about relying on heritage these days. It's a lovely thing to have, but in these times of change it's about being releva A campaign image showing Oroton's new look bags and apparel collection. nt. It's taking the recipe of the craftsmanship and putting a fresh spin on it, making it modern and wantable and the history gives it a weight and strength ... and trust. It's a nice base from which you can grow a new story.""

With a long career in fashion, Holt is well aware of the industry's challenges. The market for the sweet spot of ""affordable luxury"" in which Oroton sits has become increasingly crowded and it's easy to access cult international brands such as Staud, Simon Miller, Wandler and Mansur Gavriel, not to mention local ones such as Status Anxiety and The Daily Edited (in 2018 The Daily Edited bought back the 30 per cent stake Oroton had invested in their brand the year prior). ""There are definitely a lot more independent brands now, "" says Holt. ""And you have to be as good as the international brands. ""I've never really been averse to a challenge ... it's actually really fun. I find it ene Loading rgising and exciting. The more focused you are on giving vision and direction, the stronger that will be and the better the results.""

Holt, who splits her time between Melbourne and Sydney, is feeling optimistic about the future for Oroton. ""We've all worked hard as a team, we've given it our best shot, that for me is really important. It's a tough market, I've been around long enough to know how hard it is. But [the collections] look strong,"" she says. ""I'm feeling very bright, I really am."""
"Written by Marianna Cerini, CNN

For almost 150 years, denim jeans have been the hardy stalwart of fashion -- practically everyone, everywhere, owns a pair.

They're tough and versatile, but also a major contributor to fashion's not-so-enviable reputation as one of the world's most polluting industries.

Now a British charity, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, is hoping to change that by encouraging clothing companies to sign up to its ""Jeans Redesign Guidelines"" -- and it could change the design of jeans as we know them.

For one, the list says metal rivets should be ""designed out"" or ""reduced to a minimum."" Metal rivets were the basis of the design patented by Levi Strauss in 1873. Known as the ""XX"" pants, they were later dubbed the 501. Rivets were originally used to reinforce the jeans in areas where they could be ripped apart, but modern stitching has made them purely decorative.

The new guidelines, which form part of the charity's Make Fashion Circular initiative, state that jeans should withstand at least 30 home washes, be made of ""cellulose fibers from regenerative, organic or transitional farming methods,"" and be free of hazardous chemicals. Sandblasting, stone finishing and the use of potassium permanganate (an oxidizing agent that fades denim) are also prohibited.

""The idea is to extend the life of your pair of jeans for as long as possible,"" said Make Fashion Circular's lead, Francois Souchet, in a phone interview, ""and (to) get everyone in the supply chain to start asking: 'How can this product be redesigned in its second life?' 'How do I lower its environmental impact and do so ethically?'""

A brief history of blue jeans

The history of modern-day blue jeans begins in 1853, when a Bavarian immigrant called Levi Strauss brought denim to America.

After moving to San Francisco to open his own dry goods business, Strauss started supplying the fabric to a Nevada tailor called Jacob Davis. The cloth proved popular among laborers, cowboys and miners, as it was better suited than traditional workwear to withstand harsh conditions. Davis went on to specialize in denim pants, and later created a pair reinforced by copper rivets placed at the pockets and flies.

The pants evolved over the course of the next century, shifting from blue-collar garments to navy uniforms, then to signifiers of youth rebellion and angst, pop culture and beatniks. They have enjoyed celebrity endorsements from the likes of John Wayne and Marlon Brando, Marilyn Monroe and James Dean, but also Elvis, Paul Newman, Jefferson Airplane, Marvin Gaye, Brooke Shields (in her iconic Calvin Kleins circa 1980), Tupac and Pharrell.

In their transformation, blue jeans have maintained an almost egalitarian appeal. They've been reinvented as luxury items and, almost simultaneously, fast fashion. In doing so, they've also taken up a major slice of apparel manufacturing -- and, ironically, given they were initially created as long-lasting garments, become quasi-disposable commodities.

""What was once meant to be one of the most durable items in our closets is now something that we buy and make in frankly disturbing volumes,"" said Anika Kozlowski, an assistant professor of fashion design, ethics and sustainability at Ryerson University in Toronto Canada. ""Which has led to significant environmental impacts.""

A high environmental cost

Traditionally, jeans are made with cotton. Although natural and biodegradable, the fiber comes from one of the world's ""thirstiest"" crops. In addition to the water needed to grow cotton, more is then used in dyeing, rinsing and finishing to achieve denim's classic look, which comes from weaving indigo-dyed cotton yarn (the warp) with white cotton (the weft).

Over its lifetime, a single pair of jeans can use up to 919 gallons of water , including production and washing, according to Levi's. Bleaching agents, enzymes and pesticides are also part of the process -- as is sandblasting, a denim-weathering technique used to achieve a ""distressed"" look.

This process involves blasting abrasive materials at high speed through an air compressor in order to clean and shape the denim's surface. It can have extremely harmful effects on both the environment and workers making the jeans. Sandblasting has been proved to cause silicosis, an incurable lung disease that is often fatal.

""Taking steps towards a more environmentally aware supply chain has become almost inevitable,"" Kozlowski said. ""There are just so many issues with the sector as it currently exists.""

The H&M Group, GAP, C&A, Lee Jeans and Reformation are some of the labels that have pledged to join Jeans Redesign. More are expected to follow, with the first garments created using the guidelines set to hit stores next year.

Levi's has not signed up, but the company -- and other big names including Wrangler's and G-Star Raw -- have taken steps to reduce their environmental impact, either by cutting water use, developing more sustainable blends or working with smaller manufacturing plants to ensure ethical cultivation and processing methods.

New technologies have been helping brands to overhaul their production and supply chains. Spanish mill Tejidos Roy, for instance, has created a water-free dye system, together with US-based Indigo Mill Designs and Gaston College Textile Technology Center, that uses 100% less water in dyeing, 89% fewer chemicals and 65% less energy.

""But that's still a tiny niche of the entire sector,"" said Dio Kurazawa, head of denim at the trend forecasting agency WGSN and co-founder of The Bear Scouts, a platform that links brands with sustainable manufacturers. ""Too many companies just haven't committed to change as much as is needed, even though the innovation is there. Part of it is due to costs, part to lack of will.""

More work is required to reduce denim's environmental cost, according to Souchet from Make Fashion Circular. ""Jeans were an obvious entry point for an endeavor of this kind,"" he said. ""The denim sector has already made quite a few efforts towards improving its manufacturing process. It's aware of its own problems. Our guidelines want to build on that, to create a better alignment across the supply chain.""

Brands participating in Jeans Redesign will need to deliver annual reports to show their progress. But both Kurazawa and Kozlowski are skeptical about the long-term impact of the program.

""I personally don't think the rules are going to change much,"" Kurazawa said. ""Manufacturing countries need help with infrastructure and living wage payments to factory workers. Initiatives, like these guidelines, have little (in the way of) measurable results, in that sense.""

Kozlowski said that, while the initiative is laudable, what's needed is more oversight.

""I think the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's push for sustainability is great, but the problem is that there's no governing body ensuring the standards will actually be implemented,"" she said. ""The supply chain is global, so it's really quite difficult to enforce control."""
"Gone to ground



Last week, the government rejected recommendations from the Commons environmental audit committee report on the impact of fast fashion – including a 1p per garment levy. Ministers also rejected a ban on burying or incinerating clothes that could be recycled. According to the Waste and Resources Action Programme (Wrap) UK households sent 300,000 tonnes of clothing to landfill in 2016.

Collective failure



According to a 2019 EU report fashion companies produced two collections a year in 2000, but this had increased to five by 2011, with some chains such as Zara offering 24 collections per annum. The report stated that this had led to clothes being regarded as “nearly disposable” goods.

Polyester menace



One washload of polyester clothes can release 700,000 microplastic fibres into the environment. It is estimated that half a million tonnes of these microfibres end up in the sea each year. Polyester, made from fossil fuels, is non-biodegradable. Microfibres from synthetics are a major contributor to microplastic pollution – a 2019 Bangor University survey of UK rivers, reservoirs and lakes found micro-plastic pollution at all locations tested.

Emissions growth



According to the Pulse of Fashion report in 2015 the industry was responsible for 1,715 million tonnes of CO 2 emissions. The UN states that the fashion industry consumes more energy than the aviation and shipping industry combined. The Pulse report forecast fashion emissions to grow by 63% by 2030.

Thirsty work



The production of clothing is very water-intensive. According to the 2017 Wrap report the average water footprint for a kilo of cotton (equivalent to pair of jeans and a shirt) is 10,000-20,000 litres. India and Pakistan are major suppliers of cotton to the UK, but both countries suffer from high levels of water scarcity."

"March 1 will be a special day for Linda Kay Peters.

Standing beneath the Eiffel Tower, the Hope-based designer will watch as 15 of her handmade, couture-quality creations are showcased on the runway as part of Indigenous Fashion Week. It will be a proud moment that she will never forget.

The Paris fashion week appearance will also provide the 65-year-old designer with the opportunity to share with the fashion world what matters to her most: her Cree and Ojibwa heritage.

“It’s exciting and it’s important because I’m very proud to be a First Nations person. And I like to produce and create clothing that symbolizes us,” Peters, who is a member of the Sto:Lo Seabird Island First Nation in Agassiz, says of her garments. “There’s a lot of pride in sharing who you are.”

Through her brand, Ringing Bell Robes, Peters creates garments that proudly showcase both her design talents — and her culture. In total, there will be 10 international Indigenous designers joining the Paris Indigenous Fashion Week event. Peters will be joined by Melissa Attagutsiak, Ingrid Books, Chermene Castle, Jolonzo Goldtooth, Yolonda Skelton, Sho Sho Esquiro, Della Stump, Victor Buguilat Jr. and Victoria’s Arctic Fashion.

While each is singularly unique, portraying symbols and design components of each designer’s heritage, the creations showcased on the Paris runway will look to present one message to the fashion world — at a time when so many industry eyes will be watching.

“I want people know that that Indigenous designers are people, too, and they deserve the recognition,” Chelsa Racette, the executive director of Indigenous Fashion Week, says.

While some steps has been made in the right direction (Valentino partnered with Métis artist Christi Belcourt in 2015, for example), the fashion industry has had a troubled past with appropriation, including Indigenous designs. DSQUARED2, Forever 21, Givenchy and Urban Outfitters are just a few of the brands and retailers who have featured designs and symbols on their clothing.

It’s a practice that doesn”t sit right with Peters and Racette.

“Designers who want to have an ‘Indigenous-inspired’ line need to work alongside an Indigenous designer,” Racette says. “Most Indigenous designers have a story to tell with their designs. It’s the way they express their art and their history. It’s not only a ‘what’s in for this season’-type of line, it’s based on their traditions and values. It’s an everyday thing for them.”

“Appropriation is happening everywhere you turn around,” Peters adds. “It bothers me a lot when I see this happen as Indigenous people have lost so much already — our land, our languages, our culture — and this is just another form of taking away from us again.

“That is why we are trying to hang on to what little we have left — the land, the resources — and trying our best to revive our culture.”

Peters hopes showcasing Indigenous designs at an international fashion event like Paris Fashion Week will be a way to “present to the world that we are still here — ‘alive and thriving’.”

The increased awareness, Peters says, is especially important as Indigenous symbols become increasingly of interest.

“First Nations styles and symbols are becoming very popular. Where before they weren’t. And I think that’s why there is more appropriation now,” she says. “We’re just starting to get the recognition and not have somebody just take one of our designs and make it their own.”

Some steps have been taken too help protect Indigenous designers and artists, she points out. In B.C., a non-profit group, the Aboriginal Tourism Association of B.C., created the Authentic Indigenous Arts Resurgence Campaign to help people identify authentic creations. Similar programs have also popped up in other communities across Canada and around the world.

The message of protection — and proper representation — is especially poignant for Peters, who recalls how, when growing up in Red Lake, Ont., she once felt very differently about her heritage.

“There’s been so much prejudice against First Nations people. And I grew up in a world where being First Nations wasn’t accepted. So, I grew up with a lot of racism. And, as a child, I wasn’t proud to be a First Nations person. But I am now,” she says. “Sharing my clothing with First Nations symbols and design is a real source of pride for me. And I enjoy being able to share that with the world.”

At the fashion event in Paris, Peters will be joined by four models who have been longtime supporters of her designs, helping to showcase and support her creations from the start.

“My First Nations models — Charity Joe and Judith Pete from Chawathil First Nations, Dayna Nelson from Long Plains First Nations … and Rena Louis from Seabird Island First Nations — these four ladies have modelled for me since they were in their teens and I wanted to give them the opportunity to model in Paris as a show of my appreciation for presenting my clothing over the years at various fashion shows,” she says. “They helped to get me where I am today.”

But talent, perseverance and an unerring love of learning have also contributed to Peters’ success. Not to mention a longtime appreciation for the art of sewing.

“I’ve never taken any formal training. I’m all self-taught. So everything is a bit of a challenge,” she explains. “I started sewing as a child, hand-sewing. My grandmother taught me how to use her treadle machine.”

Peters soon graduated to making curtains. Then, in her teens, she recalls how she started to make her own clothes. After taking a break from the hobby in her teens, she returned to the craft in 1996. Peters credits Carol Mason, an Indigenous designer from the Blood Reserve in Alberta, with helping bring her back to her craft.

“She kind of got me going and mentored me. She brought her portfolio to work and showed me. And I started sewing and designing from then,” she recalls.

After mastering outerwear, with Peters laughingly points out was “the hardest thing to start with,” she segued into creating vests and formal wear designs. Since retiring three years ago from a career that saw her work for 30 years in Aboriginal Health, she’s tackling a new challenge in design.

“Within the last few years, I’ve started making buckskin clothing,” she explains. “With the buckskin, I’ve gotten into complete hand-lacing. There is no machine stitching on it. It’s totally different, for sure.”

The first buckskin she made was for herself, as a traditional dress for her to dance in. Peters’ initial design caught the eye of a bridal magazine in Calgary that was looking to feature a gown from an Indigenous designer. She made them an impressive white buckskin gown with 10 feet of fringe, she recalls. And her business took off from there.

She went on to make a white buckskin for Ashley Callingbull of the Enoch First Nation, which she wore during the Mrs. Universe competition in Russia. Callingbull won the title, becoming the first Indigenous woman to do so.

“She put a call out on Facebook looking for First Nations designers because she wanted to wear a buckskin for her cultural portion of the pageantry. And a few people recommended me. So, I got ahold of her and sent a picture of that white buckskin that I did for the bridal magazine and she liked it and wanted to wear it,” she says. “When I heard she won the title, I was so excited.”

“She really used her platform to come back and talk about some of the issues facing First Nations people. I was very proud of her.”

Now in ‘retirement’, Peters’ new goal is to tan her own hides. Creating the designs, which average from $600 to $2,000 for a handmade buckskin design, has become not only a constant source of pride for the designer — they’ve become a constant source of excitement, too.

“As it materializes, when I first start with either a fabric or a hide, it’s exciting to me to see the end result. I’ve never seen myself as being able to produce something so beautiful, and when (a design) turns out to be what it is, it’s exciting,” she says. “It’s like walking, wearable art.”

"Tourism businesses can encourage sustainable behaviour

Tourism businesses can encourage sustainable behaviour among travellers

New research offers more incentive for tourism businesses to become more sustainable and share their efforts with international visitors, Tourism Industry Aotearoa says.

The research was carried out by the University of Canterbury and ChristchurchNZ, and funded by the Tourism Industry New Zealand Trust.

It found that international visitors to Canterbury believe environmental sustainability is important but tourism operators could be doing more to promote eco-friendly practices to travellers.

TIA Industry Strategy Manager Bruce Bassett says the research confirms the importance of tourism businesses acting sustainably.

“It provides evidence that visitors want to protect the environment in New Zealand but we need to make it easier for them to do so. If the tourism operator is sustainable then they can talk to the visitor about how they can support the business’ efforts.”

Almost 1200 New Zealand tourism businesses have now signed up to TIA’s New Zealand Tourism Sustainability Commitment, which is also supported by the Tourism Industry New Zealand Trust.

The TSC sets 14 commitments for tourism businesses to achieve environmental, economic, host community and visitor sustainability. They include objectives to reduce carbon; contribute to ecological restoration; reduce waste; and actively engage with visitors on the importance of restoring, protecting and enhancing New Zealand’s natural environment.

“By showing our visitors that we are taking responsibility for looking after our environment and communities, we can encourage them to follow our lead,” Mr Bassett says.

"The owner of the high street fast fashion firm Zara has reported soaring profits and record sales.

Despite currency pressures and difficult conditions for retailers, Spanish group Inditex announced a 3 per cent rise in net income to €1.4 billion (£1.2 billion) for the six months to July 1 giving the company its best ever half-year results.

Shares in Inditex, which also owns Massimo Dutti and Pull&Bear among a number of other brands, have risen by more than 2 per cent since the progress report was unveiled.

Zara is owned by the Spanish group, Inditex, who also own other big named high street fashion brands such as Massimo Dutti, Pull&Bear and Bershka.

Net sales also smashed the previous record of €12 billion (£10.7 billion) for the first time to hit €12.03 billion (£10.7 billion).

Inditex, the world's largest clothing retailer, said group like-for-like sales rose by 4 per cent and were higher across all regions including Europe and the UK. However, this is a reduction on the 6 per cent growth seen last year.

It said its autumn/winter initial collections have been 'well received', estimating that like-for-like sales growth has improved in the second half so far to between 4 and 6 per cent.

This is despite many customers being driven away from the high street due to the tough economy with people having less spare money to spend on non-essential items.

Pablo Isla, chairman and chief executive of Inditex, said: 'The strong first-half results are the result of a solid sales and operating performance, arising from the unique strength of the group's integrated and sustainable business model.'

The stronger euro had been expected to take its toll but the group's profits still increased with its gross profit margin increasing slightly to 56.7 per cent from 56.4 per cent.

The group reported record profits despite the tough economy driving many customers away from the high street.

Many of Inditex's products are made in the eurozone but it makes more than half of its sales outside the currency bloc.

The strong euro has certainly made an impact, as shown in its total sales figures with local currencies up by an impressive 8 per cent.

The high street empire, who employs over 170,000 people, opened stores in 44 markets in its first half, taking its total number of outlets to 7,422 across 96 markets.

It also recently declared that all of its brands will be available online worldwide by 2020.

It currently has online sales in 49 of its 96 markets."

"Instagram has become the window display for a new generation of savvy shoppers – and it’s changing the way we consume style, for good and bad. Leah Harper meets some of the pioneers at the forefront of Insta-fashion

We’ve all bought them at some time or another: the perfect pair of shoes. Stylish, comfortable – the kind you wear with everything until they fall apart, and you have to start scouring the internet for a replacement.

But recently you might have noticed that the way you find a replacement has changed. Not long after you begin your search, a pair of similar shoes appears, as a sponsored post, on your Instagram feed. They’re there one day, and then the next. You’ll likely end up seeing them countless times, though never in the flesh. The brand to which they belong may not even have a physical store – but its Instagram presence is such that you peruse its wares with the kind of frequency you only usually afford your local corner shop.

Gradually, the account becomes somewhere you regularly stop, just to see what’s new. You start looking at all the other items on offer: past that original pair of shoes, to mules, slingbacks, sandals.

As prospects for the UK’s high street continue to look grim, many fashion outlets are taking their business not just online but specifically to Instagram. Although primarily a social media platform, Instagram specialises in all things visual. And, unlike most online shopping sites, it has become a place for customers to browse, covet and discover. Brands, meanwhile, are cashing in on the opportunity to sell not just their products, but an entire concept.

Dear Frances is one of a growing number of brands that might be considered “Instagram famous”. You won’t have seen it on the high street but, one way or another, it may have become a regular feature on your feed. While platforms such as Asos offer a much larger and more easily searchable catalogue of clothes, their items are invariably photographed in a studio, against a white background. Instagram brands, on the other hand, specialise in showcasing their wares “in the wild”, or within a stylised set-up that fits their overarching vision of how potential customers might aspire to dress. It offers the opportunity for brands to convey not just a single “lewk”, but a whole moodboard to Insta-fashion fans.

“Instagram is more about sharing a mood or an inspiration,” says Dear Frances’s designer Jane Frances. “It’s a natural place to attract those who share your aesthetic or those who are inspired by the lifestyle of your brand.”

The appeal of shopping brands that are recognisable only “from Instagram” lies somewhere between the thrill of unearthing hidden gems, supporting small or independent businesses, and being very much “in the know”. It’s exactly what is missing from a trip to the local shopping centre.

The influencers are ordinary people, so the imagery is more representative

“Spotting something on Insta is the modern equivalent of a great recommendation from a friend,” says Grazia’s fashion news and features editor, Laura Antonia Jordan. “It’s accessible. Aspirational but attainable – that’s the magic combination!”

I cannot claim to understand the algorithms that allow for products and brands to follow one around the internet, cropping up in banner ads and sponsored posts. However, there is a reason why so-called “Instagram brands” are gaining a cult following in fashion. Given how much time many of us spend using the app – over half an hour per day for millennials – it’s not surprising that it has become a source of sartorial inspiration, and the place where trends take flight. The majority of Instagram fashion brands skew towards womenswear, though some, such as Need and shoe brand Veja, cater for men, too. That has led to significant results: a third of all Instagram users have now bought an item of clothing they saw on the social network.

We tend to follow the people and brands with which we feel most closely aligned, images to which we at once aspire and relate. It’s the reason why my own feed is a mix of roll-top baths, weird food, girls with great makeup, unsettling artwork and ex-reality TV stars – and, of course, niche clothing labels. Unlike Facebook, Instagram is a curated feed of not just our friends’ lives, but also our own. It’s the images we want to look at on our commute, on our lunch break and last thing at night. Of course fashion wants a piece of the pie.

“I started the Instagram account before I even launched the website,” says Lisa Bühler, founder of fashion brand aggregator Lisa Says Gah (currently 195k followers). The site stocks a number of designers, some of which might be considered Instagram famous in their own right, as well as in-house brands – all thoughtfully curated towards a particular aesthetic.

“I began with inspiration posts, like charming interiors and retro films, just to get an idea of the look I was going for. Once we started bringing in products we also posted those, but not in a traditional retail way – not in a studio, just on the street in front of the office and on employees and designers. It had always had an authentic behind-the-scenes feel.”

Ganni, one of the brands stocked by Lisa Says Gah, has several stores across Denmark, Norway and Sweden, but in the UK their “Scandi 2.0 sense of style” is a hit on Instagram. It has amassed 561k followers.

“I think Instagram has become the best discovery tool for customers in fashion,” says Ditte Reffstrup, creative director at Ganni. “Maybe you stumble across a brand while scrolling, or you want to check out a brand someone tells you about – the first thing you do is go straight to its Instagram profile, not its site.”

Instagram has become the best discovery tool for fashion customers

This has become particularly significant since March last year, when Instagram rolled out their “shoppable posts” feature, allowing brands to tag items available for purchase and customers to shop in-app. Brands don’t even need their own website to set up shoppable posts with “product stickers” – just a Facebook catalogue.

Arguably, such convenience also feeds the problem of throwaway fashion. In addition, it has prompted the rise of what Jordan refers to as “the Insta-bait buy” – clothes that are designed to stand out not just in a crowd, but on an increasingly crowded feed. Inevitably, these can become clothes that are worn fleetingly, with new Insta-trends sparking new purchases on a regular basis.

Instagram also pedalled some of this year’s less practical trends. Straw bags and see-through clothing both made Vogue’s list of “the biggest, most influential trends… on Instagram in 2018”, but neither appeared quite so prevalent in real life (particularly in chillier climes). Yet if this is evidence of how “doing it for the ’gram” has seeped into fashion, trends such as the prairie dress and the sparkly barrette surely go some way to redressing that balance.

A prime example of a label which has basked in Insta-notoriety over the past couple of years is Réalisation Par (464k followers), the brand behind what i-D described as “the internet’s favourite dress”. The dress in question, the Alexandra, was the long-sleeved ruffle mini, sported by everyone from Alexa Chung to Bella Hadid. This summer, it was “the Naomi” – Réalisation Par’s leopard-print slip skirt – that flooded not only their own Instagram profile, but everyone else’s too, and sparked copycat versions up and down the high street.

On the one hand, the Insta-ubiquity of the leopard print skirt was testament to the many ways in which it could be styled: it looked just as good teamed with trainers and a baggy cream T-shirt as worn with strappy sandals and a crisp oversized shirt or a black roll-neck and blazer jacket. The brand has made the most of its Insta-acclaim by featuring a “shop Instagram” section, as well as simply a “shop” section on its website.

Never Fully Dressed (304k followers), which describes its single store as “a nice front of house” for its majority online sales, has taken this type of styling inspiration into its own hands, creating bespoke videos that prove particularly popular on Instagram. Demonstrating how to wear a garment six different ways, or for more than just one season, as Never Fully Dressed does is, of course, a valuable antidote to fast fashion – but can smaller brands afford not to push sales?

“If someone’s spent their hard-earned cash with you, you want them to get their full wear,” says Lucy Anne Tighe, founder and creative director at Never Fully Dressed. “I’d rather keep you as a customer and tell you how to keep wearing what you’ve already got from us.”

“Instagram lets us see how an outfit goes together rather than seeing separate items on a rail,” says fashion psychologist Carolyn Mair. “For some people, this is very helpful, even if the outfit looks very different on them. But the beauty of Instagram is that the images we see are not all professional photoshoots. Many of the influencers are ‘ordinary’ people. This means the fashion imagery is far more representative than we have seen in traditional fashion imagery.”

This may also be part of Never Fully Dressed’s appeal; Tighe ropes in friends and staff to model the clothes for posts and stories. Often, the brand’s styling videos come about as a direct result of customer feedback, and using Instagram as a platform for engaging with shoppers is certainly part of what has elevated select brands to cult status.

“There’s no better way to talk to future and current customers,” says Sarah Staudinger, cofounder of Instagram favourite Staud, which looks to offer “accessibly priced clothes... that forgo trend for timelessness”. That said, celebrities and influencers remain a big part of creating “must-have” items. Staud’s signature Shirley bag was quickly dubbed summer’s “It-bag” and sold out, having been posted by Instagram’s head of fashion partnerships, Eva Chen. “We showcase the brand through our own content, through influencers posting and tagging us which we repost in our stories, and through everyday customers posting their purchases,” says Staudinger.

A case in point is eco-friendly trainer brand Veja, which reached the number one spot in Lyst’s ranking of “the cult Insta brands we all wanted to wear” in 2018. The brand has seen sales increase 113% year on year – and sold out in white after Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, wore a pair on her royal tour in Australia. Ganni, meanwhile, made number five – partly thanks to the proliferation of #gannigirls on Instagram.

“My favourite Insta brand is Ganni,” says Jordan. “I met [founders] Ditte and Nicolaj and they told me that although it’s a ‘moment’ when, say, Beyoncé wears something, it doesn’t translate into sales in the same way that it does getting it on the right kind of influencer who doesn’t even need to have a big following.”

If Instagram has levelled the playing field in terms of the people who might become trendsetters, has it done the same for small, unknown brands looking to make an impact with a competitive industry?

“Definitely,” says Reffstrup. “Instagram has really democratised fashion. If you have a strong visual, creative eye that can capture what you stand for, it’s such an incredible platform.”"

Co Tyrone textiles firm Cooneen By Design - whose directors include industrialist John B McGuckian - has reported a fall of over 50% in after-tax profits to £2.1m. Profits at the Fivemiletown firm, whose products range from military clothing to work uniforms and childrenswear featuring cartoon characters like Peppa the Pig, were down from £4.9m a year earlier. Earlier this year the group company celebrated winning a new contract for the design of staff uniforms with railway company Greater Anglia.

In a strategic report filed with the results for 2017, the company said: ""Market conditions have been very competitive in 2017.

""It will continue to remain so in the current year. The directors aim to maintain market share and continue to meet its customer requirements."" Turnover at the firm was also down from £73.7m to £59.7m, while pre-tax profits dropped from £6.2m to £2.5m.

However, the company did not provide any further detail on sales, saying that to do so would prejudice its interests.

Staff numbers at the company were steady at 150. Directors were paid a total of £563,384, including pension scheme contributions. The highest-paid director was paid £248,717, down slightly from a year earlier when they received £249,583.

The business paid corporation tax of around £505k during 2017, down from £1.3m a year earlier.

There are six companies listed as subsidiaries of Cooneen By Design, including Hawk Holdings Ltd, Cooneen Protection Ltd and Cooneen Defence Ltd."
"On a sunny morning in Birmingham city centre, Charlene Powell is standing guard over four carrier bags.

They are not all hers, she says hastily. She has come shopping with her mum, but between them they have done well out of their trip to the city’s new Primark megastore, a five-floor retail palace that was named by Guinness World Records as the biggest clothing store in the world when it was unveiled in April.

“I’m going on a hen night, so I’ve been trying to find some bits and pieces for that – there’s a unicorn theme on the Saturday night. And I’ve got some bits for my son because they sell all the Fortnite stuff in there. And some bits for my little girl for summer,” says the 30-year-old from Kidderminster. Charlene hasn’t shopped in Primark much before, but she is coming back; she can come by train and be back in time for the school pickup.

Judging by the number of branded brown paper bags swinging from arms or hooked over pushchair handles in Birmingham city centre, she is not alone. If the high street is dying, then Primark, which will mark 50 years in business in June, appears to be immortal. Sales rose by 4% in the six months to March, even as established brands, such as Debenhams and LK Bennett, were going to the wall. And it is remarkable that the biggest British fashion retailer in Britain by volume (if not by value) has done it all without venturing into online shopping. If you want Primark, you still have to get off the sofa and buy it – and millions happily oblige.

The Birmingham megastore is almost a tourist destination, what with its in-store blow-dry bar, beauty salon and Disney-themed cafe that is catnip to preschoolers. There have been coach trips from Scotland, with customers filming on their phones as they walk in, as if it were a theme park. But people are not just browsing; they are buying. Why not, when you can get a bikini for £6 or flip-flops for less than a takeaway coffee? These are pocket-money prices for grownups, and they are not just attracting shoppers on a tight budget.

Discount retailers have also discreetly helped the squeezed middle – people who are not exactly hard up, but have still felt the pinch over the past decade – ride out what would otherwise have been painful downward pressure on their living standards. Middle-class families have stealthily downshifted to Lidl or Ryanair, and started stocking up on cheap children’s T-shirts and leggings in “Primani, darling” (as the store was nicknamed when 00s fashionistas realised some of its lines could, from a distance, pass for designer). These days, Primark competes for customers with Marks & Spencer and Next, not just with H&M or New Look.

Yet something doesn’t add up. If younger consumers mean what they say about tackling the climate crisis, then fast fashion – clothes so cheap, they are practically disposable – should be going the way of plastic coffee cups. Fashion is the second most polluting industry in the world, second only to oil, creating environmental headaches right through from production to the landfill created when people tire of their bargains. (Even some charity shops are reluctant to take “value” brand castoffs because they are worth so little once prices are slashed for resale.)

Cotton is a thirsty crop, draining water resources, while polyester made from oil-based polymers has twice its carbon footprint. Deforestation caused by clearing land for clothing fibre production risks accelerating global heating. To protect the planet we should be spinning out quality clothes for longer, not constantly chasing the new, yet the rise and rise of Primark suggests a gap between what people say and what they actually do.

Just as voters will swear they don’t mind paying higher taxes for better public services, but then quietly vote for tax cuts, it’s possible shoppers know what they should do, but balk at paying more than they have to. “There has been a lot of justifiably bad publicity about ethical sourcing, paying people a pittance and all that,” says the retail analyst Richard Hyman, a former director of the retail intelligence company Mintel. “But I’m afraid the truth is that comfortable middle-class people may be able to adopt the moral high ground, but most people can’t.” And that’s where the gentle evolution under way at Primark gets interesting.

Behind a sliding door at one end of a changing room lies the Birmingham store’s “snap-and-share” room. Groups of friends can take in as many clothes as they want, set the lighting and music, and then film and photograph themselves on their phones before uploading it all to social media.

It is free marketing for Primark, essentially using customers as influencers, but it is also about putting sociability back into shopping. Hen parties love it, but so, apparently, do gaggles of older women, from a generation that grew up killing hours messing around a Boots makeup counter with their mates. The store, occupying the shell of an old shopping mall, is the size of a conventional department store, and designed to feel like somewhere you could linger on for lunch or to get your nails done in the in-store salon. Welcome to “experiential retail”, or shopping reinvented for people who want to do more than just click a button.

“When people say the high street is dying, actually the high street is continually innovating,” says Tim Kelly, the company’s director of new business development. And while other brands are experimenting along similar lines, getting customers physically through the doors matters for Primark because the economics of selling online are not in its favour. When a £2.50 T-shirt could cost three times that to deliver, it needs the customer to come to the product, which means its stores must be enticing. But experiences are not the only thing Primark is trialling here. There is a recycling bin on every floor, encouraging customers to deposit old clothes for recycling or resale. There are free water fountains because the cafes don’t sell single-use plastic water bottles, and a new denim range made from sustainable cotton grown with less water, pesticide and fertiliser. For the festival season, the store is pushing eco-friendly glitter because the ordinary kind creates plastic pollution, and, while the greenest solution would probably be to stop wearing glitter, that is not the Primark way. The message is that you can still have fun with fashion, and they will take care of the guilt for you.

When the House of Commons environmental audit committee published a report on sustainable fashion last year, examining what big retailers were doing to limit their impact on the environment, Primark was ranked alongside M&S in its top category for engaging with environmental concerns. MPs’ sharpest criticism was reserved for the new online-only retailers such as Missguided or Boohoo, where a £5 dress can be driven to your doorstep for only £3.99 more. “The carbon footprint of people having it delivered to home, potentially wearing it only once for an Instagram, being pressured online by advertising – I think these models are psychologically more damaging and environmentally as damaging,” says Mary Creagh, the Labour MP and committee chair.

More than half of under-24s told a recent Mintel survey they now want to buy from labels that are kinder to the environment. “I think fashion is now where plastics was three or four years ago. People have woken up to the facts, but, because of the complexities of the supply chain and the competing claims of manufacturers, they can’t find their way through the ethical fashion maze,” says Creagh.

There is, she concedes, more Primark could do to protect overseas garment workers from exploitation in its infamously cut-price industry. But she thinks the Rana Plaza tragedy, which saw more than 1,100 people killed when a Bangladeshi factory used by retailers including Primark collapsed in 2013, was a wake-up call for the company and its customers.

Shoppers may not always have time to decipher labels, but they want to feel their brands are ethical, and in Birmingham everything from the “People. Respect. Planet” posters above tills to the branded brown paper carriers seems designed to reassure. All of which leaves the perennial question: if not by cutting corners, then how does Primark keep prices so low?

Kelly says the secret lies in doing things differently. “We don’t do big marketing campaigns,” he says. “We don’t have online shopping, or the cost of a delivery network that goes with it. We save on small stuff – our packaging is quite simple – and we do believe that all the way through our supply chain we do make a difference. Our focus has always been on our customer, on our pricing.” He won’t discuss profit margins, but Primark is a volume retailer, making up for relatively small profits on each item by selling lots of them.

It may sound suspiciously like corporate greenwashing, but Primark is, says Hyman, no cowboy operator. Having started in 1969 with one store in Dublin, where it is known as Penneys, it has grown its empire of 371 stores across Britain, Europe and the US slowly and cautiously. “It is a carefully managed business. It would be easy to assume that it’s ‘pile-it-high, sell-it-cheap’, that it involves a bit of ducking and diving. But it is not any of those things. It’s careful about what it does, and it knows exactly what it’s doing. It’s always been run as if it were a private company, owned by the people who run it.”

He sees some parallels with Aldi, the family-owned discount food retailer: “Aldi has always been much less cheap and nasty than people thought, and Primark is the same. People say: ‘How do they sell a T-shirt for £3?’ But most of its factories are pretty much the same as the factories that more expensive companies get their garments from. That’s the reality.” He thinks Primark is as least “as kosher as the rest”, even if that bar isn’t as high as some would like, given the inherent risks of retailers outsourcing production to distant countries where they can’t be wholly sure what is happening between inspection visits.

No matter how ethically they are made, however, clothes cheap enough to wear twice before chucking them out will always have an environmental question mark over them. Primark’s defence to all this, aside from its recycling programme, is that it wants to see its clothes cherished. “We understand that there’s a long way to go,” says Kelly. “But from a Primark perspective, not everybody can afford a £50 shirt or a £100 jacket. We put a lot of work into our garments, and we want our customers to retain them for a long time.”

Yet the brand remains, for many shoppers, unashamedly associated with throwaway culture. Several of the women who let me snoop through their carrier bags in Birmingham are buying what Debbie McDermott from Coventry calls “cheap holiday stuff”: sundresses and sandals, things it doesn’t seem worth spending money on because they won’t get worn much. But a generation ago, our grandmothers probably weren’t buying pool slides, any more than they were ordering piles of dresses from online retailers just to Instagram themselves in everything once before returning it. Just as cheap flights have transformed our lives, opening foreign travel up to people on lower incomes, but encouraging the wealthy to take several breaks a year, cheap clothing has rather cheeringly democratised fashion and, somewhat more worryingly, helped us buy much more than we need.

The real secret of Primark’s success, says Hyman, is the hardest one for the rest of the faltering high street to copy: its extraordinary knack of converting casual browsers into buyers. “The magical thing they do, and there’s not a lot of it about these days, is when they get customers to go into their shops the customer feels almost compelled to buy something. People will walk around, and think: ‘Wow! I could wear that three times and throw it away, and still be quids in.’ And that wow factor is so difficult to create. It’s like magic dust.”

What strikes me only later is that while its competitors in Birmingham city centre seem busy enough, most shoppers still leave empty-handed. Outside Primark, however, customer after customer emerges clutching a carrier. Whatever that magic dust does, it’s working."
"LEONARD Lauder proposed the theory that it’s possible to tell from lipstick sales when the financial climate is in dire straights.

As the 2001 terrorist attacks deflated the American economy, the chairman of Estée Lauder Companies spotted that the company’s sales of lipsticks were on the increase, hypothesising that women still wanted to buy something luxurious to boost their mood but couldn’t afford or couldn’t justify the expense of shoes, bags and new clothes.

While there was always a question mark over the accuracy of Mr Lauder’s hypothesis, it surely is out the window completely as we fast forward nearly 20 years to a time where a woman can buy a whole new outfit – shoes included – for cheaper than a high end lipstick.

While lipstick may not be able to predict the state of the economy, it remains true that people, not just women, like to treat themselves to a little something nice. A flattering new item of clothing lifts the spirits, makes you feel good, is a bonding exercise with friends and dear God, as you survey the state of us at the moment, don’t we desperately need a boost to the mood?

Shopping is no longer about the cost to our wallets, however. It is about the cost to the environment. Some, by now well-kent side effects of fast, fast fashion: we send £140 million worth of clothes to landfill every year; microplastics from our washing machines end up as pollutants in the ocean; the fashion industry causes one million tonnes of waste every year; and it creates more carbon emissions than the aviation and shipping industries combined at 1.2 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide.

Why? We have enough clothes.

My mum has some gorgeous items from the 1960s and 70s that I would love to add to my wardrobe. Will I be passing on an £8 Primark dress to future generations? Only if they’ve done something to offend me.

When my grandmother talked about shopping, it was the description of a complete experience. A trip into the city to a department store where the shopper would be deferred to and waited upon. A purchase was a treat to be cared for and nurtured; it would last for years.

Who has the time for hand-washing garments, though? Who has the patience for waiting for a shop assistant to nip round the back and check if there’s an item in your size? Fast fashion proliferates when everything is done at speed.

As we shift to a more cashless society – the UK Finance Payments Market Report published this month found debit cards were the single most-used payment method last year – contactless payments make it easier and faster to buy these cheap bits of throwaway cloth. There’s something far less psychologically impactful about tapping a card on a machine than there is about getting out a £20 note and handing it over. When the exchange of money for goods is fast and invisible, it might as well not be happening at all.

Then there’s the fact that young people have less money to spend. It’s one thing to say that we should save for a statement purchase of hand-stitched leather shoes or a handbag that will last a lifetime when there just isn’t that money to save.

An inaugural audit of intergenerational spending power from the Resolution Foundation thinktank this week shows 18 to 19-year-olds are spending less money on shoes and clothes in real terms than those of the same age in 2001. There is no figure for avocado toast. The study puts this down to soaring housing costs, saying young people are seven per cent poorer in real terms than their peers were at the millennium.

While there are plenty of problems with pitting generation against generation – poverty and disadvantage are experienced by all age groups and what good does fighting do anyway – a lack of disposable income and spending power is obviously going to affect how that money is spent.

Clothing brands are making nods towards change. Brand Boohoo has this week launched its first recycled clothing range, made with recycled polyester that had been destined for landfills and without environmentally unfriendly dyes or chemicals.

Yet the same day the range was launched, the Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) issued a critical report on the fast fashion industry. And that report named Boohoo as an offender.

Along with the much-publicised suggestion of a 1p charge per garment on producers to fund better recycling of clothes, and a ban on incinerating or landfilling unsold stock, the EAC made 16 other suggestions. The Government has said it will adopt none of the policies.

It is easy to see why fast fashion has become so readily adopted and so difficult to break free from. But it is impossible to see why the Government – the same one that pledged to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2050 – isn’t stepping up to enforce changes in an industry that is now nudging up against the oil industry as one of the most polluting industries in the world.

Fast fashion needs some fast and hard policies – and it’s time for government to break the trend."
"The prince has been photographed in bathers that are more than a decade old. Keeping our clothes is the best way to reduce their environmental impact – here’s how to do it

I get a little exercised when I see the Duchess of Cambridge described as “thrifty” for wearing more than once an outfit worth several hundred pounds. But Prince Charles has just been photographed in a pair of Vilebrequin swimming trunks that he first wore at least 12 years ago. “Probably 16 years ago,” says a spokesperson for Vilebrequin, “because this particular style went on sale in 2003 and designs tend not to stick around beyond a season.” The trunks retail at £195 (leaving inflation out of it, this equates to £12 a year of ownership), so you will have to decide if their longevity amounts to thrift.

Admittedly, the pair – which have a pink, blue and green floral pattern - do look a little faded. And the prince has worn other swimsuits in the past decade or so, such as a pair of yellow ones with a dolphin print. But still, he has done well to carry any trunks serviceably through middle age. This particular pair may have been laundered many times, but at least it is made from polyamide, which does not shed microfibres as easily as some synthetics.

The prince’s choice is interesting at a time when not only the wastefulness of the clothing industry but also consumers’ habits of purchase and wear are under increasing scrutiny. According to the Environmental Audit Committee’s report last month (Fixing Fashion: Clothing Consumption and Sustainability), textile production contributes more to climate change than international aviation and shipping combined. In the UK, the Waste and Resources Action Programme (Wrap) estimates that the average lifetime of a garment is just 2.2 years. Statistically, this makes the prince’s trunks a notable outlier."
"In Ireland, a cohort of exceptionally talented women are leading the way in the production of sustainable jewellery, crafting beautiful pieces with the minimum impact on our planet, says Paul McLauchlan

What is the most important thing when it comes to buying jewellery. Is it sentimentality? Is it its timelessness? Undoubtedly, beauty is in the eye of the beholder but, nowadays, customers have other questions, ones that simply didn’t exist five years ago. Is it sustainable? Is it ethically sourced? Those are today’s questions.

In Ireland, the market for sustainable jewellery is strengthened by a cohort of exceptionally talented women at its core.

The sustainable wave is reaching all areas of society. In fashion, there is a notable difference in the way businesses operate. The emphasis is on ethical sourcing and manufacturing, working towards a cleaner and more sustainable future where supply chains are as transparent as can be.

But, of course, with this comes the greenwashing. What is ethical to one might not be to another. Sustainability could appear differently in my mind than yours. How conscious is conscious?

In Vanity Fair’s annual jewellery supplement which accompanies the August issue, the editorial team reached the conclusion that, ‘“sustainability” is the wrong word for the

jewellery industry.’ They credited the mining of natural, finite resources and the consequences of energy inefficiency as the primary stipulations.

While definitions are up for debate, the women at the forefront of the jewellery industry in Ireland have more than a few things in common but the likeness that sticks out is mindfulness.

“It’s a learning curve for everyone to understand what we can do to help the environment and every act matters,” said Helena Malone, goldsmith.

Maria Dorai-Raj is a Cork-based goldsmith who creates eclectic and modern fine jewellery with a sleek femininity with the environment in mind. Her designs are informed by the beauty and art of nature. Her jewellery is made entirely by hand in her studio, using precious metals and a melange of traditional and modern jewellery-making techniques.

Maria Dorai-Raj

Her locally-made jewellery is stocked in retailers across Ireland by buyers who support the sustainable element of Irish craft.

“As an individual, I am concerned with leaving the lightest of footprints on our beautiful and fragile planet,” Dorai-Raj told the Irish Examiner. “With this in mind, I source my materials from suppliers who are committed to sustainable environmental practices, such as conserving energy and recycling materials. I use eco-silver which is an environmentally friendly and 100% recycled product.”

For Helena Malone, a devotion to ethical craft came naturally after spending a decade in the corporate world of global business. A chance trip to an arts centre in Australia sparked her joy for making, and a career change. The rest is history.

“Having worked in a corporate setting, when I changed career to become a goldsmith I decided, as a personal principle, to work to the best of my ability with the best raw materials I could get at a given time from sources that were considerate and responsible,” says Malone, who works in a studio Wicklow St in Dublin.

Her latest collection, entitled PURE, debuted at Brown Thomas’ 9th annual CREATE showcase which takes place in the Dublin flagship shop during the summer months. Featuring minimal clean lines and texture, the pieces are enriched with Madagascan sapphires and granulation in 18ct gold. Her work is designed to last beyond the temporal world of seasons.

“As a small artisan maker I can make immediate changes — I will continue to attend conferences and speak to experts in the field for advice,” says Malone.

“There is no choice. Everyone has seen the news, watched documentaries, and viewed the statistics. I ask myself, ‘what legacy do you want to leave? Did you care enough?’ ‘My ethos is to be environmentally conscious where possible and the use of responsibly-sourced raw materials. To develop a sustainable business I have integrated the use of recycled metals in the last few years.”

Sustainable jewellery is more than just ethically-sourced gemstones, it

encompasses every part of one’s business. Beyond the jewellery itself, countless areas have to be accounted for.

With this in mind, Malone uses recycled packaging, implements a no-plastic policy in her workshop, and shifted to more environmentally cleaning methods and processes. While she adds, “of course, I’m open to help and information to get better,” it’s clear to see that she’s on the right path.

“I’m choosing to build a more environmentally friendly practice with openness and sustainability in mind. Even if it’s not high up on the customer’s list of importance, it comes with the jewellery I make,” said Malone.

E-commerce juggernaut Net-a-Porter brought jewellery to the online world in 2018. From Cartier to de Grisogono, much of what’s on offer boasts an eye-watering price tag but fine jewellery is timeless and that in itself is a sustainable gesture. It serves as a lesson in smart-spending — the jewellery’s equivalent to wardrobe wellness.

“Last year we launched our Fine Jewellery and Watches suite, which now consists of over 80 brands. The most expensive item ever sold was a $180k bespoke diamond ring through our personal shopping team,” said Elizabeth von der Goltz, global buying director at Net-a-Porter. “For our customer who has it all, it’s now about customisation. She wants that special bespoke piece just for her and we are becoming the ultimate destination for her to do this.”

“I enjoy pop-ups and fairs as they allow me to meet new clients in person. It’s always exciting to realise their ideas, creating unique, bespoke pieces for them,” Maria Dorai-Raj said.

Customisation and a bespoke service are at the heart of Ann Chapman’s business. She founded Stonechat Jewellers in 2012 at the Westbury Mall in Dublin. They handcraft contemporary jewellery in their in-house workshop, primarily working with customers who come into the shop with their old jewellery that has sentimental and actual value. The process involves melting down old jewellery to reuse old gold and reset old diamonds and coloured gemstones to create a new piece.

Ann Chapman

“Customers love making the most of an old piece of jewellery that they may have inherited or that is quite dated. The ‘before’ and ‘after’ photos of remodelled jewellery are incredible — it’s amazing what can be achieved,"" said Chapman.

Stonechat also sells a specially curated range of jewellery from Irish and European makers, as well as designs made in their Dublin-based workshop. Her practice encompasses a more romantic idea of the adage, “one man’s trash is another man’s treasure”. Chapman works with a team of six highly-trained goldsmiths and jewellery professionals to execute her vision. “A few heads are better than one, and we all work very well as a team.” Chapman said: “I talk through designs and ideas with customers and then we remodel their jewellery into a beautiful new piece of contemporary jewellery which captures all the heritage and emotion of their original, unused jewellery.”

Malone concurs that recycling jewellery is a viable option for consumers. “Ever since I started my business, I have encouraged customers to recycle by melting old jewellery or using old stones, adding or reworking an existing heirloom to their taste. Everyone walks away happy.” In essence, waste not, want not.

“By existing, we use resources and we are responsible for minding them with the future in mind whilst also trying to live a meaningful, fulfilling life,” said Malone.

Beauty comes at a cost and sometimes a positive environmental impact is compromised. However, a move towards a cleaner, greener practice, as proved possible by Ireland’s premier jewellers, is the only way forward.

From reworking old jewellery and rendering it anew, to sustainably sourced gemstones and in-house production, the future for sustainable jewellery is bright. Fully transparent supply chains and 100% sustainability are future possibilities but, right now, all designers can do is their best.

Chapman concludes: “We are responsible for ourselves now as well as the future of the planet and generations to come. I’m not saying that beautifully designed and handcrafted jewellery will save the world, but it does bring great enjoyment and happiness and it is important to make it in as ethical and sustainable as possible.’"

Earthwise is proud to announce it will be introducing 75% recycled plastic bottles across its environmental cleaning range as part of its commitment to the New Zealand Plastic Packaging Declaration. Starting with 1L laundry liquid bottles, 75% of each bottle will be made from plastic sourced from recycled milk, juice and water bottles. The new bottles will be manufactured in New Zealand and will be seen on shelf from October 2018.

Joining other Kiwi-based businesses, Earthwise has pledged to support the New Zealand Plastic Packaging Declaration, making a commitment that 100% of its packaging is recyclable, reusable or compostable by 2025 or earlier.

Owner and director of Earthwise, Jamie Peters, says the business is committed to reducing its use of virgin plastic in its packaging. “Making the pledge was easy for us because our bottles are already recyclable but given New Zealand’s current plastic packaging problem we know an effective solution must include more than just recycling. Kiwi companies need to take greater responsibility for the materials they are putting into the environment and we are working hard to ensure we are doing this.”

Jamie adds, “We’ve started with our 1L laundry liquid bottles and will include 75% recycled content into all bottles across our household cleaning range by mid-2019. But that’s just the first step. We’re also working on launching 100% recycled bottles across our personal care brands, Earthwise Nourish and Glow Lab.”

“You will notice a slight change in colour of our bottles as they become more eco-friendly,” he says.

Earthwise is also one of ten leading businesses backing a diagnostic study of New Zealand’s entire plastic packaging system. The study is being completed by the Sustainable Business Network’s Circular Economy Accelerator (CEA), and has widespread support from across the packaging sector. It will help identify what is needed for a circular economy approach to plastic.

“It’s important that we manage the full life cycle of plastic, not just at the end of the process, so that all plastic can be reused instead of sent to landfill. We know that we can’t tackle the plastics issue alone and are proud to be part of the ground swell of change,” says Jamie.

"Monsoon Accessorize has closed nearly 40 shops in recent years in the face of competition from online rivals

Landlords of Monsoon Accessorize have backed plans to cut the fashion chain’s rents at more than half of its shops.

Last month the retailer proposed a company voluntary arrangement, a form of insolvency used by businesses to avoid collapse. A “sizeable majority” of creditors approved it at a meeting yesterday and now 135 of the two brands’ 258 shops will benefit from rent reductions.

Paul Allen, chief executive, said: “This action will help us to reshape our businesses for the future and we will now turn our attention to the wider turnaround plan and delivering a sustainable and profitable business.”

However, industry critics claimed that businesses were misusing the restructuring scheme to cut their costs. Matthew Ogg, a policy adviser at Revo, a retail property…"

Polyester blend with cotton in a ratio of 59:50 produces highly absorbent and soft fabric, which is extensively used in the textile industry. Polyester, when blended with cotton, contributes more strength towards wrinkle resistance and shape retention as cotton provides comfort along with high porosity and heat conduction.

"Prince Charles says Britain must eliminate its throw away society, as shoppers are being urged to boycott Black Friday over environmental concerns.

Speaking at an environmental summit yesterday the Prince of Wales said Britain needed to become much better at ""un-making"" and ""re-making"" clothes.

He said that with a new grandchild on the way, he did not want to miss out on the one-time opportunity to save the planet, which will be too late for the next generation.

His comments came a day ahead of tomorrow's Black Friday bonanza, which is predicted to be a record breaking shopping event as shops and websites launch flash sales ahead of Christmas.

Meanwhile Mary Creagh MP, chair of the Environmental Audit Committee, called for a boycott of Black Friday over concerns it is fueling the sale of cheap and unethically produced clothing which is hurting the environment.

Writing for Telegraph.co.uk tomorrow, she said: ""What was once a single day, now seems to be taking over November. It’s no longer just a bit of a scrum down the shops to grab the biggest and cheapest flat screen TV, now it’s about compulsively clicking online. Fast fashion retailers have been swift to jump on the Black Friday bandwagon. ‘Huge discounts’, ‘BOG off’, or even ‘up to 75 per cent off’."
"'Yogis' and clean-eaters who flocked to a 'wellness' festival in London were shocked to find the event hadn't been mindful of their use of plastic.

Balance Festival in Shoreditch promised attendees 'global fitness experts, top wellness gurus an the latest forward-thinking brands'.

But following the three-day event in east London over the weekend, festival-goers have slammed sponsors for stocking fridges full of plastic bottles and dishing out free samples in plastic containers.

Corporate sponsor Lucozade packed out the festival, which also offered vegan beer and cannabis oil pills, with electric fridges full of its 'FitWater', raising eyebrows among the event's eco-friendly clientele who had come armed with their metal refillable bottles.

Personal trainer Marc Mullen, 32, said he was disappointed: 'There are bins overflowing with plastic here and it just has to change. This isn't the world we live in now.

'I'm a vegan, if you look around there are yoga teachers and health food specialists everywhere.

'Outside of these walls, these people would not use so much plastic.'

Katie McPherson, 38, added: 'There's plastic everywhere. All the samples and trays are plastic too. It's surprising given the kind of people who are here.

'A festival like this should be highlighting the plastic issue in a positive way and has a responsibility to use alternatives like bamboo.'

Balance Fesitval ran at the Old Truman Brewery from May 10 to 12 and was marketed as 'the UK’s largest celebration of the wellness movement'.

Social media adverts read: 'Workout with leading global fitness experts, sample delicious healthy foods, learn from top wellness gurus, zen out with mindful yogis, heighten your emotional intelligence, discover all the latest forward-thinking brands, and much more.'

But attendees were bemused by the choice of sponsor, claiming they would have preferred an eco-friendly start-up or plant-based food and drinks vendor.

Hattie Bourton, 20, raged: 'I'd understand if the sponsor was a startup with a tight budget but a company like Lucozade should be making more of an effort for the environment.

'It's difficult to see because I only ever use my own metal water bottle now.'

Environmentalist Gwyn Jones, 37, who lives in Hackney, east London, vehemently agreed and said: 'I'm very eco-friendly, and whilst I have seen the start-ups making a real effort to use sustainable materials and it's a shame bigger brands aren't following suit.'

Paired with Lucozade's Fit Water, Say Aloe was also a massive plastic contributor to the event, handing out hundreds of non-recycled plastic bottles.

And guests were even treated to free bottles of 'Aqua' in their goodie bags.

A Lucozade spokesman responded to the criticism by saying: 'At Lucozade Sport we take our responsibility to the environment very seriously.

'We have worked with the team at Balance Festival in the build up to the event to ensure we have the facilities in place to recycle every bottle we give out and we are actively encouraging attendees to use the recycling points throughout the venue.'

'Our Fitwater bottle is designed for full recyclability within UK infrastructure, meaning it can easily be recycled back into bottles.

'We also take the lead on meaningful environmental initiatives, including using 100 per cent recycled plastic bottles at all marathon events as well as taking over 36,000 bottles out of circulation through our innovative use of biodegradable seaweed pods at the London Marathon, helping the event to become more sustainable than ever.'

A Balance Festival spokesman said: 'We are committed to making Balance Festival as environmentally friendly as possible and widely recycle waste from the festival.

'We also have several initiatives to reduce plastic waste including a partnership with Sol Cup to sell reusable cups at an affordable price, supplying 100 per cent plant-based, fully biodegradable cups in partnership with Decent Packaging to all of our coffee and drinks vendors and have water taps on site for refillable water bottles.'"
"Sindiso Khumalo designs. Picture: Supplied.

Cape Town based designer, Sindiso Khumalo, who founded her eponymous brand in 2014 with a strong focus on creating vibrant, culturally infused fashion pieces with sustainable textiles at the heart will be showcasing at this year’s Vodacom Durban July taking place at Greyville Racecourse on July 6.



Describing herself as a vintage, nostalgic kind of girl, Khumalo, who will be paying homage to her hometown, Durban and will exhibit five pieces which will be screen printed, reds, blues, and some other beautiful colors.





Khumalo will be showcasing alongside Maxhosa and Rich Factory- some of Africa’s acclaimed designers.

How will you be interpreting the ""Stars of Africa"" theme?





For me, the key thing is I believe looking forward is all about looking backward. It is about creating these beautiful garments that have a little bit of a nod to the past but definitely are very much modern. Some of the prints are inspired by African folktales and other prints are inspired by women. So women are the stars of Africa. There is a little bit of the futurist female in my work and women empowerment.





What are some of the colours and fabrics used for your collection?





I used a lot of red, a bit of red denim as well. There is a lot of screen printing and there are lots of signature Sindiso Khumalo prints.

What are your top 5 style tips for the Durban July?





Be individual

Don't be scared of fashion, have fun and play with it

Be creative

Create a mood board with your inspiration. Look at a magazine, Pinterest, and even on the streets

Have fun its fashion. Don't take it too seriously

What's next for your brand?





Its been a very busy six months, following the Vodacom Durban July we are opening an online store. In the same month, we have book publishers that we are working with for my prints to be on books. I am always super excited to be doing more collaborations but the most important thing is building a strong sustainable business which is what this is all about for me.

"Rent the Runway's new fulfillment center in Arlington, only the company's second, begins receiving returns on Monday from customers who use the apparel service.

The center will employ more than 500 people by the end of the year and will process all categories that the company rents -- from designer dresses to maternity apparel and kids clothing.

A pioneer in the share economy, Rent the Runway said its 300,000-square-foot fulfillment center will allow it to cut shipping times and continue to expand its merchandise mix and designer brands. Later this summer, it's adding home textiles, including bedding and accessories, in a partnership with West Elm.

The Arlington facility, which has been in the works since last year, will be the first for Rent the Runway to be ""fully automated,"" said Marv Cunningham, Rent the Runway's chief supply officer. The operation is driven by radio frequency identification tags that are attached to items and electronically scanned.

The technology speeds up sorting of returns and puts clothing back into the available inventory more quickly, he said. Plus, customers' returns are logged in faster so they can receive their next selections.

""We expect to do two times the volume in Arlington because of the automation,"" Cunningham said."
"Boohoo has revealed it will continue to sell wool products after announcing it would ban the sale of garments containing the material as of autumn 2019.

The online retailer was criticised for its plans by wool producers, with one sheep farmer telling Sky News he was ""absolutely disgusted"" by news of the ban.

Within hours of making the announcement, which was applauded by animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), Boohoo issued a statement explaining that it had decided to revert the ban.

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.

""Boohoo continues to assess all options as part of its ongoing commitment to a more sustainable future,"" it read.

""We are committed to ensuring the wool used in our supply chain comes from good husbandry and meets high levels of animal welfare, and will continue to use wool as a sustainable material.""

PETA has been actively campaigning for retailers to take a stance against the wool industry since 2014.

The Virginia-based organisation has released 11 exposés on the subject, which claim that sheep are abused for their wool.

PETA also claims that the wool industry “wreaks havoc” on the environment.

But according to Phil Stocker, chief executive of the National Sheep Association, it's very rare for professional shearers to treat sheep in a cruel manner.

He's also argued that opting for alternative materials such as nylon and polyester over wool can have a more damaging effect on the environment.

“Wool is one of the most sustainable fibres on Earth,” Stocker told The Times.

“It would be absurd to replace wool, a natural material, with plastic fibres which do not degrade, are made from fossil fuel and may end up polluting the ocean.”"

It's not easy to know what to wear when you're moving from outdoor heat to a chilly, air conditioned office.

During the summer months , this sartorial conundrum can leave us wondering exactly how we should be dressing for work.

No one wants to be bathed in sweat on their commute or shivering under the office AC.

Try maxi and midi dresses

Maxi and midi dresses are ideal for the summer months and can be purchased in a variety of flowing, ditzy styles and more structured designs, depending on your personal preference and the kind of office you work in.

Choose cottons and linens

Synthetic fibres are not you friend in the summer months, as they'll usually make you hotter and may cause you to sweat. Pick natural cottons and linens instead to ensure that you stay chill outside and warm once you're in an air conditioned building.

Loose clothing reigns supreme

Boxy or loose mens-style shirts are perfectly office appropriate and will keep your body temperature regulated once you step outside.

They can be paired with leggings or pencil skirts to offset then bagginess and keep your look feeling put-together. Wide-legged trousers are also ideal office wear for the summer months, as they keep you both covered and cool.

Lots of layering

Layers are the key for moving from office to the outdoors in the hottest months of the year. Light shirts, summer jackets and cropped cardigans all look perfect paired with dresses and tank tops, and can be easily removed on your journey to and from work.

Avoid mini-skirts and crop tops

As summery and Instagramable as these items may be, they’re definitely not office-friendly unless you work in a particularly relaxed environment."
"Three major fashion brands will stop selling their products at Myer, in another blow for the struggling department store giant.

Country Road, Politix and Mimco, all operating under the Country Road Group, will now be exclusively sold at David Jones stores.

The fashion brands are set to disappear from Myer's shelves within 12 month.

Myer cops another blow as three major fashion brands are going to cease distribution from the department store

David Jones chief executive David Thomas (pictured) said that the company was proud to offer the brands exclusively to their customers

Woolworths Holdings, the owner of David Jones and the Country Road Group, made the announcement on Thursday.

The decision comes after David Jones' profits were halved to $63 million over the last financial year, the Herald Sun reported.

David Jones chief executive David Thomas said the company was proud to offer the brands exclusively to their customers.

'(This) will be a major step in differentiating our unique brand portfolio and providing our customers with an unrivalled department store experience,' he said.

David Jones also announced new partnerships with international luxury brands including Burberry Beauty and Christian Louboutin Beauty.

'We look forward to announcing more exclusive brand partnerships in the weeks to come as we build on this offer,' Mr Thomas said.

The company has also moved its head office from Sydney to Melbourne.

Earlier this year, Myer reported a record-breaking $476.2 million loss over just six months.

Following this loss, they tried to lure back their 'traditional' customers rather than high-spending, fashion-forward shoppers.

Myer was also reported to cut their retail staff drastically, which saw up to 29,000 shop assistants losing their jobs across the country."
"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s Burberry will no longer burn unsold luxury goods to protect its brand after an admission that it destroyed almost $40 million worth of stock last year sparked a furor over waste in the fashion industry.

Burberry also said on Thursday it would no longer use real fur such as mink and racoon, in another step towards improving its social and environmental credentials which was immediately welcomed by animal rights campaigners.

The waste revelation in July from Burberry came only months after the owner of Cartier and Montblanc admitted to destroying some of their unsold watches and coincides with growing public awareness of waste and its environmental impact.

“Modern luxury means being socially and environmentally responsible,” said CEO Marco Gobbetti, who is taking Burberry more upmarket. Its coats sell for more than 2,500 pounds ($3,234) and handbags are priced at up to 1,500 pounds.

Many retailers have been called out in recent years for destroying unsold stock, including by slashing or punching holes in garments before throwing them out.

Richemont, owner of luxury watch brands, said it bought back unsold stock from dealers during a recent downturn and recycled the precious metals and stones that were in the high-end pieces.

Burberry physically destroyed 28.6 million pounds worth of finished goods in the financial year to April, up from 26.9 million pounds the previous year, including 10 million pounds worth of beauty products such as perfume.

The products are generally those that did not sell via discount outlets and are more than five years old. Burberry said it would try to reuse, repair, donate or recycle its products while a strategy to make fewer, more targeted collections should help reduce excess stock.

It is also working with the sustainable luxury company Elvis & Kresse to transform 120 tonnes of leather offcuts into new products over the next five years.

GROWING AWARENESS

Exane BNP Paribas analyst Luca Solca said Burberry’s announcement could put pressure on other luxury names to be more transparent about how they handle unsold goods.

“Concerns about sustainability are slowly but surely becoming more relevant for luxury goods consumers,” he said.

Some luxury groups offer sales to employees and journalists to limit unsold stock. Both Kering, owner of Gucci and Alexander McQueen, and LVMH, owner of Louis Vuitton, Celine, Christian Dior and Givenchy, declined to comment.

Chanel said it did everything it could to avoid destroying stock, including selling items from previous collections to employees and partners, and starting production on goods once it has received orders from buyers.

The issue of excess stock is, in volume terms, a much bigger problem in the mass market, where retailers and consumers churn rapidly through different styles.

Greenpeace says 73 percent of textile fibers used to produce more than 100 billion garments each year end up in landfill or incinerators after they have been used.

H&M, the world’s second-biggest fashion retailer after Inditex, has said in the past it burns stock, but only when it is damaged or, for example, has high levels of chemicals in it. At the end of May the Swedish group had $4 billon of unsold stock that it said it hoped to sell.

“Under no circumstances do we destroy clothes that are safe to use,” a spokeswoman said. Britain’s Primark said unsold products and samples were donated to charity.

Burberry is following the likes of Versace, Gucci and the trailblazer for ethical fashion, Stella McCartney, in removing real fur from its ranges.

The moves are part of a series of changes at Burberry where Gobbetti is pinning his hopes on new designer Riccardo Tisci to transform the quintessentially British fashion house. Former Givenchy star Tisci has previously designed costumes for Beyonce and Madonna and releases his debut collection in September.

“We are committed to applying the same creativity to all parts of Burberry as we do to our products,” Gobbetti said.

PETA, the campaign group for the ethical treatment of animals, welcomed Burberry’s move to stop using fur, which it said was a sign of the times.

“The few fashion houses refusing to modernize and listen to the overwhelming public opinion against fur are now sticking out like a sore thumb for all the wrong reasons,” PETA’s director of international programs, Mimi Bekhechi said.

Campaign group Humane Society International said animal charities would unite during this year’s major fashion shows to call on Italian brand Prada to follow Burberry’s lead.

The head of the International Fur Federation, Mark Oaten, said substituting natural fur with “plastic petroleum-based materials, like fake fur” was neither luxury nor responsible.

"Superdry shares crashed 22 per cent in early trading today after the global clothing firm warned that its annual profits would be £10million short.

The company, which was founded in 1985 in Cheltenham, said the ongoing warm weather in the UK, US and Europe has knocked its bottom line.

The unseasonable weather killed off demand for coats, jackets and winter-wear - lines that usually account for nearly half of Superdry's annual sales.

Superdry said its autumn/winter lines typically account for 45% of its yearly sales

Superdry also revealed £8million of surprise foreign exchange costs, after its hedging mechanisms failed to provide adequate protection.

Boss Euan Sutherland insisted that 'Superdry is a strong brand with significant growth opportunities, backed by robust operational capabilities.'

'But we are not immune to the challenges presented by this extraordinary period of unseasonably hot weather,' he added.

In a move to become less reliant on winter sales, Superdry has started an 18-month product diversification programme. It also plans to spend £5million growing its online business.

The firm once again pointed to the turbulent retail environment today, noting the 'well-publicised challenges' faced by some of its peers.

Along with volatile consumer confidence and falling footfall, a number of brands have been stung by the collapse of House of Fraser.

The administration process, which hurt the likes of Ted Baker, Mulberry and Coast, left Superdry out of pocket by an estimated £236,000.

Commenting on today's profit warning, retail analyst Nick Bubb says: 'It is true that Superdry is more dependent than most fashion retailers on heavy outerwear, but, even so, it seems a bit feeble to blame the latest profit warning on the warm weather.

'Management credibility is on the wane and the City will punish Superdry's rating even more today.'

The unscheduled statement triggered a steep slide in the share price to £7.95 - a far cry from the £19.80 its shares fetched at the start of 2018.

Superdry is the latest in a long line of fashion firms to bemoan unusual weather patterns this year.

Industry body, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) warned in August that if the warmer temperatures carried on into October it could cost non-food firms more than £300million."
"Activist Jameela Jamil has been criticised for her involvement in the new 'role model' campaign for fashion retailer, Aerie.

On Thursday, the British actress, 32, proudly took to her Twitter platform to unveil the brand's new unretouched spring 2019 campaign, which aims to celebrate women being their 'real selves' and strike down unrealistic beauty standards within the lingerie and clothing industry.

However, the message fell flat on her followers who questioned Jameela's advocacy of the brand, which failed to cater for inclusive and extended sizes.

Coming under fire: Activist Jameela Jamil, 32, has been criticised for her involvement in the new 'role model' campaign for fashion retailer, Aerie

Jameela has long been a passionate advocate for body positivity and has hit back at a number of celebrities in the past, including the Kardashian sisters, for using products such as detox teas to lose weight.

After hitting out at other brands in recent weeks, such as Avon and Urban Outfitters, Jameela seemed to have finally found her perfect fit as she took to Twitter on Thursday to share her new campaign for Aerie.

Jameela tweeted: 'So excited to announce that I am joining @Aerie as an #aerierolemodel and got to stand next to so many women I love and admire at our shoot. No retouching and inclusive of everyone. #aeriepartner.

She continued: 'This is a campaign about inclusion of plus size, disability, race, sexuality, and activism, but also check out their sizing which is moving in the right direction that most brands don’t care about.'

'Inclusion': After hitting out at brands in recent weeks, such as Avon and Urban Outfitters, Jameela seemed to have finally found her perfect fit as she shared her new campaign for Aerie

However, many of her followers didn't agree with the latter statement of her tweet, in which she gushed about Aerie's sizing, and didn't hesitate in letting her know:

'This is a bit disappointing. Maybe you could use this platform to encourage them to offer plus sizes. You can’t just use “body positivity” in your brand but not offers sizes for all bodies.'

'I can't wait til I'm skinny enough to be included in the group ""everyone"". #aerierolemodel #aeriepartner #everybody.'

'Please provide extended sizes if you’re going to advertise plus size. I am literally one cup bigger than the largest size available.'

'Let’s not say everyone if it’s not for everyone.'

'Not inclusive of fat people. 'Curves' that only go to a 38 bra size and clothing where XXL is supposed to cover 18-22 (3 sizes? Really??!) are not inclusive. When the *average* woman is size 16, this is a problem. Hope you continue to advocate for change.'

'It's not for everyone': However, the message fell flat on her followers who questioned Jameela's advocacy of the brand, which failed to cater for inclusive and extended sizes

Meanwhile, Jameela continued to gush about the campaign, tweeting: 'Thank you everyone who has been so supportive of our diverse @Aerie campaign, and to anyone who feels left out, I hear you and I am on it! I love it when you speak out.

'I only partner with brands who I believe will work with me towards inclusivity and doing and being better. ❤️.'

'A plus size model, a Paralympian, a south Asian, a black woman, a gay woman, a blind woman, activists, game changers, and women who use their platform to fight for others. I’ve never seen a campaign like this before that represents so many minorities, and I’m proud to be in it.

'Keep speaking up. Keep speaking out. It helps the change happen. ❤️'

'I'm so proud to be in it': Meanwhile, Jameela continued to gush about the campaign as she shared a further snap of all the women involved and their job titles

'Nothing about this is size-inclusive': However, her followers weren't buying it and the outrage continued to pour in from her followers

However, the outrage continued to pour in from her followers:

'I once drove 1hr out of my way to go to an Aerie store, thinking they were plus-size-inclusive after seeing some ads, & was promptly humiliated by the dirty looks the salespeople gave me as I entered. I left immediately. Aerie can shove their self-righteous body-posi lip service..'

'I love Jameela but nothing about this campaign is size-inclusive.'

'Don't get me started. If she wants to champion plus size women then how about giving them a platform instead of speaking for them. There have been plenty of plus size women saying this stuff for years and she's speaking like she's bringing something new to the table..'

'The most positive thing about this is almost every reply is from a sassy, beautiful woman saying ""this doesn't include me."" It's actually rare to see this many plus-size women have the space to be vocal. (That's probably why everyone forgets about us).'

'But they don't actually have all sizes and are representing themselves as if they do. It makes them look inclusive without actually being inclusive. A step in the right direction is nice, but I don't appreciate them stepping on the bodypos movement to sell their stuff.'

'I hear you and I am on it': It wasn't long before Jameela finally noticed the backlash under her tweets

'Without you all there would be no progress': Jameela also took time to respond individually to some of her comments

It wasn't long before Jameela finally noticed the backlash under her tweets, prompting her to reply:

'Thank you everyone who has been so supportive of our diverse @Aerie campaign, and to anyone who feels left out, I hear you and I am on it! I love it when you speak out. I only partner with brands who I believe will work with me towards inclusivity and doing and being better. ❤️.'

'Just sat down with some of the bosses at @aerie who assured me they are already working on becoming more and more inclusive in sizing. But please don’t lose sight of the fact that it’s also so cool to have blind, disabled, black, Asian, gay and sexual assault survivors repped too.'

Jameela also took time to respond individually to some of her comments, with one person tweeting:

'Very sorry we seem to be dogpiling on you but we curvy ladies were excited to see someone speaking out for all body types & were a little deflated that you were advocating a brand that almost half of the women in the US cannot patronize due to size.'

Inclusive: Joining Jameela in the campaign are Busy Philipps, Samira Wiley, Aly Raisman, Iskra Lawrence, Brenna Huckaby and Molly Burke

Voice: Jameela has long been an advocate for body positivity and has hit back at a number of celebrities in the past, including Kardashians for using products such as detox teas

Jameela replied: 'It’s not dogpiling! it’s much needed criticism that I’m so down to hear and help push forward. We can all do this together and your noise helps my noise. And noise makes change. So don’t stop making noise. Without all of you there would be no progress at all.'

Joining Jameela in the campaign are Busy Philipps, Samira Wiley, Aly Raisman, Iskra Lawrence, Brenna Huckaby and Molly Burke.

The #AerieREAL campaign first launched in 2014 with the brand's mission for women to love themselves and empower others to do the same.

Aerie became one of the first brands to launch the body positive movement with its commitment to stop using models in its campaign, instead highlighting real women from different walks of life that support the mission.

Its first ever Aerie Role Model was announced in 2016 as British plus-size model Iskra."

Australian clothing brands are using garment factories in countries like Bangladesh and Vietnam where their workers are being paid as little as 55 cents an hour.

Retailers in Australia's $23 billion fashion industry are using a 'system of entrenched exploitation' that is trapping millions of workers in poverty, a study by charity Oxfam Australia claims.

Labels such as Cotton On, Target, and Kmart have made commitments towards paying a 'living wage' to garment workers, however, progress in actual conditions across the supply chain is slow, the charity says.

A study by Oxfam claims Australian clothing brands are exploiting workers (pictured; Nahida, a sewing machine operator, helps her daughter, Rafsana, with her homework inside their home in Dhaka, Bangladesh)

A living wage means enough money is earned to cover basic needs such as food, housing, education and healthcare.

Oxfam also claims other Australian garment manufacturers will not reveal the factories where their clothes are made.

The report claims nine out of 10 garment workers in Bangladesh and over two-thirds in Vietnam, most of them women, struggle to pay for basics like food and medicine.

'If we don't see changes soon, we will continue to see a fashion industry that is perpetuating and fueling a system of poverty,' said Oxfam Australia's advocacy manager Joy Kyriacou.

'We will continue to see women who are running out of food and skipping meals every month, women who can't live with their children because they can't afford any childcare,' she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Sydney.

A spokesman for Kmart and Target said they had been working with suppliers, workers, and national governments to address the issue but did not give details.

Cotton On did not reply to a request for comment.

Oxfam is pushing for retailers to commit to ensuring a 'living wage' for workers meaning enough money is earned to cover basic needs such as food, housing, education and healthcare

Australia last month became only the second country in the world to bring in an anti-slavery law, requiring companies with a turnover of more than A$100 million to report on modern slavery risks in their supply chains.

The study said despite Australian firms' pledge to improve workers' rights, they put pressure on garment owners to drive wages down by using practices such as fierce price negotiation and short-term contracts.

The charity has released a 'report card' that rates the efforts being made by Australian fashion companies to provide a 'living wage' to garment workers.

Tania, a 21-year-old single mother in Bangladesh, told Oxfam she worked up to 12 hours a day for a $169 monthly wage, or about 55 cents an hour, and could only see her daughter, who lives with her parents in a village, twice a year.

Clothes manufacturers in Bangladesh, the world's second largest garment exporter, agreed to raise wages after a week of protests (pictured; garment workers shout slogans as they block a road during a demonstration to demand higher wages, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on January 9, 2019)

President of the Bangladesh Garment and Industrial Workers Federation, Babul Akter, urged the government to ensure decent treatment for its workers.

'Since there's a lot of competition among Bangladeshi factories internally, Australian buyers or any other buyers use this to their advantage and as a result give owners low prices that in turn affects the workers,' he said.

Clothes manufacturers in Bangladesh, the world's second largest garment exporter, agreed to raise wages across 6 of the 7 pay grades in January after a week of violent protests, but it left the minimum wage unchanged at 8,000 taka ($95) a month."

"Earth, meet Polo.

Polo Ralph Lauren on Thursday launched a version of its iconic polo shirt made entirely of recycled plastic bottles and dyed through a process that uses zero water.

David Lauren, the youngest son of the company's founder and its chief innovation officer, told The Associated Press ahead of the announcement that the new shirt is part of a broader strategy of fresh environmental goals throughout the manufacturing process.

""Every day we're learning about what's happened with global warming and what's happening all around the world, and our employees and our customers are really feeling that it's time to step up and make a difference,"" Lauren said.

12 bottles = 1 shirt

The Polo isn't the first of its kind. Smaller brands around the world are using repurposed and recycled materials. In announcing Earth Polo, Ralph Lauren committed to removing at least 170 million bottles from landfills and oceans by 2025. The shirts are manufactured in Taiwan, where the bottles are collected. Each uses an average 12 bottles.

The shirts are produced in partnership with First Mile, an organization that collects the bottles turned into yarn and, ultimately, fabric. The new fibres will also be used for existing performance wear already made of polyfibres, which are popular for their ability to wick away moisture.

The Earth Polo went on sale Thursday, ahead of Monday's Earth Day, at RalphLauren.com and retail stores around the world. It comes in styles for men and women in green, white, navy and light blue. The shirts are not more expensive than other Polos.

Ralph Lauren has taken on environmental initiatives over the years, but it's putting into place a more significant strategy aimed at changing both its corporate culture and how it thinks about the clothes it produces. The effort includes a new supply chain and sustainability officer, Halide Alagoz, who said more details will be released in June.

""At the moment we're refreshing our approach and framework around sustainability,"" she said.

Fashion house looking to sustainable cotton

Among the company's other goals: the use of 100 per cent sustainably sourced cotton by 2025 and 100 per cent recyclable or sustainably sourced packaging materials by the same year.

Other fashion powerhouses are also getting more aggressive on the environment.

Late last year, Burberry and H&M were among fashion stakeholders to sign on to the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action, launched at the United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP24, in Poland. The charter contains a vision to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Ralph Lauren is not a signatory but is exploring the call to action.

As for Earth Polo, a huge threat facing oceans today involves trillions of tiny plastic and chemical-covered non-plastic microfibres that flow from washing machines through drain water, placing smaller fish and other sea life, such as anemones, at risk. Alagoz said Ralph Lauren is working with experts who say the impact of turning a plastic bottle into recycled microfibre is ""much less than that bottle ending up in the ocean.""

The broader question of biodegradability of such fibres remains unresolved. For Polo Earth, the story is about recycling and reusing, Lauren said.

""There's so much out in the world that is not good for the environment. Whatever materials we can turn into threads, we'll start looking at other opportunities,"" he said. ""Right now, we're trying to make sure that what we produce is as good for the environment as possible, or at least helps clean up another problem. Are we creating a new problem? I think we're creating solutions, or at least trying to find solutions."""
"Converse is throwing a lot of spaghetti at the wall, trying collaboration after collaboration, while U.S. sales for its iconic Chuck Taylor high-and-low-top canvas sneakers continue to slump. This summer, at rough count, the brand will unveil a half-dozen collaborations and launches: Shoes made of upcycled jeans, shoes that change color like mood rings, shoes with dolphins. Even shoes that disavow being Chucks altogether.

It's puzzling, since Converse should be on fire right now: Retro sneakers are hot, clothing has never been more casual, and a recent Piper Jaffray survey shows teen girls spending more on footwear. Yet youthful, fashion-forward consumers, the future of any contemporary clothing or shoe brand, aren't feeling it for Converse as fervently as they were a few years ago.

The $2 billion subsidiary of Nike Inc. is losing marketshare to thick-soled Vans, a long-standing Chucks rival and favorite among streetwear enthusiasts, including skateboarders.

Vans last year posted sales of $3 billion, a 45% increase, according to its parent company, VF Corp., behind other activewear and sportswear brands as Timberland, The North Face, Wrangler, and Jansport. Recently, Vans was named the second most popular athletic brand—behind Nike's athletic kicks—in a Piper Jaffray survey of 8,000 teens.

In contrast, Converse's revenues have continued to deflate and there has been executive turnover. Matt Powell, sports industry advisor for NPD Group, said Converse's sales are down by a ""mid teens"" percentage year-over-year through June, according to data his firm collects. NPD's data excludes Converse's own stores and its e-commerce business.

Nike, a $39 billion brand, bought Converse in 2003 for $200 million. At the time, the brand had an audience of aging loyalists and reference-savvy youngsters who knew Chuck Taylors had been a uniform for artists (Jackson Pollock), actors (James Dean, Marlon Brando) and musicians (Kurt Cobain, Bob Dylan, the Ramones.) In old photos, those dirtied, spattered, and knotted-up Chucks reflected the patina of famous, creative lives of iconoclasts.

Every generation has a Converse standard-bearer. In recent years, it has been actor Kristen Stewart, slipping into Converse while promoting Chanel. Model Kaia Gerber is photographed constantly in Chucks; ditto Blue Ivy, Beyonce and Jay Z's seven year-old daughter. Presidential hopeful Kamala Harris says she has a closet full of Chucks. Instagram has more than 1.4 million posts tagged #chucks and more than a million more with variation hashtags.

Chucks are ""part of the cultural fabric of America. You can wear a pair of Converse sneakers anywhere, because they are cool. They don’t try too hard. They’re not precious,"" said Linda Knight, chief creative officer of Phenomenon, an advertising and branding agency.

In fact, while Converse continually trots out dolled-up, collectible versions of Chucks, what celebrities and style influencers often wear is the brand's basic style, in black or white. The shoes are often considered the epitome of cool when they are ratty from wear, not collectible perfect.

The reinvented-Chuck design collaborations run the gamut from streetwear to high-end fashion to sports. They are often in limited runs and grab attention. A design by New York graphic artist Filip Pagowski and Comme des Garçons' Rei Kawakubo, with peering eyes against a red-heart emerging from the sole of white or black high tops, sold out soon after its June 20 launch. So did the marine-mammal inspired Chucks designs by Stranger Things actress Millie Bobbie Brown, released in July. The next collaboration to drop is one with rapper and music impresario Tyler, the Creator, who developed the Golf le Fleur Colorblock collection in white leather with red or green sides of the sole, with matching shoelaces.



Even with softer sales, the Chuck Taylor is money. Since its launch in 1917 as a basketball shoe, the sneaker has sold more than a billion pairs worldwide, and still has ""tremendous resonance,"" numbering among the top 10 shoe styles sold in the U.S. every year, Powell said. The Chuck Taylor All-Star brand has been a star for parent company Nike: Revenues have grown tenfold in 15 years.

Reinventing, while re-energizing

Converse is working feverishly to re-ignite. In addition to continually remixing the recipe for Chucks, it's trying to jump-start other businesses within the brand. In a Nike conference call in late June, Andy Campion, Converse's executive vice president and CFO, cited a ""new, energized leadership team at Converse, focused on fueling growth through product diversification, including reigniting Converse's authentic brand positioning in basketball."" In April, they debuted the All Star Pro BB, a good-looking Converse basketball shoe juiced by Nike performance technology.

There's also Converse Renew, a sustainability initiative launching this summer with Chucks made from upcycled blue jeans and recycled water bottles, respectively.

Going forward, a Converse spokesperson said the Renew initiative will undergird all product designs. "" Renew is a strategy,"" she said. ""Through Renew, we are exploring new methods...that both lessen our environmental impact and make smart use of existing materials, like recycled textiles, plastics, and our own leftover canvas.

Starting with the Chuck, the spokesperson said, ""we can achieve global scale quickly. That means that, within the next year, there will be hundreds of thousands pairs of Chucks made from up-cycled and recycled materials diverting countless tons from landfill.""



Since 2015, they've also tackled fit. Traditional Chucks are notoriously thin and unsupportive, not great for aging feet or expectations of yoga-pant comfiness. They've twice re-engineered Chucks for a sleeker look and a cushier, more modern fit. The Chuck II didn't meet sales expectations. It's unclear how the Chuck Modern, a new swing at the same ball, is faring. ""I don't know if the customer recognizes the differences,"" Powell noted.

And this may be part of the problem with so many collaborations and Chucks in existence. When you Google ""Converse"" you can find countless designs—from giraffe, dinosaur, and Hello Kitty prints to Coca-Cola, Andy Warhol and Batman motifs. With such a Chucks echo chamber, it may be hard for the consumer to differentiate, or feel compelled to add another pair to the closet.

However, the brand seems to get this, reflected in the ironic design of the recent Chuck70 for Footlocker. Graffitied on the shoe: ""This is Not a Chuck.""

Play hard to get?

Sam Poser, equity research analyst at Susquehanna International, said Converse needs to fix its overall brand appeal. He suggested the company use a ""pull model"" as Nike does. In a pull model, brands deliberately keep supply hovering just below demand, particularly on coveted styles. When a customer can't snap up a product, it whets their appetite for the next round of merch. ""Nike has done a great job with this. Lulu has done a great job. Adidas has done a great job,"" Posner said. ""Their brands are sacrosanct.""

While the company's design collaborations are creating consumer buzz, and often sell out, in general, Converse hasn't created much buying urgency. Without fixing this issue, Posner asserted, its hard for other initiatives to catch hold.

Knight suggested the brand should own their ""authentic, anti-establishment, punk side...Let everyone else duke it out in the sports and luxury category. Own the anti-statement.""

On Instagram, they're doing some of this. #InMyConverse features profiles of social activists, such as Legally Black, a UK collective which replaces white actors in famous movie posters with black people to raise media awareness.

Reinvigorating U.S. sales

Asked to weigh which of Converse's launches could help U.S. sales rebound, Powell said Converse Renew has some potential: ""The customer is absolutely concerned about sustainability and they've said they'd be willing to pay more for products made sustainably."" But, he added, Converse has to tell that story well, so the customer understands the product's attributes and $5 to $10 price premium. Some of the sustainable shoes read: ""Life's too short to waste.""

Powell was skeptical about Converse's recast basketball business, given overall lackluster demand for basketball shoes, and the fact that other major brands have targeted the category with lots of new product. ""They're all hoping basketball comes back as a fashion look and want to be ready to leverage that,"" Powell said. ""Long term, I'm not optimistic.""

Tiffany K. Schreane, marketing expert and Fashion Institute of Technology lecturer, said for its basketball shoe, Converse needs to market the brand with a face of a player. (Converse has developed shoes with basketball player Kelly Oubre, Jr., of the Phoenix Suns, and China's Abudushalamu Abudurexiti, playing for Xinjiang Flying.)

Whether or not they can become a basketball brand again and whether or Chuck needs to lean in to outsider status to rebuild demand, Converse isn't going anywhere. It's an icon, a blank canvas, ready for any style.

""The main strength working for Converse is their longevity, quality, and clean name in the sneaker space,"" Schreane said. ""They don't have to introduce an audience to their name, but more so reintroduce and reestablish themselves.""

"Trending Cornering the market of African textiles

Wacy Zacarias started Karingana Wa Karingana textiles to create authentic African prints, writes Design Indaba’s Jamie Matroos.

Clothes, patterns and evocative prints had always held meaning for Mozambican entrepreneur Wacy Zacarias. From the capulanas that were passed down to her from her grandmother to her memories of older women draped in customary garb, textiles were a way to assert individuality while paying homage to age-old tradition.

But one realisation would change the way Zacarias interacted with African textiles and set her on a path to change the game in her home country and on the continent.

“I ended up figuring out that African textiles were not, in fact, really African. They were textiles that were brought to Africa via trade,” she says. “Some of them were an imitation of textiles that existed in west Africa. So they were like the mass-production answer to handmade textiles in west Africa. There are some batik elements in some of them, but mostly they were produced in China or Holland.”

The history behind her discovery can be traced back to 1846 when Dutch textiles giant Vlisco first set up shop. The company had mechanised the wax-printing method used to make batiks worn in Indonesia. They introduced these lower-cost, mass-produced products to the west African market, replacing the more costly handmade textiles of the time.

While the market was later joined by Chinese and Indian companies, Vlisco remains one of the most popular makers and distributors of what we now know as African textiles. Today, 95% of Vlisco’s products are sold to African consumers. This is even though, as Nigerian scholar Tunde Akinwumi points out, the motif is based on non-African design.

“It’s kind of like a borrowed culture; it’s no longer ours,” says Zacarias. “If you look more in-depth about the design process of these textiles, there’s nothing really about African heritage in them. It’s just somebody in a company somewhere in Europe or in China or in India who is dictating what is African now.

“So this is really the moment that I decided I wanted to be a part of doing something about this. I wanted to be part of that solution.”

Zacarias started her first company in 2008, before learning about the history of African textiles. Woogui is an ethical accessories and tailored shirt brand established to “reinvent the African fashion industry in Mozambique”.

Later, along with Mozambican fashion designer Djamila de Sousa, Zacarias established Karingana Wa Karingana, a Mozambique-based company that prints authentic African textiles, based on tradition and culture.

In a print designed to raise awareness about Movember, a month dedicated to prostate cancer awareness, Zacarias tackled an issue that’s not as widely discussed in Africa.

“It’s us saying to them [African consumers] that sometimes things that come from outside are interesting and are important. It’s us raising awareness about men’s health and saying to our African brothers, go get yourself checked out. So this was a very interesting print to design,” she adds.

In another print series, Zacarias pays tribute to the Mozambican capital of Maputo. “That print connects with all of us because it’s about the city we grew up in,” she explains. “It has the icons that we believe in and see every day. Like there’s a church that is very iconic. There is the public transport. There’s the dhal boat that you see here. There’s a cassia flower. So those are all things that we recognise as part of our heritage.”

Through storytelling, Zacarias hopes to bridge the gap between African textiles produced in Africa, where the production and importation of raw materials are more expensive, and the accessibility of cheaper mass-produced prints from across the seas.



But, not everyone has taken such a hardline stance to what constitutes an authentic African print. Dilys E Blum, the Philadelphia Museum of Art’s senior curator of costume and textiles, explained to Fast Company magazine that, no matter where the prints are sourced, they still give way to African individuality, expression and customised tailoring.

“On the body, they are something completely different because the dressmaker or tailor has to use that pattern in a creative way,” she was quoted as saying.

For Zacarias, the aim is not to replace this process but, rather, to offer an alternative.

“We’re fully aware that it would be very hard for us to compete with China and India price-wise, because mass production does mean more accessibility. But we are not trying to compete with them,” she explains.

“We are offering them an alternative. We are offering a niche market product and we are aware that we are going to have a higher price, but we are offering something that is made in Africa.”

Zacarias says she is motivated by the idea that Africa could be retaining more of the annual profit made by African textiles globally. She is part of a growing number of fashion designers, including Nigerian Amaka Osakwe of Maki-Oh and French-Ivorian Laurence Chauvin-Buthaud of LaurenceAirline, who view sourcing within Africa as a matter of national pride.

“There are textiles that are worn when people are born; there are textiles that are worn when people die; there are textiles only wedded women can wear in certain regions of Africa. So there’s a language, almost; there’s a way of communicating through the textiles that exist in our culture. It’s still very present today,” she added."
"Tan France has revealed the reason he doesn’t criticise people who buy from fast fashion brands.

Before his appearance on Netflix TV series Queer Eye, France studied fashion at Doncaster College, going on to open his own clothing company and work for a number of different retailers including high street stalwart Zara.

But, with the conversation around sustainability louder than ever before, what does the Queer Eye expert really think about fast fashion?

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.

Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, France revealed that, although he works in an industry associated with fast fashion – inexpensive clothing produced rapidly by mass-market retailers in response to current trends – he doesn’t believe in the concept of wearing something just once.

“I’m in an industry where you would assume I would only wear something once and not wear it again because I’ve already posted about it. I don’t,” he told radio host Laura Whitmore.

“If I love something I wear it a lot, I spend my money on things that I know are going to be classic and I can wear at least for the next few years.”

Despite this, France admitted he doesn’t judge people who wear lower priced clothes.

“Fast fashion, I don’t knock it because I remember being poor and not being able to afford a look that David Beckham was wearing so I would get a cheap version of it somewhere else,” he explained.

“I would get the look for a lot less because that was the only option available to me so I don’t knock anybody who is going to a fast fashion retailer.”

The 35-year-old also gave his tips for dressing in a sustainable way on a budget, calling for people to educate themselves on what is a false economy.

“I would try and encourage people to be more selective with what they’re purchasing and not be as wasteful,” he said.

“I think it’s a false economy to buy, let’s say for example, five pairs of black jeans from a really low price retailer, that’s not going to last as long, they’re going to last a couple of months each.

“Whereas if you just saved that money and spent your money on one pair of black jeans that are better quality, they’re going to last you longer in the long run.

“I think people need better education on what’s a false economy.”

France returns to the small screen with the third season of Queer Eye on 15 March.

The reality show follows the “Fab Five”, food and wine expert Antoni Porowski, grooming expert Jonathan Van Ness, fashion expert Tan France, design expert Bobby Berk and culture expert Karamo Brown, as they transform individuals lives.

Netflix has announced that the Queer Eye team are also flying to Asia to “work with local tastemakers to make-better a new group of heroes” while sampling the local culture.

The episodes, titled Queer Eye: We’re in Japan!, will be available on the streaming service following the third season."
"In honour of Black History Month, we're taking a cat walk down fashion memory lane, highlighting marquee contributions by Black Canadians. There will likely be some moments that you remember very well, but others may have gone under your radar.

These people have all broken boundaries, helping shape and advance an industry that doesn't always lift up people of colour. February or not, it's important to remember and acknowledge the significant contributions of these Black Canadians to fashion in Canada and worldwide.

The brand was thrust back into the spotlight during the Drake/Pusha T beef.

"Mr Goenka is aiming to increase annual sales to $500 million in three to five years and believes overseas sales will soon overtake domestic sales as the group opens stores and concessions and expands its online reach.

""We are a truly global business,"" said Mr Goenka, 50.

""When I envisaged the brand in my head it was always a global brand – that’s why our first overseas store opened in 2009,"" he said.

""Forever New has a unique product offering, it's not only relevant to the southern hemisphere, it's relevant globally. With our distinctive feminine aesthetic and focus on quality at affordable price points we really offer a point of difference and value.

Portable brand

""So our global expansion has been a lot [easier] and [more] profitable compared with anybody else who doesn’t have those elements. Our brand is very portable – you could take our brand anywhere else in the world and it will work.""

It also helps that Mr Goenka has been manufacturing clothing for 30 years and supplies some of the world's largest brands including New Look, Zara-owner Inditex, Mango, Topshop, PVH Corp (the owner of Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein), Esprit and Guess.

Mr Goenka is the founder and chairman of Hangzhou-based textiles company Indochine International, which has more than a dozen factories in China, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Ethiopia.

Interestingly, his factories do not supply Forever New.

Forever New is not a fully vertically integrated retailer but sources from several suppliers in China and south-east Asia, designing separate ranges for the southern and northern hemispheres to overcome reverse seasonality challenges and emulating global retailers such as Zara and H &M by dropping new stock into stores every week.

""We don't use any of my own factories, just to distinguish and have the two businesses quite separate."" Mr Goenka said.

""My manufacturing business is more for volume retailers ... Forever New's quality requirements are a lot better so we use different suppliers around the globe.

Quality and fit

""But obviously my supply experience of 30 years helps. We are agile, we source at the right cost, we make sure quality and fit is of paramount importance.

""I have a very talented team (including 25 designers based in Melbourne) and we really stick to our brand and our uniqueness. We stand for who we are and that’s why we look different.""

According to ASIC records, Forever New sales rose 11 per cent in 2018 to $298 million, fuelled by stronger same-store sales in Australia and new stores overseas.

After a brand refresh late last year, when Forever New launched a new e-commerce platform, loyalty program and new store design, sales are growing between 5 per cent and 8 per cent despite the weak Australian retail sector.

The growth also comes despite Forever New being in competition with some of the biggest names in Australian retail such as Myer, David Jones and Premier Investment-owned brands Dotti and Portmans.

""We are doing nicely in Australia and wherever the growth comes along in Australia we are expanding,"" he said. ""But Australia is going through a slow cycle and people are generally spending less on clothing.""

Forever New is 50 per cent owned by Mr Goenka and 50 per cent by Mr Singh through his private investment vehicle, Rianta Capital.

Last October the company converted $100 million of related party loans into equity, significantly strengthening the balance sheet.

New Look founder Tom Singh owns 50 per cent of Forever New. Jessica Shapiro

""The balance sheet looks stronger to the banks and other people as we look at global expansion,"" Mr Goenka said.

Despite his 30 years in the apparel industry, connections with some of the world's biggest retailers and the global success of Forever New, Mr Goenka has managed to stay below the radar.

Advertisement

""That's how I like it,"" said the father of two. ""We’re quietly doing our own business without making too much noise – that’s probably the best thing my grandfather [BK Goenka] taught me.""

After graduating with a degree in computer engineering from University of Southern California, Mr Goenka returned to India but was more interested in fashion than joining the family's sprawling industrial empire.

""In India and south-east Asia it's who you know and how you know and those things matter more than your own calibre and what you can do,"" he said. ""I didn’t want to be any part of that. I really wanted to stand on my own two feet.""

Gap in market

He started a manufacturing business in Bombay with a $US20,000 bank loan and, after moving to Melbourne in 2000, spotted a gap in the market for an affordable feminine fashion brand.

Mr Goenka said the company had no plans for an initial public offering or sale.

""We're getting really good global growth so right now the intention of mine and Rianta's is to focus on growth. We haven't really discussed a change in our ownership structure,"" he said.

""But in three to five years, who knows. We'll look at options but right now the focus is really on growing the business. Being privately owned is an advantage – we can really focus on investing and growing the business for the long term."""
"Tesler Mendelovitch is making waves as recent market analysis of Wood Textiles has shown Inspired by minimalism and mathematical precision, Tesler Mendelovitch transform stiff, brittle wood into soft, bendable textiles. More information can be found at https://www.tesler-mendelovitch.com/

Emek Hefer, Israel - February 7, 2019 /PressCable/ —

A market analysis of Tesler Mendelovitch’s Wood Textiles; Wooden textiles for fashion apparel, architecture and interior design within the architects, interior designers, fashion designers and automotive industry market, inspired by minimalism and mathematical precision, Tesler Mendelovitch transform stiff, brittle wood into soft, bendable textiles.

"The fashion industry may be a leading contributor to our planet’s pollution problem – but as shoppers become increasingly eco-aware, brands are being forced to revisit their manufacturing processes and make them more sustainable.

It is estimated that by 2050, there will be a greater volume of plastic than fish in the ocean, with 1.4 billion tons of waste entering our seas every year.

There are more than 600,000 tons of fish nets floating around, making up a tenth of all marine litter, killing animals and destroying coral reefs.

Every ton contains enough nylon to make over 10,000 swimsuits, which is why conscious fashion designers have been turning to techno fabric ECONYL.

This soft lycra is cleverly made from regenerated ghost nets and textile waste that can be recycled and remoulded again and again. It’s extra resistant to chlorine and sun cream, meaning it keeps its shape and colour for longer.

We’ve looked for brands that tick our ethical boxes without compromising on quality or style. These swimsuits and bikinis may cost more than the mass-produced, throwaway deluge found in many popular high street shops, but they’ll last you years and keep your conscience clear, without looking bland or frumpy.

Note that it’s always best to hand wash your swimwear to minimise the shedding of plastic microfibres and keep it in better nick for longer.

Devonshire sustainable swimwear brand Davy J got a lot of shout-outs when we asked conscious shoppers for their recommendations. These sturdy suits are designed for swimming and being adventurous in, as well as poolside posing, and are built to last. Divers help recover abandoned fishing nets and feed them into the production process, meaning for every 100 pieces sold, around 9kg of plastic waste has been put to fresh use. New styles include a cut-out one-piece and high-waisted bikini bottoms that can be pulled up to overlap with the top or rolled down to reveal a contrasting lining. Sizes range from 8 to 18.

IndyBest pick: The little black swimsuit: £140, Davy J

Just like the little black dress, everybody needs a go-to black swimsuit. This classic cut beauty is hard-wearing enough for cliff jumping and beach volleyball but also looks fabulous paired with a floaty skirt and wedges for the bar. It’s double-lined with thick straps that cross at the back and help keep everything in place.

Based on the north-west coast, micro brand Batoko also makes swimwear out of recycled plastic waste. Collections are deliberately kept small to maintain quality and a slower, more planet-friendly pace, so there are just nine fun and colourful designs to choose from. Prepare to want them all, from orca whales to lobsters. The size range is wider than most we’ve found, from 6 (XS) to 20 (XL) and the cost is more than reasonable for the quality. Recycled packaging is kept to a minimum and a proportion of the profits go to the Marine Conservation Society. Mums may enjoy the option to buy matching mini versions for any little eco-warriors at half price.

IndyBest pick: Wild cat swimsuit: £50, Batoko

“Water loving jungle cats” are the inspiration behind this wild animal print swimsuit that’s back for a limited run this season. Its cut is classic with a scoop neck and lower back, and it looks gorgeous under a long, loose-fitting shirt on the beach.

Gyko’s motto is “less mis-match, more mix-match”. These ECONYL bikinis are modular; finally, every woman can find their perfect combo from three styles of top and three styles of bottom. Everything is made under one roof in London by a not-for-profit social enterprise that provides full-time training and day courses for anyone considering a fashion career. The packaging is plastic-free. Sizing is currently limited, only going up to a DD cup and size 12, but the range is set to expand soon.

IndyBest pick: Top two: £50; bottom three: £40, Gyko

If you want to play it safe, top three offers the most support and bottom two the most coverage. If those factors are less of an issue for you, our favourites are top two with its vintage Hollywood vibe and the high leg of bottom three. The honey colour will look amazing with a tan but it also comes in red or black.

Selkie Swim Co is all about empowering open water swimmers of all abilities to push their boundaries. Its collection is made from ECONYL, reflecting the team’s love of our rivers, lakes and seas. The British designers take inspiration from the seaming in women’s sports underwear to enhance the streamlined shape, with a colour palette inspired by the tones and textures of water. Sizes go up to 18 and the packaging is fully recyclable.

IndyBest pick: Sports bikini top: £39; bikini pant: £29, Selkie Swim Co

If you’re looking for swimwear that’ll support your active lifestyle but want something more stylish than the usual mundane sports costumes, you’ll love this bikini top with secret front support and its matching low-rise bottoms with their comfy wide waistband.

Fashionista Georgia May Jagger is among the celebrity fans of snowboarding, skateboarding and surfing brand Volcom, which has sustainability at its core. This company takes its impact on the environment and the communities in which it operates seriously. Its swimwear is made from recycled plastic and fishing nets and is digitally printed, which uses less water than conventional screen printing. The designs are fierce and feminine; some have a grungy edge, others are more classic. Pop your measurements into the online size tool to find your best fit.

IndyBest pick: Tropakill one-piece: £75, Volcom

This modern take on the traditional swimming costume turned our heads with its strap detailing at the front and sides. It’s another one-piece that could take you from beach to bar, though the coverage is pretty minimal over the chest, so size up if you have a bigger bust. The striking floral print also comes in two bikini styles.

Tide + Seek’s summery swimwear is made entirely from recycled plastic waste, with each swimsuit keeping five plastic bottles out of landfill. Earthy tones have been banished in favour of pretty, playful prints in purples, pinks and blues for their new 30-piece range, handmade in Bali. It’s stereotypically girly, with ""undercover mermaid"" and ""sea sparkle"" among the designs, but oh so Instagram-friendly. There are plenty of different styles to choose from, including high leg cozzies and triangle bikinis, but this Cornish brand isn’t size inclusive; its bottoms only go up to a size 12.

IndyBest pick: Undercover mermaid surf bralette: £35; classic cut bikini bottoms: £32, Tide + Seek

Sportier beach babes will appreciate the adjustable, criss-crossed back straps of Tide + Seek’s bralettes, which help you find the best fit and support up top. For decent coverage over your bum, opt for the classic bottom cut; the cheeky cut is more daring. The price for the set is more affordable at under £70.

Paper London’s sustainable swimwear range pays tribute to Mother Nature and the ""pure, majestic beauty of our oceans"". Each piece is made, at least partly, from recycled fishing nets and production waste, but this award-winning British brand knows its clothing has to look good too. These bold and bright designs could never be described as boring – think ombre, ruffles and rainbows. It’s unsurprising that this brand has a place in Taylor Swift’s wardrobe. Once again though, the limited 4 to 14 sizing is disappointing, and you’ll need a big budget.

IndyBest pick: Copacabana swimsuit in coral coast: £165, Paper London

This one’s a work of art. The delightfully named copacabana cozzie plays into the colour-blocking trend with ivory, coral and turquoise. Double lined, it wraps around the low back and ties in a glamourous bow at the side, while offering plenty of bum coverage.

Ocean lovers Natalie and Zanna launched their eco-friendly swimwear brand in 2018 after realising the scale of the plastic pollution problem and determining to make a difference. Every element of every London-made piece is sustainable –like the fabric, the embroidery thread used which was originally a plastic bottle; the biodegradable hygiene liners and the packing which is both recycled and recyclable. The ""sports luxe"" style swimsuits and bikinis are designed for different body shapes, with sizes 6 to 18 available.

IndyBest pick: Nomad bikini top and bottoms: £70 each, Stay Wild Swim

Stay Wild Swim’s new colour palette was chosen with the help of their social media followers. This activewear-inspired coral bikini offers reliable support thanks to thick straps and an elastic under band, making it a smart choice for bigger-busted women, while the retro high waist is on trend.

Nylon isn’t only non-biodegradable, but the process of creating it is also highly polluting, which is why hardy British outdoors brand Finisterre has committed to using ECONYL for its swimwear and jackets. Single-use plastic has been banned from its packaging and you can peek inside the factories it uses on its website. There’s currently a buy two save £10 deal running on its separates but there aren’t many designs to choose from.

IndyBest pick: Ostrea bikini top: £50; ostrea bikini bottoms: £45, Finisterre

Navy, mustard and coral blend beautifully in this colourblock bikini for surfing, swimming and sunbathing. The top has a triangle shape, removable padding and adjustable straps that can also be worn cross-back if preferred. The bottoms are low-rise with no ties to interfere with a wetsuit. The swimsuit is £95.

Designed for women by women, Deakin + Blue long-lasting ECONYL swimwear is made in a small London factory and packaging is fully reusable and recyclable. Its body positive sizing model fits and flatter a range of shapes. Simply pick your usual dress size from 8 to 20 then choose from one of three styles based on bra size. The brand is willing to bring out more sizes in response to demand. We also like that these swimsuits come with CoppaFeel! labels reminding customers to check for signs of breast cancer.

IndyBest pick: Swimbra bikini top: £65; regular bikini bottoms: £35, Deakin + Blue

The bestselling Swimbra set is a great choice if you want swimwear you can be active in, without worrying about flashing the beach. The top has built-in bust support and is low-cut under the arms to minimise chafing.

The verdict: Sustainable swimwear brands

Davy J is a popular choice among sustainable shoppers for a reason; its swimwear is durable, beautifully-made and their little black swimsuit will become your holiday staple. Batoko’s bright swimsuits with their affordable price tag get our thumbs up too and we loved Finisterre’s sporty strea bikini that perfectly balances practical and pretty.

"Trending Cornering the market of African textiles

Wacy Zacarias started Karingana Wa Karingana textiles to create authentic African prints, writes Design Indaba’s Jamie Matroos.

Clothes, patterns and evocative prints had always held meaning for Mozambican entrepreneur Wacy Zacarias. From the capulanas that were passed down to her from her grandmother to her memories of older women draped in customary garb, textiles were a way to assert individuality while paying homage to age-old tradition.

But one realisation would change the way Zacarias interacted with African textiles and set her on a path to change the game in her home country and on the continent.

“I ended up figuring out that African textiles were not, in fact, really African. They were textiles that were brought to Africa via trade,” she says. “Some of them were an imitation of textiles that existed in west Africa. So they were like the mass-production answer to handmade textiles in west Africa. There are some batik elements in some of them, but mostly they were produced in China or Holland.”

The history behind her discovery can be traced back to 1846 when Dutch textiles giant Vlisco first set up shop. The company had mechanised the wax-printing method used to make batiks worn in Indonesia. They introduced these lower-cost, mass-produced products to the west African market, replacing the more costly handmade textiles of the time.

While the market was later joined by Chinese and Indian companies, Vlisco remains one of the most popular makers and distributors of what we now know as African textiles. Today, 95% of Vlisco’s products are sold to African consumers. This is even though, as Nigerian scholar Tunde Akinwumi points out, the motif is based on non-African design.

“It’s kind of like a borrowed culture; it’s no longer ours,” says Zacarias. “If you look more in-depth about the design process of these textiles, there’s nothing really about African heritage in them. It’s just somebody in a company somewhere in Europe or in China or in India who is dictating what is African now.

“So this is really the moment that I decided I wanted to be a part of doing something about this. I wanted to be part of that solution.”

Zacarias started her first company in 2008, before learning about the history of African textiles. Woogui is an ethical accessories and tailored shirt brand established to “reinvent the African fashion industry in Mozambique”.

Later, along with Mozambican fashion designer Djamila de Sousa, Zacarias established Karingana Wa Karingana, a Mozambique-based company that prints authentic African textiles, based on tradition and culture.

In a print designed to raise awareness about Movember, a month dedicated to prostate cancer awareness, Zacarias tackled an issue that’s not as widely discussed in Africa.

“It’s us saying to them [African consumers] that sometimes things that come from outside are interesting and are important. It’s us raising awareness about men’s health and saying to our African brothers, go get yourself checked out. So this was a very interesting print to design,” she adds.

In another print series, Zacarias pays tribute to the Mozambican capital of Maputo. “That print connects with all of us because it’s about the city we grew up in,” she explains. “It has the icons that we believe in and see every day. Like there’s a church that is very iconic. There is the public transport. There’s the dhal boat that you see here. There’s a cassia flower. So those are all things that we recognise as part of our heritage.”

Through storytelling, Zacarias hopes to bridge the gap between African textiles produced in Africa, where the production and importation of raw materials are more expensive, and the accessibility of cheaper mass-produced prints from across the seas.



But, not everyone has taken such a hardline stance to what constitutes an authentic African print. Dilys E Blum, the Philadelphia Museum of Art’s senior curator of costume and textiles, explained to Fast Company magazine that, no matter where the prints are sourced, they still give way to African individuality, expression and customised tailoring.

“On the body, they are something completely different because the dressmaker or tailor has to use that pattern in a creative way,” she was quoted as saying.

For Zacarias, the aim is not to replace this process but, rather, to offer an alternative.

“We’re fully aware that it would be very hard for us to compete with China and India price-wise, because mass production does mean more accessibility. But we are not trying to compete with them,” she explains.

“We are offering them an alternative. We are offering a niche market product and we are aware that we are going to have a higher price, but we are offering something that is made in Africa.”

Zacarias says she is motivated by the idea that Africa could be retaining more of the annual profit made by African textiles globally. She is part of a growing number of fashion designers, including Nigerian Amaka Osakwe of Maki-Oh and French-Ivorian Laurence Chauvin-Buthaud of LaurenceAirline, who view sourcing within Africa as a matter of national pride.

“There are textiles that are worn when people are born; there are textiles that are worn when people die; there are textiles only wedded women can wear in certain regions of Africa. So there’s a language, almost; there’s a way of communicating through the textiles that exist in our culture. It’s still very present today,” she added."

"The Brazilian native will be the first openly transgender model to work with the iconic brand in its 42-year history and believes the move is ""a step toward more inclusivity"".

In an exclusive interview with Vogue, Valentina said: ""Being appointed the first transgender model for the brand is a hugely important moment not only for myself but my community and beyond. I hope [this can] be a huge step toward more inclusivity and representation for everybody.""

The 22-year-old model had always wanted to be a Victoria's Secret model but found fame when she landed on the front of French Vogue's March 2017 issue, also becoming the first transgender model to feature on the cover of the magazine, and she hopes other brands will follow in their footsteps.

Transgender Victoria’s Secret model Valentina Sampaio

Valentina said: ""My dream [now] is to live in a world where representation is celebrated. I believe brands are beginning to see the value of inclusiveness, but there is a lot more work to do in our industry, culture, and society. I truly hope to be able to work with more brands that understand the importance of this...

""I'm really happy and proud to be working with Victoria's Secret, especially during this time of change. I feel very proud of my achievements, but this is just the beginning. It is important that I use my voice and my visibility to try to change the status quo.""

So far, Valentina is imagining a world where it isn't consider newsworthy when a transgender model appears in a lingerie campaign.

She continued: ""Imagine a world where it is not news that a transgender model has been appointed by a fashion brand. Wouldn't that be amazing?! Because it would mean that it is normal and it is happening all the time. I want to see this across all communities. Ultimately I want to live in a world with more respect for every kind of human being.""

The model's casting became a groundbreaking moment after the brand was previously under fire when its former chief marketing officer, Ed Razek, spoke against the inclusion of transgender and plus-size talent in the brand's campaign imagery and fashion shows.

He said: ""Why not? Because the show is a fantasy. It's a 42-minute entertainment special. That's what it is.""

However, Razek later apologised for his comments in a statement published on the Victoria's Secret Twitter account, writing: ""My remark regarding the inclusion of transgender models in the Victoria's Secret Fashion show came across as insensitive. I apologise.""

""To be clear, we would absolutely cast a transgender model for the show.""

"Hong Kong Fashion Week for Fall/Winter Closes

Thursday, 17 January 2019, 20:00 HKT/SGT



Attracted 13,000 Buyers, Highest Attendance from Mainland China, Indonesia and United States

The 50th edition of Hong Kong Fashion Week for Fall/Winter welcomed some 13,000 buyers from 78 countries and regions during its four-day run, which ended today.

FASHIONALLY Collection #13, held on the first day of the show, presented Fall/Winter 2019 collections from Hong Kong designers Yeung Chin (picture), Jane Ng and Alee Lee.

The FASHIONALLY Presentation showcased the design concepts and Fall/Winter 2019 works of local fashion designers Carrie Kwok (picture), Arto Wong, and Jason Lee in a storytelling format.

HONG KONG, Jan 17, 2019 - (ACN Newswire) - Organised by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC), the 50th edition of HKTDC Hong Kong Fashion Week for Fall/Winter wrapped up at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre (HKCEC) today. The four-day fair (14-17 Jan) attracted nearly 13,000 buyers from 78 countries and regions.

HKTDC Deputy Executive Director Benjamin Chau said: ""The fashion industry is facing many challenges against the backdrop of the ongoing trade dispute between the United States and Mainland China and changes in product sourcing and retailing patterns. The HKTDC continues to help exhibitors expand their network and connect with buyers from emerging markets. Among markets outside Hong Kong, this edition of Fashion Week saw the highest buyer attendance from Mainland China, Indonesia and the US, showing that the sourcing sentiment in both mature and emerging markets has remained unaffected. Among emerging markets, buyer attendance from Russia recorded a satisfactory increase. The results also highlight the fact that, despite economic uncertainties, global buyers still value Hong Kong's position as an unrivalled sourcing hub for global fashion traders and retailers.""

Huge Potential in Emerging Markets, Buyers Eager to Know Latest Trends

To help them stay competitive, industry players were eager to join information-sharing events during Fashion Week. These included ""The Visionary Fashion Trends for Spring/Summer 2020"" presentation by leading international fashion forecaster Fashion Snoops, as well as seminars exploring issues such as sustainable development in the fashion industry, the cotton market outlook and the latest cotton textile technologies.

Industry players from emerging markets showed real enthusiasm for Fashion Week, including Urszula Tomaszewska-Kislo from Poland who was visiting the event for the first time. She operates 30 shops in Poland together with an online store selling clothing under her own brand. The Polish buyer said the show deepened her understanding of current fashion trends and believed it was a good platform for sourcing high-quality goods. "" I have found four potential suppliers of clothing and garments here. I placed an onsite order for US$10,000 worth of women's sweaters offered by a supplier from Mainland China,"" she said.

Agile Local Company Showcases Cloud-based Job Order System

Facing changes in product purchasing and retailing patterns, the fashion industry also needs to contend with challenges arising from rising costs and smaller orders. iGarment (Hong Kong) Ltd is addressing these issues through the development of an innovative cloud-based garment production coordination system. The company joined Fashion Week for Fall/Winter for the first time this year, showcasing its iGarment cloud-based Job Order System that covers everything from sample development to production progress and shipping.

Connie Wong, iGarment Marketing Manager, said: ""During the first two days of the fair, we met with more than 100 buyers, exhibitors and designers from Hong Kong, Mainland China and Southeast Asia who are very interested in our services. To understand their needs, we'll arrange them to visit factories who adopted our system."" Due to the overwhelming response from buyers, iGarment has already decided to return to the fair next year.

YDC 2019 Opens for Application

Since 1977, The HKTDC has been organising the Hong Kong Young Fashion Designers' Contest (YDC) to unearth talented local designers. This year's competition will be held during CENTRESTAGE in September, and is now open for application. (www.fashionally.com/ydc_application)

"Like comic books or underground music, a 1990s streetwear habit required devotion. DJ Ross One, a leading collector of rap T-shirts, said that traveling to New York had been like making a pilgrimage, in which the holy sites were Triple Five Soul, Canal Street Jeans and Phat Farm.

“The thought of reselling, it would have been devastating to me to lose even one of those shirts because it was so hard to get and I wanted it so badly,” he said. “Also, nobody would have bought it.”

The internet, Ross One said, is “the beginning and end of any conversation about things that used to be sacred that are now not. There’s no more underground culture. It’s really hard today for a kid to have something that’s all their own.”

A Survey of Hype

The report was a joint effort by Hypebeast and the waviest auditing firm around, PricewaterhouseCoopers. Dr. Axel Nitschke, an expert on fashion, sports and luxury at Strategy&, PwC’s in-house consulting agency, said that he was interested in the lessons streetwear had to teach.

“Streetwear managed to create desirability for the product, something that the bulk of the fashion industry has increasing challenges in doing,” said Mr. Nitschke, who co-authored the report with Enrique Menendez, Hypebeast’s senior features editor. “Those brands, sneaker brands, have tremendous credibility within the peer group, and that comes out of the community.”

Has that community of creators and customers, many of them people of color, been left behind by the larger industry’s interest? The report defines streetwear as “fashionable casual clothes” — the suggestion being that you know when you see it — and makes room for “luxury streetwear brands,” including Off-White, AMBUSH and Vetements."

American music star Beyonce and German sportswear giant Adidas are joining forces to relaunch the singer's popular Ivy Park line.

Today it was revealed that Beyonce will be a creative partner for the brand and launch of brand new signature footwear and clothing as well as new items from the rebooted label.

Speaking about the new venture Beyonce said: ""This is the partnership of a lifetime for me. Adidas has had tremendous success in pushing creative boundaries. We share a philosophy that puts creativity, growth and social responsibility at the forefront of business. I look forward to re-launching and expanding Ivy Park on a truly global scale with a proven, dynamic leader.""

Commenting on the collaboration Eric Liedtke, Executive Board Member for Global Brands at adidas said, ""As the creator sports brand, adidas challenges the status quo and pushes the limits of creativity through its open source approach.

""Beyoncé is an iconic creator but also a proven business leader, and together, we have the ability to inspire change and empower the next generation of creators"".

The new partnership follows Adidas' successful partnership with another global music star - Kanye West .

West's Yeezy line of clothing and sell-out trainers has gone from strength to strength since the rapper first inked a deal with the brand back in 2015.

Beyonce first debuted her Ivy Park apparel line in 2016 in partnership with now disgraced Topshop boss Philip Green .

The original line featured a mix of technical sportswear and fashion led apparel items aimed at women of all ages and body types with the mission statement of empowering women through sport.

In 2018 Beyonce announced she was officially ending the partnership with Green following misconduct allegations .

The Telegraph previously reported that five of Green's employees signed NDAs to keep their complaints quiet, with one being paid more than £1 million.

Green denied his behaviour was criminal or amounted to gross misconduct."

When it comes to the Big Four fashion weeks, Milan is notable for keeping things close to home. Many of the biggest brands on the schedule have purpose-built show spaces in which to present their collections, and many of the major fashion houses still have descendants at the helm (Angela Missoni, Silvia Venturini Fendi, Miuccia Prada, Veronica Etro to name a few), proving that the Milanese fashion scene is a family affair.

In recent years, though, that family has been growing. This past Autumn-Winter 2019 season was the largest to date, with 179 new collections on the schedule. It's becoming more international, too, thanks to the Fashion Hub facilitated by the National Chamber of Italian Fashion (Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana), which presented the collections of 27 emerging brands from all over the world.

With the passing of Karl Lagerfeld last week -- a designer who has been at the core of the fashion world for over half a century --Milan Fashion Week had a more poignant start. Here we reflect on some of the key moments.

Farewell to a fashion legend

The death of legendary designer Karl Lagerfeld loomed over the first day of Milan Fashion Week. Although he was perhaps most widely known for his work for Chanel, which he had helmed since 1983, his longest-standing commitment was to Fendi, where he served as artistic director for 54 years. Under Lagerfeld's direction Fendi grew from a traditional family-run furrier into the billion-euro business it is today.

His record-breaking tenure was punctuated with his final collection for the Italian house, shown last Thursday.

""The bond between Karl Lagerfeld and Fendi is fashion's longest love story,"" Silvia Venturini Fendi, the brand's creative director, wrote in the show notes. ""When we called just a few days before the show, his only thoughts were on the richness and beauty of the collection.""

Many of Lagerfeld's favorite models, including Gigi Hadid and Kaia Gerber, walked the runway, their hair arranged into low ponytails reminiscent of the late designer's. The show culminated in a film of Lagerfeld creating one of his trademark sketches.

Fashioning a greener future

Given the United Nations' assertions that the fashion industry produces 20% of global waste water and 10% of the world's carbon emissions, the need to find more sustainable methods of garment production has never been more urgent.

To this end, seven rising design talents from around the world were invited to create new garments from existing materials as part of the Next Green Talents showcase. Bethany Williams -- fresh from London Fashion Week, where she was presented with the second Queen Elizabeth II Award for British Design -- patchworked denim into a jacket, which she printed and hand-embroidered.

Design duo Gabriela Luna and Corina del Pinal of Luna Del Pinal drew inspiration from a trip to Guatemala, fashioning several sweaters into an asymmetric top that resembled a poncho; while Ukrainian duo Ksenia and Anton Schnaider of Ksenia Schnaider made a women's jumpsuit from recycled men's tailoring.

The greatest show on Earth

Moncler

The spectre of Brexit and a recession in Italy suggest an uncertain future for Europe. So, it's no wonder designers delivered escapism this season.

For its third Genius collection , Moncler enlisted eight designers to reimagine its classic down jacket to dramatic effect. Notably, Valentino creative director Pierpaolo Piccioli, working in collaboration with model and designer Liya Kebede and her label, Lemlem, presented dramatic evening dresses in padded fabric complete with patterns inspired by Ethiopian textiles, while newcomer Richard Quinn projected his interpretation of 1960s florals onto the luxury sportswear brand.

Contemplating the visible and invisible, Gucci's Alessandro Michele sent masked models down a mirrored runway in front of a dazzling strobe light display which momentarily blinded the audience. Elsewhere, Miuccia Prada spun a tale of Gothic romance referencing Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein"" with Wednesday Addams-style models, and Jeremy Scott parodied ""The Price Is Right"" for Moschino, showing that fantasy comes in all shapes.

Inching toward inclusion

With black models like Adut Akech , Anok Yai, Binx Walton and Selena Forrest walking many of the week's biggest shows, Milan seems to be moving in the right direction when it comes to racial diversity. (Last season it lagged behind its fashion capital counterparts with people of color making up less than 30% of models.)

Age was also on the agenda for brands like Etro, who called iconic models Farida Khelfa and Violetta Sanchez, an '80s muse to Thierry Mugler and Yves Saint Laurent, out of retirement. The standout appearance this season, though, came when '90s supermodel Stephanie Seymour closed the Versace show.

Body diversity though remained almost entirely absent from the Milan Fashion Week runway and there was no representation of models with disabilities.

A hotly anticipated debut

It's just been over a year since Phoebe Philo left Céline, ending an an era of design widely regarded as being the most egalitarian and sensitive to women's bodies. But now, it finally looks as though there may be someone to fill the void she left behind.

In his debut collection for Bottega Veneta, 32-year-old British designer Daniel Lee -- who was educated at London's Central Saint Martins and previously worked under Philo at Céline -- assertively but sensitively thrust the luxury leather company in a new direction while staying true to its heritage. Architectural tailoring and layered knitwear were Lee's hallmarks, while the versatile dresses and diverse range of footwear (from chunky biker boots to delicate kitten heels) will help to restore the 6% drop in sales the label experienced last year."
"A couple of weeks ago I wrote an impassioned ode to the canvas tote. I praised its effortlessness, simplicity and practicality. Day to day, the tote has taken the place of my purses, and I’ve amassed a multitude of these cotton bags. Truly, they are the new promo T-shirts — handed out at events and by brands, whether as an add-on to a purchase or as a stand-alone bit of swag. To the environmentally conscious, tote bags have become an indispensable tool in the fight against plastics. Whenever I forget to bring mine to the grocery store, the shame of having to grab single-use bags follows me all the way home.

Plastic is bad, hands down, right? As someone who writes about sustainable fashion brands on the regular, I know my topline stats. Eight million metric tons of plastic enter the oceans each year. On land, plastic takes 500 years to break down, releasing those evil, no-good microplastics in the process that end up lining the stomachs of marine life.

So there I was, feeling virtuous with my Céline-Dion-themed tote bag. And then I came across a 2018 study released by Denmark’s Ministry of Environment and Food that claimed that plastic bags are actually better for the environment than cotton ones. Excuse me?

In the report, which looked at the life cycle of plastic, paper and cotton grocery bags, the latter ranked the lowest. That’s because they need to be used thousands of times to offset the amount of water and energy needed to produce them. Cotton is a resource-heavy crop, requiring lots of land, water and fertilizer to grow. That said, the report did not address plastic’s impact on oceans, focusing mainly on how long it would take to reach a kind of carbon break-even point. Still, do I need to start avoiding canvas totes like I now do Zara?

Maybe not, says Gordon Renouf, co-founder of Good On You, an app that analyzes the environmental impact of popular fashion brands and then rates them. “You can’t say that canvas totes are universally bad. You have to ask who made it, how did they make it and from what materials before you can judge whether or not something is ethical and sustainable.” Like any consumer product, not all totes are created equal. Though many are made cheaply, using mass-produced or unethically sourced cotton, there are also totes that are cut from organic linen (a far less thirsty crop than cotton) and made in fair-trade factories using low-impact, non-toxic dyes. Another option is recycled nylon, used by popular reusable bag brand Baggu. Non-virgin nylon can be made using recycled bottles and even old fishing nets, a far better alternative than brand-new synthetics, which require fossil fuel — a finite resource.

“While cotton totes are resource-intensive to make, they are not single-use like plastic, so I don’t think the comparison is fair,” says Ayesha Barenblat, founder of ethical fashion non-profit Re/Make. Even though totes are designed with reuse in mind, there’s the issue of quantity. I’d venture to guess that most of us own far more canvas totes than we actually need or use. I have a whole hallway drawer stuffed to the brim with reusable bags. “It’s not just about buying sustainably, but about buying less,” says Barenblat. That means refusing to be tempted by yet another canvas tote. Yes, even the one bearing the cover of Sweetbitter on one side, and “F*ck Brunch” on the other, like I did when faced with of a rack of certified cool-girl totes last weekend.

As for the ones you do have? Take them everywhere and use them lots to offset their impact. And treat those pesky plastic bags in a similar way — within reason, of course. No one is proposing we start to carry our lipstick and keys around in a neon yellow No Frills shopper. Line your trash bins with them, wrap up your lunch in them, and, if you’re my wonderfully thrifty mom, wrap your hair in them to keep your DIY dye job from getting on the couch. According to the Center for Biological Diversity, the average use time of a plastic bag is a mere 12 minutes. Anything we can do to extend that is a (small) win.

When it comes to being a more responsible shopper, it can often feel as though there’s no perfect solution. And short of moving to a self-sustaining solar-powered commune straight out of The Beach, maybe there isn’t. My days of using and amassing canvas totes certainly aren’t over. Maybe it’s time someone started a tote trading service that lets us swap, say, a Reformation tote for one by L.L. Bean when we get bored. That way, our cotton bags can accompany us until they’re ready to naturally biodegrade, unlike their plastic counterparts."
"The shift towards more sustainable fashion will be a boon for luxury brands, according to Anya Hindmarch, founder and managing director of her eponymous British handbag label.

“It’s much better to buy less, buy beautiful things, and wear them more,” said Hindmarch, speaking at Fortune’s Most Powerful Women International Summit in London on Tuesday. “[Sustainability] totally fits with what we believe in.”

That push towards producing fewer and better products has come amid a shift in the fashion industry overall towards selling accessories that emphasize the craftsmanship and the personal “story” behind the product, Hindmarch said.

“There was a stage where luxury used to be very mass produced, honestly,” Hindmarch said, adding that the latest bag the company has produced took two years from design to completion. “The idea of that being fast fashion or mass produced is just so far from it.”

However, the shift to more sustainable fashion does come with a cost as supply chains are adjusted, she said: “There’s a real hit on your margin. There’s a period as we adjust to behaving in a more sensible, sustainable way.”

The push towards sustainability comes amid a period of transition for the company, with Hindmarch taking back the top job at the brand she founded after stepping down eight years ago to become creative director at the company. The brand’s ownership also changed this March, after Iran’s Maharandi family bought the majority stake from the Qatari’s royal family’s fund.

As managing director, Hindmarch has said her first step was to “turn around the business.”

The branding shift has not just happened at Anya Hindmarch. That push towards building a “story” around branding luxury items is emerging again across the high-end fashion business, said Kristina Blahnik, CEO of luxury shoe brand Manolo Blahnik, who appeared on the panel with Hindmarch.

“I think nowadays they don’t just want an object, they want something to talks to them,” said Blahnik. “For me I think the word ‘luxury’ is so over used it doesn’t mean anything anymore, same with ‘brand.'”

"Brands have been criticised for using slender and seemingly flawless models in adverts purporting to celebrate diverse and body positive beauty.

Boohoo and ASOS are just three of the retailers that have come under fire in recent months over campaign images that were either unedited, or claimed to feature women with diverse body types.

Speaking to FEMAIL, Liam Preston, Head of YMCA's Be Real Campaign, pointed out adverts that claim to depict 'real' or 'normal' women, but actually feature women with a standard model physique, can in fact by more damaging than regular adverts.

Meanwhile former Miss America Kirsten Haglund, whose foundation Eating Disorder Hope campaigns to raise awareness of eating disorders, accused retailers of trying to cash in and 'make a buck' off the rise of the body positive movement.

Brands have been criticised for using flawless models in adverts purporting to celebrate diverse and body positive beauty. This week the issue made headlines once again after In The Style released its latest unretouched lingerie campaign featuring a toned and slender model

Criticism was leveled last week against US brand Aerie after it featured stars including Jameela Jamil, pictured, Busy Philipps, Samira Wiley, Aly Raisman, and Iskra Lawrence in a campaign titled '#AerieREAL'. Shoppers questioned whether the women reflected 'real' women

This week the issue made headlines once again after In The Style released its latest unretouched lingerie campaign featuring a toned and slender model'.

The woman had just the tiniest of imperfections, including a slight scratch on her leg; uneven skin tone, a tiny patch of cellulite and marks from the seams of the clothing she was wearing before the shoot.

Kirsten, 30, who lives in Zurich, explained such a campaign is evidence of how 'out of touch' a brand is from reality.

'It's really fascinating to see what brands call ""real"" because people who work in the fashion industry and in photography are so used to working where they see things are so airbrushed and so photoshopped, they see a picture of a beautiful woman and say ""of course this is real"",' she said.

'They are so out of touch with what the average woman looks like, they just have no clue how it comes across. The models they use represent one per cent of naturally occurring body type in the world.'

ASOS has a selection of photos using the same model to advertise their Ann Summers Curve Adorn lace and satin knicker - and was accused of 'padding' the model to appear larger

Boohoo came under fire over its choice of model used to advertise a plus-size clothing range online, with many claiming she was too slender, pictured

Liam agreed that by casting 'perfect' models, brands are actually 'going against the entire thing they're trying to suggest'.

He continued: 'It is essential that the fashion industry champions diversity and reflects what women actually look like.

'These images and the models chosen will naturally leave impression on the young women they are targeted towards.

'Our research found that just under half of young people said that the pressure to look a certain way came from models. When brands give the illusion that they care about such an important issue but in reality do not, they can actually do more damage than good.'

The In The Style campaign for the Valentine's Day collection has been designed to encourage women to feel great for themselves, rather than anyone else. Marks on the model's leg from the clothes she was wearing earlier can be seen just above her knees and bikini line

Many agreed with one person who took to social media and said: 'There's no imperfections anyway' and questioned why this model needed to be airbrushed anyway

Criticism was leveled last week against US brand Aerie after it featured stars including Jameela Jamil, Busy Philipps, Samira Wiley, Aly Raisman, and Iskra Lawrence in a campaign titled '#AerieREAL'.

Customers took to Twitter to question the decision, claiming none of the women could be considered truly plus-size.

Meanwhile Boohoo came under fire over its choice of model used to advertise a plus-size clothing range online, with many claiming she was too slender.

ASOS has faced similar criticism, with some questioning whether the online retailer had used padding to make models curvier for plus-size clothes.

Plus size blogger Georgina Grogan took to Twitter to accuse online retailer ASOS of using padding to advertise their curve range

Kirsten said this sort of behaviour is typical of retailers trying to cash in on customers who want to see greater diversity and representation in fashion.

She added: 'It's all about money now that the fashion industry can see that the tide is turning we can make a buck out of authenticity, they're just trying to make a buck. They are saying things are real, but it's all about branding- it's not real.

'We can try to put pressure on theses brands to change, but as consumers we need to realise they are trying to make money out of us, and adjust our spending habits, we shouldn't reward it.'

Boohoo has been publicly criticised over the size of model used for its plus-size range

Commenting on the Aerie campaign specifically, Kirsten said: 'Aerie do really well, they parterned with NEDA (National Eating Disorder Association) in the US. They have done a really good job of trying to be conscious. But ultimately, all these brands care about is there share holders'.

Responding to the criticism, Jamil said: 'Hey everyone. I want to take a second to address yesterday and how much I was criticized for being part of a campaign that didn't have big enough sizes,' she wrote.

'I'm really sorry if that hurt you, and it does need to change across the entire industry, and I'm glad you spoke out. But I just want to explain my decision, as someone who fights ethnic, lgbtq, and disabled erasure, eating disorder culture as well as fat phobia.

'As a South Asian girl who grew up never seeing us in campaigns or media or fashion or tv unless we were being ridiculed or made to behave in a derogatory cartoonish way to make white people laugh, or often white people literally just wore brown make up and pretended to be us and then played stereotypes of us, it meant the world to be asked to be in a big mainstream American campaign.

Responding to criticism, Adam Frisby, Founder and CEO of In The Style told Femail: 'I am completely aware of the impact that ""perfect"" looking models can have on young woman and I want to be very clear the valentines campaign for the brand was not an intended ""unedited"" campaign at all.

'It was just a starting point to show we don't need to retouch anyone and this wasn't about the model being any particular size, it was just a positive step in the right direction to move towards not retouching at all - we have some major plans this month to further focus on body positivity and this will really highlight as a brand that we are inclusive.'

Femail has contacted Asos, Boohoo and Aerie for comment."
"Sales of synthetic chemicals will double over the next 12 years with alarming implications for health and the environment, according to a global study that highlights government failures to rein in the industry behind plastics, pesticides and cosmetics.

The second Global Chemicals Outlook, which was released in Nairobi on Monday, said the world will not meet international commitments to reduce chemical hazards and halt pollution by 2020. In fact, the study by the United Nations Environment Programme found that the industry has never been more dominant nor has humanity’s dependence on chemicals ever been as great.

“When you consider existing pollution, plus the projected growth of the industry, the trends are a cause for significant concern,” said Achim Halpaap, who led the 400 scientists involved in the study.

He said the fastest growth was in construction materials, electronics, textiles and lead batteries. More and more additives are also being used to make plastics smoother or more durable.

Depending on the chemical and degree of exposure, the risks can include cancer, chronic kidney disease and congenital anomalies. The World Health Organization estimated that the burden of disease was 1.6 million lives in 2016. Halpaap said this was likely to be an underestimate. In addition to the human health dangers, he said chemicals also affect pollinators and coral reefs.

Global chemical production has almost doubled since 2000 and is now – if the pharmaceutical business is taken into account – the world’s second largest industry, the report noted.

This is expected to continue for at least the next decade owing to massive increases in the expanding economies of Asia, Africa and the Middle East. By 2030, the industry is projected to almost double again from 2017 levels to hit $6.6tn (£5tn) in sales; China is forecast to account for 49.9% of the world market.

Despite the negative effects, humanity is increasingly dependent on synthetic chemicals. According to the UN, output will grow seven times faster than the global population between 1990 and 2030.

At the Johannesburg Earth Summit in 2002, governments agreed to significantly reduce chemical pollution by 2020, but the report showed the world is far off course from that and the other sustainable development goal of reducing the number of deaths and illnesses from chemical pollution by 2030. “The 2020 goal will not be achieved,” the report stated bluntly.

There have been advances in some areas. National authorities have raised concern about a number of products, including formaldehyde in shampoo, microbeads in toothpaste, phthalates in food packaging, and flame retardants in many household goods. Numerous conventions have been signed and regulations put in place to minimise risks but the industry continues its relentless expansion.

In part, this is a sign of the increasing sophistication of consumer products. Some electronic consumer items, such as laptops and mobile phones, can include hundreds of different chemical products. But they are also present in countless other everyday items. The report gives the example of an office chair, which contains flame retardants on the foam cushion, rubber additives in the rollers, chromium surface coating, plastic additives on the back and varnish on any wooden parts. But environmentalists say the long-term risks to the majority outweigh the short-term gains for a minority.

Of the 345 million tonnes of chemicals consumed in the European Union, 62% posed a health hazard, according to a study by the EU statistical organisation last year.

“Large quantities of hazardous chemicals and pollutants continue to leak into the environment, contaminating food chains and accumulating in our bodies, where they do serious damage,” wrote Joyce Msuya, the acting head of the UN Environment Programme. “Considering the expansion of the market, and the associated increase in contamination, we cannot continue to gamble with our health.”

The study – the first for five years – offers only broadbrush solutions, echoing the mantra of reduce, reuse and recycle that has been largely ignored for decades. It also calls for greater use of sustainable materials and better education of scientists about the dangers. More specific measures will be debated at a conference in Uruguay next month."
"Shows taking place this month will not feature garments made from animal skins. (Picture: Instagram)

The British Fashion Council (BFC) have announced the shows taking place this month will not feature garments made from animal skins after carrying out a survey asking designers if they were planning to use fur in their presentations. BFC chief executive Caroline Rush said the move ""highlights a trend we have seen over the past few years, with more and more brands deciding to use alternative materials to fur.""

She added: ""The fur dialogue is ongoing and the stance of brands such as Burberry, Stella McCartney, Gucci, Yoox Net-A-Porter, Versace and Vivienne Westwood, among others, to look at alternative options to fur will encourage more brands to consider what options are available to them.""

The official announcement came after Burberry announced creative director Riccardo Tisci's debut show at LFW would be fur-free.

Chief executive Marco Gobbetti said: ""I don't think it is compatible with modern luxury and with the environment in which we live, and Riccardo has a very strong view as well on this.

""It's part of what Burberry is today.""

The Humane Society International UK have hailed the move and hopes it persuades other major fashion houses to follow suit.

Wendy Higgins, director of international media at the organisation, said: ""Most British consumers don't want anything to do with the cruelty of fur and so this is absolutely the right decision by this quintessentially British brand.

""And as fashion week kicks off in New York, Burberry's compassionate stance couldn't have come at a better time, sending a strong message to designers like Prada still using fur, who are looking more and more isolated and outdated by the day.""

Earlier this week, singer Paloma Faith penned an open letter for animal rights group PETA to urge the BFC to introduce a fur-free policy.

Referring to the 2003 ban on fur farming in the UK, she wrote: ""The BFC shouldn't be endorsing a material whose production is deemed so cruel that it is outlawed in the UK.

""With the vast number of cutting-edge, eco-friendly faux furs available on the market today, I'm sure you'll agree that there's no longer any excuse for killing animals for their fur."""
"It’s just like Rihanna to use fashion to telegraph her news. Women’s Wear Daily ran a front-page scoop last week detailing rumours that Rihanna is knee-deep in negotiations with LVMH to produce a designer-level fashion label under her name. Along with what the fashion industry paper-of-record cited as “multiple sources,” she was snapped in a tease: A pair of oversized, visor-style sunglasses with the name Fenty stamped prominently in gold on the side.

Fans went straight to speculation and jubilation. There has yet to be public confirmation from LVMH, the Paris-based multinational conglomerate that controls a slew of top heritage fashion brands from Louis Vuitton and Dior to Givenchy, Fendi, and Celine. These exist alongside a stable of aspirational luxury brands in the categories of fine wines and liquors (including Moët Hennessy), beauty and perfume, as well as international duty-free outlets, and the beauty behemoth Sephora.

A deal like this could be game-changing for Rihanna and her current fashion initiatives. Many celebrities have clothing lines, but few have the leg-up Rihanna does.

She already has her foot in the LVMH door: Fenty Beauty was launched with a massive bang in September 2017 by Kendo, which is LVMH’s beauty brand incubator. The strategy was to be the first-ever global beauty launch — dropping online and in thousands of stores in 17 countries simultaneously. The foundation line — 40 shades strong — shook the industry’s scanty offerings for women of colour, proving that respecting diversity means dollars. Suddenly, everyone in beauty was playing catch-up to Rihanna. The line moved roughly $100 million in product in the first 40 days.

The Savage x Fenty lingerie collections of the past few seasons have also been applauded for their wildly inclusive runway castings — and commensurate wide-range of size availabilities. (The current online Valentine’s Day collection, dubbed SavageAF, is modelled by Rihanna herself.)

Last year, Time estimated Rihanna’s personal net worth at $245 million (U.S.). In addition to her music sales and megaconcert tours, her shares in the music streaming service Tidal, and her acting gigs (Oceans 8), she has attached her name to no less than six perfumes. There have been a number of previous fashion endeavours, most notably Fenty Puma x Rihanna, wherein her Creeper sneakers sold out in a hot second. Then there were those much-imitated fuzzy slide shoes; Rihanna is single-handedly credited with giving the German athletic brand’s bottom line a hefty boost, as well as increasing the brand’s appeal with women.

After an early collab with British high street brand River Island in 2013, Rihanna has earned big bucks for endorsements from brands ranging from Chopard to Dior and Manolo Blahnik.

But the multi-faceted star was also in the news last week for a more painful story, though one that shows she is willing to stand up for herself, no matter how uncomfortable the situation. In a sad turn of events, she had to sue her father, Ronald Fenty, as well as his business partners in Fenty Entertainment. The suit, filed in Los Angeles court, seeks an injunction to protect the name Fenty, for which Rihanna holds a trademark. She is also petitioning them to stop misrepresenting her participation in Fenty Entertainment activities. The most upsetting of these allegations includes her father making a fraudulent deal with a third party for a Latin American concert tour. Basically, she alleges he has been pretending to be her agent.

Rihanna comes by her ferocity honestly, having been out on her own since she was discovered at the tender age of 15 in her native Barbados. She gained some early fashion retail experience growing up on the Caribbean island, selling clothes at a market stall with her dad. She was also an army cadet, before she cut a demo that was routed straight onto Jay-Z’s desk.

She signed with Def Jam and thus was transported out of a childhood that doesn’t seem as sunny as its location. Her father has long struggled with substance use issues, though she reportedly distanced herself from him until she discovered he had sold info and family pics to tabloids around the time of her assault by Chris Brown in 2009.

Suffice to say, Rihanna isn’t going to let anyone stand in her way. And I think I speak for the internet when I say we want this LVMH fashion fairy tale to be true. It will succeed where other celeb brands fail because she has the fashion chops — and an attitude that makes us fall to our knees.

Who else could have pulled off that yellow Guo Pei gown and its 16-foot fur-lined train at the 2015 Met Gala when Rihanna stole the show — and reinvented the concept of memes? Even Vogue voted it the best Met look ever, which is like winning the Fashion Olympics, All-Star edition.

Who else could have pulled off the fully sheer Adam Selman gown and matching cap, bedazzled with a galaxy of Swarovski crystals that she wore in 2014 when Anna Wintour presented her with the Style Icon Award? Please note that Rihanna was 26 at the time. And also note that she had the best quip a few years later, when she said her only regret in life is wearing a thong that wasn’t bedazzled under that dress. We all have regrets, but Rihanna’s is better than ours.

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

She also owns street style. There’s never any demurring ballcap-lowered looks for the paparazzi. She never phones it in. She’s skin-tight one minute, baggy the next. You can’t characterize her look or underestimate how daring she’s willing to be. Flip through any year of her street-style shots and you can’t put your finger on what ties it together — except, maybe, that she is so cool everything works on her.

We can learn from her beauty launch, though, that Rihanna wants substance with her style. Her inclusive line shows an innate understanding of who she is, and what she represents to consumers. She delivered something that, in retrospect, was so obvious — yet few luxe offerings had seen the profits waiting in those gaping holes of nuanced skin-tone coverage. If she can do the same with fashion — her sellout shoe collabs and lingerie efforts are strong bellwethers — then LVMH would be foolish not to sign up the most fashionable and forward-thinking woman in the world.

This is outside the core business of LVMH, which was built on reviving major European heritage brands. But it’s a great way to add something next, something with larger pop-culture relevance and cutting-edge youth cred when the luxury market is in flux.

After all, Rihanna is a celebrity who is defiant, funny and deliciously relatable. She demands two different kinds of Cheetos (hot and regular) on her appearance rider contract. She is photographed crazy-often with a glass of red wine, possibly the greatest accessory of all time.

Fact is, she knows she is going to have her photo taken every damn time she leaves the house, or hotel, or club or restaurant or airport. So she has fun with it, camps it up, and goes big before she goes home.

The only logical thing for her to do now is a complete line of fashion, clothing and accessories, heavy on the daring and the legendary, so we can all own just a little bit of that insouciance."
"It's the lifestyle site that has divided readers over jade vagina eggs and ""conscious uncoupling"" but Gwyneth Paltrow's infamous Goop just got a whole lot more inclusive with its latest launch.

Teaming up with Universal Standard, a ""size-inclusive"" clothing company that counts Paltrow as one of its backers, the site has launched a capsule collection spanning from a US size 00 to 40 (UK size 2-44).

Whilst Goop has sold a wide-range of clothing brands including Tibi, Ellery and Joseph since 2012 alongside its own apparel label that it launched in 2016, this capsule collection marks the first time that a size above a US 12, the equivalent of a UK 16, has been made available on the site.

Described as a ""clean-lined, sophisticated capsule,"" it features five pieces including a dress, jumpsuit, peacoat, and tuxedo jacket with matching cropped trousers, a look that Gwyneth has been pictured wearing several times on the red carpet.

The plus-size market, valued at £6.5 billion in the UK, is an area that more and more fashion brands are slowly beginning to explore. Earlier this year Marks and Spencer launched a Curve range offering 100 pieces ranging in size from a UK 18 to 32, whilst last year Ashley Graham became the first plus-sized woman to feature on Forbes' highest-paid models list."
"NEW YORK/MADRID (Reuters) - The holy grail for apparel brands facing rising uncertainty and cost in their global supply chains is to make their merchandise closer to the point of the sale.

Entertainment companies from Walt Disney Co to Dr. Seuss are increasingly turning to Amazon.com Inc’s t-shirt printing service to help it get there. The trend is up-ending the traditional licensing model where brands worked with apparel wholesalers to produce garments and get them into stores.

The ‘Merch by Amazon’ on-demand printing service, in its third full year of operation, works by printing t-shirts once an order comes in, meaning content creators like video game makers and pay TV channels do not have to commit to a large merchandise inventory upfront.

This allows companies to offer t-shirts featuring niche characters that would not warrant a wide distribution.

“You can list overnight on Amazon all the merchandise that’s for sale and then as you book sales you just make it and ship it,” said intellectual property lawyer Gaston Kroub. “It completely cuts out that whole traditional supply chain.”

The expanding service is another way in which Amazon is becoming a major player in the clothing industry. The company had a group of patents granted in recent years outlining a process to integrate fabric printing, cutting, sewing and dispatch to a customer in one computer-controlled process.

Bringing apparel manufacture back to the United States and Europe would eliminate the long production times and commitment to big orders inherent for Western apparel brands sourcing from countries like China, Vietnam and Indonesia.

When fabric cutting is delayed to the last possible moment and garments are produced on-demand, it can also prevent the pile-up of unsold inventory, allowing brands to sell more stock at full price.

Amazon told Reuters the ‘Merch by Amazon’ format allowed it to offer designs across 21 colors and 15 sizes without brands and content creators having to manage inventory.

It said it was interested in all brand types from major entertainment brands to musicians, consumer products and social media influencers with a minimum of 100,000 followers.

Following an upheaval of consumer habits, which has led to the shuttering of thousands of small apparel stores, Amazon has overtaken Walmart Inc as the most-shopped clothing retailer in the United States and outpaced Marks and Spencer Group PLC in Britain, according to surveys.

Amazon has a try-before-you-buy service as well as many of its own private label clothing brands.

Royalty revenue from sales of licensed merchandise and services globally amounted to $14.5 billion last year, up 2.6% from 2017, according to professional licensing association LIMA, with more than half of that coming from the U.S. and Canada.

Entertainment and character licensing was the biggest industry category, while apparel, toys and fashion was the biggest product category, a LIMA survey found.

Dr. Seuss Enterprises has increased sales through ‘Merch by Amazon’ by 40 percent since opening its store on the site around 18 months ago, selling t-shirts and hoodies emblazoned with characters like The Grinch and The Cat the Hat, president Susan Brandt told Reuters.

Dr. Seuss helps Amazon with design, but Amazon sources the clothing and handles the sales and distribution, a Dr. Seuss Enterprises spokeswoman said. Dr. Seuss also sells licensed products through stores like Target Corp and Walmart, she said.

Disney, which started printing t-shirts on-demand through Amazon in December 2016, has increased orders and expanded offerings from all its franchises since then, including Disney, Star Wars, Pixar and Marvel, a company spokeswoman said.

Disney also uses traditional licensing models to manufacture and sell products, the spokeswoman said.

Pay TV channel Cartoon Network, which started working with ‘Merch by Amazon’ in 2016, has added designs and increased profits via the service since then, a company spokeswoman said.

The brand prints with other vendors, but the on-demand service allows it to give frequent design updates and offer secondary characters that may not be available in traditional stores, she said.

TIDAL WAVE

“The profit-sharing on-demand model existed before Amazon started their effort, but the size that they are, they have created a tidal wave,” said Gabi Seligsohn, former CEO and current board member of Kornit Digital Ltd, the Israeli company that provides textile printers for ‘Merch by Amazon’.

The business is growing. Environmental authorities in Philadelphia have approved an expansion at Amazon’s Pennsylvania printing facility, allowing nearly 50% more printers, the Philadelphia Department of Environment told Reuters.

Amazon also runs a second printing facility in Dallas, which was also recently granted preliminary permission to install more printers, a spokeswoman for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality said.

Beyond the United States, Amazon has launched a ‘Merch by Amazon’ printing facility in Poland in mid-2018 that serves the British and German markets.

Amazon said it had not made any announcements regarding expansion.

Showing further interest in on-demand apparel manufacture, Amazon has been actively seeking patents in the space. Intellectual property lawyers say this shows where companies think the technology is going.

“There is no doubt that patenting activity is indicative of some kind of market trend,” said John Lanza, Boston-based intellectual property lawyer at Foley & Lardner LLP. “On-demand apparel manufacture is very hot.”

In 2017, Amazon Technologies was granted a U.S. patent for on-demand apparel manufacturing whereby a textile printer, textile cutter and computing device are linked up to cut out garment patterns and align them for sewing in response to electronic orders.

Amazon Technologies has been granted other patents linked to on-demand apparel manufacture since then, including continuous feed fabric cutting using lasers and a robotic system that uses fluorescent ink as a guide for cutting fabric.

Amazon, a prolific patent generator and one of the United States’ top patent holders, declined to say whether it had put any of the patents into production. Amazon said it filed a number of forward-looking patent applications to explore new technologies and said they did not necessarily reflect current developments to products and services.

“The trend for things becoming on-demand is only going to grow,” said Lanza."
"Tourists have become a lot stricter on the type of location they visit. Picture: Pexels.

Sustainable travel has come a long way in recent years and not only from a resort and business perspective but also from a traveller perspective. Tourists have become a lot stricter on the type of location they visit, how “green” the location is, what experience the resort offers as well as what they are willing to pay for all of this, it’s important for the travel industry to sit up and take notice of these tourist “demands”. Ramesh Jeenarain, Managing Director at World Leisure Holidays South Africa answers some of the pertinent questions:



What does sustainable travel mean?

It focuses on two more pillars namely economic and social factors. From an economic perspective, social impact travel ensures that money spent on a trip or tour remains within the community, that every effort has a positive impact on the environment and that the culture of the country and community isn’t compromised. Millennials are gaining more spending power but are also more conscious about their impact on the world. As such, these travellers are demanding sustainable travel options and are willing to pay more to ensure that they are staying at an eco-friendly resort. This type of holidaying termed barefoot luxury is growing in popularity among holiday-makers and resorts and holiday accommodation that isn’t including sustainable travel choices will be doing themselves (and their environment, culture and economy) a huge injustice.



How can the travel industry ensure that it is practising sustainable travel?

By reducing the environmental impact. These can include:

* Paperless check-in and check-out.

* Refillable soap, shampoo and shower gel dispensers that reduce the amount of plastic and waste that goes through the accommodation on a daily basis.

* Donating leftover food to underprivileged communities in the area instead of throwing it away also shows the resort’s commitment to sustainable travel.

* Offer locally relevant experiences to tourists, allowing them to really get to know the location they are visiting, this promotes good choices and healthy activities across the locals and the tourists.

* Preserving natural sites, lifestyles and the uniqueness of the destination not only attracts tourists but shows local pride and responsibility. Inspiring farm-to-table dining far supersedes imported, endangered cuisine.

* Actively showing respect for and treating staff, locals and children well can have a huge impact on the type of visitors to the resort.



How can tourists tell whether a resort practices sustainable travel?

Their offering needs to clearly state that they offer a unique experience that’s (if possible) certified eco-friendly accommodation. There are many authentic international certificates that resorts can receive. The trend towards greener experiences over traditional hotels among travellers continues to grow. Resorts that can show that they are consciously reducing their carbon footprint through their accommodation and activity often rank far higher than skyscraping establishments.



A final word of advice for sustainable travel in 2018

By managing and communicating their sustainable travel efforts, resorts are able to stay top of mind when holidaymakers are deciding on where to book their next holiday as well as when recommending sustainable tourism to others.

"Meghan has done a brilliant job of paying tribute to the fashion industry Down Under while showcasing some British designers during the tour. But she has also put her own unique twist on her wardrobe by focusing on eco-friendly fashion.

Since she began her (now defunct) lifestyle blog The Tig in 2014, Meghan has campaigned for a more sustainable planet. And her green credentials have never been more evident than in her outfit choices over the past fortnight – dresses made from organic fabric, shoes of sustainable leather and jewellery crafted from recycled gold.

Fashion powerhouse Stella McCartney is one of the Duchess of Cambridge's go-to designers. But Meghan too has a special connection to the daughter of Sir Paul McCartney: not only did Stella design Meghan's evening wedding gown, she also shares her interest in sustainable and animal-friendly fashion.

FOCUSED: Meghan watched the Invictus Games sailing in Sydney harbour wearing £242 Krewe aviator-style sunglasses

Meghan first wore Stella's £1,150 navy cape dress for the Queen's 92nd birthday concert at the Royal Albert Hall in April. And she re-wore it for the opening ceremony of the Invictus Games, teamed with a coat by another female designer, actress Gillian Anderson – who has created a collection for British label Winser.

In one stroke, Meghan managed to promote British fashion, gender equality, sustainability and thrift.

For her final day in Australia, when she visited Fraser Island, Meghan wore a £166 'Pineapple' maxi dress with a thigh-high split from US label Reformation, which aims to put sustainability at the heart of its business.

The company, which tracks its environmental footprint, states on its website: 'Being naked is the number 1 most sustainable option. We're number 2.'

DUCHESS OF RETRO: In a pair of £255 Illesteva Palm Beach shades at Cockatoo Island

On a visit to Dubbo, in New South Wales, Meghan chose a pair of £140 Harriet jeans by the Australian brand Outland Denim, which employs Cambodian women who have been victims of sex trafficking.

She teamed the jeans with an oversized £110 Boss blazer by her close friend, tennis player Serena Williams, who was a guest at her wedding, and shares her feminist credentials.

In fact, Meghan chose a number of female designers to equip her, including Australian Karen Gee, whose website crashed after Meghan wore her cream shift on the first day of the tour – the day she announced she was pregnant.

IN THE FRAME: A smiling close-up, wearing a pair of £145 Karen Walker Northern Lights

She also wore outfits by London-based designers, including Roksanda Ilincic while on a trip to a school in Sydney; New Zealander Emilia Wickstead – a £1,595 Camilla coat dress for the Anzac Memorial service – and Daniela Karnuts – a £1,095 Gingko Cape dress for a state dinner in Fiji.

But Meghan knows it is accessories that make an outfit, and was equally in tune in her choice of shoes, bags and jewellery.

Twice on the tour, she swapped her high-heeled pumps for £112 flats by San Francisco start-up Rothy's, which makes shoes out of recycled plastic bottles, instantly doubling their online traffic.

And when she took part in a sailing competition in Sydney, she wore £115 J-10 vegan sneakers by French company Veja. The brand makes their trainers out of organic cotton, wild rubber from the Amazon and vegetable-tanned leather.

On her arrival in Fiji, she had a £173 Anna woven straw clutch by Kayu. The US company employs immigrant artisans from the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia to hand-craft bags from natural materials. She also bought a woven bag made by women at Fiji's Suva market.

When it comes to jewellery, one of Meghan's favourite designers is Pippa Small, who describes herself as an 'anthropologist, human rights activist and survival ambassador'. Meghan has a number of her rings, bracelets and studs made with Herkimer 'diamonds' – quartz crystals – mined from the Mohawk River valley in New York's Herkimer County.

She has also showcased some new designs: the £115 Oshna bangle and £160 Omeen bangle worn when she and Harry left Fiji were hand-crafted in Kabul. And during the Invictus Driving Challenge on Cockatoo Island, eagle-eyed fans noticed she was wearing four rings by Canadian jeweller Ecksand, which 'respects Mother Nature', and uses 100 per cent recycled gold and traceable gems.

Fashion week in Milan is a somewhat obvious distinction, like a week in London devoted to pub culture or a week in Tokyo dedicated to the love of colourful anthropomorphic mascots. Give the Romans their basilicas and the Venetians their canals, Milan’s preoccupation with contemporary design – particularly fashion design– has shaped its identity for most of the past century. In addition to crowds of tourists who’ve come to check out the Fondazione Prada and the Armani museum, Milan Fashion Week draws thousands of industry professionals to see runway shows from Fendi, Versace, Marni and other legendary labels.

Despite the outsized presence of these Italian fashion juggernauts, they are far from the only locally grown brands vying for attention among international buyers and press. For designers, Milan’s abundance of skilled sewers, cutters, knitters and dyers makes it one of the best places in the world to set up shop. Last June, in a hollowed-out industrial building in Tortona, a district known for art and design, several dozen such labels showed their wares at White Milano, a trade show dedicated to emerging brands.

Open this photo in gallery AVAVAV is the creation of Linda and Adam Friberg, who sold their Cheap Monday label to H&M.

Seated around their laptops at a yellow formica table, Linda and Adam Friberg held court among racks of samples from their fledgling brand, AVAVAV. While AVAVAV is still relatively unknown, the Fribergs are famous in the industry as the duo behind Cheap Monday, the Swedish label whose skinny jeans and button-down shirts were ubiquitous in the aughts. After selling their brand to H&M, the couple took a few years off, moved to Italy and began thinking about what to do next. “We come from the fast-fashion side,” said Adam, who, as with many in the industry, had become disillusioned with the wastefulness of mass clothing production. “We understood where [the] mass market was going and we wanted to try to break the pattern. We were thinking, how can we take things to the next level?”

The result of their efforts is AVAVAV (spoken as it’s spelled, A-V-A-V-A-V), a brand of easy-wearing everyday pieces for women combining the clean lines of Scandinavian minimalism and the elegance of Italian design. “It’s a little bit ageless,” said Linda, dressed in a matching blouse and pants printed with a colourful bird motif. With a generous, pyjama-like cut, and a soft, flowing viscose fabric, the outfit looks both comfortable and graceful. “It allows you to live how you want to live,” she said, describing the brand’s ethos.

Instead of producing 80 or 90 pieces each season, AVAVAV plans to offer weekly releases of small-run, made-in-Italy capsule collections, a system that provides a constant stream of new products to customers while eliminating the waste of unsold merchandise. “It’s affordable luxury within fast fashion,” Linda said.

Elsewhere at White Milano, the offerings included woven straw hats, knitwear, swimwear, watches, hand-sewn leather goods and perfume. Despite the wide range of brands and styles, everything on display is bound by a common thread of contemporary aesthetics and attention to detail.

Much of it is also made in Italy. Bucking the trend of producing clothes overseas, many of the designers at White Milano prefer to have things made locally, citing not just the prestige of a Made in Italy label, but also the ability to produce things on a smaller scale while keeping a close eye on quality.

One such designer is Lucio Vanotti, who offered a tour of his namesake collection accompanied by his miniature Italian greyhound. His Spring-Summer 2019 creations, he said, weave together influences from Bauhaus furniture, traditional Masai clothing and 1990s hip-hop style. Such disparate elements could easily clash in less experienced hands. Vanotti, however, who trained at Milan’s renowned Marangoni Institute (as did Moschino’s Franco Moschino and Berluti designer Alessandro Sartori) is a master of his craft.

Open this photo in gallery Lucio Vanotti's pieces weave together influences from Bauhaus furniture, traditional Masai clothing and 1990s hip-hop style.

“My intention is to give a really relaxed and soft feeling,” he said, pulling out a bright blue blazer in a lightweight shirt fabric, with matching pants with a slim cut and an elasticated waist. “It’s not like the typical blazer,” Vanotti said. “You can be very elegant, but at the same time sporty and comfortable.” The same kind of thinking informs the rest of the collection, which balances oversized fits and cheerful colours with classic men’s-wear references like jean jackets and jumpsuits.

A few booths over, Chinese-born designer Miao Ran was stooped over a book of fabric swatches beside a rack of PVC raincoats decorated with colourful cartoon robots. “It’s something man-made, but each one has its own character,” he said of the robots in the print, which reoccurs throughout the Spring-Summer 2019 collection of Miaoran, his eponymous label.

A skilled pattern-maker, Miao creates clothes that explore the possibilities of shape and silhouette. The clothes are technically complex but imbued with a sense of humour: One lace gown, he said, required 60 hours of embroidery, but the lace is composed entirely of his robot motif. “All of my collections always have two parts,” he said. “One part is a little bit more natural, classic, with high-cost fibres. The other part is much more fun. [They’re] designed to be worn together.”

Open this photo in gallery Miao Ran earned a special mention in Vogue Italia's 'Who is on Next?' competition. handout

While Miao’s brand is only a few seasons old, the designer has accrued no shortage of accolades, including a Woolmark prize, a special mention in Vogue Italia’s “Who is on Next?” design competition and a coveted runway show at Teatro Giorgio Armani in Milan. Miao has lived in Italy for more than a decade and speaks fluent Italian and there’s no other place in the world he’d rather practise his craft.

“I never think about working in another country or another city,” he said. “I’m a Chinese guy, but I opened my atelier in Milan. For me, it’s a very important thing. It’s an industry city and that helps every kind of designer, but especially in fashion.”

Such are the benefits of living in a town where every week is fashion week.

At Google, they call them “moonshots”, and Maria McClay, the company’s head of luxury fashion, launched hers at the Copenhagen Fashion Summit last month.

McClay, who joined Google from Gucci three years ago, has long understood that the fashion industry must reduce waste, use cleaner supply chains and cut down on energy consumption. It is, after all, one of the most wasteful industries on the planet and one of the biggest emitters of carbon.

“I could see there was an increasing need to address the negative impact of fashion,” she says. “I would be at industry events and hear about the need for data from fashion brands, so that we could have a clearer idea of what was happening, and then address those issues. I kept thinking, ‘Google can help. Data is what we do.’”

Her idea, to create a tool that measures data for the fashion industry, began as a “20 Per Cent Project,” a task Google employees can work on outside of their normal role (but inside of work hours). Within the company these projects are known as “moonshots.”

Eye on fashion: Google's Maria McClay says data is key to better understanding the industry. Supplied

“If you find a really tricky, complex issue where there might be a way that Google can get involved and make a substantial improvement, you’re encouraged to work on that,” she says. This is McClay’s first 20 Per Cent Project. “They don’t come around all the time, so this is pretty special.”

Within the industry, McClay says, there is a desire to have better energy practices and cleaner supply chains. But without proper data about how energy and water are being used, for example, it’s difficult for brands to know where to begin.

What has been missing is data, not for lack of wanting it but because it hasn’t existed or hasn’t been easily accessible. — Maria McClay, Google

Indeed, last December when Business of Fashion reported that dozens of brands pledged to reduce emissions by 30 per cent by 2030 as part of the UN Charter for Climate Action, many didn’t know the baseline they had to reduce from. Data, says McClay, is key to understanding what the industry uses, and what it can do better.

In the first stage, the project will focus on raw materials – “because that’s where the largest impact is and where the data is the most opaque”, explains McClay. In particular, it will focus on cotton and viscose. Cotton was chosen because it uses an enormous amount of water and pesticides, and viscose because it has a more contained supply chain with more sources of data. The contrast between the two, McClay says, will offer a broad scope of information."
"Resale sites have come a long way since the dawn of eBay. Formerly app-based, the ever-rising secondhand site Depop recently added web checkout, functioning as a cross between Instagram and a sales platform. Its 10 million plus users have handles and followers. There are hashtags, you can “like” items and there’s a much stronger focus on styling and aesthetic. The coolest photo of the day will land you on the home page, and bam, you’re Depop-famous.

Depop releases its users’ stats weekly, and sellers compare their worldwide ranking. They’re always quick to congratulate each other in private community pages on Facebook — and so they should. It’s pretty good business. A recent study by ThredUp, which bills itself as the largest resale and consignment store, valued the U.S. resale market alone at $20 billion, with an expectation that it will grow to $41 billion by 2022.

According to Depop, vintage clothing, generally meaning clothing that was made at least a decade ago, made up 40 percent of its sales worldwide last year.

One Depop seller, Cory Barnette (or @rainydaysweatpants) of California, is already followed by over 15,000 users , after just one year of trading."
"The 'athleisure' trend was a response to fitness culture: when women started wearing their leggings outside of the gym, the fashion industry started to design apparel that reflected the Pilates-and-coffee lifestyle.

When high street fashion brands realised that 'festival fashion' was a search term, they responded with flesh-baring, glitter-strewn collections aimed squarely at the weekend wristband market.

The latest fashion trend of 'one mile wear' is no different. The Japanese concept of comfort clothing that you wear within a one-mile radius of your home is trending - and it's easy to see why.

Brands like Madewell and, more recently, NRBY have been inspired by the idea of one mile wear. The former designed a collection especially for ""post-workout hangs, neighbourhood coffee strolls and couch marathons"". The latter recognised that women wanted clothes for the ""days when you're just putting one foot in front of the other and seeing where life takes you"".

It sounds like the type of attire that we could all get behind - and that's because most of us already have.

One mile wear is certainly a catchy idea but the truth is that women have been wearing clothes that prioritise comfort over style for years now. Think of the grey slouchy joggers that you pull on for school runs (M&S cashmere for those with money to burn; Penneys lounge pants for those who know a bargain when they see it).

Think of the oversized sweater that you sink into on a Sunday afternoon or the duster coat that you throw on when you'd much rather be wearing a dressing gown.

On trend: NRBY has embraced ‘one mile wear’ clothes

Sure, you could argue that one mile wear is the natural evolution of the lounge wear trend. Look a little closer, however, and you'll notice that a paradigm shift is occurring.

Women aren't buying into one mile wear because it's on trend. They're buying into it because they no longer want to be constricted by skin-tight trousers, blister-inducing stilettos and bras that leave red imprints on their skin.

Need further proof? Just look at the changing shape of the bra and the rise of the infinitely more comfortable bralette.

Lingerie brands have realised that women don't want to be constrained by padding and underwires anymore. And after decades of the push-and-lift look popularised by Wonderbra, they're more than happy to sacrifice scaffolding for comfort.

The handbag shape has changed dramatically too as creatures of comfort seek out backpacks and belt bags that literally and figuratively take a load off.

Functionality is the new watchword and designers are finally giving women clothing that makes their lives easier to manage.

Bum-grazing Daisy Dukes have been replaced by laid-back utility shorts. The skinny jean has given way to straight- and wide-leg looks. The easy, breezy midi skirt has trumped the can't-breathe pencil skirt.

The here's the best part: these new styles come with pockets. And not just those awful fashion pockets that can't carry anything larger than a house key, but proper, functional pockets that give women the freedom to leave their shoulder-strain-inducing trophy handbag at home (or avoid buying one in the first place).

The catwalks have been awash with feminist statements these last few years. The late Karl Lagerfeld staged a feminist rally for Chanel's SS15 collection. The first iteration of Dior's 'We Should All Be Feminists' slogan t-shirt was a sell-out success. Alexander McQueen's Sarah Burton described her AW18 collection of padded shoulder pieces as ""soft armour for women"".

These Instagram-worthy style moments have led some critics to ask if the fashion industry is appropriating feminism, just as they've wondered if the inherently elitist catwalk is any place to champion equality.

The trouble is that they seem to be missing the wider shift that's afoot.

Sure, slogan feminist t-shirts are becoming a little tedious - especially when they cost €620. Likewise, the power-shoulder trend is just that - a mere trend that will disappear after a few seasons.

But look beyond the window dressing and you'll notice that a fundamental change has occurred.

Shapes have relaxed, garments are becoming looser and form is beginning to follow function. Comfort, ease and flexibility have come to the fore, and looked at from this point of view, SS19 might just be the most feminist fashion season yet.

"COMMENT:

So it's fashion week this month FYI, and in keeping with how woke we are these days, there are calls for diversity among the models, and ethical sustainable fashion.

Who saw that coming? Possibly all of us.

It's hard to see this as more than tokenism because we know the bulk of the models will still be skinny minnies with cheekbones, and that much of fashion these days is still fast – which means unsustainable.

Advertisement

But it doesn't mean Kiwi designers aren't making an effort and that's to be applauded.

But I also think we should be able to enjoy fashion for art's sake without freaking out about having to be overtly environmentally friendly with every single stitch on every single garment.

I mean it is after all, Fashion Week.

It will come with a long line of fancy invites and PR boxes and goodie bags, not all of which will be saving the trees.

There will be people travelling from all over to watch the shows, not all of whom are coming by bike worrying about their carbon footprint.

There will be drinks and canapes on offer maybe with paper straws and on biodegradable bamboo plates but I wouldn't bet on it. There will be buckets of makeup and hairspray used, let's hope most of it's chemical free, organic and not tested on animals, but again, I have my doubts.

I like that Fashion Week is aiming for all this eco-friendly stuff, but I also like that Fashion Week is about just that – fashion.

And if the focus gets diverted from that too much, and instead onto which designer used recyclable bamboo in their garments, then do we lose the chutzpah of it all?

Advertisement

Can we have high fashion glossy and sassy enough to make international headlines and cut through if the focus is on the back panel of a dress which was sewn with vegan fabric? Or is that likely to be more headline news these days than the fashion itself?

Is popping a diverse model into a biodegradable fabric garment enough?

Or is it hypocritical if the garment was whipped up by a machinist in a sweat shop on below the minimum wage?

How much of an effort is enough? And how much is just green washing?

I actually think we can be really proud in New Zealand of how much our designers have embraced sustainability.

And bear in mind it's at great cost to them to do so.

The noise-makers say ethical fashion is the most important thing, but does the mass market at any mall on any given Saturday stop to check whether the t-shirt was made in China or not, before they buy it? Really?

Does whether you purchase or not depend on whether the cotton's organic? I doubt it.

Apparently, it's the phone call that all fashion designers lie in wait for, and, once it comes through, it means a retail red-letter day. This week, it was the turn of Irish brand Dubarry, with Kate Middleton stepping out in one of the firm's £399 jackets, produced by John Hanley tweeds in Nenagh, on her first public engagement of the year.

Dubarry, originally a shoe retailer established in Ballinasloe in 1937, has already enjoyed a celebrity endorsement boost from the likes of Geri Horner and Amanda Holden. It's also a brand already loved by the Queen, Princess Anne and Zara Phillips. Yet it's assumed that the 'Kate effect' will provide a huge shot in the arm for the design house. At the time of going to press, the Bracken Heath jacket that she wore had sold out online in all sizes but a size 8.

""There has been a notable uplift in our website traffic in the past 24 hours, and indeed significant sales of the Bracken jacket in the immediate aftermath,"" says Dubarry marketing director Michael Walsh.

""This has also seen significant foot flow into our stores in Dublin, London and Cheltenham, enquiring about the Bracken jacket.""

Irish designers have enjoyed royal connections before with, it must be noted, varying degrees of success.

It all started with couturier John Cavanagh, who designed a wedding dress for Katharine Worsley (bride of the Duke Of Kent) in 1961.

Two years later, he dressed Princess Alexandra of Kent for her wedding in Westminster Abbey.

Paul Costello was roundly regarded as one of Princess Diana's favourite designers in the Nineties, and was a regular caller to her inner sanctum at Kensington Palace.

""That was the beginning, one of the biggest things for my career, dressing Princess Diana,"" he once told the Irish Independent.

Following Diana's endorsement, Costelloe went on to work with Zara Tindall and Princess Anne, both of whom are still clients.

Philip Treacy has been a blueblood staple for longer than he cares to remember, and the connection with the Royal Family has been, on reflection, a mixed bag of fortunes.

He designed no fewer than 20 hats for Harry and Meghan Markle's big day, though back in 2011, he admitted he feared he'd end up with his ""head on a spike"" for creating Princess Beatrice's 'octopus' hat for Prince William and Kate Middleton's wedding.

Yet adopting the maxim that there's no such thing as bad publicity, the infamous fashion creation has been part of his journey to the top of his game.

Last year, Irish designer Don O'Neill's white ballgown was one of the many designers that Meghan Markle packed for her 16-day tour of Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga. The Kerryman, then a relative unknown, noted that creating the gown for the duchess was ""beyond my wildest dreams"".

It's a major coup for any designer on the up, amounting to acres of publicity that could scarcely be bought.

But the question needs to be asked, does a royal connection actually amount to an increase in sales, or is it simply good for PR?

Consultants Brand Finance certainly seem to think it's the former, and two years ago pitched Middleton's potential worth annually to the British fashion industry at £1bn.

Relative newcomer Meghan, says Brand Finance, boosted the British economy by $677m in 2018 alone.

Where Kate Middleton's purse-friendly approach (relatively speaking) has apparently aided an ailing high street, animal lover Meghan is said to be doing the same stellar work for sustainable and eco-friendly labels.

And what of the next generation of royal style icons? Prince George (aged five) may be king one day, but he is reportedly worth a mere £2.3bn by comparison to three-year-old Charlotte's £3bn. A princess is worth potentially more to the economy because of the fashion she might wear in the future, and Charlotte's birth alone is said to have generated economic benefits of over £100m.

""As well as the boost to baby clothing sales that we have seen from Prince George, a princess would be able to set trends throughout her life, which will be great for the people who designed her clothes or those who can make quick knock-off copies,"" says Brand Finance chief executive David Haigh.

The vintage Silver Cross pram that carried Charlotte to her christening at Sandringham in 2015 enjoyed a dramatic upswing in popularity, for instance.

Prams With Pizazz, a company that restores them, was ""inundated"" with calls after the ceremony, according to owner Scott Frew.

One designer who has certainly felt the warm glow of the Kate effect is London-based Erdem Moralioglu, who has credited Kate with transforming him from a struggling designer to a fashion powerhouse boasting $15m in annual sales.

Similarly, designer Jenny Packham reported a 58% increase in frock sales after Middleton wore her buttercup yellow shift dress after Charlotte's birth.

They're healthy numbers, by anyone's standards, but the Kate effect (or the Meghan effect, for that matter) doesn't always inure designers from the slings and arrows of the famously fickle industry.

Besides, equating a 'sellout' item with a wild streak of success is something of a misnomer.

If, for instance, Kate or Meghan wear a label or item without prior warning to the fashion houses, it means precious little if the designer in question has a humble amount of stock to sell. And this can often be the case.

Just ask Orla Kiely, the Kilkenny-born designer whose fashion empire collapsed last year. Kate was a champion of Kiely and was often spotted in her dresses and coats. In one instance, a dress she favoured sold out online within minutes of photos being published.

""We don't know in advance (when Kate wears our outfits), so it is a case of 'oh, holy smoke'. It's good for business, absolutely,"" Kiely said in May 2017.

But, evidently, not good enough: The endorsement from one of the world's biggest fashion icons wasn't enough to save the firm.

The full story behind the demise of Kiely's fashion empire has yet to surface, although a statement released last year alluded to ""various challenges that have faced the company over the past few years, both in the UK and abroad"".

Proof positive then, that a doff of the cap from even the most fashion-forward and influential princess doesn't always mean that a designer can sit back and rest on their royally recommended laurels.

"Women in Bangladesh and Vietnam working for Big W, Kmart, Target and Cotton On earning 51 cents an hour

This article is more than 5 months old

This article is more than 5 months old

Women in Bangladesh and Vietnam making clothes for the $23bn Australian fashion industry are going hungry because of wages as low as 51 cents an hour, an Oxfam report has found.

The aid group interviewed 470 garment workers employed at factories supplying brands such as Big W, Kmart, Target and Cotton On, and found 100% of surveyed workers in Bangladesh and 74% in Vietnam could not make ends meet.

“The investigation has uncovered the widespread payment of poverty wages and the impact this is having on the lives of the workers, mainly women, making the clothes Australians love to wear,” Oxfam Australia chief, Helen Szoke, said.

Australian clothing brands won't commit to garment workers' safety Read more

“Women who are unable to get treatment when they fall sick, workers who cannot afford to send their children to school, families that cannot make their pay stretch to put enough food on the table, people sleeping on floors in overcrowded houses, spiralling debts, mothers separated from their children – these are just some of the common realities of the failure of big brands to ensure the payment of living wages.”

Nine out of 10 workers interviewed in Bangladesh said they could not afford enough food for themselves and their families and were forced to skip meals or go into debt. In the same country 72% of workers interviewed could not afford medical treatment, compared with 53% in Vietnam. In Bangladesh, one in three workers interviewed was separated from their children because of inadequate income.

The report details the plight of a Bangladeshi 21-year-old single mother, Tania, who works up to 12 hours a day in a factory supplying clothes to brands including Kmart and earns $169 a month, or about 55 cents an hour.

She was forced to send her baby back to her village to be cared for by her parents and sees her daughter only twice a year.

Another worker profiled, Chameli, earns about 51 cents an hour for her work as a helper in a factory in Bangladesh that supplies clothes to brands including Big W. Her family cannot afford to send any of her three daughters to school and the eldest, aged 14, has also started working in a garment factory.

The family of five live in a crowded compound on the outskirts of Dhaka in a 3.6 metre by 2.4 metre room, where the two youngest girls sleep on the floor.

Deloitte Access Economics estimates that on average just 4% of the price of a piece of clothing sold in Australia goes towards the wages of the workers who made it.



Oxfam said if brands absorbed the cost of paying a living wage, it would amount to less than 1% of the garment price.

The research found practices by Australian companies were contributing to driving wages down.

Bangladesh strikes: thousands of garment workers clash with police over poor pay Read more

“They undertake fierce price negotiation, often jump between contracts instead of working with factories over the long term, squeeze lead times for orders and operate with a separation between their ethical and standards staff and their buying teams, who negotiate directly with factories,” the report said.

“One factory owner even reported the extensive measures a company had taken to keep their clothing safe in case of a fire, but a lack of interest from the very same company in fire safety measures for the workspaces where people sew their clothes.”

Szoke said Oxfam was not advocating boycotts of brands, but encouraged shoppers to contact fashion retailers via social media to demand living wages for garment workers.

Cotton On, Kmart, Target and City Chic have recently announced plans to achieve a living wage for the workers in their supply chains."

Apparently, it's the phone call that all fashion designers lie in wait for, and, once it comes through, it means a retail red-letter day. This week, it was the turn of Irish brand Dubarry, with Kate Middleton stepping out in one of the firm's £399 jackets, produced by John Hanley tweeds in Nenagh, on her first public engagement of the year.

"A schoolboy has realised his dream age just 13 after showcasing his glamorous designs on the catwalk at London Fashion Week.

Josh Birch Jones, from Kent, has been passionate about designing since he was a child, imagining up his creations from the age of four and has now seen his work on one of the world's biggest fashion platforms.

He presented his pieces under his label Designed by Josh to the discerning fashion elite on Sunday at the House of Ikons show and closing the catwalk was socialite Lizzie Cundy in a showstopping red ballgown.

At just 13 Josh Birch Jones is the youngest designer to showcase his work during London Fashion Week and enlisted socialite Lizzie Cundy (pictured together at the event) to model his showstopping designs

Speaking of his early start in the fashion industry Josh, who is currently at high school in Kent, said that his initial inspiration was close to home.

He said: 'I first started designing from when I was old enough to pick up a pencil.

'My first inspiration would be from my mothers wardrobe and seeing all the gorgeous dresses inside.

'I would just go inside her wardrobe and take them out and sketch them and then I would put my own twists on them.'

And this is not his first taste of the catwalk showcasing his very first collection at a fashion show at Port Lympne last year before showcasing the same pieces on Ireland’s Next Top Model.

Josh (pictured with Lizzie) first showed his work at the AW LFW catwalks in February this year but began designing his own pieces age four

When it comes to the pieces themselves Josh is keen to 'empower women' with intricate evening wear. Pictured: Lizzie modelling his dresses

Following this he went on to present his first collection at London Fashion Week in February making this his second time at the world famous event.

When it comes to the pieces themselves Josh is keen to 'empower women' with intricate evening wear.

He continued: 'My main specialty is evening gowns as I feel like it’s the most interesting type of clothing because there are endless possibilities that you can explore.

'Nowadays most of my inspiration comes from many evening wear designers like Ralph and Russo mainly because of their stunning designs and their intricate detailing that goes into each of their pieces.

Josh now wants to see his designs on the catwalks of Paris, Milan, New York and Dubai

'Another fashion designer that inspires me would be Ellie Saab, this brand is a true inspiration to me because of how elegant and detailed their clothing is.

'Apart from those designers some of my other inspiration comes from colours, patterns and fabrics that I see around me on a day to day basis. I also love to source fine silks and beaded fabrics from all around the world especially from Dubai.'

And while Josh is already going above and beyond expectations for a teenage designer he still has bigger ambitions for his future.

He added: My vision for me in the future will be to conquer the fashion world and turn my brand into a worldwide company and have stores in all the major fashion capitals of the world e.g. London, Paris, Milan, New York and Dubai.

'I want to stand out from all the other brands and reach out to everyone and give them something no one has ever seen before.

'I envision myself at every fashion week showcasing my latest collections and also I dream of dressing many celebrities for the red carpet and to be as recognised as all the other famous fashion brands.'"
"As an Australian of Indian heritage, the debate around cultural appropriation is inherently emotional and personal for me.

Indian, or more broadly South Asian, culture is often one of the first examples that's used when the polarising topic comes up, and usually it revolves around dress or fashion: Can people who aren't South Asian wear bindis to music festivals? Can they wear a sari to a dress-up party? Is it OK to get a henna tattoo?

GIF To wear a bindi, or not to wear a bindi? ( Giphy: No Doubt )

These conversations are important and necessary because they articulate the complex experience of watching select elements of my culture and heritage being plucked out of ""the otherness"" and effortlessly placed into the ""on trend' category.

At best this feels cringe-worthy and weird, and at worst it's upsetting — and I'm not the only one who feels this way.

Do you have thoughts on this? Leave your comment below.

Fashion label Gucci faced a backlash from the Sikh community earlier this year when it sent white (non-Sikh) models down the runway wearing turbans. Chanel upset Indigenous Australians by selling a $1,930 designer boomerang as part of a collection in 2017. Victoria's Secret was forced to apologise in 2012 for putting a Native American-style headdress on a model in one of its fashion shows.

At the heart of these discussions about cultural appropriation and fashion is the desire to answer bigger questions — when is it problematic to adopt customs, practices or ideas from a group of people or culture? And what's the line between inspiration and evolution, and cultural appropriation?

What's the difference between cultural appropriation and cultural influence?

Fashion draws its influences and inspiration from everywhere, so this can be tricky to answer.

""Borrowing from other cultures is inherently a part of the creative process,"" says Megha Kapoor, stylist and editor of an Australian high fashion publication.

And this doesn't just apply to fashion.

Dr Shameem Black, from the Department of Gender, Media and Cultural studies at the Australian National University, says there has always been different kinds of cultural sharing.

""People borrow practices that aren't traditional [to them]. That's a philosophical principle that's really important,"" Dr Black says.

""There's lots of interchange across what we might think of as cultural boundaries in many parts of the world and historically.""

For Ms Kapoor, fashion is a space where different cultures are celebrated.

""It's one of the really positive industries in terms of being inclusive of other cultures.""

The history of exploitation makes cultural appropriation more complicated

But Dr Black says that issues can arise when ""we see a split between the way a cultural practice is valued and the way people from that culture are valued and treated in a particular society"".

Borrowing from other cultures becomes problematic when historical context and cultural sensitivities are ignored.

That's why Gucci's turbans, Chanel's boomerang and the Victoria's Secret headdress received such strong criticism. All those pieces hold religious or cultural significance to their traditional owners. They also represent cultures that were subjugated and exploited by European colonists, and they're now being profited off by European and American brands.

Designing pieces inspired by any indigenous culture requires even more sensitivity.

""In the Australian context it's particularly sensitive. For so long Indigenous Australia was a culture denied, a culture interrupted and therefore not acknowledged,"" says Peter Denham, Director of Curatorial and Exhibitions at Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences.

""For someone like Chanel, why couldn't they have worked with an artist or a maker in Australia?""

Chanel could have considered taking a leaf out of Jimmy Choo's book. The well-renowned international shoe designer collaborated with Noongar artist Peter Farmer in 2017 to make two pairs of high heels decorated with Farmer's designs.

Dr Black says the use of Native American headdresses as fashion or dress-up accessories is equally as tone-deaf.

""There is a feeling that while people may feel interested or willing to take on that cultural practice, it is also in contrast with a very violent and dark history.""

How to avoid cultural appropriation with your fashion choices Navigating the murky line between appropriation and exchange is a task that comes down to mindfulness and respect. Ask questions: ""Look at a brand that uses textiles, patterns or styles from different parts of the world and ask questions about whether they have designers from that part of the world involved. How engaged or how well represented are they in the industry? That's one first step that could go from there to learn about some broader issues and structural questions — like how are people from those cultures treated in this society,"" says Dr Shameem Black.

How engaged or how well represented are they in the industry?

Do your research: Think carefully before wearing traditional dress from another culture. Find out what cultural significance that piece of clothing may have to people and in what context these items are traditionally worn.

Think carefully before wearing traditional dress from another culture. Find out what cultural significance that piece of clothing may have to people and in what context these items are traditionally worn. Engage with other cultures in an authentic way: If you want to celebrate or appreciate another culture, don't cherry-pick the parts you think are cool or trendy. Do some reading or travel, and genuinely listen to what people from those cultures have to say.

How do you know if it's cultural appropriation?

Asking who profits is one way to tell if appropriation has crossed a line.

Another red flag when it comes to the question of cultural appropriation is the lack of authorship, acknowledgement and consultation of the groups that people choose to borrow from.

""You've got to get their point of view. You can't just come from the angle of 'I think that looks cool, so I'm just going to do it',"" says Ms Kapoor.

Mr Denham says compensation should also be considered.

""For it not to be cultural appropriation, there has to be recognition, respect, reward or recompense. You have to ask yourself which people benefited from this product — did someone receive an income from it?""

This failure to consult, collaborate and at the very least consider cultural context means that designers and individuals run the risk of reinforcing damaging stereotypes.

""This has been frustrating for minority communities around dress — when someone is taking styles and putting them on the runway, they're picking and choosing what they think is representative of that culture,"" says Dr Black.

The evolution of hip hop culture from streetwear to high-end fashion is an example of this.

Sneakers and tracksuits used to be synonymous with poorer, black neighbourhoods in the US. But now high-end brands such as Gucci, Balenciaga, Marc Jacobs and Louis Vuitton are all cashing in on what has recently become a fashion trend.

Why's this a problem? When luxury brands profit off the ""coolness"" of black culture, while turning a blind eye to the structural injustice and economic inequality faced by black Americans, they run the risk of appearing to be exploitative and insensitive to those communities — a perfect illustration of what Dr Black is describing.

What about cultural exchange instead of cultural appropriation?

But there are positive and constructive ways for people to engage with and borrow from other cultures.

Cultural exchange, instead of appropriation, is something we should encourage.

""The principle of cultural exchange, which involves consultation, collaboration and recognition, is a much more equal way in which it's not just one person setting the terms,"" Dr Black says.

Anna Robertson is the founder of Yevu, an Australian-Ghanaian social fashion enterprise is doing just this.

While Anna is based in Sydney, she employs over 20 people in Ghana who are paid above the living wage. She says there are so many positives to come out of genuinely collaborating with people in Ghana.

""Seeing new female leaders emerge has been one of the best things to come out of starting the business, as well as being part of a really strong team who feel immense pride and ownership of what they're making,"" she says.

Co-branded collaborations are also becoming common in the fashion industry.

Last year Lisa Waup, an Aboriginal Torres Strait Islander artist, worked with fashion designer Ingrid Verner on a collection exploring themes of connection, identity and country.

Image Gunditjmara and Torres Strait Islander artist Lisa Waup and designer Ingrid Verner collaborated closely to make a collection of garments featuring four original prints by Waup. ( Supplied: Verner )

The product was a collection of garments that referenced Lisa's print work. She says her culture, history and story was honoured throughout the creative process.

""It was a beautiful way to work together and was a partnership from the start. You're coming from different worlds in a lot of ways, so it was all about sharing and listening which is really special,"" she says.

In a modern, globalised world, it's only natural that individuals, artists, designers and entire industries would be influenced by cultures different to their own. And this is exactly why identifying appropriation is complex.

It is as much about profit and structural inequality as it is about individuals choosing to wear bindis to a music festival. They're intertwined.

But appreciating and borrowing from other cultures can be a positive, enriching and unifying — if it's done in a sensitive, mindful and equitable way."
"New York (CNN Business) Bankrupt Gymboree has found a buyer for its brands. The Children's Place and Gap have agreed to purchase most of what's left of the company.

It's the latest shakeup in the sector as brick-and-mortar stores try to find their footing in a challenging environment.

Children's Place will spend $76 million to acquire the rights to the Gymboree and Crazy 8 brands, and will take over the contract for Gymboree Play & Music, which was spun off in 2016, according to court documents filed Saturday.

Gap appears to be going all-in on Gymboree's more upscale Janie and Jack brand. It's paying $35 million for the online business and leases to Janie and Jack stores, with an additional agreement to buy Janie and Jack's inventory.

The moves follow Gymboree's decision in January to file for bankruptcy for the second time in less than two years.

"A plus-size fashion blogger has used her platform to attack big name brands such as Zara and Alice + Olivia for not making her size of clothing, and she does this from the inside of a dressing room.

Katie Sturino, 34, is a fashion publicist turned beauty entrepreneur and blogger who started her blog, The 12ish Style, in 2015 after she realized there was a gap in the market for fashion inspiration for curvier women online.

The New Yorker, who used to be married to meme king The Fat Jew, alerts people of the problem with sizing by taking pictures of herself in the largest clothes at prominent brands.

Important: Katie Sturino, 34, is a fashion blogger who uses her platform to inform the public about issues plus-size people face in fashion. Pictured wearing an too small XL Zara dress

Upset: She created a campaign entitled #MakeMySize where she posts about brands that don't offer clothing for women with fuller figures, like Zara

Prominent: Katie has run her blog, The 12ish Style, since 2015 where she helps promote inclusivity for plus-size figures in the fashion world

Unimpressed: One of her brands recently added to her #MakeMySize list was Alice + Olivia for its too small dresses

These images, posted on her Instagram, show the shocking display of how exclusive clothing can be for women at certain stores with fuller figures.

Katie uses the hashtag #MakeMySize to inform brands about their lack of inclusiveness and to encourage other people to share their own problems with finding clothing that fits.

'@zara is at the top of the #MakeMySize list bc they have been making me feel bad in the fitting room for years,' Katie wrote in a recent Instagram post featuring herself in a dress that was too small.

'In fact, I stopped even trying about six years ago. Went in today, same deal. This is an XL and I can’t get my arms down let alone try to close the front.'

What Katie does is she finds the largest size clothing for specific pieces and sees how they fit on her own body. But this sometimes demonstrates how exclusive a store can be to plus-size people.

Zara isn't the only brand that has felt the heat from Katie during her inclusive movement.

Annoyed: In one of Katie's most recent post, she showed what the largest clothing at Club Monaco looked like on her body

Sad: She expressed to the company how much she wanted to wear the clothes, but none of the designs fit her frame despite grabbing the largest size available

Not right: FRAME denim also came under fire for creating jeans that came nowhere close to fitting Katie's body, despite being the largest size (32/XL/14) on offer

She also recently blasted Alice + Olivia, Club Monaco, Aritzia and FRAME for their lack of clothing available.

'What kind of message are you sending to high school, college and basically any aged woman who walks in your store when I’m shown here in the largest sizes that you carry?' Katie asked in her most recent post featuring multiple clothing items from Aritzia.

None of the clothes came even close to covering her body, which shows how lacking the brand is in inclusive sizing.

Since Katie first started the #MakeMySize hashtag, she has inspired other women to share their own stories of not finding clothes that fit.

To help all of her plus-size followers, Katie also included an Instagram highlight on her page featuring a number of brands that do provide inclusive sizing for women.

Some of the brands she has recently found create plus-size clothing include Zac Posen, Brandon Maxwell, Mara Hoffman and City Chic USA.

But she also has consistent favorites such as J.Crew, ModCloth, Nordstrom, Loft and Stitch Fix.

Unacceptable: Another brand under fire is Aritzia for its exclusive sizing for all clothing

Too tight: None of the clothes came close to fitting Katie's body, which she said is a problem

What's the message? She asks her followers to also share instances where they couldn't find as a way to inform brands that they all need to be inclusive

Stunning: Katie has grown more confident with her body in recent years and uses her platform to inspire other plus-size women

Smart: Katie admitted to getting trolls on her Instagram account about her body and weight, but she chooses to focus instead on self acceptance

Since launching her blog and personal Instagram account, Katie has built a loyal following (she currently has more than 225,000 followers).

Despite receiving relatively positive feedback about her body positive posts, Katie revealed recently how she has been the subject of name-calling online.

In one Instagram post in May, Katie shared a picture of herself posing on the beach in a leopard print bikini, with various offensive names and phrases Photoshopped into the background.

These words included 'whale,' 'fat,' and 'cover up,' along with the phrases 'nobody wants to see that' and 'lose some weight'.

'I always get a ""troll"" or two when I post a swimsuit photo, but it never bothers me because my journey to self acceptance meant I had to get over the opinion of my biggest troll... ME,' Katie wrote in the accompanying caption.

'When I was a lot slimmer than I am now, I used to criticize myself in the mirror, feel shame for being ""the fattest girl in the room"" and blame my problems on those final ten pounds I couldn't lose.'

However, when Katie finally learned to accept her body and herself, she also started to feel good about her body at any size, and harsh words and criticisms became 'irrelevant'."

The owner of high street fashion giant Zara has rung up record sales and profits after shrugging off currency pressures and tough retail conditions.

Spanish group Inditex reported a 3% rise in net income to 1.4 billion euro (£1.2 billion) for the six months to July 1 – its highest ever half-year result.

The world’s largest clothing retailer said group like-for-like sales rose by 4% and were higher across all regions including Europe and the UK, although this marks a slowdown on the 6% growth seen a year earlier.

Net sales also reached a milestone, smashing past 12 billion euro (£10.7 billion) for the first time to hit 12.03 billion euro (£10.7 billion).

It also estimates that like-for-like sales growth has picked up pace in the second half so far to between 4% and 6%, as it said its autumn/winter initial collections have been “well received”.

The group’s profits hike comes despite fears over an impact from the stronger euro, which had been expected to take its toll.

Its gross profit margin increased slightly to 56.7% from 56.4%.

Inditex makes a lot of its products in the eurozone, but makes more than half its sales outside the currency bloc.

The impact of the strong euro was shown in its total sales figures, with the result in local currencies up by a more impressive 8%.

Pablo Isla, chairman and chief executive of Inditex, said: “The strong first-half results are the result of a solid sales and operating performance, arising from the unique strength of the group’s integrated and sustainable business model.”

The fast fashion firm, which also owns Massimo Dutti and Pull&Bear among a raft of brands, opened stores in 44 markets in its first half, taking its total number of outlets to 7,422 across 96 markets.

It recently announced that all of its brands will be available online worldwide by 2020.

Currently it had online sales in 49 of its 96 markets.

"Trending AFI Cape Town Fashion Week 2019 journeys home

Runways are set to come alive with the best in African fashion. AFI Cape Town Fashion Week promises to be an awe-inspiring show featuring colourful couture and work by designers from across the continent, as well as some exciting up-and-comers, writes Rhodé Marshall.

African fashion is a political statement – it represents our heritage and, with or without our permission, creatives from around the world have drawn inspiration from our cultures and way of living to design either our or their depiction of Africa.

But, for the most part, that’s in the past as young creatives from across the continent are telling their own stories of where they come from through honest and beautifully creative depictions of what our world represents.

To showcase this, African Fashion International (AFI) is returning to Cape Town. Lovers of fashion, beauty and design will be treated to a week of fashion and lifestyle heaven from Tuesday to Saturday. AFI Cape Town Fashion Week arrives on the heels of the Condé Nast International Luxury Conference, of which AFI is a major sponsor.

The Condé Nast conference and AFI Cape Town Fashion Week bring together the finest Pan-African designers to showcase their latest ranges. The Condé Nast conference kicks off on Tuesday and ends on Thursday, which is the first day of AFI Cape Town Fashion Week – it’ll run until Saturday.



The Condé Nast International Luxury Conference is a premier business industry event that attracts business leaders and influencers within the luxury industry from more than 30 countries. The event is the first conference of its type to take place in South Africa, and will be hosted by Vogue International editor Suzy Menkes.

Under the theme The Nature of Luxury, the Condé Nast conference will explore topics such as sustainable business models and conscious consumerism; African opportunities; retail success strategies; and the ongoing intersection of luxury and technology.

The current fashion and lifestyle market is bursting with prospects for up-and-coming designers, as well as distributors of raw materials, and Cape Town is going to be the perfect melting pot for beautiful things. Designers from Ghana, Nigeria, Tanzania, Cameron and Morocco who have strong African aesthetics in their creations paired up with local favourites such as MaXhosa by Laduma, Imprint ZA and Marianne Fassler.



AFI founder and chief executive officer Precious Moloi-Motsepe says: “Africa has always been a source of inspiration for the rest of the world. AFI is set up to showcase and propel African designers to promote their businesses. Africa can definitely compete with the global brands when given the support and an enabling ecosystem – that is what AFI seeks to facilitate.”

The continent boasts the world’s largest millennial population and the fastest-growing middle class. Together, this represents an enormous opportunity for African luxury and commercial fashion brands. International luxury brands have penetrated local markets, but they lack valid African narratives that speak to a distinct sense of style. While the world is investing in African consumers, home-grown creatives have a responsibility to set the trends.



“The idea of going back home is all about building a future through strengthening the present and acknowledging the past. Our presence in the market is only as great as our ability to stand out,” Moloi-Motsepe says."

"Korean Beauty, also known as K-beauty, has been all the rage in the U.S. over the last couple of years.

The cosmetic addict in all of us is committed to trying everything at least once, so it's only natural that we would want to explore and experiment with popular products from other countries.

But what about the fashionistas? Enter Suggesty, a personal styling e-commerce site and app that features Korean brands spanning from established labels to up-and-coming streetwear designers.

K-fashion: Suggesty is a personal styling e-commerce site and app that features popular Korean brands spanning from established labels to up-and-coming streetwear designers

Something for everyone: Suggesty is currently working with over forty Korean clothing and accessory brands, with a focus on quality fabrication, function and fit

Suggesty is currently working with over forty Korean clothing and accessory brands, with a focus on quality fabrication, function and fit.

'K-Fashion design and product quality can be compared to high-end designer brands but the price point is much lower and often compared to SPA (Fast Fashion),' said Suggesty founder Sangwoo Kang.

'The current US fashion market is becoming more and more polarized between cheap SPA brands and high-end brands, I think K-fashion labels can very easily bridge the gap.'

'Just spending half a minute sets you up with a unique fashion profile, and our Suggesty stylist engine handpicks the recommendation for you in real time.

'We want to expand your fashion comfort zone and experiment with your style,' shared Sangwoo.

According to Sangwoo, K-fashion's design inspiration is multi-cultured and heavily influenced by cities like Paris, London, Milan, New York and California.

A self-proclaimed 'terrible dresser', Sangwoo, launched the site to help others like himself.

'With my big-data analytics background, we basically made a tool that can help identify customers needs and wants in fashion. Simply put, we put a stylist genie into a bottle and made it into an app/website.'

Once technicalities were sorted, stocking inventory became the next issue. 'SPA brand items had quality and design issues and high-end designer had a pricing issue. That is when we turned our focus to K-Fashion.'

Where to get it: Suggesty fashion and accessories mostly range from $50-$350 and can be purchased via the app, or on suggestyny.com. Pictured: Back Ribbon Blouse by Millogrem, $86.90; suggestyny.com

"Fast-fashion retailers have been accused of not doing enough to combat waste and the poor treatment of workers.

Amazon UK, Boohoo, Missguided, JD Sports, Sports Direct and TK Maxx are guilty of ‘shocking failures’, say MPs.

A cross-party group has sounded the alarm over cheap polyester leisurewear and ‘plastic dresses’ that are sold for as little as £3 or £5, before being worn once and then thrown away.

The fast-fashion culture, driven by celebrities and social media, means Britons buy twice the amount of clothes compared to the rest of Europe.

An estimated 400,000 tonnes of clothes are buried in landfill or burned in incinerators for energy every year.

Sports direct was among the firms accused of 'shocking failures' by MPs over issues of waste and staff conditions

Mary Creagh, chairman of the environmental audit committee, said: ‘We want to see a thriving fashion industry that employs people fairly, inspires creativity and contributes to the economic success of the UK.

‘It’s shocking to see that a group of major retailers are failing to take action to promote environmental sustainability and protect their workers.’

MPs wrote to UK retailers asking what they were doing to reduce the environmental and social impact of their clothes, shoes and accessories.

They were particularly critical of British brand Kurt Geiger, which failed to answer any of their questions.

The retailers’ performances were measured on their public commitments and membership of industry schemes which promote sustainability, environmental protection and the ethical treatment of workers. These include the Sustainable Clothing Action Plan (SCAP) which has set a target for a 15 per cent cut in carbon, water and waste to landfill and 3.5 per cent cut in overall waste by 2020.

Amazon (left) and TK Maxx (right) were also slammed for waste from disposable fashion

There is also Make Fashion Circular, which promotes the idea of using renewable and safe materials.

MPs also looked at whether retailers offered ‘take-back’ schemes to collect old clothes that could be recycled.

Their report said: ‘None of the “least engaged” retailers have signed up to SCAP targets to reduce their carbon, water and waste footprint and none of them use organic or sustainable cotton in their garments. Of the six, only Boohoo and Sports Direct use recycled material in their products.

‘Only TK Maxx offers an in-store take-back scheme.’

The committee said it was important that firms were signed up to the Action, Collaboration, Transformation (ACT) scheme, which includes a commitment to pay a living wage.

But MPs found: ‘None of the six retailers are signed up to the ACT living wage initiative and only one, Missguided, is a member of ETI – Ethical Trading Initiative – which aims to improve working conditions for workers globally.’ However, the committee did acknowledge efforts made by Missguided to improve working practices at suppliers in Leicester.

The MPs were critical of Amazon UK for providing scant information on its activities and policies.

On a positive note, they praised efforts by Marks & Spencer, Tesco, ASOS, Primark and Burberry.

And they said other retailers, such as Next, Debenhams, the Arcadia Group and Asda Stores, were ‘moderately engaged’ in making improvements."
"Strong results are due to rise in online shopping, warm weather and surge in summer sales, says company

This article is more than 10 months old

This article is more than 10 months old

Profits at the online fashion retailer Boohoo soared 22% in the most recent six months, driven by strong sales of cycling shorts, playsuits, 90s-inspired fashions and Britain’s continuing shift to internet shopping.

The company said warm weather had helped lift sales of summer trends for holidays and festivals, including a surge in demand for cycling shorts, which the joint chief executive Carol Kane said was one trend she thought she “would never see again”. Total sales rose 50% to £395m in the six months to 31 August – a bigger increase than City analysts had predicted.

Boohoo’s chief financial officer, Neil Catto, said the company was continuing to benefit from the shift to online shopping. “All our brands are taking market share,” he said. “The signs are that the market is tough generally but we are in the right place.”

Founded 12 years ago in Manchester, Boohoo has expanded quickly, listing its shares in 2014 and buying the PrettyLittleThing and Nasty Gal brands last year.

Boohoo boss in line for £50m bonus if share price rises by 180% Read more

PrettyLittleThing was the standout performer, with its revenue soaring 132% despite the relocation of its distribution centre to Sheffield, northern England, during the period.

Boohoo and other online specialists like Asos are tapping into a generation of consumers who shop on their mobile phones and share fashion tips via social media. Traditional British clothing retailers such as Marks & Spencer and Debenhams have seen profits slump and stores close.

Shares in Boohoo, which sells own-brand clothing, shoes, accessories and beauty products, largely to 16- to 30-year-olds, jumped more than 9% to nearly 209p after the company said it now expected full year sales to rise by up to 43%, three percentage points more than previously hoped.

The share price rise means Boohoo – which is 36% owned by Kane and the family of her fellow chief executive Mahmud Kamani – is now valued at £2.44bn, some 20 times more than the 240-year-old Debenhams.

Pretax profit was £24.7m for the half year, up from £20.3m in the same period last year."

The department store chain's stock tanked as much as 18% on Wednesday, after cutting its 2019 adjusted profit on the heels of huge markdowns on products that flopped with customers. This year, Macy's has lost nearly 60% of its stock market value.

Macy's also reported a meager 0.3% increase in second-quarter comparable sales, including licensed departments, allowing the company an empty victory of being able to crow about continued sales growth. But in a healthy consumer spending environment, it suggests Macy's continues to lose market share to the likes of Target, T.J. Maxx, and Ulta Beauty.

Executives pinned the blame on factors like bad weather in May and on ""fashion misses"" in its women’s sportswear business, particularly its own brands. Macy's CEO Jeff Gennette told Fortune that while the company had to do better, these problems are part of ""the vagaries of being in the fashion business.""

But vagaries aside, it is clear Macy's will have to do better, much better, with its own clothing brands if it wants to win back market share. The company gets almost a third of business from its brands (including home goods) and is betting a good chunk of its future on those private labels.

Target's strong performance in apparel is adding to the pressure. That company has boldly eliminated a number of large-but-stale brands and found enormous success in the new names replacing them. Gennette acknowledged some of Macy's clothing brands need to be ""rejiggered"" but said he had ""confidence"" Macy's will revitalize the brands.

Should more stores close, or downsize?

Another big challenge for Macy's is what to do with the bulk of its 600-store fleet, beyond the marquee stores it operates in top markets like Manhattan and San Francisco. With comparable sales up (which includes e-commerce) and digital sales rising more than 10% for the 40th quarter in a row, the math makes it clear that business in its stores is down and that fewer shoppers are coming for a visit.

Gennette, who oversaw the closing of more than 100 stores a couple of years ago, has long argued that even stores with declining sales are valuable, provided they have positive cash flow, meaning they take in more money than they need.

Indeed, stores provide a visibility in a market and when one closes, Macy's permanently loses a big chunk of business. ""We know that when we close the store, we're firing customers,"" Gennette said.

What's more, many of these regional stores are crucial as nodes in Macy's massive e-commerce operation—a $6 billion a year business— that can ship items to customers, to other stores, and where shoppers can get customer service.

""I'm not opposed to closing more doors, I just want to make sure that I've considered the full customer in that,"" said Gennette.

But such facilities are typically in more remote areas rather than in suburbs, where doing business is more costly. Consequently, it's an open question whether e-commerce support is enough of a justification to keep many locations open. Gennette conceded that Macy's is looking at reduced square footage at many of these stores, along with more self-service to keep costs in check.

What's more, many Macy's stores beyond its top stores are inadequately maintained, with clothes strewn on the floor, and the walls in need of paint, a far cry from the ""experiential retail"" many companies know they need to offer shoppers to get them to physical locations. It's hard to see how letting any stores become shabby adds to the brand ultimately.

Playing to Macy's strengths

Macy's has a lot to build on, and Gennette said things were in play that will let the chain have a good holiday quarter.

The company boasts a stellar e-commerce operation, a loyal clientele, a promising start to website-only brands (currently, the assortment of such merchandise is 500,000 items), and enormous (although possibly eroding) clout with vendors. Its jewelry and men's business enjoyed good quarters. But all that is clearly not enough

""All is on the table,"" Gennette said. And all needs to be if Macy's is to finally reignite growth in a meaningful way beyond some anemic increases.

"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Does my environmental impact look big in this?

Young people's love of fast fashion is coming under the scrutiny of Britain's law-makers.

MPs say the fashion industry is a major source of the greenhouse gases that are overheating the planet.

Discarded clothes are also piling up in landfill sites and fibre fragments are flowing into the sea when clothes are washed.

The retailers admit more needs to be done, but say they are already working to reduce the impact of their products.

What do MPs say?

The House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee says there is a basic problem with an industry that relies on persuading people to throw away good clothes because they are ""last year's colour"".

It quotes evidence that:

British shoppers buy far more new clothes than any nation in Europe

People are buying twice as many items of clothing as they did a decade ago

Fish in the seas are eating synthetic fibres dislodged in the wash

The MPs have written to the UK's top fashion bosses asking how they can maintain the £28bn benefit their industry brings to the UK economy, while reducing the environmental harm.

They believe swift action is essential, because if current clothes consumption continues ""...they will account for more than a quarter of our total impact on climate change by 2050"", chairwoman Mary Creagh told BBC News.

""Three in five garments end in landfill or incinerators within a year - that's expensive fuel! Half a million tonnes of microfibres a year enter the ocean. Doing nothing is not an option.""

Image caption Shouldn't more clothing be re-used?

What are the solutions?

The committee's report to government could include a call for the fashion industry to create less pollution, a demand for longer life for garments and a ban on dumping clothes in landfill.

The MPs also have concerns about social impacts. They believe fast fashion is fuelling quick turnarounds among suppliers, which may lead to poor working conditions.

Among their questions to retailers are:

Do you pay the living wage and how do you ensure child labour is not used in factories?

Do you use recycled materials?

How long do you keep clothes, and how do you encourage recycling?

Do you incinerate unsold or returned stock?

How are you reducing the flow of microfibres into the sea?

Circular Economy

More on the Circular Economy.

What do retailers say in response?

Peter Andrews, head of sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, told BBC News that population growth and increased demand have led to an increase in the overall volume and environmental impact of clothing.

But, he said his members are now designing products that are made to last, and they are encouraging customers to return unwanted clothes for reuse.

""We know more needs to be done, but the best answers will be achieved with collaborative global actions.""

The companies approached by the MPs are: M&S, Primark, Next, Arcadia, Asda, TK Maxx and HomeSense, Tesco, JD Sports Fashion, Debenhams, Sports Direct International.

Dressbarn is closing all of its stores.

The women’s retailer announced Monday “plans to commence a wind-down of its retail operations, including the eventual closure of its approximately 650 stores.”

Stores remain open along with the Dressbarn website, the company said in a statement.

""For more than 50 years, Dressbarn has served women's fashion needs, and we thank all of our dedicated associates for their commitment to Dressbarn and our valued customers,” said Steven Taylor, Dressbarn chief financial officer, in a statement. “This decision was difficult, but necessary, as the Dressbarn chain has not been operating at an acceptable level of profitability in today's retail environment.”

This year has been a tough year for retailers with more store closings announced than in all of 2018. With Dressbarn closures, there are more than 7,000 closings announced for 2019.

Tariff impact: China tariffs could force 'widespread store closures' and put $40 billion in sales at risk

Coresight Research tracked the 5,864 closings in 2018, which included all Toys R Us stores and hundreds of Kmart and Sears locations. The record year for closings was 2017 with 8,139 shuttered stores.

All Dressbarn stores are open along with the website, the statement said. There are no current changes to Dressbarn's return, refund, or gift card policies.

“During the wind-down process, we will continue to provide our customers with the same great experience both in-store and online, offering them even better deals and value,” Taylor said. “We will work to assist our associates through the transition and maintain existing relationships with our vendors, suppliers, and other key stakeholders through this process.""

According to the statement, plans for closing individual stores and information about store closing sales “will be shared during the wind-down process.”

Dressbarn is part of New Jersey-based Ascena Retail Group, whose other brands include Ann Taylor, Lane Bryant, Catherines, Cacique and Justice. The company recently sold its Maurices brand.

In a separate statement from Ascena, the company said the decision has no impact on the operations of the other brands.

“Dressbarn’s wind down is another significant step taken to advance ascena’s ongoing transformation,” the statement said. “This move is in line with the Company’s commitment to comprehensively assess and optimize its portfolio by focusing resources on its most profitable brands to position the business for long-term growth and enhance shareholder value.”

"COMMENT:

We all know that plastics in our oceans are a danger not only to marine life but also to our food supply. Banning single-use plastic bags from our supermarkets and microbeads from our body wash has got New Zealand started in addressing some of the problems, but for a bigger impact, it might pay to read the label on your clothing.

Polyester, Lycra, and nylon are all cheap and versatile materials that give you the comfortable, breathable stretch in your activewear and the warm, long-lasting durability in your outerwear. These materials are also synthetic or man-made fibres created from plastic and making up about 60 per cent of all clothing globally.

With the rise of fast fashion, where high-street brands produce cheap, low-quality clothing to meet consumer demands for on-trend clothing, the amount of clothing dumped into landfills each year is steadily rising.

Advertisement

This over-consumption of clothing, however, is only one part of the challenge when it comes to what we wear. Scientists are now looking into the contribution that synthetic fabric clothing could be making to ocean plastic pollution from a simple act that most of us do every week.

Throwing your clothes into the washing machine is part of the process of owning and maintaining them. The machine along with water and detergent cleans your clothes through a process of agitation in the drum.

This agitation not only gets the dirt out of your clothing but, according to a study published in the journal Environmental Science and Technology, also breaks off small pieces of loose fibre from your clothing.

These tiny fibres, known as microfibres are so small that they easily pass through the filtration system in the washing machine as well as the sewage filters in the waste water facility and can end up flowing out through our waterways as microplastics.

The researchers set up a series of experiments where they washed new and old clothing that was made from either polyester fleece or nylon shell material. Alarmingly, they found that on average one synthetic fleece jacket released 1.7g of plastic microfibres with each wash.

They also found that older clothing shed almost twice as much than new jackets. When they compared types of washing machines they found that the mass of microfibre produced from top-load washing machines was approximately seven times more than was produced by a front-loading machine.

Microfibres are typically less than 5mm in length with a diameter of a few micrometres - thinner than a human hair. They are easily consumed by fish and other wildlife, where they accumulate in the stomach of the animal.

The shape of the fibres creates another problem too – specifically their high surface area to volume ratio. The surface of plastic is charged in a way that means it strongly attracts and absorbs chemicals known as ""persistent organic pollutants"" or POPs, which include polychlorinated biphenyls and dioxins.

POPs have been found in the human body and are linked to adverse reproductive, developmental, behavioural, neurological and immunologic health effects. In the ocean these absorbed POPs can accumulate with the plastics in the animals, leading to high concentrations in their tissues, which further magnify as they move up through the food chain.

So, if you don't want to inadvertently eat plastic from your clothing, natural fibres like cotton and wool are more friendly as they biodegrade more easily. However, if you still love your fleece – and the planet - you might want to consider wearing it one more time before throwing it in for a wash."
"According to Stratistics MRC, the Global Eco Fibres Market is accounted for $121.42 billion in 2017 and is expected to reach $398.00 billion by 2026 growing at a CAGR of 14.1% during the forecast period.

"Tourism’s sustainability journey gets industry backing

1/04/19



The vision for New Zealand to have the world’s most sustainable tourism industry has reached a significant milestone.

The Tourism Sustainability Commitment challenges individual businesses to operate more sustainably, and now over 1000 tourism businesses have made the pledge.

Tourism Industry Aotearoa launched the TSC at the end of 2017, with the aim of seeing every New Zealand tourism business committed to sustainability by 2025.

To get some real impetus behind the initiative, an aspirational goal was set to sign up 1000 businesses by the end of March 2019. TIA is proud to announce the TSC community has now exceeded that target.

TIA Sustainability Advocates Megan Williams and Lynn Robinson have been promoting the Commitment across the industry, spearheading industry change and challenging tourism businesses to improve their operations.

“It’s been exciting talking about sustainability with tourism operators and we’ve been heartened by the huge amount of interest and enthusiasm from the industry,” says Lynn Robinson.

“Operators throughout the industry are really keen to find out how they can become more sustainable. With a large number of businesses now signed up to the TSC we’re starting to focus on the ‘enablement’ phase – developing sustainability tools and resources and initiating conversations to get networks of operators talking and sharing ideas.”

Megan Williams says, “We’re excited about working with regional and sector groups to assist businesses in making meaningful changes. These can be at an individual business level or within a group where working together can create other opportunities for change.”

The TSC asks supporters to join the effort to achieve ambitious economic goals for the industry while sharing the overwhelming benefits with their host communities and contributing to restoring, protecting and enhancing our natural environment. This ensures that New Zealand continues to be a high quality destination of choice for domestic and international travellers.

The 1000th business to sign up to the TSC was Amber Kiwi Holiday Park, Christchurch. Owners Braden and Sharon Lee say their team is excited to be a part of TIA’s initiative on sustainability within tourism.

“This is something that we actively participate in and enable, and we encourage our guests to join us in our sustainability efforts at our holiday park.”

Holiday Parks New Zealand Chief Executive Fergus Brown says it’s an achievement that one third of HPNZ members are now signed up to the Tourism Sustainability Commitment.

“We have been committed to the TSC since its launch, and also committed to getting 100% of our 300 members signed up,” says Mr Brown.

“We see the TSC as an essential business tool for our members to address the key four areas of sustainability embedded in the TSC, and to make a difference for New Zealand by addressing sustainability in the long term.”

TIA Chief Executive Chris Roberts says reaching 1,000 TSC supporters is a sign that the tourism industry is serious about making sustainability a priority.

“Our national vision and goals for sustainability are important, but without the support of individual business owners and operators we can achieve nothing.

“A huge thank you to our tourism community for saying ‘yes’ to making industry-wide change. Together we can create a truly sustainable industry making a positive long-term contribution to New Zealand.”

The Tourism Sustainability Commitment has 8 industry goals and 14 business-level commitments, across four elements of sustainability – economic, visitor, host community and environment. It is guided by the values of Kaitiakitanga, Manaakitanga and Whanaungatanga, with a vision of ‘Leading the World in Sustainable Tourism’.

"PARIS — On Friday, François-Henri Pinault, the chief executive of Kering, plans to unveil details of a Fashion Pact that he is to present to world leaders at the Group of 7 summit this weekend.

The agreement outlines group commitments focused on climate, biodiversity and oceans. It defines itself as “a set of guidelines” and will not be legally binding. The 32 signatories, which include high-end brands like Chanel, Prada and Hermès; athletic apparel names like Nike and Adidas; as well as fast fashion retailers like the H & M Group and Inditex, the parent company of Zara, say they will implement proposed changes to their own operations. No punitive measures will be imposed should they fall short of targets.

“The global challenges we are facing are complex,” Mr. Pinault wrote in an email on Thursday. “They know no borders. Only coalitions can overcome them, bringing together governments, businesses and civil societies.”

He went on: “This Fashion Pact is about saying: We have acknowledged the 21st century’s environmental issues, and we are taking our responsibility through collective action and common objectives.”"
"Singaporeans are spending less on clothes and shoes compared with five years ago, a government survey has found.

The latest Household Expenditure Survey, based on data collected in 2017 and last year, found that the average household spent about $120 a month on clothing and footwear, down from about $160 in the 2012/2013 poll.

""Notably, clothing and footwear experienced the largest decline in expenditure in percentage terms,"" said a report on the survey, which is conducted every five years by the Department of Statistics.

In comparison, expenditure on accommodation services, food and health increased.

But retail experts say the reduced expenditure on fashion does not necessarily mean people are shopping less. Instead, the availability of more affordable options for shoppers these days makes it easier to spend less.

Dr Kapil R. Tuli, 43, points to the advent of fast fashion and online shopping as big factors.

""In the last 10 years, there have been a lot more fast-fashion options for consumers - brands such as Zara and Uniqlo offer pretty good designs at low prices,"" says the professor of marketing and director at the Singapore Management University's Retail Centre of Excellence.

More online companies are also offering attractive discounts and better return policies that entice customers, he says.

""These companies are very well-funded in terms of seed funding, so they don't think twice about offering very good deals to customers.""

The shift towards online shopping was reflected in the survey findings too, with more households performing transactions online. About 60 per cent of households reported online purchases in 2017/18, up from 31 per cent in 2012/13.

The survey also noted that while average monthly household expenditure on clothing and footwear fell, online spending on these items increased from 4.4 per cent in 2012/13 to 7.7 per cent in 2017/18 - making up a larger share of overall clothing and footwear purchases.

Ms Ho Semun, chief executive officer of the Textile and Fashion Federation, says new business models such as clothes rental and sale of pre-loved items could also be a factor behind the overall decline in spending on clothing and footwear.

She observed that, lately, more consumers prefer to shop from sales and outlet stores.

""Even if a consumer shops the same amount, their spending today could be lower than it was then,"" she adds.

Housewife Angela Chua, 41, said her expenditure on clothing ""has definitely gone down"". She stopped frequenting physical stores in recent years, preferring to shop online instead.

""The selection online is much bigger than in shops and is more affordable,"" says Mrs Chua, who spends mostly on her two sons.

""Unless there are very good sales in stores - which is rare - the discounts are not comparable with what I can get online.""

For Ms Rebecca Morais, a change in priorities helped her cut back on spending.

The 25-year-old public relations consultant switched from buying branded items to wallet-friendly alternatives, so she could spend on things like travel.

""I realised I was not using the items I'd purchased - they were just accumulating. So I've started to think twice before I purchase anything,"" says Ms Morais.

""I've also realised that as I'm getting older, I value experiences over material goods. I'm in a long-distance relationship, which means all my savings go towards my trips.""

Dr Tuli believes that shoppers are becoming more savvy at identifying deals, thanks largely to smartphones and comparison shopping tools. These have made it easier for consumers to pick and choose, even across countries.

He adds: ""We don't have the data on volume - my take is that it's not that people are not shopping anymore, but rather they are being more rational in their shopping. People are always looking for value.""

"Despite losing a portion of its share of voice in the last two months of 2018, Debenhams maintained market dominance in terms of online opportunity

Driven, in part, by a near-unbeatable Google UK presence for womenswear and menswear-related searches, Debenhams.co.uk has managed to defend its position as the most popular website in Google UK for fashion retail over the Christmas period.

A report from search marketing specialists at Pi Datametrics revealed no new entries in the top five websites in the UK marketplace, with Debenhams sitting smart above long-time runner-up Next.

The analysis, which sets out to create a ‘leaderboard’ of search-strong brands, looks at more than 14,000 of the most popular queries relating to fashion (such as ‘black dress’ and ‘men’s jumper’), as well as the Google positions of some 40,000+ returning websites within the search engine’s index to provide a definitive list of the websites consistently featuring in Google positions that typically attract more clicks from its searchers.

PrettyLittleThing fell two positions to settle in fifth by close of Q4, though its vacated spot was adopted by parent brand Boohoo. Womenswear brand Missguided.co.uk improved by one rank on the previous quarter to slot in at fourth overall.

Narrowly missing out of the top 10 were retailers houseoffraser.co.uk (11th) and marksandspencer.com (12th).

eBay saw the largest loss, falling from 12th to 16th overall. This dip in the last few weeks of the year is an annual trend for the world’s online marketplace, though it is gradually fading from the forefront of shoppers’ minds – and from Google’s most clicked positions – as it struggles to remain relevant.

Close rival Amazon took 9th position at close of Q4 and received healthy search interest right up until the final week of December. Its fast delivery options and ever-growing range of new, on-trend clothing from brands typically sought for Christmas gifting makes Amazon an increasingly attractive option for clothes shoppers – and eBay comparatively less fashionable.

Debenhams retaining the strongest position in Google UK may come as a surprise to those aware of the recent management shake-up that came after its shares slumped 15pc in January, following a slide in sales in a period across the festive season.

But as Louise Linehan from Pi Datametrics explains, Debenhams’ online assets will become increasingly important to the retailer in light of the news: “While times have been turbulent for Debenhams, the fashion retailer can remain confident that, for 14,000 of the most valuable product searches, it is the most visible player in the industry; an industry which is made up of 40,000 competitors.

The value of its online assets will become increasingly important, not just in light of recent news, but as more consumers and new audiences move online.

The next step for any retailer performing strongly in search should be to hone in on quick wins; for example, delving into the most valuable subcategories (i.e. Womenswer) and niches (i.e. Animal print) to find products which, with a slight push, could move into the conversion zone on page one of Google.”

UK fashion websites leaderboard: share of voice in Google:"
"There will always be a place, says Crawford, for avant-garde, envelope-pushing designers who become known for throwing out the rule book, but the vast amount of fashion and clothing is designed in a much more methodical way by looking at range plans and market forecasts. “AI can really help those processes,” he says.

“It’s interesting to consider how the designers of the future will integrate the poetry of fashion and its emotional element with big data and algorithms,” says Jenny Underwood, associate dean of fashion, textiles and technology at RMIT. “We’re in a period of great transformation.”

Designers are going to have to work on their digital literacy. — Jenny Underwood, RMIT

She predicts a shift from the old model, which centres the designer as the great ego around whom everyone less important revolves, towards a more collaborative, cross-disciplinary future.

“In the past, we tended to look at the designer as a single entity, working on the body, sketching, draping materials; the other aspects of the design process flowed from that,” says Underwood. “Now I suspect it’s going to be more team-oriented. Designers will have to learn to talk to engineers and statisticians. They’re going to have to work on their digital literacy.”

Rahul Mooray studied engineering: “Initially aerospace then mechanotronics, which is more about coding and control systems.” On graduating, he ran a small fashion business manufacturing leather accessories in Italy. “It was fun but I missed technology,” he says.

He now works for Australian start-up Citizen Wolf, which makes bespoke T-shirts on demand. The big idea? To use tech to solve one of clothes shopping’s greatest pain points: fit, and to introduce mass personalisation online. The company works on a one-piece production system, laser-cutting the shirts, one at a time, as the orders flow in, and sewing them on site in its Sydney workshop. Mooray built its Magic Fit algorithm.

“We call it magic,” says co-founder Zoltan Csaki, “but really it’s maths.”

“Citizen Wolf began by measuring people in-store, so that’s the experience we work from,” says Mooray. “They literally did thousands of fittings. Every time we receive a new piece of information, the system gets smarter. An algorithm is a formula that takes a set of inputs, runs them through a processor and gives you an output. Basically, it’s a set of rules. Machine learning is the algorithm correcting itself as it learns more.”

Angela Ahrendts in 2012, when she was CEO of Burberry and helped the brand become a leader in the digital luxury space. AP

“Algorithms are changing the game,” says Crawford, who was Burberry’s vice-president of IT strategy for seven years while Angela Ahrendts was chief executive and the company was the undisputed digital leader in the luxury space. Burberry was first to live-stream its fashion shows (from 2007). It introduced e-commerce in 2004, and was offering digital customisation of its famous trench coat by 2011 – eight years before Business of Fashion named personalisation and on-demand production as key trends shaping the global industry.

Ahrendts went on to be a vice-president at Apple for five years before leaving in April. Crawford now consults to brands such as MatchesFashion and Jaeger on the AI opportunities for retail. He and Ahrendts both left Burberry in 2014.

“Burberry was rare,” says Crawford. “All of us who worked there during that period recognised how far ahead we were.”

In general, Crawford notes, fashion has been slow to adopt tech – the first e-commerce transaction took place in 1993, but it’s only in the past five years that online shopping has become the norm.

“Tell that to a heritage retailer and they might say, ‘My flagship store is 100 years old. If e-commerce is only 25 and still only accounts for 10 per cent of my revenue, why do I have to look at it differently?’ ” says Crawford.

The answer, of course, is Amazon. And Google. And all the competitors who have already figured out that websites are the new flagship stores.

“In 2019, machine learning, artificial intelligence, gaming, cinematography and traditional fashion technology [such as CAD pattern-making software] are converging,” says Crawford. “This is inspiring new business models, particularly around on-demand production, mass customisation and styling services. Big data is the foundation of it all.”

We know what product is going in and out of the store; now we have the capability to know more of what’s happening in the rest of your life. — Craig Crawford, tech expert

Amazon is promising that Alexa “can help you look your best”. Just ask her to take a photo using the Echo Look hands-free camera, then use the Style Check function to get a second opinion from a virtual fashion editor. The app uses algorithms to decide which outfits work best according to fit, colour, styling and current trends, but this is more than just a fun way to take a selfie.

Amazon is collecting data on what people are wearing – “Not just what they buy, send back, add to cart but don’t buy, or buy and return, but what they’re actually wearing at home,” says Crawford. “It’s the next phase. We know what product is going in and out of the store; now we have the capability to know more of what’s happening in the rest of your life.”

Creepy? Crawford thinks not. “It’s fantastic, because it opens up personalised curation on a massive scale. Imagine taking 10 years’ worth of the fashion and interiors magazines you love, and years of recipes by your favourite cooking columnist, and a picture of you in your favourite outfit in your kitchen with something you’ve cooked, and putting that into a machine-learning system.

I love fashion, but the current system doesn’t work too well. I think that the opportunity to fix it lies with tech. — Craig Crawford, tech expert

""When we know that much about what you like and how you live, we can cut through the noise to surprise you with things that have a real propensity to interest you.

“I’ve worked in this industry so long and seen so many ways it can be improved,” he says. “I love fashion, but the current system doesn’t work too well. I think that the opportunity to fix it lies with tech. Wouldn’t it be great if every store worked seamlessly for its customers? If we produced on demand to eliminate waste? If we could track a product throughout its life cycle? These things are all possible. The idea that machines are going to take over is just scaremongering.

“Now, I’m not a practising Buddhist by any stretch of the imagination,” says Crawford, “but Buddha says two things drive humans: fear or love. What I tell brands is, stop being afraid and move to the love space.”"
"Food and beverage retailers remain the single strongest driver of leasing enquiry in shopping malls, although their influence has moderated in the last six months, according to an industry survey.

The latest survey of centre managers across 88 JLL-managed malls covers mostly neighbourhood and sub-regional centres and was undertaken in August

It found 52 per cent of centre managers reported that enquiry levels from the F & B sector remained the same or stronger than the previous survey, six months earlier.

Foot traffic in sub-regional malls has slowed by 0.7 per cent, according to a JLL report.

""It is worth noting that the proportion has softened from previous surveys though, down from 66 per cent in December 2017 and June 2017,"" said JLL's director of retail research, Andrew Quillfeldt.

​The findings come amid warnings that a bubble is building in the booming food and beverage sector as more mall landlords turn to cafes, restaurants and the latest eating trends to fill the gap created by the collapse of fashion brands."

"MILAN (AP) — The opening shows of Milan Fashion Week on Friday evening underscored a world in transition.

Ermenegildo Zegna invited guests to an abandoned and gutted former steelworks on the outskirts of Milan that symbolizes both the region’s deindustrialization but also offers the prospects for rebirth as the site of a major redevelopment plan.

In a green oasis in the heart of the city, Stella McCartney offered a literary and activist view on fashion, and the world, as she touted her message of sustainability.

Some highlights:

ZEGNA REUSING THE PAST

Alessandro Santori bookended the collection for Ermenegildo Zegna XXX with two suits that encapsulated its disciplined yet otherworldly spirit: The opening single-button light suit had fading block print, the color of a light cappuccino stain, while its closing purple twin had a sheen that seemed to capture a rainbow.

Models walked down a dark gravel runway under the metal roof of the disused steel plant in sturdy boots. But there was nothing workmanlike about the looks, which were calculated casual. Ties hung untied inside tailored suits, suede blousons were worn with elegant striped trouser and short-sleeve leather jackets featured architectural pockets.

Textiles, some created from fabric cuttings or developed from recycled plastics, were reworked for a wrinkle effect on tailored trousers and suits, while prints had a hazy, shadowy effect, like looking through a rain-battered window or at an enlarged negative.

Flat caps were worn jauntily backwards, and eyewear offered colorful contrasts. Bags included cross-body sunglass cases and leather bound journals for the traveler, and more substantial satchels.

The colors — basic cream, gray and lavender with offsets of icy green and peacock blue — played gorgeously against the stormy sky.

STELLA MCCARTNEY’S ACTIVISM

A band marched into Stella McCartney’s garden party playing joyfully, and McCartney paused in conversation, observing with delight: “We’re listening to Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da, which my Dad wrote.”

McCartney’s men’s and women’s collection celebrated the Beatles, it celebrated literature through a collaboration with Jonathan Safran Foer, and as all her collections, it celebrated sustainability.

“It’s 60 percent sustainable, the collection, which is really hard to achieve,” the designer said. That includes organic cotton, sustainable viscose, a regenerated nylon called ECONYL and recycled polyester.

For men, she had T-shirts inspired by “Yellow Submarine” and another poking fun at herself: “Eco Weirdo.” The womenswear looks celebrate spring with ruffle and floral dresses. And the Safron Foer collaboration yielded inscriptions on garments, such as, “Be leaving, believing, be living,” and “We are entirely free to live differently,” inspired by his book, “We are the Weather,” a call to action on climate change.

The rest of the luxury fashion world has been scrambling to catch up with McCartney, whose label was founded with sustainability as a core belief, stemming from her childhood growing up a vegetarian on an organic farm and what she called “her animal awareness, and not wanting to kill animals.”

“That’s really the next conversation, and it’s a harder conversation to have,” McCartney said.

Her mantra is to make it fun, and to embrace all positive change in the fashion industry.

“For me I feel like we are activist, Stella McCartney as a house. And we embrace change … We want it to be positive and uplifting and we want to provide solutions,” she said. “We don’t want anyone to freak out. We don’t want to preach. We want to celebrate life and make the world a little bit of a better place.”"

"Instagram, influencers and aspiration: What impact is Instagram having on Australian fashion?

Instagram has become a Rorschach test for the Australian fashion industry; some people see a community of likeminded tastemakers, others a torture device of unattainably taut bodies in sun dresses.

For emerging designers, it can be both — and lucratively so.

A new generation of small-scale Australian brands have emerged from the social media platform, deftly managing this blend of inspiration and aspiration.

Through largely Instagram-only marketing and online-only retail, these companies — sometimes a team of one — eschew department stores and the pricey go-betweens of traditional retail.

Stavroula Adameitis, who works under the name Frida Las Vegas, makes 1980s-influenced art and fashion with a strong dose of Ken Done Australiana.

Share Frida Las Vegas makes art and fashion inspired by the 1980s.

Treating Instagram as a ""pocket art gallery"" of sorts, she has benefited from the close relationship with her customers that social media allows.

It's also a rejection of the typical path.

Retail shops have become ""over-commercialised by the Westfields of the world"", Ms Adameitis said, and most are unaffordable for a small business.

The internet, on the other hand, is free and offers endless space.

But endless space can become flat space, and social media-driven brands face criticism that they're imposing cookie cutter sameness on Australian fashion.

And as Instagram becomes more driven by e-commerce, how sustainable is three to five posts a day as an indie launch pad?

The 'Australian look'

Ms Adameitis doesn't believe Australian fashion, or Australian Instagram fashion, has only one look.

""As a general observation, there are two design camps that characterise Australian fashion: the 'white, lacy, floaty race-day summer dress' aesthetic and everything else,"" she said.

You can find any style you like on Instagram, but there is certainly a common character — perhaps best described as 'young woman on endless vacation'.

Danielle Mulham lives some of that dream. From Bali, she works on her brand Posse, which she started in 2016.

The beachy look of Posse is in dialogue with some of the app's most popular ""influencers"" — a social media-age entity, most often a 20-something slim white woman with enough social media followers to move product if she's seen wearing it — who Ms Mulham sometimes sends clothes.

Karen De Perthuis, a fashion scholar at Western Sydney University, said Instagram fashion tends to be unrooted in one location. And that goes for influencers too.

""There's this global, aspirational lifestyle: healthy breakfast, sitting on a verandah, on the beach, on a cliff, on a balcony, on the top of a building,"" she said. ""Aspirational but approachable.""

The brand Spell & The Gypsy Collective has been on Instagram since its launch, and today also works with influencers.

Share Instagram has added ""tap and shop"" tools to its platform.

Elizabeth Abegg and her sister Isabella started their line in Byron Bay around 2008, and Ms Abegg said customers can now ""sniff out"" when someone has been paid to wear something.

Instead, like Posse, she said they prefer a collaborative approach, where an influencer might take over their Instagram account during a festival.

Ms Abegg suggested Australian fashion Instagram has a warm weather aesthetic — Spell, in particular, lends itself to what she called the ""vacation trail"" — but she questioned its real difference from, say, a California brand.

""These days brands, bloggers, campaign shoots are so international anyway, they shoot all over the world and don't seem to have borders or seasons,"" she said.

The Instagram effect

So why does Instagram work so well for fashion? Possibly because it shortens the path between inspiration, desire and purchase.

In the past, an advertisement might make you think about a product, but you'd still need to track it down and pass your cash over the counter, Jason Pallant, a marketing lecturer at Swinburne University, explained.

Instagram is advertising on endless scroll, and brands can now use its shopping tools, which allow users to tap a photo and bring up click-through buttons, for almost immediate gratification.

The size of the Instagram-driven fashion market is difficult to evaluate.

A 2018 PayPal survey indicated in the last six months, 19 per cent of Australian respondents had purchased something via social media. Of those, only 25 per cent of those people had done it through Instagram.

Instagram-commissioned research in 2017 suggested that of 1,117 Australian Instagram users, 53 per cent of those aged 18 to 34 had bought a product based on what they'd seen on the app.

But while it's growing, online shopping is still dwarfed by traditional bricks and mortar retail.

""For small start-up brands … that could be enough, but I think it puts a limit on the amount that you can actually grow,"" Dr Pallant said.

He pointed out more established sportswear and luxury brands are also popular on social media, and have more money to pay for sponsored posts and professional photography.

External Link: A Spell Instagram post

""[Instagram] is a good way to start, but how do you … keep those people engaged so you don't get lost in all the other brands that are using the same platforms?"" Dr Pallant asked.

Instagram-driven fashion brands may ultimately be unsustainable because they have no real control over the app they rely on, suggested Valérie Moatti, Lectra fashion and technology chair at ESCP Europe.

""It's also very valuable for Instagram to get all this data on the brands,"" she said, pointing to the example of Amazon, which has been accused of creating its own versions of popular goods sold on its e-commerce platform.

""I know some companies and brands start to be more cautious in their use of Instagram,"" she said.

Group industry director for Facebook Australia Naomi Shepherd said the company's priority is to continue developing tools that support the growth of businesses on Instagram.

""The recent addition of Shopping in Instagram Stories is an example of how we create tools based on both the needs of businesses and feedback from our community,"" she said.

For the moment, Spell's Ms Abegg said the app gives people the chance to create their own brands without significant financial backing, huge marketing budgets or even an established inventory.

""Right now, hand in hand with Facebook, [Instagram] is everything,"" she said.

But she understands from a business perspective, ""relying too heavily on Instagram, or any one platform, is risky"".

'Wizard Of Oz behind-the-curtain schtick'

It's certainly true that brands must play by Instagram's rules to win.

Changes to its algorithm, for example, such as the move away from a purely chronological feed, can throw a spanner in the works.

""Ultimately, I'd like to see more top-down transparency from Instagram HQ [about its algorithm], rather than its current Wizard Of Oz behind-the-curtain schtick,"" Ms Adameitis said.

""Deep down I am ultimately distrustful of a platform that changes the rules at the drop of a hat with zero input from its stakeholders — aka, the people who actually use the platform, generate content and maintain its sky-high engagement levels.""

Spell is also exploring paid digital advertising, and Posse's Ms Mulham sees direct email marketing as an important alternative.

""You've always got to be prepared if Instagram does go away,"" she said. ""Keeping your audience tight and close to you."""
"When it comes to the skin-care industry, green is definitely gold.

With new natural brands popping up, seemingly daily, and more mainstream companies introducing additional “clean” products into their lineups — eschewing ingredients such as sulfates, parabens, formaldehydes, phthalates and more — the shift is prompting some retailers like Sephora to carve out shelf space in their stores (both bricks-and-mortar and online) dedicated to the growing green movement.

In fact, the organic beauty industry is reportedly projected to reach US$25.11 billion in sales by 2025. That’s some serious plant power.

According to Mathilde Thomas, co-founder of the French beauty brand Caudalie, the driving force behind the growth in the natural beauty industry is all thanks to an increase in consumer consciousness surrounding natural skin-care ingredients and benefits.

“Consumers are more informed than ever and looking at brands to make informed decisions from a 360-degree perspective,” Thomas explains. “While the ingredients in the products are taking centre stage, consumers are also looking at everything from a brand’s facilities down to the packaging and its environmental impact.”

That increased interest in what goes into a product is prompting brands to be more transparent about their tinctures, from production to packaging.

“Sustainability and brand transparency has become important in every consumer-goods category and beauty is no different,” Tayler Mariles, founder of the Vancouver-based natural beauty company Midnight Paloma, says. “Understanding what you’re putting on your face and body is just as important as knowing where the food you are feeding your family is coming from.

“Is the brand Canadian? Do they care about the people using it? Where are the ingredients sourced? All of these things are much more ‘on the radar’ now then they used to be.”

As more information about product ingredients enter the beauty-sphere, consumers are faced with the opportunity to better inform themselves on elixirs than ever before.

“People are incredibly savvy when it comes to product ingredients these days, especially in Vancouver,” Mariles says. “No one even knew what paraben was five years ago, and now you’ll get people asking if there is synthetic fragrance and chemical preservatives in our formulas.

“Customers are very educated.”

If you’re unsure of how to get started on your own ingredient education Mariles says going online is a great place to start.

“The internet is an amazing tool for this, but you definitely need to watch what you read,” she says. “There is a lot of good information but there is also a lot of fluff. I like to take a look at what is banned in the (European Union). They are usually a little bit ahead of us in terms of ingredient testing, so knowing what they are watching out for is a great way to stay on top of it.”

And be aware that, as the industry continues to change with awareness, so too will the list of “bad” ingredients.

“There will always be a new ‘dangerous ingredient’,” Mariles says. “Before getting too worried, I like to research and see what is actually going on to assess the risk.

“There are always going to be products that aren’t natural and that’s fine. Not all preservatives are bad necessarily. But when there are serious carcinogens in products that’s when these companies need to ask themselves: ‘Who is benefiting, and why?’ If you wouldn’t use a product on your own child, why would you market it to the masses? With the knowledge we have now there really are no excuses for formulating things with cleaner ingredients in mind.”

According to Mariles, one of the most common questions she faces in regard to her product lineup — ingredient inquiries aside — is how consumers can make the shift from traditional beauty products to a more “clean-beauty” routine.

“People want to make the right choices but they don’t know where to start, and they certainly don’t want to spend a fortune changing over,” she says. “It can be an overwhelming process at the beginning, but slowly adding good clean options is easy now. There are tons of options in everyone’s budget.”

To get started on the greening process of your own skin-care routine, she recommends starting with the few products that you use everyday — your personal skin-care MVPs (most valuable products of course) — rather than the more novelty creams, oils and other assorted tinctures.

“Get some good clean replacements and go from there,” Mariles says.

Expanding one’s knowledge of the green-beauty movement, as well as further understanding the list of potentially harmful chemical ingredients lurking in self-care products, is important for more than just one’s piece of mind, though. According to Thomas, an increased level of awareness can also help safeguard against buying “greenwashed” products — or beauty and skin-care products that are purported to be “clean” but have buried chemical ingredients or production processes.

“It’s important for customers to do their own research and look critically into the ingredients that brands are using in their products,” Thomas says. ” ‘Natural’ to one brand may mean something completely different to another. In fact, there is no one definition of natural.”

At Caudalie, which promotes the use and benefit of products featuring antioxidant-rich grape seed sourced from their family’s vineyard in Bordeaux, France, Thomas says there’s an emphasis on avoiding ingredients that have been linked to health-care concerns.

“As a brand, we frown upon including ingredients that are endocrine disrupters, that can be irritating or that are bad for the environment and use the smallest proportion of preservatives as possible and are committed to avoiding certain controversial and artificial ingredients,” Thomas explains. That emphasis on a more sustainable product also extends to the production.

“It’s important to me that everything from our facilities — to the product, packaging and formulation — leave as little negative environmental impact as possible,” Thomas says. “I’m also especially proud that Caudalie is an active member of 1% for the Planet, which is an organization that works to protect the environment. We’re proud of the fact that at the end of 2018, we planted more than four million trees globally and have plans to plant more than eight million in eight countries by 2021.”

As the green movement continues to gain momentum, shoppers can expect to discover more resources for information, increased transparency and even more “clean” beauty brands on offer — and, as it has been for the past five years, the push will come from consumer demand.

“The more educated people are, the more demand there will be for sustainable, healthy products,” Mariles says. “It’s like everything in our lives now, the more we know, the better we can change our lifestyles … Transparency is going to be more important than ever moving forward.”

It's a reality series for up-and-coming fashion designers, with weekly challenges that might involve anything from making elegant red-carpet-worthy dresses, to making outfits from material you might find in a camp site. The reason I love it is the sheer practicality of it all. Each week they make something from scratch, sketch an idea, cut some fabric, fit a model, present a runway look. I'm constantly astounded by the sheer talent of these people, their inspirations and stories and ideas, their finished pieces. And I have no idea why. Fashion is not my thing. My best needlework comes with buttons and the odd sock I choose to darn. The only thing I can remember making in textiles at school was a huge flag I could take to the football. But I turn to Project Runway every season, and it's been on air since 2005. But here's my problem. This season, season 17, I find myself just a little irritated by it, for reasons which have nothing to do with the clothes. Season 17, now showing on Foxtel, was billed as the season of diversity. The designers include a Syrian refugee, a gay man who had to flee India with his lover, a mother of nine kids, young, old, people of colour, of all sexualities. The models are diverse. Different sizes, shapes, races and even gender, with Mimi the first trans woman to hit the catwalk on the show. But what has irritated me is the attitude of some of the contestants when it comes to embracing this diversity. Don't get me wrong, they all rush to Mimi, with her cheekbones you could slice a tomato on, slim hips and broad shoulders. But there's two ""curvy"" models in the line-up who lose out every week. Kate and Asia are gorgeous, tall, voluptuous, women. They're branded with tags, even from the judges, such as ""healthy"", ""plus-size"", ""curvy"", ""full-figured"", someone even called them ""real women"", and I wondered what that meant for the rest of the models. Kate was continually dressed in horrible outfits because the contestants admitted they didn't know how to dress ""plus-size"" women. The average Australian woman is 164cm and weighs 68kg. She wears a size 14-16, with a 14D bra size. New research suggests the average size of an American woman is now between a 16-18. As much as the fashion industry purports to cater for real women, for the best part it doesn't. There was one challenge in season 17 where they had to dress actual women, women who worked as teachers, police, paramedics, one woman drove a garbage truck. It was like some of the designers hadn't even thought that women such as these would be needing clothes at all. Everyone who's not built like a Victoria's Secret model knows how hard it is to go clothes shopping. We squeeze ourselves into things that might fit our tops but not our bottoms, pull up pants with tiny waists and too long legs, we try on bikinis that barely cover a nipple. If clothing - if fashion - is meant to make you feel better about yourself, sometimes the mere act of shopping is what defeats you first. Which is why it's always fabulous when you find clothes that work. Now work it.

"Award-winning designer partners with Prouds

Fiji’s award winning fashion designer – Robert Kennedy has teamed up with Prouds which will soon be carrying the popular fashion brand under the Robert Kennedy label in all its stores.

“We are so excited to share that we will be coming soon to Prouds stores Fiji-wide,” Kennedy revealed in an official video posted on his Facebook and Instagram page.

“Having entered into an exclusive retail partnership with Prouds, we will have a brand new collection of fashion, jewellery, accessories, homewares and giftware, which will be unveiled in May this year,” Mr Kennedy said.

“My new collection is named TUBU, which translates - to grow, increase, spring up and rise. It couldn’t be a more apt description as my label is reinvigorated with this new partnership.”

Mr Kennedy said he is very encouraged with the confidence shown by the team at Prouds for his “RKFJ” label and looks forward to extending his popular brand across the country.

“The partnership with Prouds which is Fiji’s premium retailer will ensure my lifestyle brand reaches out to my extremely loyal local customers and tourists alike,” Mr Kennedy said.

Founded in 2002, Robert Kennedy Design Fiji brings a fresh take on fashion, textiles, interiors, art, homewares and accessories inspired by the beautiful tropical islands of Fiji.

Based on Fiji’s beautiful coral coast in Sigatoka – Robert Kennedy rose to fame after winning the “Established Designer of the Year Award” and the “Resort Wear Designer of the Year Award” at Fiji Fashion Week in 2011 and has since won numerous other accolades over the years.

He has also shown his collections internationally at various international fashion weeks, festivals and events.

Prouds director Tejash Patel said he is very excited to partner with Robert Kennedy Designs as Prouds continues its commitment in offering the best international and local brands in its stores.

“The introduction of Robert Kennedy inspired lines into Prouds stores will add further value to our existing awardwinning local brands and we look forward to a great partnership with Robert,” Mr Patel said.

"Fashion month kicks off in September, when designers from around the world will showcase their spring collections in New York, London, Paris, and Milan.

The looks sent down the runway will predict next year’s trends; there will no doubt be bonkers sleeves, freed nipples, and blinding neon. But if protesters have their way, one more theme will be hot for spring 2020: dissent.

While designers put finishing touches on their pieces, global activist groups are also fine-tuning their fashion week plans. From Donald Trump to climate change, they feel they have a lot to demonstrate against right now, and this autumn editors and influencers will have to trudge through a die-in or sea of signs to find their front row seats.

As The Daily Beast reported last week, the final days of summer have turned into a mad scramble for those involved with planning New York Fashion Week’s location schedule.

After The Washington Post revealed that the billionaire Hudson Yards developer Stephen M. Ross planned to hold two fundraisers in the Hamptons that garnered a reported $12 million for Donald Trump’s re-election campaign, the designer Prabal Gurung pulled his runway show from The Vessel, an art installation on the property.

Dana Lorenz of the jewelry line Fallon also withdrew from the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) after learning that Ross’ wife, Kara, sat on its board.

In a fiery Business of Fashion op-ed, Out magazine editor-in-chief Phillip Picardi wrote that “New York Fashion Week Has a Donald Trump Problem.” A cultural center called The Shed, located near Hudson Yards, counts Ross as one of its board members. The Shed was the proposed future hub of NYFW, but after Picardi’s piece went live, Rag & Bone decided against holding its show there.

New York City Council Speaker Corey Johnson told The Daily Beast that Ross should jettison his friendship with Trump; both men are members of the Board of Directors of The Shed at Hudson Yards. Several designers also confirmed to The Daily Beast they would not be staging shows at The Shed.

Rumors are swirling behind-the-scenes regarding what labels may plan to present at The Shed. Currently, no designers have spoken in favor of using the location, though a source at The Shed last week confirmed that “a lot of shows” were on the books. (They did not elaborate on how many shows were planned or which brands were scheduled.)

That means activists will have to wait to know just who, exactly, they will have to protest come NYFW’s September 6 kick-off.

“ I would hope New York, the epicenter of fashion, would be able to take a stand against the Trump administration. ”

When asked if he would attend any Hudson Yards shows, Picardi responded immediately with, “Absolutely the fuck not. You can quote me, directly, word for word on that. The fashion industry benefits from smoke and mirrors, the curtain of luxury and mystique. [With Stephen Ross], the curtain has been pulled back.”

“Ultimately, the fashion industry has a really tough decision to make of whether or no they want to declare their values for publicity’s sake, or they want to live their values,” Picardi went on. “I would hope New York, the epicenter of fashion, would be able to take a stand against the Trump administration.”

Until 2010, Fashion Week events centered around Bryant Park, making it easy for attendees to hop from show to show. But with runways all over the city, Picardi admitted that things can feel “disjointed,” and he understands “the ease” that Hudson Yards could offer as an official home.

“ So many of our editors who are queer, women, or people of color would rather pay for an extra Uber ride than feel complicit in the industry’s participation with a billionaire who supports Donald Trump. ”

“But ultimately, at the end of the day, there are plenty of spaces in New York that we can go to,” Picardi said. “So many of our editors who are queer, women, or people of color would rather pay for an extra Uber ride than feel complicit in the industry’s participation with a billionaire who supports Donald Trump. It may be inconvenient, but welcome to how so many people feel under this administration.”

Though Picardi will skip The Shed this fall and encourages others to as well, he draws the line at an outright boycott. “The thing about our industry is that people can lose their jobs for not attending shows,” he said. “I can’t expect my friends who are fashion directors to miss anything. This is people’s livelihoods we’re talking about.”

Once they survive New York, plenty of those section editors will head across the pond to London, where they will face more protests. Earlier this month, the climate crisis advocacy group Extinction Rebellion called on the British Fashion Council to cancel all shows.

In a responding statement, the BFC’s CEO Caroline Rush declined to go that far, but agreed to meet with Extinction Rebellion activists to “share our plans.”

“We are facing a climate change emergency and all need to act,” Rush wrote, adding the BFC can “use the platform of London Fashion Week to communicate not just to the industry, but to a wider public, that not all businesses are equal, that those that support a better future, are committed to change, are those that should be supported.”

As a result, Extinction Rebellion will heavily protest the event with “disruptive actions” such as a funeral procession to “commemorate the loss of life due to climate and ecological breakdown.” The event will begin right outside 180 The Strand, London Fashion Week’s mainstage.

“ We don’t want to cancel fashion, but we are asking for a very high profile, very glamorous event that promotes excess to be cancelled while we convene to conceive what we are going to do about the climate crisis. ”

“We appreciate going forward, a friendly, amicable working relationship with the BFC and we respect them and know that they respect us and respect the issues,” Alice Wilby, coordinator and spokesperson for the Boycott Fashion Team, told The Daily Beast. “We don’t want to cancel fashion, but we are asking for a very high profile, very glamorous event that promotes excess to be cancelled while we convene to conceive what we are going to do about the climate crisis.”

This isn’t the first time Extinction Rebellion has crashed fashion week—protests popped up last season, too. But there is a symbolic significance to designers’ spring 2020 collections. Next year is the U.N.’s deadline for world leaders to accept the Paris deal.

“We are looking at this fashion week, which will be showing trends and collections for 2020, when it will already be too late to effect real change on the climate crisis,” Wilby said. “Why are we talking about clothes to wear when we don’t have a planet to wear them on? It’s quite intense when you think about it like that, but also very simple.”

Members of Extinction Rebellion were partly inspired to call for the abolition of London Fashion Week after the Swedish Fashion Council cancelled their Stockholm showing. (Copenhagen hosts its own, more popular fashion week.)

Activists in Paris and Milan have yet to speak out about any planned events, but both cities have seen a share of fashion week controversy in past seasons.

Back in January, the anti-government demonstrations by France's Gilets Jaunes, who frequently clashed with police, inspired designers like Dior and Thom Browne to reschedule their shows in an effort to skirt disruption.

“ Why are we talking about clothes to wear when we don’t have a planet to wear them on? ” — Alice Wilby

Though Hong Kong is not part of the official, “Big Four” calendar, Chanel plans to hold its Cruise presentation in November at the city’s Kai Tak Terminal. But given the months-long political and social disturbances, a representative for the brand told WWD they are “keeping a close watch on events,” and may pull out.

The French couture line is not the only label with a commitment in the city; according to Hong Kong’s Tatler, over a thousand are expected to attend the Centrestage trade fashion show. On Sept. 4, the opening gala will include collections from Anaïs Jourden and Altuzarra. (A PR for Anaïs Jourden would not comment on the matter to The Daily Beast; representatives from Altuzarra did not respond to multiple inquiries.)

Brendon Hong, a Daily Beast contributor based in Hong Kong, said in an email that a protest specifically targeting the fashion community would be unlikely. Still, the industry denizens who take part in Centrestage will visit a city in the midst of extreme unrest.

In Milan last February, PETA supporters dressed as “grim reapers,” toting fur coats to protest the industry's use of the material. The organization may be infamous for its protests, but senior vice president Dan Mathews said that most of them occur in the winter, because fall collections tend to include more fur.

“Protests are less of a priority in September, because they’re showing spring clothes,” Mathews said. “There’s a lot more action in February.”

PETA has become friendly with most fashion designers, as more of the industry ditches fur. (There are still some notorious holdouts, like Dolce & Gabbana.) These days, Mathews serves more as a consultant to brands than a complainer.

“ I do miss it. It was fun. As delighted as I am to meet with brands, I do miss the Milan jail. The cops are very sweet. ”

“We disrupted shows for Michael Kors, Donna Karan, Versace, and Armani, which resulted in them meeting with us and dropping fur,” Mathews explained. “Before doing that, I sent letters asking to meet and discuss, and they simply had no time for us. Through disrupting, we became an important part of their agenda, because they didn’t want their shows to be hijacked.”

Mathews looks back fondly on his time agitating. “I do miss it,” he laughed. “It was fun. As delighted as I am to meet with brands, I do miss the Milan jail. The cops are very sweet.”

“The jails in Paris are so lovely in the spring,” he added."

"This week the art and fashion glitterati will breeze into South Florida for the annual ritual known as Miami Art Basel, filling their Rimowa suitcases with the latest resort wear from Gucci, Johanna Ortiz and Eres.

The fair has become a multi-million-dollar boon for the area, driving the creation of glitzy global outposts, including the Design District (where stores like Loewe, Fendi and Christian Dior operate) and Brickell City Centre (Orlebar Brown, Giuseppe Zanotti and Kiton).

And it has also spurred an evolution in the city’s homegrown aesthetic.

The Miami look has matured, moving beyond (but not abandoning) its night-life-centric platforms, minidresses and tight black tees, as well as its Versace-fied penchant for exuberant flair. The emergent style is casual-luxe and reflective of the multitextured local cultural blend. It is exemplified by Erika and Roma Cohen, who run Alchemist, a local retail outfit turned independent label."
"COMMENT:

Spend less by giving zero-waste gifts this Christmas. Just be wary of products marketed at this niche that are unnecessarily expensive.

Even if only one or two presents are replaced with something of less impact on the planet, or by agreement, no present at all, you deserve a pat on the back. Although the zero-waste journey involves buying less, if you do acquire items, they should be able to be composted or disposed of in other environmentally friendly ways when worn out.

Children often want a whole pile of plastic. For the youngest ones, there is home-made edible finger paint, play dough, art materials and other consumables. Wooden toys are sustainable and have a long life, meaning they can be passed on or sold online when you're done with them, or composted.

By mid-primary school, children start to appreciate an IOU note or gift voucher. IOU a trip to Rainbow's End, Auckland Zoo or whatever they're into. Even a gift voucher for the mall is better than giving them something they'll never use. They keep on giving because you get to experience the event with them.

If you must buy plastic then avoid single-use. Lego, and enduring toys such as PLAYMOBIL and Sylvanian Families, can be re-gifted or sold on to be used and reused by many children.

The Clement family tradition of second-hand presents has become cool. But I have to admit that while my children never distinguished between new and second-hand if they wanted the item, I feel cheap giving other people's children something that's not in its original package.

Parents of waste-inducing children should be talking to each other. I'm sure some would have no issue and may even welcome second-hand presents.

Re-gifting is another concept around giving that's increasingly socially acceptable. Wrap up the gift you received but didn't want and give it to someone who would actually appreciate it.

That means one less item bought this Christmas and less discarding.

Books and magazines are reasonably sustainable gifts. They're reusable, re-saleable, recyclable, donateable and compostable. Someone suggested to me that audio books for children are another option — except if you're buying them on CD in a plastic box. Electronic copies are better.

In the case of clothing, which many of us gift, the fabric matters. Hemp, pure wool and 100 per cent cotton clothing, for example, can be composted at the end of its life. No choice is ever perfect of course. The pesticides used for cotton production, for example, are problematic.

When I first embraced the zero-waste goal I had a brainwave to put together sustainable gift packs for friends' birthdays containing items such as metal straws and reusable shopping bags. It turned out to be a monumental fail.

As my knowledge and thought process improved I realised two things, A: I was giving people things they didn't necessarily need, and B: the ""eco"" bags I had bought in bulk were made of artificial fibres, which get out through our washing machines, find their way into the sea and ultimately the fish that people are eating.

If you have time, many zero-waste products can be made at home. You could make an eco bag from an old T-shirt. Many websites and YouTube videos offer instructions.

If you don't have time, a huge cottage industry of zero-waste products has sprung up selling things like eco laundry detergent in jars to metal bento boxes for lunches.

Even the most natural eco product is no good if it's not going to get used. Last year I bought a T-shirt from Mr Vintage's lucky dip bin. Great concept. But it turned out to be the only ugly one in the entire collection and I'm sure the recipient is never going to wear it. Maybe it can become a bag.

I'm forever committing crimes against zero waste, by accident or ill-thought-out actions such as the lucky dip present. The reflection on every fail, however, has led to improvements and another baby step towards reducing my impact on the planet."
"At six foot seven inches and about 215 pounds, Hamilton-based model Kyle Andrew had a tough time breaking into the fashion industry in his early 20s.

The standard sample sizes of clothing used at fashion shoots and shows were too small for his tall frame and, although he had an agent, he had to walk away from the business.

""I was in great shape at the time but I just didn't fit the clothing — sleeve lengths, all of that stuff — and I had no success,"" recalls the 39-year-old, who was born Kyle Andrew Skinner but goes by Kyle Andrew professionally.

These days Andrew's modelling career is thriving, though, as the men's fashion industry slowly catches up to the women's so-called curvy movement and embraces different body types through a wider spectrum of clothing and campaigns.

More agencies are representing larger-sized male models, including Toronto-based B&M Models, which represents Andrew under its XXL division.

Meanwhile, IMG Models now has a Brawn section, which has launched Zach Miko to plus-sized fashion fame, with 86,000 followers on Instagram, his own ""Big Things"" podcast and an advice column at Chubstr.com.

Then there's Wilhelmina's Titan division, which recently teamed up with JCPenney and basketball star Shaquille O'Neal on a model search for his XLG clothing collection.

Several other labels are creating a more broad range of men's clothing sizes, including ASOS and American Eagle, and using a more diverse slate of models for those campaigns and fashion shows.

...men are being encouraged to be much more aware of themselves, whether that's emotionally, physically, intellectually, and also about what they put out into the world. - Toronto designer Stacey Gonder

""More and more of it is cropping up and you can see a market emerging and building for men, slowing catching up to where size acceptance is for women,"" says Andrew, who is now about 260 pounds and details his industry experiences at 48long.com.

""It's exciting to watch obviously for professional reasons for myself, but just knowing the struggle of people with larger body types that want to also look good from a clothing point of view, that's exciting to see.""

Contestant on The Bachelorette Canada

Andrew signed with B&M's XXL division in fall 2016 after the agency noticed him as a contestant on The Bachelorette Canada. He is now also represented by other agencies in the U.S. and Europe, is the face of George Richards Big & Tall Menswear, and starred as a Viking in a Harlequin commercial.

""It's a growing trend, for sure,"" says Andrea Evans, B&M's agency director.

""We are starting to see clients request or more and more. But it's still nowhere near the curvy movement for women.""

'Plus-sized"" male model Kyle Andrew is photographed in Toronto on Tuesday, May 7, 2019. At six foot seven inches and about 215 pounds, Hamilton-based model Kyle Andrew had a tough time breaking into the fashion industry in his early 20s. (Chris Young/Canadian Press) Evans says they don't refer to their male models as plus-sized.

""It's usually 'big and tall' or 'double-XL' or 'brawn,""' she says. ""Retailers and designers started those key words. We never speak of weight. It's all based on measurements.""

Andrew says ""big and tall"" in the male modelling world typically means over six foot three and starting at size 38 waist.

But it encompasses ""many more body types — size, shape, athletic ability,"" he adds, predicting ""extended size"" will become a widely used term, which he prefers.

Evans chalks up the trend partly to a growing number of men becoming interested in fashion because they see it more on social media.

""It's more available to them and they can buy it online, they don't have to go into the store, the experience doesn't have to be as overwhelming as it has been typically for them,"" says Evans.

Fashion world not accessible to people outside 'normal-sized ranges'

Men's fashion is also becoming ""more representative of the population, she adds.

Andrew notes manufacturing technology is getting increasingly sophisticated and better able to create a wider range of sizes for a cheaper cost.

Toronto photographer Anthony Manieri, who promotes positive body image for men through his ""Arrested Movement"" portrait series, hopes the trend signals that more men are opening up about this subject matter.

""When body positivity is discussed, it's usually always around women, and I believe rightfully so because they get the brunt of it,"" says Manieri, whose series has appeared in Vogue Italia and features nude portraits of male subjects.

""I know men suffer from this as well, but they're more quiet about it (due to) toxic masculinity, where you have to be strong, you can't say anything, you shouldn't say anything.""

Toronto designer Stacey Gonder, who cast three so-called ""plus-sized"" male models in her recent fashion show at the city's Anime North, surmises that swirling conversations in the media about toxic masculinity and the .MeToo movement are contributing to the trend.

""In general men are being encouraged to be much more aware of themselves, whether that's emotionally, physically, intellectually, and also about what they put out into the world,"" says Gonder, who caters to a broad clientele under her brands Flash Design Co., and the House of Sass and Magic.

Andrew says he hasn't struggled with body image issues but he has faced the frustration of not fitting into clothing on the racks and not being able to express his love of fashion without customized outfits.

""The world of fashion just wasn't accessible to a person outside of those normal-sized ranges,"" he says.

""People that don't fit that very specific mould should be allowed to pursue high fashion too, and if not high fashion then good fashion, and if not just good fashion then quality fashion — just fashion, blanket statement."""
"Starbucks announced Wednesday it will pilot new greener to-go cups this year in Vancouver that will be both recyclable and compostable.

Vancouver will join New York, San Francisco, Seattle and London to trial different cup options that will be chosen from the NextGen Cup Challenge winners that were announced earlier this month.

""We know how important this issue is to Canadians,"" said Michael Conway, executive vice president and president of Starbucks Canada in a media release. ""We're committed to being a part of the solution. I'm excited and proud that our customers in Vancouver will be among the first to sip coffee from a greener to-go cup.""

In addition to the greener cups, the coffee company will roll out new recyclable strawless lids to stores across North America beginning in Toronto. Customers may have already seen strawless lids at select locations but the new lid has been redesigned to be more lightweight.

This new lid will have nine per cent less plastic than the current lid and straw. Straws will continue to be available to customers upon request.

Progress plans for both initiatives will be revealed at the company's annual shareholders meeting Wednesday.

Making recycling to-go cups a reality

Starbucks initiated the NextGen Consortium managed by Closed Loop Partners last spring to launch the NextGen Cup Challenge — a challenge to redesign the paper to-go cup to make packaging more environmentally sustainable.

The 12 winners of the challenge were chosen at the end of last month. One of the categories of the competition was to create innovative cup liners so that coffee to-go cups can in fact be compostable and recyclable.

""Directionally they're moving in the right spot. But it's easy to confuse consumers saying that this is good enough,"" Calvin Lakhan, a research scientist at York University said. ""There's still a lot more room to grow.""

Current coffee to-go cups are made with paper but are lined with polyethylene plastic or wax making them difficult to recycle in most jurisdictions.

Footprint is a sustainable packaging company in the U.S. and one of the 12 winners of the challenge. According to Starbucks who announced the winners on their website last month, Footprint ""creates cups, lids and straws that are fully-formed fiber based solutions, with an aqueous-based coating that is recyclable and compostable.""

In addition to Starbucks, Mcdonalds is also one of the lead partners of the consortium including the Coca Cola Company, Yum! Brands, Nestle and Wendy's as supporting partners. The challenge is part of the consortium's $10 million commitment to advance food packaging design.

Starbucks isn't the first company to announce changes to their cups in efforts to reduce its ecological footprint.

Tim Hortons announced last year that certain locations have begun piloting environmentally friendly lids that are also designed to prevent leaking.

Lakhan said companies and consumers should be looking at more reusable options. He suggests that instead of consumers buying a new cup every single day, they should bring a reusable cup.

Starbucks Canada currently offers customers a 10-cent discount to any customer who brings a reusable cup or tumbler to a company-owned store.

""If you can bring in your cups that's ten times better for the environment than buying something that has made a marginal change in its composition,"" Lakhan said. ""Reuse should always be what we're aiming for when it comes to sustainable coffee."""
"NEW YORK — Barneys New York is filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, the latest retailer to buckle as shoppers move online.

The iconic clothier founded almost a century ago will keep the doors open at its 10-story Madison Avenue store, but it has secured $75 million in financing to pay employees and vendors as it seeks a buyer.

Stores in Chicago, Las Vegas and Seattle will close along with 12 concept and warehouse locations.

Stores in Beverly Hills, California, San Francisco and in Boston will remain open, as well as two warehouse locations in New York and California. However, the company said Tuesday it's reviewing all store leases.

Barneys, controlled by New York hedge fund Perry Capital, listed more than $100 million in debt and more than $100 million in assets in its bankruptcy filing in the Southern District of New York.

The picture for most traditional retailers grows worse by the year.

The number of retail stores closed in the U.S. this year has already surpassed last year's total, according to Coresight Research, which expects 12,000 will be shuttered in 2019. Coresight said 7,567 retail stores have closed so far this year, compared with 5,864 in all of 2018.

The escalating trade war between China and the U.S. has intensified that pressure, leaving clothing companies scrambling to find new routes and suppliers. Over the past year, the retail sector has consistently bled jobs.

A strong economy has traditionally boosted luxury sales but like retailers across the spectrum, Barneys and other high-end stores have struggled to entice people through the door. They're seeing younger shoppers migrate online to sites like Net-a-Porter, which offers same-day delivery for luxury goods, or resale sites like The RealReal.com. Moreover, wealthy shoppers are going directly to luxury brands' online sites or shops.

Nordstrom has reported slowing sales. And Neiman Marcus Group, which also operates Bergdorf Goodman, posted a loss and a sales decline in its most recent quarter.

After 104 years, Lord & Taylor's flagship store on Fifth Avenue locked its doors in January and the property was sold to WeWork.

And with sales growing weaker, cost pressures have increased for retailers.

Barneys' Manhattan landlord doubled the rent at its flagship store on Madison Avenue to nearly $30 million this year.

""Like many in our industry, Barneys New York's financial position has been dramatically impacted by the challenging retail environment and rent structures that are excessively high relative to market demand,"" said CEO Daniella Vitale.

The weight of shifting consumer loyalties and rising costs is now threatening to fell Barneys, which energized its aisles by placing new and unheard of designers beside the well-established fashion houses.

Barneys' roots date back to 1923, when Barney Pressman pawned his wife's engagement ring and used the cash to open a 500-square-foot men's discount clothing store on Seventh Ave. and 17th St. in Manhattan.

His son shifted the company's focus to luxury clothing in the 1960s, and it began to expand nationwide in the 1990s.

The company's crown jewel, its Madison Avenue location, opened in 1993, two years before Amazon initiated operations as an online bookstore.

""Barneys is a viable brand,"" said Robert Burke, who runs a namesake retail and fashion consulting business in Manhattan. ""It has good recognition. There's certainly a future there. How big the footprint should be has yet to be decided.""

Joseph Aquino, who runs a real estate services firm under his name in Manhattan, says the days of the shop-till-you drop mentality on Madison Avenue popularized by the 1990s HBO series ""Sex in the City"" are over.

""She was 45 and now she is 65... She isn't shopping like she was 45,"" Aquino said. ""We are in the phase where a lot of younger shoppers don't want to go the high street. They sit around and buy online and that's what we are fighting against."""
"Avant garde fashion designer and founder of Luzol, Austin Aimankhu, believes in promoting Nigerian culture through clothes. He is also the founder of FashionArtFusion, FAF, an annual exhibition of contemporary Nigerian fashion. JOE AGBRO JR. met him and he talked about his journey to fashion, his passion for Nigerian fabrics and how the industry is changing.

BOHEMIAN, arty, and raw. Those words are likely to run across your mind upon meeting Austin Aimankhu. With his trademark afro hairstyle, rebellious beards, with sprinklings of grey, his arty side is at once visible. And his fashion style, ‘conservative’, as he describes it, is nonetheless catchy. This is not unexpected because he is one of Nigeria’s top fashion designers.

Though Aimankhu studied law at the University of Benin, his love was in the arts, he says, as we settle down at Freedom Park, an arts hub on Broad Street, Lagos. Many people must have thought he was crazy for dumping law for fashion but his heart was not in drafting legal documents, advocating or the boring life of an attorney.

“I never practiced law because law wasn’t really my thing,” he said. According to him, his parents thought the arts wasn’t worth pursuing.

“I read law to prove a point to my parents that my love for the arts, for acting and all. You know, the impression those days was that if you’re in the arts, you’re not bright or something. But for me, somewhere along the line, my interest for law waned and I discovered fashion.”

Upon finishing his studies, Aimankhu took to fashion, working as a manager for his friend, Kesse Jabari, a renowned Nigerian fashion designer in the 80s and 90s

“For me, having a degree is just to be able to find your way around things,” he said.

“You don’t have to necessarily practice what you read. An education just makes you to be able to hold your own anywhere you find yourself.”

When Jabari relocated to the US, Aimankhu felt it was time to set up his own shop. And LUZOL was birthed in 2003.

“I even bought machines from Kesse Jabari.”

Fast forward 16 years, he has become a household name in Nigeria’s couture space, carving a niche for himself by infusing art into fashion.

“I’ve always liked clothes, I’ve always liked to do things with clothes, I’ve always liked to see when I put something together, how it would look on people.”

In 2015, Aimankhu started an annual fashion exhibition, FashionArtFusion, marrying fashion and arts “to promote ‘Wear Nigeria’.” He also mandated all the designers on the runway to fuse local fabrics into their designs.

“I have deep interest for the Nigerian culture, so it drives me in these things I do,” he said.

“I’m interested in Nigerian dance, Nigerian art, everything Nigerian culture. It’s a tough call because you have to fund all these things yourself, you have to gradually get people to believe in it because we’re so westernised in our ways and thinking. It’s amazing that the white people appreciate what I do more.”

And with several exhibitions staged already, Aimankhu has come to dig more into Nigerian fabrics. In 2016, he partnered with the federal ministry of information and culture to promote ‘Wear Nigeria,’ targeted at promoting Nigerian fashion.

“I realised that (in) Nigeria, we have textile, we have fabrics, we have tie dye,” he said.

“Ghana is known for Kente and Kente is known all over the world. Kente has gone into print. It’s on weave. It’s on print. Yeah, we have Aso Oke. Who really knows Aso Oke? If you’re not in the southwest, you won’t know Aso Oke? If you go to Kogi State, you will see fabrics that would blow your mind. If you go to the middle belt, you will see fabrics. If you go to where I come from, Esan, Ogbu weave, Akwete, Akwocha, all of them in the east. Nobody knows them; only the indigenes that are in that environment. Those of them that were born in Lagos, they don’t even know that they have this fabric.”

Advocating the use of local fabrics for the ‘Wear Nigeria’ initiative, Aimankhu said, “if we must showcase our fashion, we must showcase it with our textile. Fashion is a complete package. It has to do with the sewing, the fabric, the creativity, the adornment that comes with it, the costumes, everything. So, if we must showcase it, showcase it with what you have. Fashion is our culture. If we must take our designs outside, let’s take our designs with our fabrics.”

He said it was one of the initiative’s aim to “empower the local producers of these textiles because it’s going into extinction gradually. The young ones don’t want to learn their father’s trade any more. They come to the cities and do other menial jobs. So, you find out that, if you see the weavers, they are mainly old people. The art is going.”

He also said that African fabrics are ‘very colourful’ and even European fashion is tilting towards them. But, some time ago, Aimankhu was noticeable on the Lagos arts circuit for always wearing whites.

“I wore white for nearly four years,” he said.

“It was a way of branding. I got into it. I loved it and I stayed there. And when I felt I should move out of it, I moved. In as much as I love my whites, it was tough not wearing because it was already part of me but also for the reason of what I do.

“People were reading meanings to the white. I wasn’t interested. I heard comments that I always wear whites. There must be something attached to it and because of my presence in the culture space and my work is also cultural, very African, people were attributing meanings to it.”

But two years ago, Aimankhu said he became more liberal with his colours after an encounter with the Ooni of Ife, Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi Ojaja II, as part of promoting the ‘Wear Nigeria’ campaign. Hence, in walking the talk, nowadays, Aimankhu has embraced fusing indigenous fabrics in his own clothes.

“A lot of my designs, I have to wear them. So, everything I wear, you’ll see a touch of different thigs Nigerian.”

In December 2018, Aimankhu launched a ready-to-wear line, Lzee, for males and females.

And though Aimankhu still works more with western fabrics for his expatriate clients, he says, “I try to fuse because it could be too heavy to just say, everything Nigerian. They’re coming to like it but it’s a lot of work to get them to really get these things on,” he admitted, saying that more Nigerians are now proud to wear Nigeria so long as it’s tailored properly, as long as the fit is there.

“I know that in those days when we started fashion, the average Nigerian man would just have one buba and sokoto for owambe.”

But he believes he is yet to kick off his fashion.

“I’ve not even started doing fashion,” said Aimankhu who is also into food, owning a Chinese restaurant.

“I’ve not scratched the surface of fashion. And fashion is not about noise. We need to get corporate organisations to key into this. It’s a huge business.”

While Aimankhu identifies the challenge of fabrics, lack of funding and dearth of knowledge as challenges to the local growth of fashion business, he is not deterred.

“You need investors, you need funds. And we have a problem of knowledge here. People think you just start sewing for customers. No. like I advise young people, it’s very important for you to train as a fashion designer. It helps you. Get the training, get the skills, you have to understand it.”

To get a solid foothold in the industry in his early years, Aimankhu said he produced more of ‘uniforms’ and sewing for organisations in addition to couture. But he sees a future beyond that. And he advocates for the country a fashion hub to get fashion designers largely out of couture.

“A fashion designer does not necessarily need to have tailors. You can’t afford it abroad. If we have a fashion hub or have fashion hubs, you just create your designs. If you create your designs, you just take it to these people, they do the sample of what you have. And you take it to the manufacturer and they produce for you.

“Couture is what we do here. And the money is not in doing couture. The money is in doing mass. It is in having your clothes in different shops and having them sold online, even export them because now that African textiles is getting known. That’s my passion.”"
"New Jersey middle school teacher Julia Mooney is promoting sustainable fashion and individuality in a rather unconventional way.

For 100 days, the seventh- and eighth-grade studio art teacher at William Allen Middle School in Moorestown, New Jersey, will wear the same button hemp dress from retailer Thought Clothing.

The sustainable pick cost her around $50 with shipping. It’s part of her “OneOutfit100Days"" project.

Mooney started the project in early September to show that people shouldn’t be defined or labeled by the clothing they wear.

""I was a little bit fed up with the cultural expectation to go shopping and spend all this money for other people to approve of me,"" Mooney told ""Good Morning America."" ""There is no rule that says I cannot wear the same thing every day if I choose to, so I thought why not. I’m just gonna do that and then we can talk about how our clothes really don't define us.""

Courtesy Julia Mooney

Mooney hoped that by wearing the same dress daily, the people around her would start to acknowledge that there is more to one’s image than the way they dress.

""The things that we do define us, and if we spend less energy trying to look good and trying to create this superficial image of who we are, then we might have more energy to do meaningful things and define ourselves based on the good that we do instead of how good we look,"" she said.

Mooney chose the fair trade dress because ""it itself is a rejection of fast-fashion,"" she said, referring to mass retailers who quickly produce clothing in bulk to capitalize on industry trends.

The teacher said she wanted a versatile piece that she could wear with different sweaters and accessories. She also wanted to buy from a company that ethically produces their clothes.

The project evolved to focus on sustainability when she realized the topic wasn’t on everybody else’s radar as much as it was on hers. ""It was really just sort of a subconscious underlying motivation for me because that’s just something that I’m interested in my life in general.""

She upholds these values in her home life. ""We’re always kind of conscious of what we’re using, what we’re wasting and where it’s coming from,"" she said.

Courtesy Julia Mooney

As a new teacher at the middle school — Mooney previously taught at a nearby high school for nine years — she didn’t tell anyone about her mission.

""I just came in to the first day of my career at this new building with people I did not know at all and decided I was just gonna wear the same thing every day, and see how long it took for people to notice,"" she said.

At first, she had two copies of the same dress that she planned to wear throughout the duration of the project, but now she is halfway through and only has one.

She gave the other dress to a woman she met while on a service trip to Africa in October. The woman didn’t have much and was in need of clothes, she said.

The two agreed that the woman would wear the dress during her travels — possibly sharing it with others — and continue to spread the message of sustainability.

Other than passing one of the dresses off to someone else, Mooney hasn’t had any issues with her initiative so far. If anything falls off or the dress gets a rip, she simply fixes it with her sewing machine.

Mooney was curious to see how people would react — if they would ask her about her choice of clothing or if they would even say anything at all.

Aside from seeing what her students and peers would think, Mooney also wanted to see how she would respond to the challenge herself.

""I don’t really usually think of myself as somebody who really cares that much [about] what people think, but at the same time I did feel self-conscious after a few days walking down the halls saying 'Hi' to the same people, who I knew didn’t really know me but were probably noticing that I was wearing the same thing every day and they just probably didn’t want to be rude and ask me,"" Mooney said.

""That was the feeling that I got,"" she added.

Sure enough, some of Mooney's peers eventually got to know her better, and they told her that others had asked them about Mooney's peculiar style. Students, however, asked her directly.

""My students — some of them didn’t notice at all, which I guess is expected because, you know, I’m just a teacher,"" she said. ""But some of them noticed on the second day and asked me why. ... They see me more, I guess. I think maybe being that they’re 12 and 13, they’re just a little more curious and bold. I think my colleagues just didn’t want to be rude and ask me to my face.""

She explained the concept to those who asked but resolved to stay quiet about it otherwise.

If she had done the project at her old school, many of her former colleagues would have said something about it, she said.

Mooney took to social media to help clarify her message and appeal to her students on a platform they know well.

""I made the Instagram because I wanted to make sure that the message and ideas behind it were articulated by me,"" she said. ""I knew that kids operate on Instagram, and before this, I really was not much of an Instagrammer. I just made an account for them, so that they could go there and say, 'What is this all about?' and would be able to find out the answer from me that way.""

One reaction some people had about Mooney's project was about her personal hygiene. ""Some people will say some things like, 'Do you wash it?'"" she said.

""That’s kind of their first go-to question, and I just tell them: this is not a project about hygiene. I wash it as needed. I come to work clean. Lots of people wear uniforms and they are not assumed to be dirty. But the minute that there is no uniform policy and somebody voluntarily chooses to wear the same thing everyday, suddenly that’s not socially acceptable, and I think that element of our culture is worth thinking about.""

""It really comes down to vanity — the only reason we’re living like that. We end up inadvertently feeding into the fast-fashion culture, which is not good for the planet or our self-health.""

To those who view clothes as a form of creative expression, she said she loves fashion and completely supports designers.

""It is, in a way, more of a creative challenge to figure out if you can express yourself in a way that is eco-friendly and maybe a little more minimalist,"" she said.

""Can you do it with less? Can you do it by reusing what you have? By sharing with other people? Why can’t we share the clothes we’re tired of with the people in our circle instead of getting rid of it and buying something new?"" she said.

She added that there are a lot of ways for us to express ourselves creatively while still being mindful of the environment.

Now that Mooney is doing this project, she’s become more conscious of what she’s buying for her children as well, she said.

""My little one’s have always worn thrift or consignment clothes,"" she said. ""I’m not spending a lot of money on their clothes because they grow out of it so fast.""

She said her 4-year-old son eventually noticed her project about a month-and-a-half after she began. He wanted to join when she explained the idea to him.

He wore the same thing willingly for 10 days, she said, but then he spotted his ""Hulk"" shirt and quickly changed his tune.

Mooney’s husband, who is also a teacher, is joining her in the challenge.

""I was really excited to have somebody doing it with me,"" she said.

Two students in her middle school also participated in the challenge, lasting around 20 days, she said.

Another young student in her district, second-grader Sofia, is working to complete the project as well.

Mooney wants everyone to question clothing norms in society.

""I think sometimes people are afraid to challenge the status quo, and sometimes the status quo needs to be challenged when it doesn’t make sense,"" she said. ""We need to be open to that and have a dialogue about it. We need to be brave enough to start the conversation."""

Children develop a ‘fashion sense’ as young as age seven, according to a study.

Researchers found that by this stage kids are developing a feel for what they like to wear and start taking a closer interest in different clothing styles.

It also emerged mums and dads are inspired by their own child’s style, with seven in 10 agreeing their kids are often better dressed than they are.

Parents also said they feel happy, proud and even impressed by their youngster's style and fashion sense.

The research among 2,000 parents was commissioned by Capsule Chix to launch a new doll which encourages kids to show off their individual styles.

Of those polled, one third said they will even let their little ones go outside in dressing-up clothes, allowing them to embrace their unique tastes.

Emily Maclennan, sales and marketing director at Moose Toys which makes Capsule Chix, said: “Style is a really important part of self-expression, so it’s great to see parents allowing and encouraging this from a young age.

""Our research shows parents don’t care how their kids are dressed, as long as they’re enjoying themselves and are being creative.""

The study also found one in four mums and dads are happy to let their child wear any accessories as long as it makes them happy.

It also emerged more than a third of mums and dads have even had to return an item of clothing because their kids weren’t happy with it.

Research also revealed six year-olds aren’t shy to pass comment on their parent’s outfits either, whether that be positive or negative.

In fact, seven in 10 parents said they believe kids these days are better dressed than children have ever been.

The study, conducted via OnePoll, also revealed where kids are getting their style ideas from with Princess Charlotte coming top.

She was closely followed by Harper, Romeo and Cruz Beckham – which will no doubt make fashionista mum Victoria Beckham proud.

Fifth on the list was Cristiano Ronaldo Jr, with Suri Cruise and North West also appearing in the top 10.

Capsule Chix come with four billion 'looks', with each doll featuring a style dial enabling kids to customise their dolls in countless ways.

Emily Maclennan added: “We hope kids love their dolls and have fun dialling up their style – with lots of limited edition and rare pieces to look out for.

""We’re really excited to be launching this toy collection which lets kids express themselves in a truly creative way.""

"Victoria Beckham's fashion label is now losing £10.2million a year, it was revealed today.

The ex-Spice Girl's luxury clothing, glasses and accessories business recently celebrated its 10th anniversary - but losses have increased by £2million in the past 12 months.

The label's loss, worth around £27,000-a-day, came despite revenues growing 17 per cent to £42.5million in 2017.

The fashion label, which has a flagship store in Mayfair, London and sells items such as coats for up to £2,900 each, posted an £8.4million loss in 2016.

But experts believe Mrs Beckham, who is worth an estimated £240million, can expect to turn a profit in the 'medium term'.

Victoria Beckham's fashion label losses in 2017 reached £10.2million - up from £8.4million in 206, accounts show

But revenues in clothing, eyewear and accessories grew to £42.5million last year for Victoria's label. She is pictured with her husband David at the Fashion Awards at the Royal Albert Hall on December 10 this year

The fashion label belonging to Victoria Beckham, pictured left after her London Fashion Week show, right, has lost £10.2million the last year

Victoria has been supported at label events by her husband David, 43, and children Harper, seven, Romeo, 16, Cruz, 13, and Brooklyn, 19 (pictured left to right)

The mother-of-four oversees an empire comprising four clothing lines, more than 400 retail outlets in over 50 countries and offices in London and New York.

At the outset the longtime fashionista, faced a daunting challenge: convincing a competitive and demanding industry that she could make a lasting impression on fickle fashion fans.

Seizing the opportunity to surpass her status as a pop star she has gradually earned widespread recognition, even from fashion luminaries such as Karl Lagerfeld, the creative genius behind Chanel.

Last year sale increased across all areas, especially in her ready-to-wear 'Victoria Beckham' line, its sister ready-to-wear 'Victoria, Victoria Beckham' line as well as accessories and eyewear, both online and in-store.

Victoria Beckham Ltd said last year the company 'continued to invest in the business and build its talent base', maintaining that its shareholders are committed to reducing its loss and expect to break even in the medium term.

Last December, NEO Investment Partners invested £30 million in the business to grow the company's digital operations and bricks-and-mortar stores.

The company has redesigned its website, invested in its distribution capabilities - now shipping to more than 120 countries, and recently announced a long-term global licensing deal for its eyewear products with Marchon.

NEO is a shareholder in the company along with Beckham Brand Holdings, which is owned by Victoria and David Beckham and XIX Entertainment.

The company said that despite a 'difficult trading environment' it has been investing for its future growth and building its leadership team.

David Beckham posted this photo of the fashion week show's after-party with their son Brooklyn toasting them behind

Sales on Victoria's website (pictured) are up across the board with the label's revenues now reaching £42.5million - but still not enough to turn a profit

In March, the company appointed industry veteran Ralph Toledano, who is currently president of the French tarde body Federation de la Haute Couture et de la Mode, as chairman joining Paolo Riva who was appointed chief executive in September.

Mr Riva said: 'We will continue to invest in growth markets such as the US and Asia whilst also ensuring we have the right strategy to ensure profitability over the medium term.

'I look forward to working with Victoria and team to steer the brand to the next phase.'

The company trades from its website, flagship store in Mayfair, London and in Hong Kong as well as from 400 stockists in over 50 countries.

Last week Victoria looked far from comfortable as she stepped out in a sheer top and bra as temperatures hovered just above freezing.

The designer was pictured in the barely there mesh top from her own collection, which showed her black lingerie underneath as she attended the Haig Club House Party in Notting Hill, West London.

The star, 44, who almost always wears items from her own brand, was joined by her son Brooklyn, 19, sister Louise Adams, 34, and husband David, 43, who is brand ambassador for whisky firm Haig Club.

Mrs Beckham's top is from her latest collection and is available from her website for £565.

Speaking to British Vogue about her collection last year, the mother of four said: 'For me and my customer, what I believe is that she wants to feel secure and comfortable.

'For me, it was also looking at my heritage: you can see we've got heritage fabrics here in the houndstooth and tartan. British - but with a global outlook.'"
"At first glance, Kerri Westlake’s backyard looks like an ordinary garden, lush with plants and flowers. But a closer look reveals it is actually a dye garden.

Four years ago, Westlake planted seeds to grow plant materials that are used to naturally dye yarn in the shared backyard of the apartment she rents on Lansdowne Ave. in Toronto.

“It’s really magical. I like the process of going from seed to colour,” says Westlake, owner of Westlake Knits, an online business that sells hand-dyed yarn and natural dyes — much of it harvested from her own garden.

“I love the Sumac greys, they have this really amazing warmth, and depending on how much iron I add, they can have almost a really purple or lavender colour that comes through. It’s my favourite plant.”

Westlake gives workshops on growing a dye garden, natural dyeing and bundle dyeing using plants and foraged organic materials.

Participants get to explore her garden, forage and try different plant materials.

Bundle dyeing involves laying out plant materials on natural fabric like linen, cotton or silk and rolling it tightly and tying in a bundle. It’s a great way to try your hand at plant dyeing.

Her garden has mainly native species and is the source for many of her natural dyes, except for exotic colours like indigo (deep blue) madder root (orange red) and cochineal (vibrant red) made from insects. She orders these from Maiwa, an online source for natural dyes in British Columbia.

Dyes made of plant materials and minerals date back thousands of years but today most textiles are dyed with synthetic colours that enable manufacturers to give materials a consistent colour.

However, interest in natural dyeing is growing as artisans rediscover plant dyes as a more environmentally friendly and creative alternative.

“There is a renewed excitement about natural dyeing,” says Westlake.

“I think that it’s part of a trend of people being excited to do things with their hands and to connect to the natural world.”

Plants can yield a rainbow of colours.

Yarrow, a native plant yields yellows and greens, marigolds give a golden yellow-orange, and woad is an ancient source of blue dye.

Experimentation is part of the process of natural dyeing and the biggest challenge is trying to create consistent colour, says Westlake.

“It may look magical, but there’s a definite chemistry behind it.”

Natural dyes work best on natural fibres such as cotton, linen, hemp and silk, says Westlake.

Her process to make dye starts with harvesting the plants and chopping them into small pieces that are simmered in water for about an hour before being cooled and strained.

Depending on the natural dye being used, the fibre may have to be mordanted with a solution such as alum or iron.

Mordant helps fibre absorb colour and be more colourfast and can also influence the final shade or colour.

While Westlake makes the dyes, she places the fibres in a vat filled with a mordant solution. The fibres simmer in the vat of mordant for about an hour. Once cooled, the fibres are squeezed and put into the dye vat.

The time in the vat depends on the colour she wants to achieve. It could take anywhere from one minute to a couple of days. Then it is taken out, squeezed, rinsed with water and dried.

“Unless it’s a plant that doesn’t need a mordant at all, I usually mordant with alum,” says Westlake.

“From my research, it’s the one with the lowest environmental impact and it doesn’t affect the colour too much.”

Iron, by comparison, will transform a dyed colour right before your eyes, says Westlake.

Some plants give off naturally bright colours. “Marigolds are great, the dye bath is a vibrant yellow orange like you would expect, and then you add a few grains of iron and vinegar concentrate and it turns immediately to olive green,” says Westlake.

She says avocados are easy to start out with because you don’t necessarily need a mordant. The skin and pit of an avocado are naturally high in tannins, which act as a mordant. Onion skins and black walnuts have the same effect, she says.

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Westlake’s garden is an evolving experiment in natural dyeing.

Black hollyhocks give pretty browns as a vat dye but when bundle-dyed turns a purple black because of the heat and direct contact with fibre.

The tops of Lady’s Bed Straw (Galium verum) make yellows and greens while the roots make pinks and reds.

But looks can be deceiving. The most vibrantly-coloured plants can produce the lightest colours, whereas the less-vibrant plants produce more intense colour, says Westlake.

For example, “berries — you think will be really dramatic but they tend not to be the most effective natural dyes, they tend to give brown and not be very colourfast. Indigo is a very inconspicuous looking plant, it’s just green leaves and then you can get this magical blue pigment out of it.”

“It’s a really amazing way to connect with the local environment and learn about plants and nature in such a fun and hands-on way, and I feel like since I started growing the dye plants it has improved my garden for pollinators, too.”

Toronto designer Rachel MacHenry has been working with natural dyes since she was a child, but it has only been in the last 15 years that she has focused on using them in her own practice.

MacHenry, an instructor at OCADU, produces a small line of naturally dyed trims (ribbon, rick rack, lace) and embroidery threads — materials for home sewers, makers, sustainable textile designers and fashion brands that she sells through her website Botanica Tinctoria.

Her curated palette of colours is sourced from traditional dye plants such as indigo and madder and is produced in partnership with a natural dye research company in India called BioDye, whose dye materials are sourced from sustainable items such as fruit, leaves and regenerative stems.

“Many of the artisans I work with are subsistence farmers, or live in forest-dependent communities, and their way of life is closely intertwined with the land,” says MacHenry.

“The Indigo and Madder are grown in Pakistan, and the Iron Vinegar is made by cooking old pieces of iron with natural sugars and vinegar.

“In India, we are working with a wide range of bioregional dyestuffs that are sustainably gathered or farmed, including Indigo and Madder ... some of the plants are carefully wild-gathered, while others are farmed. We’ve also worked with natural dyes in Peru, which has its own range of beautiful natural colour from their own range of plants.”

We are seeing a global resurgence of interest in natural dyeing, says MacHenry.

“I think this is largely in response to the very negative impact of chemical dyes, especially their toxicity in relation to human health and the destruction of waterways.

“This interest in less toxic colourants is connected to larger concerns we have about waste impacting the environment, and is related to concerns about the environmental and social effects of Fast Fashion and overproduction.”

Katelyn Powers and Christine DuRoss of The Wild Woven Collection were each experimenting with natural dyes when they met in Toronto last summer.

Powers, a graphic designer, had taken an indigo dyeing course at Harbourfront Centre and was interested in painting with natural pigments.

DuRoss, a social worker, had been writing a food blog, experimenting with natural dyeing in her kitchen.

They connected over their shared interest in botanical dyeing and quickly began collaborating that autumn, making botanically-dyed tea towels. Their first show was a holiday pop-up in November 2018.

It’s a collaboration — Powers does the painting aspect of the dyeing and DuRoss does the solid and resist dyeing. Together, they create naturally dyed and painted textiles such as tea towels, duvet covers, table linens and throw cushions from their homemade paints and dyes.

“We like to use materials when they’re in season, such as wild goldenrod or black walnut picked up from the ground. I also like to freeze the material and pull it out to use it when I’m ready for it rather than try to preserve it,” says DuRoss.

“Friends save avocado pits and onion skins for me, a florist friend donates flowers, it’s a real community effort.”

Summer is a great time for bundle dyeing, says DuRoss. “Walking around the neighbourhood looking for things is especially good for bundle dyeing because you need all different kinds of flowers and plants.”

Avocado is one of their favourite materials to use. It creates a soft earthy pink, that closely resembles the popular “millennial pink.”

Not surprisingly, it’s also one of their more popular colours of hand-dyed and painted home textiles that can be found in Toronto at smaller stockists such as Rose City Goods, Cambie Design and The Pale Blue Dot in Hamilton.

Lots of things can affect the colour but that’s part of the attraction of natural dyeing.

“You open this little parcel after it’s been steaming and it’s always a surprise and I really like that about it,” says Powers."
"Mike Ashley's Sports Direct Buys Jack Wills In Pre-pack Administration

Jack Wills has been sold to Sports Direct. Picture: PA

Sports Direct has won the bidding war for Jack Wills after the clothing company was put into administration on Monday.

The high street clothing chain was bought in a process known as a pre-pack administration. It is believed Sports Direct paid £12.75 million for the brand.

Jack Wills will come under a new division established at Sports Direct which will focus solely on buying and building fashion and sports brands, and report to Michael Murray in his role as head of elevation.

Mr Murray said: ""Jack Wills has made a name for itself carving out a unique place in the minds of consumers since its launch and has today grown into one of the most recognised British fashion brands. Having taken a personal role in driving the decision to bid for this business, I am absolutely thrilled that Sports Direct was successful.

""Jack Wills will continue to operate as a separate company with its own leadership team. Our role will be to support the business and help elevate the brand and help restore it to its former glory.""

There are no details yet as to what it will mean for the 1800 employees and 110 standalone stores."

"By James Davey

LONDON, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Fashion retailer Boohoo raised its sales guidance on Wednesday as it beat forecasts with a 22 percent first half profit rise, underlining Britain's rapid shift to online shopping.

Founded just 12 years ago in Manchester, northern England, Boohoo has expanded quickly, listing its shares in 2014 and buying the PrettyLittleThing and Nasty Gal brands last year.

British clothing retailers like Marks & Spencer and Debenhams have seen profits slump and are closing stores, but pure internet players like ASOS and Boohoo are tapping-in to a generation of consumers who shop on their mobile phones and share fashion tips via social media.

Shares in Boohoo, which sells own-brand clothing, shoes, accessories and beauty products, largely to 16 to 30 year olds, were up by 9 percent to 209 pence at 0813 GMT.

The rise gives Boohoo a market capitalisation of 2.39 billion pounds ($3.15 billion), which is some 20 times the equity value of the 240-year-old Debenhams.

Boohoo said its pretax profit was 24.7 million pounds ($32.5 million) in the six months to August 31, up from 20.3 million pounds in the same period last year, on revenue up 50 percent to 395.3 million pounds.

ASOS, which is 18 years old and unlike Boohoo sells third party brands as well, is due to update on trading on Oct. 17. Its shares were up 2.2 percent.

""All of our brands performed extremely well across all territories as we continue to gain market share,"" said Boohoo's joint CEOs Mahmud Kamani and Carol Kane.

Together the Kamani family and Kane own 36 percent of Boohoo's equity.

STANDOUT PERFORMER

PrettyLittleThing was the standout performer in the business, with its revenue soaring 132 percent despite the relocation of its distribution centre to Sheffield, northern England, during the period.

The core Boohoo brand's distribution centre in Burnley is also being extended, giving the group a network capable of generating 3 billion pounds of net sales globally.

For the full-year to Feb. 28 2019, Boohoo forecast revenue growth of 38 percent to 43 percent, up from previous guidance of 35 percent to 40 percent, with adjusted EBITDA margin of between 9 percent and 10 percent.

Medium term guidance of sales growth of at least 25 percent per annum and EBITDA margin of 10 percent was also reiterated by the firm.

Last week Boohoo appointed John Lyttle, the current chief operating officer at Primark, as its new chief executive, with effect from March next year, on a pay package that could earn him almost 58 million pounds.

The package includes the possibility of a 50 million pound share plan payout if Boohoo's market value hits 5.6 billion pounds in five years.

""With 11.7 million active customers across the brands, expanded distribution capacity, successful marketing campaigns, 41 percent of the business now outside the UK, and a rising cash balance on the balance sheet, boohoo seems very well positioned to continue its impressive growth trajectory,"" said analysts at Jefferies, who have a ""buy"" stance on the stock.

On Tuesday clothing retailer Next forecast flat profit for the full 2018-19 year after two straight years of decline. Its online business is growing strongly while sales at its stores continue to decline.

Next pointed to the problems this creates - as retail sales decline many fixed costs remain but as online sales grow its variable costs increase. ($1 = 0.7599 pounds) (Editing by Paul Sandle and Alexander Smith)"

▲ Sustainable Fashion

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.

On Tuesday, luxury fashion retailer Net-a-Porter launched a one-stop shop for customers who want to buy sustainable and ethical products.

Called Net Sustain, the new platform highlights and celebrates brands which meet at least one of the business’ criteria for sustainability.

Launching with 26 brands and around 500 products, Net-a-Porter aims to include more designers to Net Sustain over time, with beauty brands scheduled to be added to the platform next year.

The section will also offer exclusive capsule collections from a number of popular sustainable brands, including Stella McCartney, Mother of Pearl and Maggie Marilyn – a favourite of the Duchess of Sussex.

The launch of Net Sustain follows the news that the UK government has rejected calls for fast fashion retailers to address their impact on the environment.

The government refused to accept any of the 18 recommendations set out by MPs on the Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) regarding issues such as forced labour, environmental damage, and excessive waste in the industry.

Find The Independent’s round-up of the best brands you can buy from Net Sustain here.

▲ Yoghurt

A new study has suggested that men who regularly eat yoghurt could reduce their risk of developing pre-cancerous growths by a fifth.

The study, conducted by the University of Washington, found that men who eat two or more servings of yoghurt a week had a significantly lower chance of developing adenoma – polyps in the bowel which may eventually become cancerous.

After tracking more than 32,000 men for 25 years, the researchers found that those who consumed at least two portions of yoghurt a week had 19 per cent fewer adenoma growths.

Furthermore, regular eaters were also 26 per cent less likely to have tumours of the most high-risk type.

Bowel cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the UK, with more than 42,000 people diagnosed with the condition in the UK every year.

This equates to around 115 new cases of bowel cancer every day.

For more information on symptoms of bowel cancer, visit the NHS here and Cancer Research UK here.

▲ Cocktails in a can

On Monday, Marks & Spencer unveiled four new cocktail in a can flavours to its line-up.

Fans of the fruity beverages will now be able to get their hands on an aperitivo spritzer, cherry spritzer, peach spritzer and a vermouth and tonic.

Each 250ml can has 5.5 per cent alcohol and cost £2. The drinks are currently available to buy from M&S.

The launch comes after the supermarket reported a 24 per cent rise in sales of its own-brand canned gin and tonics after they were featured in episode two of BBC Three’s hit comedy series Fleabag.

In the episode, actor Andrew Scott’s priest character – dubbed “the hot priest” by both the series’ protagonist Fleabag and its fanbase – revealed his love of the beverage, describing it as a “proper drink”.

▲ Goop

Gwyneth Paltrow launched the first shop for her wellness brand, Goop, in Harvey Nichols on Thursday.

In keeping with the Goop brand, the shop sells products relating to beauty, fashion, wellness, and homeware, while a Goop smoothie menu devised by the brand’s food editors will also be sold in the store’s on-site cafe.

The shop has been designed by Charles & Co, a US interior consultancy, and features a blend of British and Californian design.

Speaking about the Harvey Nichols shop, Paltrow says: “We love the community we’ve created around our Notting Hill shop, and the Harvey Nichols shop-in-shop allows us to expand on that community.”

▲ Royal Ascot

This week, Royal Ascot returned to the Berkshire racecourse for a week of horse racing, socialising, fine dining and fashion.

Since its launch in 1711, the event has long been regarded as one of the most important fashion events in the UK calendar, where guests are invited to keep to a strict dress code depending on which enclosure they’re granted access to: Royal, Queen Anne, Village, and Windsor.

On the first day of the sporting event, the Duchess of Cambridge made her return to Ascot wearing an Elie Saab duck egg-blue lace dress with a bow fastening at the neck.

Elsewhere, TV presenters Charlotte Hawkins and Kate Silverton both opted for red toned-dresses, while Australian model Georgia Fowler wore a draped, dusty-pink floor-length dress, accessorised with a mint-green handbag, and a nude-hued hat.

See The Independent’s roundup of the best looks from Royal Ascot 2019 here.

▼ Gaslighting

After Sunday night’s episode of Love Island, fans of the reality show criticised contestant Joe Garratt of gaslighting his partner, Lucie Donlan.

The term is used to describe a form of emotional abuse where one person gradually manipulates another in order to gain control.

Garratt’s treatment of Donlan came under fire after he criticised her friendship with boxer Tommy Fury, calling it “strange” and “disrespectful”, adding: “I think it’s time for you to get close with the girls.”

Following the episode, 302 viewers complained to broadcasting watchdogs Ofcom about the treatment of Donlan thus far on the series.

Domestic abuse charity Women’s Aid praised viewers of the show for calling out Garratt’s “possessive behaviour”, saying: “Controlling behaviour is never acceptable, and with Love Island viewers complaining to Ofcom in record numbers about Joe’s possessive behaviour towards Lucie, more people are becoming aware of this and want to challenge it.”

“Abusive relationships often start off with subtle signs of control, so it’s important that it is recognised at an early stage.”

Following his departure from the fifth series of the programme on Tuesday evening, the sandwich maker blamed the “heightened pressure” in the villa for his behaviour towards Donlan and said he “didn’t manipulate or abuse her”.

▼ Sexting

A new study has suggested that teenagers who engage in sexting are more likely to have mental health issues and multiple sexual partners compared to those who don’t.

The analysis of 41,723 participants younger than 18-years old found “significant associations” between sexting and increased sexual activity, multiple partners, lack of contraceptive use, and anxiety and depression.

Other problematic behaviours such as drug and alcohol abuse was also highlighted as being potentially associated with sexting – the exchange of sexual messages, photographs, or videos.

The researchers said that it was difficult to determine whether sending or receiving sexually explicit messages directly led to any of the negative outcomes, or if sexting is just one of several risky acts a teenager is already more inclined to take chances might engage with.

The findings follow a 2018 study which revealed that one in seven teenagers have sent sexts – messages containing sexually explicit content – and one in four have received them.

▼ Bella Hadid

Bella Hadid was forced to apologise to fans who were offended by an Instagram post this week.

On Sunday, the supermodel posted a photo to her Instagram Story featuring her foot up against an airport window. In the background of the image are planes from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates on the tarmac.

Several fans took offence to the image, explaining that the sole of the model’s foot was facing the flags printed on the side of the planes’ tails, which they argued disrespected Arabic culture.

As a result, several Twitter users called for luxury fashion brands such as Calvin Klein and Dior to stop employing the Palestinian-American model in their campaigns, using the hashtag #BellaHadidIsRacist.

In light of the backlash, Hadid apologised in English and Arabic on Twitter and in an Instagram Story, explaining that the photo she had shared had “nothing to do with politics”.

“I would never mean to disrespect these airlines, let alone these amazing countries,” she tweeted on Monday.

“I absolutely love these airlines, with the best planes and people.”

▼ Detox teas

On Tuesday, model Amber Rose faced criticism for promoting a detox and weight-loss tea on Instagram while pregnant.

The 35-year-old who is expecting her second child, shared a paid advertisement for Flat Tummy Co’s “organic pregnancy tea” on Instagram, while Rose said helps mothers on those “bloated, nauseous, blah feeling days”.

Rose faced backlash from numerous social media users, including outspoken actor Jameela Jamil, who wrote on Twitter: “FLAT TUMMY PRODUCTS FOR… PREGNANT WOMEN? Is this FDA approved?

“Are we… f***ing… KIDDING?”

▼ Mum-shaming

Model Chrissy Teigen was mum-shamed this week after she shared a video of her three-year-old daughter attending the dentist for the first time.

In the video posted to Instagram, which Teigen captioned: “So proud of my toons at her first dentist appointment!!” Luna can be seen cleaning the teeth of a stuffed alligator at the dentist’s office.

However, critics soon questioned why Teigen didn’t take Luna to the dentist sooner – with many suggesting one-year-old is when children should go for their first visit.

In response to the criticism, the model wrote: “Was waiting for this. U guys never fail me.”

The American Academy of Paediatric Dentistry (AAPD) defended Teigen on Instagram, commenting: “This is so great to see! Did you know that only 62 per cent of children see a dentist from age two-four? You’re helping this number grow!”"
"New Zealand scientist Dr Philip Elmer has won the kiwifruit industry's top innovation award for his contribution to the fight against diseases and the industry's efforts to become more sustainable.

Dr Elmer, a senior scientist at Crown Research Institute Plant & Food Research, was awarded the Sir Brian Elwood Award at Zespri's annual Harvest Dinner, for leading the team which developed the organic-certified biological control agent Aureo®Gold which is being used in the fight against Psa.

""Aureo Gold was developed during a time of real hardship as most of New Zealand's 2600 kiwifruit growers were forced to cut out all or some of their vines because of Psa, with many pushed to the financial brink,"" Zespri chairman Bruce Cameron says.

""The industry needed hope and Dr Elmer and his team played an important part in that, leading the effort to find a new way of controlling the disease which was safe, bee friendly and did not affect the quality of canopy and the fruit.

""Thankfully, despite the immense pressure, his team succeeded and Aureo®Gold is in high demand today. It's also taken on new significance, with more consumers now looking for more sustainably produced products, and growers looking to further reduce their environmental footprint.

""It was an incredibly important innovation and we're pleased to have Dr Elmer on the team,"" Mr Cameron says.

Developed through the industry's longstanding partnership with Plant & Food Research, AgResearch and UPL it ticks both boxes as a biological control which is BioGro™ organically certified, adding to the industry's sustainability efforts.

Kristy McDonald QC, chairwoman of kiwifruit industry regulator Kiwifruit New Zealand, says the importance of science and innovation to kiwifruit is underlined by the discovery.

""The kiwifruit industry has a proud record of innovation, investing heavily in developing new varieties and products in search of better tasting, higher yielding fruit with a lower impact on the environment.

""Innovators like Dr Elmer are an important part of those efforts. He's thoroughly deserving of this recognition and we thank him for his contribution.""

Fellow judge New Zealand Kiwifruit Growers Inc chairman Doug Brown echoed those sentiments, noting the importance of growers having the right tools to help combat Psa.

""It is important for the industry to find new tools such as Aureo® Gold to combat Psa and having a sustainable biological option is particularly helpful to support growers.

""NZKGI congratulates Dr Elmer on his valuable contribution to the kiwifruit industry,"" Mr Brown says.

Dr Elmer has spent more than 30 years developing tools and technologies to manage diseases which impact the New Zealand horticulture industry. He is a world leader and using his expertise to improve how we grow and manage pests and diseases in a more sustainable manner.

Last year he was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Kudos Awards for his regional and national contribution to science, and to the international profile of New Zealand science.

Dr Elmer says the joy he gets from his work stems from leading a team that is both passionate and energetic about helping New Zealand's horticulture become more environmentally sustainable.

""I love biocontrol research and the freedom to develop new biologically-based solutions to industry problems,"" he says.

""Where else can you realise that a micro-organism you stashed away in a freezer over a decade ago is the key to controlling a bacterial pathogen that killed so many vines? I guess that makes me a 'stamp collector' that collects micro-organisms instead of stamps.

""When we started, we had our fair share of sceptics and many thought that Psa was just too tough for a biological control to handle. Therein lies the heart of why we do what we do — our team loves a challenge and Psa was the biggest one we had ever faced.

""This award means a huge amount to my team and recognises all the hard work and technical barriers we had to overcome — from discovery in 2012 to commercial product being sold in 2018.

""Our mission does not end here for the kiwifruit industry. We are constantly looking to improve what we have developed and right now we are working on a new plant defence booster that will help boost the power of Aureo®Gold."""

"The department of labour's Supported Employment Enterprises (SEE) initiative employs nearly 1,000 people with disabilities, with the capacity for another 3,000. Picture: Department of Labour/Supplied

Johannesburg - A Department of Labour initiative which dates back to the second world war is helping create jobs for handicapped people who have borne the brunt of South Africa's unemployment scourge. Official data shows that some 4.7 million people live with disabilities in South Africa, of whom 10 to 15 percent require an environment such as the department's Supported Employment Enterprises (SEE), a projected established after World War II to provide jobs for veterans.

The SEE initiative current boasts 12 factories which operate in seven of the country's nine provinces and employ nearly 1 000 people with disabilities, with the capacity for another 3 000.

The factories manufacture some 3 000 products for hospitals, schools and the police force, including furniture, textiles, metalwork, leather work, canvas work, book-binding and screen printing.

In rural areas, SEE has created another 1 100 jobs indirectly. It transports school desks which are assembled by local carpenters who also do repairs when needed, establishing a sustainable eco-system.

The SEE project has provided employment for disabled people such as Andrew Moeketsi, who had one of his legs amputated after he was shot in a hijacking in 2003.

Another beneficiary is Louise Badenhorst, a textile designer, pattern maker and fashion designer with Friedreich's ataxia, an autosomal recessive inherited disease that causes progressive damage to the nervous system, while Hannelie Roos, who was left with a traumatic brain injury after a head-on collision, is about to retire with a pension after 38 years at SEE.

In addition to contributing to South Africa's manufacturing sector, the non-profit SEE initiative pays all its own expenses and staff. Dennis Matsepe, a deputy director for business development in the department of labour, markets and sells SEE's products.

""The people are disabled, but are not seen as such,"" Matsepe says. ""They do all the work and if given a chance can do anything.""

7am: take an aerated, plastic-free shower

Britons use 840bn litres of water a year showering, with some power showers using up to 15 litres a minute. Aerator shower heads, such as Lowenergie’s (£12.99), save water by acting as a sieve, reducing space for the water to flow through while maintaining water pressure.

Microbeads were banned in the UK last year, but most soaps are still wrapped in plastic. Seek out alternatives. Aerende’s bergamot and mint wool soap (£12) is handmade by young people in Hertfordshire with disabilities, wrapped in wool from Herdwick sheep, packaged in recycled paper and contains no parabens.

The UK sends an estimated 300,000 tonnes of clothing to landfill each year. If you are not going to wear an item at least 30 times, don’t buy it. Instead, consider renting (try hirestreetuk.com or frontrow.uk.com). If you do buy new, use the app Good on You to check clothing brands’ sustainability rating. The charity Traid will collect old clothes free of charge for its shops in London, Hertfordshire, Surrey and Brighton.

The global footwear industry emits 700m tonnes of CO 2 a year. AllBirds is a favourite of actors Ashton Kutcher and Amy Adams, and uses sugarcane, sheep’s wool and recycled bottles to make its carbon-neutral trainers. You can recycle old trainers at Runners Need.

Many household cleaning products are filled with toxins, so get creative and make your own. A combination of baking soda, vinegar and essential oils is perfect for scrubbing floors, bathrooms and kitchens. Avoid air fresheners – most emit more than 100 chemicals, some of which may be pollutants. Lola Grogan, founder of the Eco Laundry, recommends Sonnet, which offers ecologically conscious bleaches and laundry products.

A typical 6kg wash load of acrylic fabric releases more than 700,000 plastic fibres into the sea, where they are eaten by fish and, eventually, us. “Only wash clothes when you have a full load, and at low temperatures – higher temperatures can mean more fibres are released,” says Grogan. Most washing machines don’t have filters, so invest in a microfibre-trapping laundry device, such as the Cora Ball (£29).

Opt for a fridge with an A+++ energy label, which shaves about 5% off an average household’s electricity bill when replacing an A+ fridge. Freezers cut food waste by almost 50% and are more efficient when fully stocked. Use a lid to cover pots on the stove, reducing energy use by two-thirds and heating food faster. And don’t be a microwave snob – it is a more eco-friendly way to reheat food.

8pm: streamline your streaming

Stream films through a smart TV rather than a less energy-efficient games console. The US nonprofit the National Resources Defense Council found that the PS4 and Xbox One required 30 to 45 times more power to stream a film than players such as Apple TV, Google Chromecast and Amazon Fire TV. Depending on your music habits, listening to CDs may be more environmentally friendly than doing it digitally. Research by Bach Technology in 2012 showed that streaming an album 27 times can use more energy than creating and posting a CD to a consumer.

10pm: makeover your makeup routine

Reusable face pads (try cheekywipes.com) can be used to remove makeup and then machine washed. When it is time to reapply, go for Ecotools’ makeup brushes, made from recycled bamboo, plastic and aluminum and packaged in recycled paper.

11pm: sleep in bamboo-fibre bed sheets

Get some shut-eye in cotton/bamboo bedding from Urban Collective (from £116.99). Bamboo is fast-growing and self-replenishing, consuming one-third the amount of water during the growing process than cotton. It also has antibacterial properties.

"Stella McCartney has admitted she delights in the fact many customers who snap up her take on the classic Stan Smith trainer 'don't have a clue' it's vegan.

The 47-year-old fashion designer, who has built her brand around a cruelty-free ethos and has never included leather or fur in her collections, said in a cover interview with Wired magazine that she was 'proud' of her collaboration with Adidas on its iconic shoe - which are typically made using leather.

'We pushed to get it vegan and they let me. And we did it. I'm so proud. That is the future,' she told the magazine.

The daughter of Sir Paul McCartney appears on the cover of the latest issue of Wired, shot by Erik Madigan Heck, dressed in dressed in a geometric colour-block jacket.

British fashion designer Stella McCartney has admitted she relishes the moment her customers discover the edgy trainers she has collaborated on with Adidas are vegan, in an interview with Wired

Her latest design is a collaboration with Adidas on the Stan Smith trainer, modelled on the shoes the iconic tennis player wore on the court.

Stella's stars run along the sides, replacing the sports brand's classic three stripes, along with Stella's portrait and signature on the left tongue.

The 47-year-old fashion designer said she's proud to have created a vegan version of the classic Stan Smith shoe

Paying tribute to Stan Smith, his face remains printed on the right trainer.

Speaking about the shoe, Stella said: 'I relish the thought that 99 per cent of our customers see the Stan Smith and haven't got a clue it's a vegetarian shoe.

'We pushed to get it vegan and they let me. And we did it. I'm so proud. That is the future.'

And arguing that she most environmental issues which are mentioned in the fashion industry are not 'genuine or heartfelt, she added of her designs: 'If I don't design things that are desirable and sexy, and a must-have for people, then it just ends up in landfill anyway.'

Stella has been married to husband Alasdhair Willis for 15 years, and the pair are parents to sons Miller, 11, and Beckett, eight, as well as an elder daughter Bailey, and youngest daughter Reiley, six.

Her latest design is a collaboration with Adidas on the Stan Smith trainer, modelled on the shoes the iconic tennis player wore on the court, and she ensured the would be vegan (Pictured)

Stella uses her fashion line to champion her anti-cruelty beliefs, previously telling the Telegraph: 'There are a lot of designers who are very f*** you when it comes to using fur,' she says. 'If it's wrong to do fur, then they're going to do it.

'But given that there are only about three of us who don't do fur, they're not being very punk. They're just complying with every other fashion house.

'The fur industry gets to fashion students so young, paying them to use it. But even if you don't care about the millions of animals killed for fashion, it's not sustainable, and it's not modern. Every other industry tries to move forward, apart from the fashion industry.'

This year it emerged that Stella pocketed £4million last year, compared with £8.3million the year before.

The company said sales in the year to the end of December rose by two per cent, hitting £42.5million. But profit fell four per cent to £9.1million.

After the financial year end, McCartney agreed to acquire luxury goods group Kering's 50 per cent in the firm named after her. Kering had owned the stake since the fashion label was created 17 years ago.

"Starbucks announced Wednesday it will pilot new greener to-go cups this year in Vancouver that will be both recyclable and compostable.

Vancouver will join New York, San Francisco, Seattle and London to trial different cup options that will be chosen from the NextGen Cup Challenge winners that were announced earlier this month.

""We know how important this issue is to Canadians,"" said Michael Conway, executive vice president and president of Starbucks Canada in a media release. ""We're committed to being a part of the solution. I'm excited and proud that our customers in Vancouver will be among the first to sip coffee from a greener to-go cup.""

In addition to the greener cups, the coffee company will roll out new recyclable strawless lids to stores across North America beginning in Toronto. Customers may have already seen strawless lids at select locations but the new lid has been redesigned to be more lightweight.

This new lid will have nine per cent less plastic than the current lid and straw. Straws will continue to be available to customers upon request.

Progress plans for both initiatives will be revealed at the company's annual shareholders meeting Wednesday.

Making recycling to-go cups a reality

Starbucks initiated the NextGen Consortium managed by Closed Loop Partners last spring to launch the NextGen Cup Challenge — a challenge to redesign the paper to-go cup to make packaging more environmentally sustainable.

The 12 winners of the challenge were chosen at the end of last month. One of the categories of the competition was to create innovative cup liners so that coffee to-go cups can in fact be compostable and recyclable.

""Directionally they're moving in the right spot. But it's easy to confuse consumers saying that this is good enough,"" Calvin Lakhan, a research scientist at York University said. ""There's still a lot more room to grow.""

Current coffee to-go cups are made with paper but are lined with polyethylene plastic or wax making them difficult to recycle in most jurisdictions.

Footprint is a sustainable packaging company in the U.S. and one of the 12 winners of the challenge. According to Starbucks who announced the winners on their website last month, Footprint ""creates cups, lids and straws that are fully-formed fiber based solutions, with an aqueous-based coating that is recyclable and compostable.""

In addition to Starbucks, Mcdonalds is also one of the lead partners of the consortium including the Coca Cola Company, Yum! Brands, Nestle and Wendy's as supporting partners. The challenge is part of the consortium's $10 million commitment to advance food packaging design.

Starbucks isn't the first company to announce changes to their cups in efforts to reduce its ecological footprint.

Tim Hortons announced last year that certain locations have begun piloting environmentally friendly lids that are also designed to prevent leaking.

Lakhan said companies and consumers should be looking at more reusable options. He suggests that instead of consumers buying a new cup every single day, they should bring a reusable cup.

Starbucks Canada currently offers customers a 10-cent discount to any customer who brings a reusable cup or tumbler to a company-owned store.

""If you can bring in your cups that's ten times better for the environment than buying something that has made a marginal change in its composition,"" Lakhan said. ""Reuse should always be what we're aiming for when it comes to sustainable coffee."""
"From borrowing clothes to switching search engines, there are ways to boost your environmental credentials throughout the day

7am: take an aerated, plastic-free shower

Britons use 840bn litres of water a year showering, with some power showers using up to 15 litres a minute. Aerator shower heads, such as Lowenergie’s (£12.99), save water by acting as a sieve, reducing space for the water to flow through while maintaining water pressure.

Microbeads were banned in the UK last year, but most soaps are still wrapped in plastic. Seek out alternatives. Aerende’s bergamot and mint wool soap (£12) is handmade by young people in Hertfordshire with disabilities, wrapped in wool from Herdwick sheep, packaged in recycled paper and contains no parabens.

7.20am: clean your teeth with a bamboo toothbrush

The average person uses 300 toothbrushes in their lifetime, with an estimated 80% ending up in the sea. Zero Waste’s bamboo, replaceable-head toothbrushes are 100% biodegradable and made from sustainable bamboo (£6.99). Use with a zero-waste toothpaste such as Georganics’ natural toothpowder (£6.90), which is free from peroxides and comes in a recyclable glass jar.

7.25am: borrow your wardrobe

The UK sends an estimated 300,000 tonnes of clothing to landfill each year. If you are not going to wear an item at least 30 times, don’t buy it. Instead, consider renting (try hirestreetuk.com or frontrow.uk.com). If you do buy new, use the app Good on You to check clothing brands’ sustainability rating. The charity Traid will collect old clothes free of charge for its shops in London, Hertfordshire, Surrey and Brighton.

The global footwear industry emits 700m tonnes of CO 2 a year. AllBirds is a favourite of actors Ashton Kutcher and Amy Adams, and uses sugarcane, sheep’s wool and recycled bottles to make its carbon-neutral trainers. You can recycle old trainers at Runners Need.

7.35am: eat local, eat wonky

Help eliminate food waste by purchasing a “wonky” veg box from Odd Box (from £9.95) or one of Lidl’s Too Good to Waste boxes (£1.50). Alternatively, search Social Farms & Gardens to see how you can get involved at your local community farm.

8am: feed your dog insects

Pets are estimated to consume about 20% of the world’s meat and fish. Reduce your dog’s environmental impact with Yora (£13.99), a protein-packed food made from insects, oats and potato.

8.10am: cycle to work

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Take to the road on a bike. Not so fit? Try an ebike instead.

According to Sam Jones of Cycling UK, only 2% of all journeys in England are taken by bike. Happily, the government has just refreshed its Cycle to Work scheme, extending the tax-free savings to ebikes over £1,000. These have integrated motors, making the scheme more accessible for those with a lower level of fitness or a longer commute.

10am: have an eco-friendly tea break

Make the office a cuppa with an eco-friendly kettle. Vektra’s vacuum eco kettle (£59.95) keeps water hot for four hours, so you don’t have to waste power and water by repeat-boiling.

11am: go green with office supplies

Dr Neil Jennings of the Grantham Institute for climate change and the environment at Imperial College London recommends setting your office printers to double-sided, and automating systems to power down over the weekend and evenings.

12.45pm: switch to an eco-friendly bank

Since the Paris agreement was adopted, the world’s biggest banks have poured $1.9tn into financing the fossil fuel industry. Make the switch on your lunch break – Triodos Bank invests in social and environmental initiatives and publishes details of where it invests.

1pm: enjoy a sustainable lunch

Cook once, eat twice and bring leftovers for lunch. A vegan’s carbon footprint is half that of a meat-eater’s, but if you can’t face forgoing animal products then cut down. Researchers have found that eating just one vegetarian meal a week for a year saves the greenhouse-gas equivalent of driving 1,160 miles. Ditch the tupperware: transport sarnies in black+blum’s stainless steel sandwich box with bamboo lid (£29.95).

3pm: have a guilt-free loo break

Don’t flush anything that isn’t biodegradable, to avoid feeding fatbergs, which block sewers and cost the UK about £100m annually. Flushable wipes and chemical-free sanitary products can be found at Natracare.

4pm: save some trees with your search engine

Only about 30% of the Earth’s forests remain. Change your homepage to Ecosia, which has servers that run on 100% renewable energy and uses its profits to plant trees – almost 60 million of them, so far.

"When it comes to looking effortlessly chic, few nail it quite like the Scandinavians.

Spend just a few moments on Instagram and you’ll see that models, fashion editors and style influencers are head-to-toe in cult Scandi brands like Cos, Acne and By Malene Birger, all of whom pay homage to the minimalist flair that characterises the wardrobes of those in Denmark, Norway and Sweden.

But eccentricity is having a moment on the Scandi fashion scene thanks to the rise of labels like Ganni and now, Saks Potts.

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.

Saks Potts is the playful Copenhagen-based brand taking over Instagram with its flamboyant fur coats and colourful co-ords, which are a far cry from the muted styles that define the aforementioned brands.

The label was launched in 2013 by best friends Barbara Potts and Cathrine Saks, both of whom are 26 years old.

Shape Created with Sketch. Saks Potts: The new Scandinavian fashion brand you need to know about Show all 24 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch.

""We basically started out making what we and our friends wanted to wear,” they tell The Independent.

One of the brand's most recognisable staples is its fluorescent glitter two-pieces, which have been lighting up social media feeds since the mint green style was worn by Selena Gomez in her “Taki Taki” music video.

The exact same co-ord was subsequently sported by Kim Kardashian West's five-year-old daughter, North West, for a family party.

Those with a keen fashion eye might’ve also spotted the monochrome “SP” logo tights doing the rounds at London Fashion Week, which were worn by savvy street stylers underneath everything from flirty floral dresses to oversized blazers.

But it’s the label’s eccentric and vintage-inspired outerwear that is turning the most heads among the fashion set, with model Kendall Jenner leading the way by donning a vivid forest green fur-lined trench coat that made her look like she’d just dashed off the set of Almost Famous.

Other celebrity fans include Lady Gaga, Katy Perry and Cardi B, all of whom have been photographed wearing the label in the last year.

Whether in pastel shades of blue or eye-popping purples, these audacious fur-trimmed coats, like the rest of the label's garments, are made to appear distinctive, explain Potts and Saks.

“The launch of Saks Potts all started with a missing coat,” they explain. “The outerwear market seemed to be ruled by the Scandinavian design aesthetic, which is characterised by architectural lines, muted colours and heavy fabrics like woo. Colours and three-dimensional materials were nowhere to be seen – it was almost as if you were not allowed to stand out in a crowd.”

The designers sought out to break free from what they describe as “the tonal monochrome status quo” and set out to produce experimental clothing that would appeal to those in need of some sartorial wanderlust.

“That was the baseline of our first collection,"" they say.

Aside from its obvious idiosyncratic quirks, another reason why Saks Potts stands out as a fashion label is that it uses real animal fur and skins – namely lamb skin and fox fur – a design choice that heavily goes against an ethical zeitgeist that has seen designers like Burberry and Chanel eschew fur in the place of faux alternatives.

“We love natural fur, because it’s both beautiful and sustainable,” Saks and Potts explain, adding that they source it from local fur farms in Denmark, which they say is renowned for its animal welfare being among the best in the world.

“Fake fur made of plastic just can’t create the same kind of elegant aesthetics and feel from a designers’ perspective.

“Natural fur is also one of the world’s most sustainable and long-lasting materials that begins and ends in nature, and that’s among the reasons why so many designers are using it.”

“Fur keeps you warm, and that’s important to remember when you are an outerwear brand coming from cold Denmark,” they add.

In an age that is becoming increasingly ethically-conscious, the brand’s decision to use real fur might be unconventional, but they’re clearly not interested in following the crowd.

Prices range from £245 for shiny Space age T-shirts loved by fashion editors to £1,500 for the Insta-famous coats."
"Livestock farmers play major role in looking after the landscape and safeguarding thousands of jobs, writes Jak O’Donnell

Having worked in the restaurant industry for a number of years, I’ve seen a lot of trends and fads come and go, but high quality local ingredients never go out of fashion. Recently, this has picked up pace as a shift in attitudes towards consumption is becoming more widespread – especially among younger people.

Jak O'Donnell, Chef/Patron of The Sisters Restaurants, Glasgow

I’ve noticed a particular rise in people favouring a ‘locavore’ diet of high quality, traceable and sustainable ingredients that tell a story.

These are ‘mindful eating’ practices whereby rather than choosing exotic ingredients and global brands, consumers are increasingly favouring authenticity, independent businesses and products produced locally (Mintel Global Consumer Trends 2019). In Scotland, we have this in abundance.

Let’s take Scotland’s red meat industry as an example. Per head, we’re the biggest consumers of it in the UK, reflected in figures that show 90 per cent of Scottish households bought beef during 2018 (Kantar Worldpanel), higher than the UK average of 86 per cent.

However, as headlines continue to be made regarding negativities surrounding the consumption of red meat – largely based on global statistics – there’s never been a more important time to communicate our unique offering. When you look at the facts and isolate Scotland’s farming practices, we actually have a really strong case to refute much of what is being said.

Indeed, research by Censuswide on behalf of Quality Meat Scotland revealed 81 per cent of adults think we should safeguard the industry by buying and eating Scottish red meat.

In Scotland, livestock farms play a major role in looking after the landscape. Eighty per cent of Scotland’s farmland is comprised of grass and farmland not suitable for growing crops, but ideal for producing beef, and grazing animals are needed for the habitats of many species.

Beef that bears the Scotch Beef PGI logo is guaranteed to be born, reared and processed in Scotland to the most stringent quality and welfare standards, and as a member of the Scotch Beef Club, all of the beef I serve bears this assurance.

As a proud advocate of Scotland’s red meat industry it’s incredibly important to me to help preserve the livelihood of Scotland’s farmers and the wider supply chain. For every 1,000 jobs in on-farm production and processing, red meat production supports a further 118 jobs in the supply chain (An assessment of the economic contribution of Scotland’s red meat supply chain, 2016 – A report to QMS by Andrew Moxey).

It’s encouraging to see recent efforts being made in light of this. Quality Meat Scotland has recently launched its ‘Know Your Beef’ campaign for its Scotch Beef PGI brand, which is attempting to address these claims while answering what people are searching for – simple, delicious recipes using classic Scottish fare from sustainable sources.

We know that people are becoming more interested in knowing exactly where their food is coming from – it’s a question that we as restaurateurs get asked all the time.

I firmly believe we should be held accountable for what we are serving, which is why we have a duty to source traceable ingredients from trusted suppliers.

While I have no doubt that veganism and vegetarian diets will continue to become mainstream, I believe a strong argument for conscious consumption can be put forward, especially when it comes to Scottish produce.

To revisit the fact made earlier whereby 81 per cent of Scots believe we should support the Scottish farming industry, I’m proud to share these truths with consumers so they can be armed with the correct knowledge to make the right decisions about what they are eating when it comes to red meat that is farmed, processed and eventually on plates in Scotland.

"I recently spent two years living in Chicago. As a British person adapting to life in America, I faced various struggles: terrible public transport, the complex rules of baseball, the virtual non-existence of meringues. But none were as all-consuming as the daily struggle to remain at a comfortable temperature. My days were spent either piling on jumpers and thermals, or reluctantly dressing in the lightest materials I could find. Chicago in the winter is so cold that any day above zero degrees is considered balmy. The surface of Lake Michigan freezes over, and sprays its sharp crystals at the nearby trees, transforming them into otherworldly bubbles of ice.

At last, the season changes. You gratefully breathe in gulps of spring before June arrives with its searing heat. Chicago is hardly alone in facing these extremes. The US is a land of glaciers and deserts, and of wild swings between summer heat and winter freeze. So perhaps it’s no surprise that Americans dedicate such a large amount of energy to heating and cooling their buildings; 40 per cent of the energy consumed in an average home is used to maintain comfortable temperatures for its residents, and it makes up around 13 per cent of the country’s total energy use.

In 2010, residential space heating in the US was responsible for 324million tonnes of carbon dioxide. But heating or cooling an entire building is a wasteful task: not only are you ensuring the comfort of its human inhabitants, but also its tables, sofas, and bookshelves – objects that don’t even care that it’s so cold you haven’t even left the house for three days.

Faced with this inefficiency, scientists and entrepreneurs across the US are trying to find ways to approach heating and cooling so that it focuses on the human body itself. One obvious way to do this is through textiles. We (almost) all wear clothes. From thick sweaters and long-johns in the winter to shorts and t-shirts in the summer, our choice of apparel is central to keeping us comfortable. But this only works to a point, says Gihan Amarasiriwardena, founder of the clothing company Ministry of Supply.

“It’s the dramatic switches between environments that cause the greatest discomfort,” he explains. “People get up at 6AM, they have a shower, and they’d be feeling fresh. But then they’d hop on the subway and it’s 85 degrees and 100 per cent humidity in there, and they get to the office and they’re completely drenched. I kept hearing that story, people saying, ‘I get to the office and I’m freezing.’”

Amarasiriwardena, a former MIT engineer, decided to design a business shirt that could deal with these pressures by changing itself. In doing so, he realised that city commuters weren’t the first people to deal with dramatic changes in temperature during their everyday lives: it was also a problem for astronauts. The lack of atmosphere in space leads to extreme swings – the sunlit side of the moon is hotter than the Sahara, while the dark side can drop to around -170C – and space suits, in particular gloves, need to be able to deal with such fluctuations.

In the 1980s, Nasa began experimenting with phase-change materials in its clothing. This technology means a textile can absorb and hold heat at high temperatures, creating a cooling effect, and release it at low temperatures, warming the wearer of the garment. The same technology – which Amarasiriwardena likens to paraffin wax surrounded by a plastic straw – is also useful on earth. At his company, these yarns are woven into a fabric that looks and feels like the material used in a classic dress shirt, but can adapt to its wearer’s body temperature throughout the day.

Amarasiriwardena is not alone in confronting this problem, yet he’s managed to successfully commercialise his textile. The US government has given money to various research programmes inventing new ways to create cooler humans rather than cooler houses. While most of these efforts remain in laboratories a range of innovative textiles could, in the future, change how we keep ourselves comfortable, whatever the weather.

Shanhui Fan is a professor at Stanford who is developing one of these alternative approaches. His laboratory has created a textile that allows infrared radiation to pass through the material, using nanostructures, creating a dramatically cooler garment. “When we’re sitting in a room, more than half of the heat dissipation of your body into the room comes from radiation. So being able to influence this radiation is very important,” he explains. “The conventional textile, for example cotton, turns out to be a very good absorber of radiation, so, as far as getting heat out is concerned, this is not the best solution.”

He’s now working on taking this concept out of the laboratory and incorporating it in products that can be manufactured at a larger scale. Fan has already patented the technology; the main challenge now is to weave it into something that looks and feels like clothing people would want to wear. He’s currently working with a commercial textiles facility to develop a process that will allow these nanostructures to be manufactured, while also “preserving the characteristics we as humans demand textiles have”, he tells me.

The US government has pumped funds into other cooling technologies including an adaptive material by San Francisco based laboratory Otherlab, which changes its thickness according to the temperature. This creates an insulating layer of air when the temperature drops, trapping heat to keep its wearer warm. Another cloth, developed by engineers at the University of California - Irvine, imitates the properties of squid skin to capture and release body heat.

Currently, fashion is doing the environment more harm than good, leaving a slew of chemicals, pesticides and waste in its wake. And, in a world of instantaneous fashion and £1 bikinis, a new generation of smart new materials are not going to materialise overnight – certainly not to the extent that offices will be prepared to turn down the thermostats.

Yet such smart materials could be the basis of apparel that helps rather than hinders our efforts to tackle climate change. The planet is heating up, and if early adopters find they can turn down the AC a notch or two in their own homes, then these lab experiments will have saved a little extra energy – and made us more comfortable in the process.

"Chupi’s jewellery designs made her a household name. Now, with designer Kate Nolan, her new fashion label focuses on made-to-measure pieces for the environmentally-aware woman. Niamh O’Donoghue pays a visit to Atrium

How can you tell the difference between silk made from worms and silk made from wood pulp? Unless you investigate their genetic makeup side-by-side under a microscope, you can’t. They’re both soft to touch and have that classic high-fashion finish that makes silk so desirable. Traditional silk can be ecologically damaging and expensive to manufacture but eucalyptus silk, by comparison, is manufactured with zero waste, as well as being totally biodegradable.

“In 300 years’ time, there will be no trace that there ever was a shirt,” says Kate Nolan, co-founder of Atrium, Ireland’s newest addition to slow fashion shopping.

Built on a core bedrock of ethical and responsible shopping, as well as traceability, Atrium was launched in 2018 by long-time industry friends Kate Nolan and Chupi Sweetman.

The pair had already built the foundation they needed to start a clothing brand of their own: Over 30 years between them working in the fast fashion sector, a beautiful retail space in the heart of Dublin city centre, ample relationships with suppliers and designers, and a fervent devotion for responsible fashion to boot. Having spent so long working with disposable clothing, the women joined forces to build a home for Irish design, and thus sprouted Atrium.

“We came together during the year of Irish design in 2015 when both Chupi and I represented Ireland during London Fashion Week,” Kate tells me as we walk through the brightly lit, airy loft on the top floor of the Powerscourt Centre.

There was a huge gap here for someone to represent the best designers that were being recognised at home and on an international scale.

Atrium, previously known as Made, quietly launched its first limited collection in January 2019 with a sublime edit of of sustainable cashmere wears. Beautiful and form-fitting alpaca-wool pieces instantly drew a crowd not least for their soft-touch and luxurious feel but for their accessible price point, too. The collection was produced by a women’s co-op in Nepal who sourced and manufactured the fine, layerable garments.

It cemented Kate and Chupi’s commitment for and mission to produce high-quality, fair-trade produce from the onset. “Sustainability is not the lead reason behind Atrium,” says Kate, “but it’s our ethos and sustainability is at the heart of what we do.

“We work with baby alpaca wool because the collection method is very sustainable. The farming of alpaca wool isn’t as intensive as say, sheep farming, and it’s got amazing thermal qualities so it keeps you warm in winter and cool during warming months, so it’s a lovely transitional piece.”

For their second collection for spring/summer 2019, Kate and Chupi took a gamble working with Irish linen, creating a series of easy-to-wear tops, dresses, and trousers in beautiful, rich, and earthy tones. While trends come and go, linen has a timeless allure. It’s romantic and fresh, expressive, and unobtrusive. It has the right amount of sex appeal and can go from boardroom to dinner party in one clean swoop (save for a change of shoes).

“For SS19 we did an amazing collaboration with the Republic’s last remaining and working linen mill in Co Wexford. We wanted to explore linen and think it’s not utilised enough in Ireland anymore,” says Kate.

I take time to examine each item, my favourite being a full button-down dress in black and cream. I think about how I can wear it opened up as a top layer or light jacket, or buttoned up and belted. There’s a blush pink and charcoal variation too that are rich in depth against pale, blue Irish skin. This is the thing about Kate and Chupi’s designs: they create functional pieces that answers all of your ‘what will I wear today?’ conundrums. Atrium’s designs can be worn on their own without having to think about what to do with them and it’s this coupling of functionality and form that will win the hearts of Irish women, regardless of age or profession.

“We’re designing the missing elements to our current wardrobe. The Atrium woman is a conscious shopper and she’s aware of what’s going on in the world,” says Kate.

She has a bit of extra income to spend but she isn’t driven by solely one thing, she’s practical: She needs to get into work, she needs to look the part and feel the part.

""She is self-assured and wants to know that what she’s buying is of quality and not doing any damage to the environment. We want to keep it simple,” says Kate as we move from rail to rail.

“Atrium isn’t just for people like me or Chupi. Our design is a slow evolution: You start with one thing and think you know what you want to create and as time goes on, it turns into something totally different.”

Kate and Chupi are completely opposite, but it’s this dynamic that makes their business so successful, both economically and creatively. Kate points to a cream alpaca sweater from the SS19 collection to help solidify her thesis: “Take this sweater for instance. This is a perfect example of me and Chupi combined. The cut and feel is very me, but the ribbon is more Chupi. She pushes me and she would say the same of me. It keeps you constantly revitalised. You don’t always like it when you hear a different opinion, but at the same time it opens you up to the alternative perspective and that’s really vital.”

The crown jewel and stand-out piece of the Atrium SS19 collection is a two-piece, terracotta, handmade silk and wool-blend suit. Every detail is considered, from the double-breasted blazer and notch lapel to the slightly exaggerated shoulder caps, which perfectly echoes this season’s love-affair with the ’70s era. For many women today, wearing a suit to work is a choice and not a requirement, so, in the context of tailoring, this really is a ‘Power Suit’ with a capital P. The slight drop in the shoulders and wide, pintuck, flared pants give this otherwise feminine suit a masculine permutation.

And as two women CEOs, creating an authoritative yet wearable piece like this is culturally relevant, especially at a time when the politics of fashion are so closely observed. A not-so-silent proverbial nod to smashed ceilings everywhere. “Today’s workwear is more fluid,” says Kate. “These women want to make a statement by wearing it, rather than being obliged to wear one depending on their industry or profession.”

Of course, those who aren’t partial to pink terracotta can try a neutral oatmeal choice instead.

Pieces from the new collection include Atrium’s Irish linen smocked dress, €169.

We turn our attention to sizing, referencing — almost in unison — how men are uniform in shape, but how no two women are the same. To combat this, and to create an inclusive and encouraging space, Atrium works with a group of female seamstresses and tailors in Dublin who provide alterations free of charge. Women today want more choice and control yet buying bespoke is expensive and not widely available. Atrium is a great middle-point for customers who want a similar bespoke experience at a lower cost. Women come in all shapes and sizes; mass-produced clothes don’t. Atrium is creating a coherent response to this frustration.

There’s no standard to sizing anymore and it’s expensive to buy a pair of trousers and then have them altered. I think a lot of it is getting comfortable with your body shape and not being fearful of clothes or shapes. If one of our garments isn’t fitting then we can alter that.

The overarching theme of Atrium’s SS19 collection is inspired by the ’70s, with dramatic collars, oversized cuffs, and sharp silhouettes. For AW19, however, the focus will be on outerwear. “We have a collection of beautiful fabrics and we’re really interested in creating amazing outerwear; beautifully simple but amazingly cut coats in a selection of beautiful fabrics. Chupi loves a bold coat but I’m more minimal and subdued. We meet in the middle somewhere.”

Chupi and Kate opened the shopfront to international brands like New York-based designer Mara Hoffman and Spanish hand-crafted shoe label Miista, the likes of which give Atrium an expansive, worldwide appeal. “It is as good as you’ll find in London or New York,” says Kate as we walk past a selection of curated Miista shoes.

Each label, she explains, must meet certain criteria in order to be stocked, namely that if the brand outsources production, that it has control of its chain supply and workers are paid fairly and work in safe conditions: “We don’t expect everyone to be perfect, but we definitely strive for it. We opened the store during a period when the industry really started to change, so the calibre of how designers are transforming their businesses into sustainable ones are pretty amazing.”

Kate and Chupi are champions of Irish design. Their commitment to safeguarding and exhibiting it is apparent from the moment you step into the crafted shop space: Pops of colour from Electronic Sheep’s recognisable scarf motifs come to the fore around the space and Orla Lanigan’s handmade ‘denim-meets-sports’ designs brings a freshness to everyday denim. Designs from Natalie B Coleman, Jill De Burca and Alanna Plekkenpol, as well as Chupi’s own jewellery collection, are housed in the shop year-round too.

Brands are chosen not just for design and retail ability but simply because Kate and Chupi believe in them. Kate says: “Particularly with Irish designers, when we see someone doing something really interesting then we love to get them in. It’s not necessarily because they fit with the mould of the store, but because we believe in what they’re doing.”

The ultimate prize though for the environmentally considered shopper, apart from buying the best in Irish design, is knowing that in 300 years, there will be no trace of it left on the planet."
"Two of Britain's biggest fashion retailers, Topshop and Primark, have policies that allow people as young as 14 to work in their supply chains.

The child labour policies were put back in the spotlight on Tuesday when representatives from some of the biggest brands on the UK high street appeared before MPs to discuss sustainability and ethical practice within the fashion industry.

The Environmental Audit Committee asked a panel of retailers to explain how their companies would define a ""child"" within their supply chain.

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.

Representatives from Arcadia and Marks & Spencer both said that the minimum age of workers that they employ in supply factories is 15, which is the school leaving age in countries such as Colombia and Indonesia.

Paul Lister, head of ethical trade at Primark, stated that the company defines a child as being under the age of 16.

However, his statement didn't fall in line with Primark’s published code of conduct, which outlines that the company regards a child as being under the age of 15.

And while Primark's guidelines on child labour may claim to not employ any youngsters under the age of 15 in its supply factories, there are loopholes in the law that could lead to a child as young as 14 joining the workforce.

The retailer's code of conduct says that it doesn't employ anyone under the age of 15, except in developing countries where there's a minimum working age of 14.

This means that in countries such as India, Pakistan and Tanzania, where some of Primark's supply factories are based and there's a minimum working age of 14, children of that age may be hired to manufacture clothing.

Arcadia's code of conduct also follows these same guidelines, which were enacted in 1973 by a International Labour Organisation (ILO) convention.

The convention states that a country ""whose economy and educational facilities are insufficiently developed"" may specify a minimum working age of 14.

The ETI estimates that there are approximately 211m children under the age of 15 working around the world.

60 per cent of this underage workforce can be found in Asia, the organisation explains.

In the UK, a child can only start working full-time once they’ve reached “minimum school leaving age”."
"Forget kale and butternut squash, vegan leather is the latest buzzword among the fashion pack.

The first Vegan Fashion Week will take place in Los Angeles next month, while Natalie Portman and Serena Williams have started to promote “veather” — formerly known as pleather.

Like faux fur, veather is made of plastic. Yet while fake fuzz has been condemned by experts (and the fur industry) for not being sustainable or easily recycled, vegan leather is not technically bad for the environment.

“You can pop vegan leather into your recycling and it could be changed into something new or taken apart and repurposed,” says Mary Creagh, chairwoman of the Commons environmental audit committee. “You cannot do that with fake fur; it is at the end of…"
"The department of labour's Supported Employment Enterprises (SEE) initiative employs nearly 1,000 people with disabilities, with the capacity for another 3,000. Picture: Department of Labour/Supplied

Johannesburg - A Department of Labour initiative which dates back to the second world war is helping create jobs for handicapped people who have borne the brunt of South Africa's unemployment scourge. Official data shows that some 4.7 million people live with disabilities in South Africa, of whom 10 to 15 percent require an environment such as the department's Supported Employment Enterprises (SEE), a projected established after World War II to provide jobs for veterans.

The SEE initiative current boasts 12 factories which operate in seven of the country's nine provinces and employ nearly 1 000 people with disabilities, with the capacity for another 3 000.

The factories manufacture some 3 000 products for hospitals, schools and the police force, including furniture, textiles, metalwork, leather work, canvas work, book-binding and screen printing.

In rural areas, SEE has created another 1 100 jobs indirectly. It transports school desks which are assembled by local carpenters who also do repairs when needed, establishing a sustainable eco-system.

The SEE project has provided employment for disabled people such as Andrew Moeketsi, who had one of his legs amputated after he was shot in a hijacking in 2003.

Another beneficiary is Louise Badenhorst, a textile designer, pattern maker and fashion designer with Friedreich's ataxia, an autosomal recessive inherited disease that causes progressive damage to the nervous system, while Hannelie Roos, who was left with a traumatic brain injury after a head-on collision, is about to retire with a pension after 38 years at SEE.

In addition to contributing to South Africa's manufacturing sector, the non-profit SEE initiative pays all its own expenses and staff. Dennis Matsepe, a deputy director for business development in the department of labour, markets and sells SEE's products.

African News Agency (ANA)"
"PARIS (Reuters) - Louis Vuitton owner LVMH on Wednesday set a high bar for rival luxury goods companies all trying to capitalize on Chinese demand for high-end handbags and clothing, as sales growth at the conglomerate picked up pace in the first quarter.

Some luxury manufacturers are struggling more than others to hold onto their all-important Chinese clients, who make up over a third of industry sales and are increasingly spending on high-end wares at home rather than overseas.

LVMH - which cited a “buoyant environment” at the start of the year and said all regions were experiencing “good growth” - has been one of the big beneficiaries of thriving appetite among younger Chinese shoppers for branded goods.

It did not break down its performance by country on Wednesday, with more details due on a Thursday conference call with analysts.

But it had previously flagged enduring demand in China in the first weeks of January, even against the backdrop of a slowing economy.

The French conglomerate, which owns other labels like Christian Dior in fashion or Krug in champagne, was boosted by a strong performance in its leather goods unit, while sales of spirits like cognac improved from a quarter earlier.

Group revenues rose 16 percent to 12.5 billion euros ($14.1 billion) in the period, up 11 percent on a like-for-like basis, which strips out currency swings and the impact of acquisitions or disposals.

That beat analyst forecasts and marked an acceleration from the 9 percent growth notched up a quarter earlier.

Its performance bodes well for peers who derive much of their profits from high-margin handbags, and which have also proved a hit with consumers in recent years, like Kering’s Gucci or Birkin bag maker Hermes.

Yet the gap is also growing among brands benefiting from a strong presence in mainland China, and those trying to catch up there as the Chinese government looks to fuel more domestic spending by cutting VAT or import duties.

Jeweler Tiffany has flagged a spending slowdown among Chinese tourists in the United States, while Prada noted a slowdown among this clientele in Hong Kong in the fourth quarter, as the weaker yuan and the backdrop of a Beijing-Washington trade war also took its toll.

LVMH shares closed up 2.45 percent on Wednesday before the results were published, at 329.8 euros per share - just shy of a recent record high of 337.5 euros hit earlier this month."
"Walmart Inc on Tuesday said it will acquire Eloquii, a fashion startup that sells plus-sized clothing, for an undisclosed amount as it continues to look for ways to appeal to younger shoppers and differentiate from rival Amazon.com Inc.

Eloquii, a four-year-old startup, sells apparel starting at size 14 through its own website and through five of its own stores. Walmart, the world’s largest brick-and-mortar retailer, said Eloquii has seen its revenue grow by three times since 2015, without giving more details.

Plus-size apparel is part of a $21 billion market and represents one of the fastest growing segments in women’s apparel, Walmart said in a statement. More than half of women between the ages of 18 to 65 in the United States wear size 14 or higher, the retailer said.

“These customers have been historically underserved, with clothing limited by its lack of fashion, lack of fit, or both,” Walmart said.

The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer has previously acquired smaller digital brands like Modcloth and Bonobos to complement its online assortment.

Eloquii CEO Mariah Chase, the startup’s management team and 100 employees will continue to be based in Long Island City, New York, and Columbus, Ohio. They will join Walmart’s U.S. e-commerce team, reporting to Andy Dunn, senior vice-president of digital consumer brands at Walmart U.S. eCommerce.

“We are laser focused on developing a portfolio of direct to consumer brands with a unique assortment you can’t find anywhere else,” Dunn said in a separate blog post on Tuesday.

The Eloquii brand was first created by retail chain The Limited in 2011 but was discontinued a little over a year later. A team of employees with help from an outside investor bought the brand and relaunched it in 2014.

Walmart said the deal is expected to close this quarter."
"An former shop assistant who launched a fashion website that turns over £40M a year, which is loved by celebrities, has revealed how she juggles looking after her young twins with running a business empire.

Emma Watkinson, 32, from London, co-founded women's clothing retailer SilkFred in 2011 and the business has enjoyed meteoric success, scooping countless awards.

The site, which sells clothing from 600 independent brands, is hugely popular with celebrities and influencers, including Made in Chelsea and Love Island stars.

Louise Thompson, Ashley James and Binky Felstead have all been spotted in SilkFred brands, as well as Love Island celebrities like Cara De La Hoyde.

Emma Watkinson, 32, founded the online fashion empire after a chance encounter abroad with her now co-founder Stephen

Born in Liverpool to entrepreneurial parents, Emma studied English at university but always dreamed of running her own shop like her mother.

A career in fashion ensued, until a chance meeting in Spain helped Emma to finally realise her dream.

She began her career working part-time on the shop floor at Whistles in 2005 whilst studying at university and then went on to work on fashion magazines and with various retailers.

Celebrities like Ashley James (pictured) regularly wear the brand - in this snap, the starlet wore a Silkfred dress

In 2011, at the age of 24, she met Stephen Jackson, a financial trader, while she was working for a company that had a luxury boutique in Marbella.

And when they returned to London, he asked her to meet him in a fast food chain to talk over a business idea.

His friend had invested in an independent handbag brand, and Stephen asked Emma's advice on how to help the fashion business grow.

Made in Chelsea star and fitness guru Louise Thompson has also long been a fan of SilkFred's bold looks

The pair quickly realised there was a real opportunity to help all the independent brands get out to market, and that the high street customers were ready for something new and exciting.

They co-founded SilkFred alongside Stephen's sister Kate.

The trio managed to secure investment from three investors, who Emma calls her 'angels', allowing them to build the technology, begin signing up brands and start selling fashionable clothes

After some time, they started crowdfunding for the business and ended up raising £145,000.

The mother of twins launched the business in 2011. Silkfred reportedly turned over £40 million last year

Emma admits: 'We had to work hard to keep the business funded, especially when we didn't have as much traction. Even when we started to grow quickly, it was still a struggle.'

'The traditional VCs didn't see our potential, we weren't the next Facebook as far as they were concerned.'

'Our angel investors from the beginning and the new ones we found along the way believed in us and backed us as we continued to bring them better and better results.'

But Emma recalls the early days of business as 'exciting, tough, lonely, scary and fun all at the same time.'

Presenter Deborah James, aka Bowel Babe, is also a fan of the brand (pictured here with Davina McCall)

'The first challenge was getting people to buy into our dream.

'No one had heard of the brands we wanted to work with, no one had heard of us. I didn't have a reputation in the industry. I had very few contacts.'

The entrepreneur admits that the brand struggled to find their audience at first, and that the company had to figure out how to sell online.

But after a steep learning curve, the brand were able to navigate the logistics and get the business up and running.

Love Island star Cara De La Hoyde wore SilkFred maternity brands while pregnant with her son Freddie

The entrepreneur believes her founding a business has made her a 'stronger, more resilient person' but admits she struggles to switch off

SilkFred are always seeking new brands to stock, although Emma says it's no longer part of her role as CEO.

'We have a team of brand scouts who go to trade shows, markets and events. They always have their fingers on the pulse and always researching new brands on social media.'

Emma, who is now a married mother of 10-month-old twins, also believes her struggles in business have made her 'a stronger, more resilient person'.

Her typical day involves waking up at around 6am to feed her daughters, before sharing a coffee with husband Victor and heading off to the office.

Emma recalls the early days of business as being a mix of emotions, as she describes it as often being tough, lonely and scary

The 32 year old, who still works as CEO for the brand, has been vocal about helping other woman into business

She then has a morning of meetings with various team members, brands and investors.

She revealed: 'I try to keep a few hours back in the afternoon to catch up on emails or work on plans and strategy for the future.'

But the mother of two says she tries to make the time to get home in time for bath and bed with the girls at 7pm.

Later in the evening, she takes phone calls and ties up any loose ends from the day, before one last scroll through her emails and bed.

She admits she struggles to switch off, because thoughts about the brand are 'free flowing', and says she enjoys 'thinking through how to solve problems or come up with new ideas to make life better for brands and customers.'

"Barnawartha biodiesel plant bounces back to life, as industry calls for more government support

Posted

Australia's largest renewable biodiesel producer has restarted operations in north-east Victoria just three years after it was driven to closure.

Key points: Just Biodiesel will produce up to 50 million litres of biodiesel each year at the Barnawartha site

The plant's general manager says the prospect of an increasing excise was a big issue

Biodiesel is mainly made from tallow and recycled vegetable oil and is considered a green alternative to diesel

Just Biodiesel has partnered with Refueling Solutions to re-commission the Barnawartha-based plant to potentially produce up to 50 million litres of biodiesel each year, including B5, B20 and B100 fuels.

The Barnawartha plant was formerly operated by Australian Renewable Fuels before it fell into voluntary administration in early 2016 and 30 local jobs were lost due to competitive oil prices at the time.

The company also pointed the finger at the Federal Government for its collapse, after taxation was rolled out on biofuels under the 2014 federal budget. This came despite 2011 legislation outlining renewable fuels would be excise free until 2021.

Taxation remains a concern for the company's operations, with the excise rate for domestic biodiesel at more than 13 per cent this financial year.

That will gradually rise to 50 per cent in the year 2030 and beyond.

Just Biodiesel general manager Greg Boyall said the prospect of an increasing excise was a big issue.

""It's one of the major hurdles of the development of a successful biodiesel industry,"" he said.

""We'll work around it by looking at where the best opportunity to sell biodiesel is, whether it be domestic or export.""

Calls for Australia to become more biodiesel friendly

Biodiesel is made from a range of feedstock — primarily tallow and recycled vegetable oil.

It can be used in existing diesel engines without modifications needed and is covered by major engine manufacturers' warranties.

Blends typically range from 5 per cent biodiesel (B5) through to 20 per cent (B20).

The chair of Bioenergy Australia, John Hewson, described the Barnawartha plant as being of national significance, but criticised the government for severely lagging in renewable fuel policy.

""Right now one of the most challenging issues that has been consistently neglected by government is fuel security,"" Dr Hewson said.

""In those circumstances we've got to start thinking about the resource we've got, the feedstock we've got, and the opportunities they present not in terms of biodiesel but more broadly.""

Bioenergy Australia has stated that a national biofuel industry could create more than 8,000 direct and indirect jobs, as well as contribute more than $1 billion to regional communities.

The new Barnawartha operation has now welcomed 11 former AR Fuels employees back to its 16-strong workforce.

""The opportunities being demonstrated here are transferable right across the country,"" Dr Hewson said.

""If you look across regional Australia there are feedstocks spread everywhere, and we don't have a national fuel security strategy and we don't have a national waste management strategy.

""These things come together pretty well, I think, when you look at regional Australia.""

Bio for business

Sales and service-based company Scania Australia last year signed a memorandum of understanding with three providers in the bio-fuels industry — Bioenergy Australia Members, Wilmar Bioethanol Australia, and Ecotech Biodiesel — in a bid to embrace cleaner fuel options.

Over recent years, the company has rolled out biofuel compatible buses and trucks in Australia.

The company's sustainable solutions manager, Anthony King, said growing operations like Barnawartha's biodiesel plant helped promote greener alternatives for business.

""From our point of view by running biodiesel you can get an 83 per cent carbon reduction, which is pretty much key for us in operating vehicles in this environment,"" Mr King said.

But he said he would like to see more contribution from government to help make biofuels a more attractive alternative for investors and consumers.

""We can't do it alone. To us it's about partnerships and it's about driving a shift towards a sustainable society.""

The re-commissioning of the plant has been welcomed by the Independent Member for Indi, Helen Haines.

""I'm delighted because it shows yet again that renewable energy sources such as biodiesel is something that the community wants,"" she said.

""The population wants to play their part in reducing global emissions and here we are in Barnawartha showing that's entirely possible.""

"PETA has announced the winners of its annual Fashion Awards, which celebrates the brands and events that have made major statements for animals this year.

The fashion industry has come under scrutiny in previous years from animal rights campaigners, who criticise labels that insist on using real fur.

But 2018 saw many luxury labels abandon the practice once and for all, including Coach, Burberry, Michael Kors and Diane von Furstenberg, who were all named as winners in PETA’s biggest luxury fashion moment category for their actions.

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.

ASOS was named the most progressive online platform by PETA in light of its announcement that it will introduce a ban on mohair, silk, feathers and cashmere products on its site.

Elsewhere, PETA’s most progressive fashion event of the year was awarded to Helsinki Fashion Week for its decision to ban leather from its catwalks as of 2019.

On the high street, faux fur label Ecopel was honoured with the innovation award for using recycled plastic bottles to produce its garments.

""Vegan living is now the fastest-growing lifestyle across all developed economies, and consumers are looking to purchase clothes and accessories that are consistent with their values for both animals and the planet,"" says PETA Director Elisa Allen.

""The fashion industry is increasingly embracing vegan fabrics, and the days of treating sentient beings as raw materials are numbered.""

Other winners included Dr Martens, which was awarded for its extensive range of vegan shoes on the best vegan boot collection category, and Veja, which received the best vegan shoe collection prize for its vegan leather and organic cotton collection.

Meanwhile, London-based label Felder Felder took home the collaboration award for partnering with sustainable fashion label Ecoalf to produce a capsule collection of coats made from recycled materials; outerwear brand Save the Duck was awarded best down-free label for its recycled coats free of animal fillers; and Alexandra K won in the best vegan bags category for its innovative accessories made from apple leather, a sustainable material made in Italy that integrates organic apple peels into the skin of the material.

Faux fur label Jakke won the best wool-free collection award for its new range of knitwear that proudly proclaims to be entirely free from wool.

PETA, whose motto includes the line “animals are not ours to wear” is currently campaigning for high street brand Forever 21 to stop selling garments made with wool, the production of which involves harmful practices that are hugely detrimental to sheep, the organisation claims.

Ahead of Black Friday, PETA supporters gathered outside the label’s Oxford Street store in central London holding placards saying “Never21” and “stop selling cruel wool,” urging shoppers to boycott the brand.

“PETA is calling on caring people to give sheep some peace on Earth this Christmas by choosing only wool-free, vegan apparel,” Allen adds.

"PETA has announced the winners of its annual Fashion Awards, which celebrates the brands and events that have made major statements for animals this year.

The fashion industry has come under scrutiny in previous years from animal rights campaigners, who criticise labels that insist on using real fur.

But 2018 saw many luxury labels abandon the practice once and for all, including Coach, Burberry, Michael Kors and Diane von Furstenberg, who were all named as winners in PETA’s biggest luxury fashion moment category for their actions.

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.

ASOS was named the most progressive online platform by PETA in light of its announcement that it will introduce a ban on mohair, silk, feathers and cashmere products on its site.

Elsewhere, PETA’s most progressive fashion event of the year was awarded to Helsinki Fashion Week for its decision to ban leather from its catwalks as of 2019.

On the high street, faux fur label Ecopel was honoured with the innovation award for using recycled plastic bottles to produce its garments.

""Vegan living is now the fastest-growing lifestyle across all developed economies, and consumers are looking to purchase clothes and accessories that are consistent with their values for both animals and the planet,"" says PETA Director Elisa Allen.

""The fashion industry is increasingly embracing vegan fabrics, and the days of treating sentient beings as raw materials are numbered.""

Other winners included Dr Martens, which was awarded for its extensive range of vegan shoes on the best vegan boot collection category, and Veja, which received the best vegan shoe collection prize for its vegan leather and organic cotton collection.

Meanwhile, London-based label Felder Felder took home the collaboration award for partnering with sustainable fashion label Ecoalf to produce a capsule collection of coats made from recycled materials; outerwear brand Save the Duck was awarded best down-free label for its recycled coats free of animal fillers; and Alexandra K won in the best vegan bags category for its innovative accessories made from apple leather, a sustainable material made in Italy that integrates organic apple peels into the skin of the material.

Faux fur label Jakke won the best wool-free collection award for its new range of knitwear that proudly proclaims to be entirely free from wool.

PETA, whose motto includes the line “animals are not ours to wear” is currently campaigning for high street brand Forever 21 to stop selling garments made with wool, the production of which involves harmful practices that are hugely detrimental to sheep, the organisation claims.

Ahead of Black Friday, PETA supporters gathered outside the label’s Oxford Street store in central London holding placards saying “Never21” and “stop selling cruel wool,” urging shoppers to boycott the brand.

“PETA is calling on caring people to give sheep some peace on Earth this Christmas by choosing only wool-free, vegan apparel,” Allen adds.

"As tensions in Hong Kong continue to escalate after months of political unrest, China has sought to rein in international brands that have mistakenly identified the semiautonomous territory - and other Chinese-claimed lands - as independent countries.

From Versace to Givenchy, brands have swiftly offered apologies to China over their references to Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao on their websites and on items of clothing. The online backlash and calls to boycott the brands come at a highly sensitive time for China, with Hong Kong rocked by protests - which kicked off in June - over concerns that Beijing is encroaching on the territory's autonomy.

The Chinese market is key for luxury brands, and many have been quick to publicly express regret over clothing designs that have upset Chinese consumers.

Taking to Instagram on Sunday, Donatella Versace, head of the legendary Italian fashion house that her brother founded, said she was ""deeply sorry,"" alluding to the Chinese social media firestorm that erupted over the weekend. At the centre of the backlash was a photo of a Versace T-shirt that suggested Hong Kong and Macao were independent countries, not part of China."

"Eko Hotels and Suites, Lagos this week made history by becoming the first hospitality outfit in the country to consciously and officially migrate its activities in such a way that would reduce the carbon foot print of the hotel and reduce the greenhouse effect of carbon emission to the environment.

The hotel officially launched its environmental friendly mode of operation through the Eco Friendly Arts competition that was held for children from primary and secondary schools within the hotel’s council area.

Prior to the arts competition, the hotel had, in a release, said the board and management made a corporate decision to officially embark on an eco-friendly way of life due its concern about its immediate environment and the global community.

It said: “Eko Hotels is determined to make considerable investment in ensuring a more eco-friendly culture is embedded into the daily operation of its business. To this extent, they accept they have a responsibility not just to their shareholders, but also to their host community, future generations and the larger society, so they are committed to ensuring that their environment is preserved and properly catered to, promoting a healthier, safer and more sustainable business space.”

Speaking on the new initiative and new way of doing business, the hotel’s chairman, Mr. Christopher Chagoury, said: “We are far more than just a global and local leader, we are the equivalent of a community that hosts over 500,000 clients each year, providing them with water, energy, food and a hospitable environment. With ‘eco’ right in our DNA, the board of directors decided it was time to expose our guests to a more caring and greener lifestyle.

“We want to share the opportunity to experience what a greener, more wonderful world could be. You are invited to ride with us on the green side as we join hands to contribute our quota in preserving planet earth.”

To achieve this, the hotel said it is leading the change towards an eco-friendly hotel and are championing the eco –friendly drive with keen interest. They have reduced energy consumption significantly, several water conservation practices have been adopted gradually, utensils and amenities are being replaced with biodegradable options and hundreds of children are being sensitized on the need to reduce our carbon footprint.

“Living green is to pro-actively participate in keeping our environment clean and sustainable for future generations. It is a serious issue; one that will inform the way we see things in every facet of life. Keying into this system of improving our environment is a lifetime and a lifestyle vow to be borne by all regardless of age, creed or social status.

“We at Eko Hotels and Suites firmly believe there is a growing need to drive interest in environmental conversation and bring to the fore its impact on tourism and destination travel, and the benefits that other global brands have thus far enjoyed,” it said.

The arts competition’s grand finale which was held on the premises of the hotel, 10 shortlisted students who scaled through the preliminary stage, compete for the coveted prize of a trophy, a certificate and a cash prize of N500,000.

In his welcome address during for the competition, the Managing Director of the hotel, Mr. Ghassan Faddoul, harped on the need for people to engage in a more responsible, environmental way of doing business.

He said: “Travellers are increasingly using accommodation that supports eco-friendliness and sustainability. It is not only for the season, but also for posterity sake that Eko Hotels and Suites seeks a greener Nigeria, through a greener hospitality business. We see a great opportunity in this green thinking and seek to aggressively build capacity in all areas that would surely lead to the personal welfare of guests, their families, friends and the broader society.

“We, however, cannot achieve this project alone, as it is a long term and team oriented campaign. We must use this gathering to solicit support from the media, business partners and the state government in actualizing this.

“The foundation for today’s event began early in 2018 when our management and staff sought better ways to conduct ourselves businesswise and with less adverse impact to our immediate environment.

“After excessive researches, consultations and collaborations, we arrived at a blueprint which will not only see our business safe on cost but will significantly reduce our greenhouse foot print. Stimulated by these findings, the Eko Hotels eco-friendly project was initiated with two objectives: information and sensitization. In the form of information, I like to inform, that as at January 1, 2019, Eko Hotels and Suites, as far as we know, became the first hospitality outfit, to effect behavioural change, by organizing eco-friendly trainings for staff, offering practical tips and advices on green practices both at home and at work. “

The key event during the programme was the planting of trees within the premises of the hotel by the dignitary at the event.

After a few hours allowed by the judges for the finalists of the competition draw, their image of an eco-friendly future Eko Hotels and Suites, the judges were called upon to adjudicate and score the finalists. Among the judges were: Eko Hotels and Suites Managing Director,Mr. Ghassan Faddoul; the renowned artist, Prof. Olu Amoda; former Commissioner for Environment, Lagos, Prince Adesegun Oniru; Chairman, Eko Hotels and Suites, Mr. Christopher Chagoury; and proprietress, Arts 21, Mrs. Caline Chagoury Moudabe.

Among the students that made it to the final of the competition included: Mae N., Akindele Abdulkazim, Njoku Amarachi, Blessing Nwaede, Agubata Kosanna, Olugbengba Ayeoluwa, Adegoke Ademola and Fadekemi Onikosi.

At the end of the competition, Adegoke Ademola came first, closely followed by Akindele Abdulkarim, while Olugbenga Ayooluwa came third."
"The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has announced plans to revive Nigeria’s textile industry, unveiling measures that will see the development achieved. To this effect, the CBN has placed a restriction to forex access to importers of textiles and other clothing materials into the country. Henceforth, importers of textile and textile materials would not be able to purchase foreign exchange from banks and bureaux de charge as well as other operators in the official foreign exchange market.

The announcement was made by the CBN Governor, Mr Emefiele, at a meeting with textile industry stakeholders which held in Abuja yesterday.

“Effective immediately, the CBN hereby place the access to FX for all forms of textile materials on the FX restriction list. Accordingly, all FX dealers in Nigeria are to desist from granting any importer of textile material access to FX in the Nigerian Foreign exchange market.”

According to Mr Emefiele, the restriction will boost the domestic textile industry as well as create jobs for Nigerians. He noted that the apex bank would initially support the importation of cotton lint for use in textile factories, with a caveat that such importers will begin to source their cotton needs locally beginning from 2020.

He disclosed that the CBN has decided to implement a few steps that will support the revival of the textile sectors. These steps include financial support to textile manufacturers with the provision of funds at a single-digit rate, to refit, retool and upgrade their factories in order to produce high-quality textile materials for the local and export market.

As part of its Anchor Borrowers Program (ABP), the CBN will support local growers of cotton to enable them to meet the needs of the textile industries in Nigeria. The CBN “shall also support efforts to source high yield cotton seedlings so as to ensure the yields from our cotton farmers meet global benchmarks.”

In response to the problem of stable electricity, the CBN has also offered to support the creation of textile production centres in certain designated areas in Nigeria where access to electricity would be guaranteed.

CBN is optimistic that these measures would discourage smuggling, resuscitate the critical industry, and support stakeholders’ efforts at creating jobs for Nigerians. Citing that Nigeria spends above $4 billion annually on imported textiles and ready-made clothing. The governor also explained that with a projected population of over 180 million Nigerians, the needs of the domestic market are huge and varied, with immense prospects, not only for job creation but also for the growth of domestic textile industries.

There is huge potential in the local market which includes the need to support the provision of uniforms and clothing apparels for school students, military and paramilitary officers as well as workers in the industrial sector. Based on the amount spent on outfits for religious and events such as weddings, naming end funeral ceremonies on a weekly basis, CBN projects the potential market size is well over $10 billion annually."

"It’s more usually associated with garden furniture and dinner time for pandas, now a Glasgow entrepreneur has launched a range of underwear made almost entirely from bamboo.

Bonnie Lawson-Brown launched the set as part of a bid to find a comfortable bra after breast reduction surgery because none of the mainstream products in shops seemed to fit her.

The garments are made from mosso bamboo, imported from Turkey and processed into an ultra-soft and pliant fabric at a textile factory in the east end of the city.

Around five per cent of the garments are made from elastane to provide support.

The bamboo garments are also more sustainable and 100 per cent vegan, according to Ms Lawson-Brown.

Having agreed a deal to sell her range at the Scottish Design Exchange, a not-for-profit social enterprise, at its store in Buchanan Galleries and on its online shop, Ms Lawson-Brown now developing a sports bra as well as a range of bamboo nightwear and male underwear.

She says: ""Bamboo has developed a natural ability to survive in the most challenging conditions which makes it an ideal product for clothing.

""It’s antibacterial, anti-fungal and it wicks moisture. It also provides 97% UV protection which makes it a great sunblock.”

Ms Lawson-Brown, who previously ran a wifi communications technology business, launched the venture earlier this year after returning to th UK from Germany where her husband, Piers was serving in the British Army.

""I found a company online that sells GOTS (Global Organic Textiles) certified bamboo that’s processed using steam, which is not harmful to the environment.”

She added: ""A lot of bamboo that enters the market has been created by chemicals that have extracted fibres, but the bamboo we use has been created through a steaming process which is a much more ecologically friendly process.

""It is used elsewhere, but what happens is a lot of companies that use bamboo use a lower percentage of bamboo mixed with other material such as cotton or man-made material.

""The reason for that is that it is very expensive and still not a particularly well used material.

""It (the Bonbon material) is 95% which is the highest percentage of bamboo you can use without it becoming almost like a heavy cotton.""

Competitive introductory and ongoing rates from suppliers have helped make the venture cost effective, with the bra priced at £55 and the briefs £30.

""It still costs me about four times the amount of a man-made material"", she says, ""but it is material that can be washed and worn many times, and it regains its shape and support"".

Ms Lawson-Brown has partnered with BeYonder a not-for-profit organisation that specialises in helping designers who use ethically-sourced, organic fibre to manufacture in small or large batches and pays the Glasgow Living Wage to local women.

The Scottish Design Exchange, which provides high street retail exposure to the work of hundreds of artists and craftspeople, has offered her retail space at its Glasgow store and she also plans to sell from its Edinburgh flagship store at Ocean Terminal, Leith.

Lynzi Leroy, Scottish Design Exchange managing director, said: “Bonnie is a great example of the kind of design-led businesses we are here to help.

""She came up with a great idea for a product, designed it, sourced the materials, found a manufacturer and now she’s selling all over the world.

""As well as proving very popular in our store, she’s also received online orders from customers as far flung as America, France, Spain, Germany and Pakistan.”"
"Online luxury reseller The RealReal Inc.’s stock rose as much as 50% after raising $300 million in its U.S. initial public offering.

The RealReal was trading at $29.86 at 11:18 a.m. in New York on Friday, giving the company a market value of about $2.5 billion. The shares opened at $28, after the company sold 15 million shares for $20 each on Thursday. It had marketed them for $17 to $19.

The RealReal, founded by Chief Executive Officer Julie Wainwright, makes it easier to sell and buy used luxury items such as clothing, accessories, and jewelry on consignment by providing platform for transactions and verifying the goods are authentic.

While the market is intrigued by its growth, RealReal has yet to make a profit. The company posted a loss of $23 million on revenue of $69 million in the first quarter, compared with a net loss of $14 million on revenue of about $46 million for the same period last year. For all of 2018, it lost $76 million on revenue of $207 million, according to its filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Internet-based apparel resellers like The RealReal, Thredup Inc., and Poshmark Inc. have emerged as trendy alternatives to the second-hand clothing market. The RealReal focuses on luxury apparel items from designers like Hermes and Louis Vuitton, catering to the high-end fashion market, while Thredup and Poshmark feature lower-priced items.

Used clothing, footwear, and accessories represent a $10 billion market in the U.S., according to data from market research firm IBISWorld Pty Ltd. Interest from young, sustainability conscious shoppers has been a boon for the industry, which the firm forecasts will grow around 1.6% a year through 2024.

All this has made old clothing a magnet for investment. Venture capital has poured in, with more than $1.1 billion dropped into used-clothing operations over the past several years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

That included more than $350 million in funding for The RealReal and about $130 million for ThredUp. French startup Vestiaire Collective raised $45 million in June to fuel international growth, bringing its total funds to almost $200 million.

The San Francisco-based company now has two brick-and-mortar stores in Manhattan and one in Los Angeles that collect as well as sell goods.

This year marks the 150th anniversary of Sainsbury's -and the supermarket chain is launching a new clothing line with a difference.

The new range, which starts at just £12, is unisex and made from recycled yarn.

It makes up part of the new Drury Lane Collection , which is available in stores and online at tuclothing.sainsburys.co.uk , and a spokesman says it's ""designed to show commitment to reducing environmental impact"".

The launch comes after the Queen visited a replica of one of the original Sainsbury's stores in London's Covent Garden.

She cut a cake made by the baker who created Harry and Meghan's wedding cake.

The new unisex range has jersey pieces suitable for the whole family to wear.

The collection is also made with cotton from the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI) to help protect the environment and working for global change.

A spokesman said: ""This enables a more sustainable approach to fashion cotton producers to achieve better yields, reduce their environmental footprint and benefit from greater financial security from a global market for sustainable cotton.

(Image: Sainsbury)

""The use of recycled yarns also helps reduce environmental impact and are produced through the use of waste product, ultimately reducing the amount of waste sent to landfills.

""This collection is committed to being more caring and having an actively positive impact on the environment.""

It is available online at tuclothing.sainsburys.co.uk and in stores now and prices for adults range from £12 - £16. Prices for the childrenswear collection start from £3.50."
"Cynthia Oguntoye is the Creative Director of Maison Loulabelle, an outfit that specialises in children’s wear. In this interview with Yetunde Oladeinde, she recalls how she made lots of mistakes at the beginning, conquering her world and how life as a human resources consultant motivated her.

What or who inspired you to go into making children’s wear?

I have always loved all things afrocentric. It’s always been reflected in my personal style. After becoming a mum in 2012, I wanted to be able to dress my daughter in cool, modern afrocentric cloths but there was literally nowhere I could find anything! I found myself getting my tailor to make different outfits for my daughter. Needless to say, she always stole the show in cute outfits. I began to receive enquiries and requests for the type of my daughter’s outfits. At the time, I was a full time consultant. This meant I could pick and choose my work hours which also meant I had more free time than most other working mums. I decided to make the best of that time, and I enrolled in the KathyAnthony Fashion Academy. Of course, the training was in women’s wear. However, I chose to translate my knowledge to kid’s fashion as I realised there was an obvious gap in the market which needed to be filled. And that was how Maison Loulabelle was born.

What was it like at the beginning?

The beginning was a very difficult phase. Filled with lots of mistakes. However, I wouldn’t trade that difficult experience for anything as every challenge served to strengthen the brand we have today. At the beginning, one of our greatest difficulties was even finding tailors interested in making children’s cloths. When we found them at all, they charged almost the same for the mainstream women’s fashion as they did to make the kid’s cloths. However, we couldn’t sell our kid’s cloths at the same margins as women’s fashion. So, it was quite tricky finding the right balance.

In addition to that, one of the major issues I faced was a lack of reference point. Everyone I knew in the fashion industry was into women’s fashion. I soon realised that women’s and kid’s fashion were totally different. Literally, it was not possible to replicate the average women’s wear business strategy in the kids’ wear market. Owing to the fact that at the time, there was no one (at least around me) in the kids’ wear sector, a lot of my learning was done the hard way. However, in the years that followed, the growth of social media especially instagram would act as a fantastic reference point for the newer brands. And also gave them direct access to older brands. This helped provide the advice and guidance that those of us who started much earlier weren’t fortunate to have.

That said, the most significant challenge of our inception phase was a strong resistance to ankara kids fashion. One of the most common feedback we got at the time was “oh it’s GORGEOUS but my kid’s won’t wear ankara.” Afrocentric kids’ fashion was snubbed by many people within our target market. I believe, at the time, ankara for kids was viewed as a thing for the less privileged.

What were you doing before this and what was the experience like?

Prior to starting Maison Loulabelle, I was a strategic human resources/institutional development consultant for the British government’s Department for International Development (DFID) programmes. Prior to that, I had worked for the British Council and other DFID and World Bank programmes in similar capacities. It was the only work life I knew as my first job was with the British Council in 2005/2006 and that followed through all the way to the birth of Maison Loulabelle. Working in an international, yet culturally diverse environment has always given me a different perception of what a work environment should be like and feel like; of interpersonal relations in the workplace – there was no ‘oga’ or ‘madam’ or crazy internal politics. Relationships were based on respect. Respect based on what you could achieve. This helped to further sharpen my culture of excellence and has also been very instrumental in how Maison Loulabelle is run today.

In general, it was a wonderful experience. I got to build organisational structures and systems from the scratch and watch them grow into well-oiled entities. I guess in a lot of ways, it is the same kick I get from creating beautiful outfits from pieces of fabric, thread and embellishments! Nothing beats the feeling of being able to build something out of nothing. So whether it’s systems or clothing, it is always a rewarding experience for me.

It is worth noting that I’m still involved in my strategic HRM&D /Institutional Development consultancy. I absolutely love both worlds and I feel privileged to be able to do the two things I love.

Let’s talk about some memorable moments in the sector.

Oh there have been so many! The first would be getting into 41luxe. It really helped with the penetration of our target market. The second would be selling our first $300 ankara kids dress – effectively proving that we had successfully dissociated ankara kid’s fashion from poverty and confirmed that it could be truly luxurious. Our third most memorable moment would have to be winning the African Creatives and Exhibitions – best creative kids brand award. It felt really good to have our efforts in the sector recognised in such a way. Also, one of our most memorable moments has to be being invited to participate in the London Kids Fashion Week. Our brand had been on their list for a long time – oblivious to us. They were taking stock of the depth and growth of the brand. It felt like such a wonderful nod of approval from the global kids product sector! Finally, 2018 saw us delivering our dresses to customers in far away Australia and even South Korea, Brazil, DRC and Guinea Bissau, amongst others. It was confirmation that brand MLB is now being seen across the world. You are participating in the UK kids wear event next month. What are you looking forward to at the event?

Being invited to participate in the London Kids Fashion Week is so monumental for us as a brand and for the Nigerian kids product sector in general. As you know, we will be the first brand domiciled in Africa to participate at the event. I’m really looking forward to flying the flag for Nigeria and Africa in general – showcasing modern luxury afrocentric kids fashion on a global scale. I am also looking forward to networking with key global players in the kids product industry. Most importantly, I am looking forward to potentially meeting and engaging with major industry buyers from key global children’s wear retailers. I am truly looking forward to making history for the sector in such a way.

Who or what do you consider as the greatest influence in your life and career?

To be honest, there’s no one person I can point to as being ‘the greatest influence’ as it’s taken the proverbial village to get me this far. However, in the journey of brand MLB, our story would not be complete without mentioning the impact of brands like 41Luxe. I’d always be grateful to Tata Yinusa, the founder of 41Luxe, for being the first person in the fashion industry to believe in the vision of brand MLB and taking us on in her luxury retail store – 41luxe – just three months into our inception. We remained at 41luxe for two years before opening our flagship store. This played a significant role in our brand positioning. KathyAnthony has also played a significant role in brand MLB. I was part of the pioneer set of the KathyAnthony Fashion Academy and four years on, we still receive support and referrals from them.

How’s life compared with when you started doing this?

Back when I started, my time was split 90% consulting and 10% for Maison Loulabelle. Maison Loulabelle which was literally run from money from my consultancy practice. Now, the reverse is the case. As at 2018 – 2019, my consulting/Maison Loulabelle ratio is 20:80. This has resulted in monumental growth in brand MLB. As much as I had hoped I would have more time for myself as a full time entrepreneur, that hasn’t been the case as it’s resulted in me working even harder and at pretty much all hours of the day. The key difference is that it’s all geared towards building a sustainable brand – an inheritance for my children and that is a truly rewarding feeling.

What are some of the changes that you would like to see in the sector?

The sector has come a long way in the past four years, thanks to social media. However, I’d like to see the consolidation of the sector. We need to come together to build a sector worth reckoning with. Children’s fashion has never really been part of mainstream fashion anywhere in the world. So as a sector, we need to come together to take the market back from the Chinese.

I would love to see diversification within the sector. More people doing boys fashion, casual fashion, night wears and undies, costumes, kids shoes etc. There’s so much to be done! But most of the current focus is on bespoke princess dresses. If the sector is going to come into its own, we need to have development of a proper diverse made in Nigeria children’s product retail sector.

I’ve learnt that there is so much room to grow in this sector. In Nigeria, we are reproducing at one of the fastest rates in the world. In 2019 alone, our population is expected to increase by 5.4m – with an average of 22,066 life births per day! The children’s product sector in Nigeria is prime! The Chinese recognise this. As a sector, we need more brands to come in so we can begin the process of reclaiming and catering to the needs of our people.

What are some of the things that you treasure most in life?

Without doubt, my family. I have been blessed beyond measure with both my birth family and my family by marriage. Without a doubt, my family is my greatest treasure.

How do you relax?

I take myself out once every week. Me time! Maybe to dinner, the movies, the spa, or just hanging with my friends. At the moment, “me time” has become such a sacred and rewarding part of my week… it offers me a few hours to just relax and be ME!

Let’s talk about the people you admire and role models.

My mum has always been the biggest influence on my life. Incredibly strong, yet fiercely loyal and loving. She’s always taught me the value of staying true to yourself as a woman. She’s also taught me that kindness trumps all. Even today, she has a multitude of children – not born to her but fiercely loyal to her because of one random act of kindness or the other.

Another major role model of mine is Mrs Mo Abudu. I’ve never met her. But her achievements as a woman, as a mother and as a businesswoman are simply inspiring. Look how far Ebony life TV has come since she started it! A woman – in Nigeria – through sheer hard work and determination. I pray to be able to impact generations just like she is currently doing and be a point of reference for my generation as well."
"Why are wages so low for garment workers in Bangladesh?

How can a charity-backed T-shirt come from a dismal factory where staff are abused and do gruelling work for low pay?

The Spice Girls and Comic Relief said they had checked the ethical sourcing credentials of Represent, the online retailer commissioned to make the T-shirts that have caused a furore, but it had subsequently changed manufacturer without their knowledge. Represent said it took “full responsibility” for problems identified by a Guardian investigation this week.

But it is little surprise that workers at the Bangladesh factory where the T-shirts were made were paid less than the local living wage.

Tesco, Mothercare and M&S use factory paying workers 35p an hour Read more

Countries such as Bangladesh are popular places in which to operate because they offer cheap labour alongside expertise in clothing manufacture.

The legal minimum wage for garment workers in the country is 8,000 taka (£73.85) a month, slightly less than the amount received by workers spoken to by the Guardian.

The amount was increased by 2,700Tk a month in December, but campaigners say workers need 16,000Tk to live a comfortable life in Bangladesh. With such low wages, employees often feel compelled to take on large amounts of overtime to make ends meet.

Beyond wages, checking conditions in clothing supply chains requires considerable resources, covering a complex web of thread and fabric makers, dyeing services and stitching work, all located in distant, developing economies with poor communications infrastructure.

Local laws may regulate fire safety, pay and working conditions, but enforcement is often weak because there are not enough inspectors and there is significant potential for the corruption of officials. At the same time, workers can struggle to raise awareness of issues as a result of low levels of union recognition and fear of reprisals.

After the Rana Plaza clothing factory collapse in Bangladesh, in which more than 1,000 workers died, dozens of retailers and brands signed up to the accord on fire and building safety. It funded inspections and improvements to buildings, including fire doors and structural work, as well as helping inform workers of their rights and training managers to spot and respond to problems.

Mary Creagh, the chairwoman of the UK parliament’s environmental audit committee, which has carried out an investigation into sustainable fashion, previously said: “The best audit [of conditions] … is taken by workers through their elected representatives in your factories.” Globally, less than 10% of garment workers are in trade unions, she added.

But action to increase union representation in Bangladesh and other supplier countries has been slow, as union leaders and members can face intimidation because business owners and some governments see activists as a threat.

Where local regulation and union representation is weak, retailers have traditionally tried to weed out poor factories with regular inspections carried out by their own staff or professional ethical auditors.

Sedex, which has 50,000 members in more than 150 countries, enables brands to share data on ethical standards at thousands of factories around the world.

The Guardian view on Bangladesh: when charity goes wrong | Editorial Read more

But Peter McAllister, the executive director of the Ethical Trading Initiative, which brings together businesses, unions and campaign groups to try to improve conditions in clothing manufacturing, said retailers and brands could not rely solely on inspection reports and those thatdid were “either naive or wilfully ignorant”.

The best retailers have teams on the ground who work closely with suppliers to monitor conditions and check details about the capacities of factories and the time needed to carry out particular work projects.

Such a detailed investigation can then identify when unrealistically low price points are being quoted – prices that can prompt factory owners to cut corners by forcing staff to do unpaid overtime or outsourcing work to less reputable establishments that may not have been inspected.

McAllister said price was one of the best indicators of working conditions: “If something is very cheap, you have to ask yourself, is it really possible to make it in a factory that is run properly, with a living wage?”"
"Alice Smellie (pictured) quality testing fast fashion to find out if the pieces pass the 30 wear test

The business model behind the UK’s booming ‘fast fashion’ industry is broken.

One million tonnes of clothing are thrown away every year, with 300,000 tonnes going to landfill or being incinerated.

And no wonder — T-shirts are now on sale for £2, dresses for a fiver; clothes so cheap you can throw them away after a big night out without a second thought.

A recent study of 1,500 women found we only wear clothes an average of seven times — with a third of us considering items to be ‘old’ after just three outings.

We’ve been investigating fast fashion in Parliament for over six months. What’s clear is that business-as-usual no longer fits.

In the UK we buy more clothes per person than any other country in Europe. Italians are famed for being the world’s best dressed, but they only buy half the weight in clothes we do each year.

Our demand for fast, cheap fashion comes with a catastrophic environmental price tag. Textile production contributes more to climate change than international flights and shipping combined.

Cotton production consumes lake-sized volumes of fresh water and often involves pesticides. Every time we put on a wash, thousands of plastic fibres go down the drain and into the oceans. Plastic-based fibres from polyester and acrylic jumpers are being found in the deep sea, in Arctic sea ice and the fish we eat.

The social cost of our clothes is also high. When we rejoice at the £5 tag on a dress, we don’t question the real cost of making it. But someone is paying the price.

Forced labour is used to pick cotton in two of the world’s biggest cotton-producing countries, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.

In China, prison camps are used as textile factories. Girls in India are sold into three years of bonded labour by their families to earn their marriage dowry.

Our biggest retailers have ‘chased the cheap needle around the planet’, commissioning production in countries with low pay, little trade union representation and weak environmental laws.

We all have a responsibility to buy less and rent, reuse, repair and recycle more. Given the warnings we face on climate change and biodiversity loss, we must chart a new direction. In Parliament, we’ve been talking to businesses and designers forging an exciting, sustainable vision for fashion — making garments with reused or recycled materials, offering fashion rental and even lifetime repair services.

But they face tough competition from businesses driven to maximise profits through cost-cutting, regardless of environmental or social impact. We found retailers, including Boohoo, Amazon and TK Maxx, to be lagging behind the rest of the industry.

None has signed up to the Sustainable Clothing Action Plan to reduce their carbon, water and waste footprints or the ACT labour rights and living-wage agreement.

Producers must take responsibility for the waste they create and help pay for clearing it up. We want the Government to make retailers pay a penny for each garment produced. This could raise £35million a year to be spent on better clothing collection and sorting services.

Fixing fast fashion can’t wait; the time to act is now. Our clothes shouldn’t cost the earth.

WHAT'S SPECIAL ABOUT THE 30 WEAR TEST

SUSTAINABILITY consultancy Eco Age say shoppers should be considering lifespan, not just price, and launched a #30 Wears campaign to encourage us to wear everything we buy at least 30 times.

You may think that you can take your old clothes to the charity shop when you tire of them, but poor quality clothes have little resell value, meaning they often end up in landfill.

HOW THE TEST WORKED

ALICE SMELLIE and scientist Jim Hicks, owner of the independent STTC Test Laboratory in Glasgow, submitted primary coloured clothing staples from eight popular retailers to a range of laboratory and home tests to determine their sartorial staying power.

HOME RESULTS

Alice bought two of each item and took measurements such as from neck to hem and armpit to armpit. Then they were washed five times as per label recommendation. Shrinkage, stretching and difference in fabric were observed and measurements retaken.

LAB RESULTS

PILLING: Samples were rubbed against themselves at low pressures and in continuously changing directions — as happens when we move around — to see whether fabric bobbles.

STRENGTH: This tested the fabric by clamping it in place and blowing compressed air at it until the material literally bursts.

COLOUR FASTNESS: The fabric was sprayed with liquids which mimic the composition of human sweat. Discolourisation was exposed by the dye bleeding onto a white fabric swatch underneath.

Jim measured the above tests using a leading high street chain’s standards from around a decade ago. Whether they would last 30 wears and still be of reasonable quality is based on our observations of fading, feel of fabric and pilling.

You could probably wear most for this long, but they certainly wouldn’t look as smart."
"The sun is out, the garden’s calling and there’s a bottle of something crisp in the wine cooler; why not settle into the Bank Holiday with some stark and alarming reading?

Sobering and post-apocalyptic, Will McCallum’s book “How To Give Up Plastic” might not make for light relief, but it highlights what will happen if we don’t sate our plastic consumption.

The statistics - that we kill over 100k marine mammals a year with the near-impossible-to-get-rid-of material, and that by 2050 there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish - make for grim reading. This week’s Extinction Rebellion protests across London have also been highlighting the perils (to perhaps less convincing effect).

The fashion industry is one of the biggest problem areas - synthetic fibres account for a third of the microplastics in the ocean. Luckily some brands are beginning to step up their eco responsibility and chime with the times and tackle this swell. Recycling plastic from the oceans and turning it into clothing and accessories is one of the ways they are doing this.

This week Ralph Lauren debuted the Earth Polo, a rendering of its classic polo shirt. It has been developed with American recycling specialist First Mile and features a cotton-like material made with plastic bottles. Appropriately, swimwear brands have also been dynamic in recycling ocean waste - the likes of Riz Boardshorts, Passenger Clothing and Naeco use plastic bottles to create their vibrant, summery trunks."

'I was gobsmacked by the rubbish piling up on the beaches. It was so bad I couldn't find somewhere to put my feet without stepping on rubbish — it was horrific, and it made me feel ill.

"The thought of living a zero-waste life can feel overwhelming at best and impossible at worst, since our daily lives seem consumed by garbage.

These days, separating your trash and bringing your own bag to the supermarket just isn't enough when it comes to saving the planet. But there are more ways we can help the environment and committing to a waste-free life is just one of them.

Bea Johnson, blogger and author of Zero Waste Home, pioneered the 5 R's: Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle and Rot. Remembering these 5 R's will help you monitor your personal consumption and waste.

To help you get started, here are 10 simple and easy zero-waste tips:

Re-useable bottles

Avoid plastic bottles and paper cups by investing in a reusable flask for hot and cold drinks.

Bringing your own reusable bottle to a local cafe for your daily brew is not only economic, but it could even save you money as some spots offer incentives for bringing your own cup.

And with more water stations popping up than ever before, it has never been easier to quench your thirst by filling your reusable flask with fresh water, while also eliminating the need to buy a new one at the store.

Re-usable straws

Remember to refuse plastic straws and carry your own metal straw if necessary.

A single plastic straw can take around 500 years to decompose and by now we should all have seen at least one image of marine wildlife tangled in plastic — be it a straw or otherwise.

Thankfully, more and more shops are foregoing plastic straws and have introduced their own environmentally-friendly versions. You can go one further by purchasing your own metal or silicone version to carry with you.

Reusable cutlery

Plastic cutlery can take around 450 years to decompose and you can only imagine how many are used each day! It is much more eco-friendly investing in a reusable cutlery set or bringing cutlery from home when you're planning on eating al fresco or grabbing a take out.

Reusable bags

Avoid using single-use plastic bags and always remember to bring your own

Plastic bags take around 1000 years to decompose and are very damaging to the environment and wildlife.

Though the problem is being reduced by shops charging for plastic bags to encourage more people to bring their own, there is still a long way to go. In fact, in the US, plastic bags are still readily available cost-free.

To combat this, you should always bring your own cloth bag by keeping them in your car or handbag.



Avoid packaging

Buy in bulk and try to avoid packaging where possible to help reduce unnecessary waste.

Most supermarkets still use packaging made with harmful plastics and these could be affecting your health. Some packaging such as plastic bottles and canned foods can leak the chemical bisphenol A (BPA) into your food and drink.

According to Ribble-pack, 93 per cent of Americans over the age of six tested positive for traces of the BPA chemical found in the body.

So not only are you saving money and reducing waste by buying package-free items, you're also reducing the risk of consuming harmful plastics.

If possible, bring eco-friendly bags for your fruit and vegetables and glass containers for other items such as meat and fish from the counter.

Toothbrushes

Avoid plastic toothbrushes and opt for a sustainable and eco-friendly bamboo version.

Dentists advise changing your toothbrush every three months and if everyone is using a plastic version, the amount of waste this causes is unimaginable. In fact, it is believed that in the US alone, more than 850 million toothbrushes end up in landfill every year.



An electric toothbrush is more economical both for your pocket and the environment. But there are even better options out there such as bamboo toothbrushes that you can compost after use.

Meal plan

Meal planning helps you save money on perishable foods and reduces food waste.

The average amount of food wasted each year weighs 1.3 billion tonnes and almost half of all food waste happens in the home.

Planning meals is the perfect way to reduce food waste and save money because you buy only what you need. It's also worthwhile to make a plan for any leftovers or scraps such as turning it into lunches or adding it to other meals.

Recycle and Compost

It might seem like you're doing your bit to recycle, but only nine per cent of 6.3 billion metric tons is actually recycled. The rest either ends up in landfills, or at worst, in the ocean. So before you decide to recycle a glass jar or cardboard box, ask yourself if it can be re-used or re-purposed.

Disposing of food waste in a landfill contributes to global warming and also produces methane gas when sitting in landfills. You can reduce these emissions by putting vegetable scraps and egg shells into a food compost bin. If you have a green thumb, you can return these valuable nutrients to soil and aid plant growth.

Go Paperless

Switching to digital bills reduces paper waste and unwanted clutter.

When you're finished with a private letter, most people tend to shred these before disposing of them, but most recycling plants do not accept shredded paper because the pieces are too small.

Switching to digital bills and receipts will save paper and keep your documents more secure. Plus when you're finished with them, you simply have to delete the files.

Going paperless also de-clutters your home and saves you hunting for lost letters. You can also reduce paper waste by making digital notes on your phone or laptop.

Buy less

Clothes and shoes that you don't actually need will eventually become clutter and can lead to stress, debt and extra waste in landfills. In fact, 80 per cent of discarded textiles will either end up in a landfill or be incinerated — neither of which are good for the planet.

That old saying 'less is more' can really benefit your mindfulness, bank balance and productivity. Ask yourself if you really need something before making a purchase and always check if you can buy second-hand or have materials to make something similar at home. You will end up with far less clutter and allow you to save money for experiences rather than things."
"""The idea of customisation in the fashion industry has been gaining momentum,"" she says. As a small label, however, the pair wasn't sure where to start. ""Our garments aren't couture, so we couldn't find a fit we were confident would work.""

Enter Local Peoples. The multi-disciplinary design and strategy agency, run by Cleary's husband Giuseppe Demaio, put one of its clients, the materials science and engineering department, in touch with Alpha60.

Heads together

Over a few months, the Clearys and materials science students, led by department head Professor Nick Birbilis, nutted out ideas for how best the university might creatively apply its 3D scanning and printing technology – before settling on bespoke jewellery.

""We thought jewellery or some kind of object was the way to go,"" says Cleary, adding that Alpha60 – which has produced accessories including shoes, bags, hats and jewellery – is ""more of an attitude"" that appeals to the kinds of people ""who like going to an art gallery on weekends"".

Alpha60 founders Georgie and Alex Cleary were looking to add customisation to their range: bespoke jewellery was the answer.

""Bringing creative thinking into any industry is exciting. You start to think differently, pull different ideas and skills together… and something innovative is born from it.""

It also helps when one half of Alpha60 is technically literate – Alex Cleary trained as an aeronautical engineer.

For its part, Monash University believes the fashion week collaboration provides an important opportunity to build greater awareness about the capabilities of materials science and the possibilities of its 3D-modelling software and printing.

Local Peoples design lead Martin Brown says the jewellery offers people a tangible, consumer-friendly example of what materials science can achieve. ""It starts a conversation.""

The fashion label's Chapel House store will be the venue for Alchemy, a week-long event during Melbourne Fashion Week.

It also shows other fashion and design brands how they can ""create personalised experiences for their customers"", says Birbilis.

Brown is quick to point out that Monash's materials science department is already involved with commercial partners on many real-world applications across a spectrum of industries, including health, sport, and oil and gas. For instance, the department is working in partnership to create sportswear customised for individual athletes.

3D magic

Increasingly, it is also possible to use different materials. In this instance, the Alpha60 jewellery will be made from a lightweight plastic. But 3D printers are being developed to handle multiple materials – on their own or in combination – including metals, glass, other polymers and carbon fibre.

While the jewellery generates ""the buzz of having something made just for you"", Brown says the ability to toy with facets of a design on screen – such as the brow, eyes, nose and lips – shows the enormous flexibility of customisation.

Monash University's Department of Materials Science and Engineering provides the 3D modelling technology.

""This is a pretty light-hearted way of showing you can have infinite customisations of a single object, infinite iterations using a software layer,"" he says, as I pull my own Potato Head features back roughly into proportion.

Cleary agrees: ""It's a bit of fun with the idea of the face."" But she also sees longer-term possibilities. ""We're already bubbling away with ideas for further customisation.""

For example, she'd like to design a more refined, permanent fashion accessory, possibly in metal. She also envisages the day, well down the track, when people may print Alpha60 clothing at home.

""We talk about it,"" she says. ""Maybe that's where it goes.""

"She's the Sudanese-Australian model who has strutted on runways across the globe.

And it appears all of her hard work has paid off, as Adut Akech Bior has been named the world's number one model.

Topping supermodels Gigi and Bella Hadid, the 19-year-old took the industry's vote by storm for Models.com Industry Awards.

Move over, Gigi! Adut Akech was named the number one model in the world by models.com Industry Awards, beating supermodel Hadid sisters. Pictured in 2018 attending The Fashion Awards

Meanwhile, Gigi Hadid, 23, scored the reader's choice vote for the female model of the year.

Industry's vote runner up was British model Adwoa Aboah, 26, while the reader's choice runner up was Bella Hadid, 22.

The feat comes after Adut opened up about her harrowing struggle with anxiety and depression.

Adut, who launched her modelling career aged 16, admitted on Tuesday that she cried every morning and night in 2018.

Taking to Instagram on New Year's Day, the supermodel said that despite her successful career she 'suffered from really bad depression and anxiety'.

In a lengthy post, she explained that she is learning to 'handle' her mental illness, but nonetheless feels overwhelmed sometimes.

'I'm learning to handle it better now but it's a daily struggle and not every day is a ''good'' day,' the beauty confessed.

'Every single day of my life in 2018 was a challenge, filled with some serious obstacles to overcome.

'I would wake up every morning crying but put the biggest smile on my face and tried my hardest to push through the day pretending I was fine, then I'd come home and cry some more and go to sleep.'

"""Menswear is definitely changing,"" he says. ""Look at the finalists for the National Designer Award – there's only one womenswear designer this year, and that's so telling of what is happening in fashion right now. It really shines a light on the potential that menswear has.""

Archibald's own designs have a workwear vibe, with a strong utilitarian attitude. They're tailored but feel relaxed. Most of his customers are women, he says, but his male clientele is growing. ""That archaic idea that only women are interested in clothing and style, it's just absurd.""

While he says that not all gender conventions need to be done away with – ""we do need our own identities"" – the blurring of the lines between menswear and womenswear is a welcome development. ""The idea that a man can wear a skirt and be celebrated for it, not pilloried, is great. If your masculinity is so fragile it can't handle a guy in a skirt, that's a real problem.""

Keen to push the boundaries of traditional masculinity, Archibald points to his own background as evidence that creativity can blossom anywhere.

""I grew up in a very conservative environment, in a small town. My mum's family worked in logging, it was a very blokey way to grow up. But it's also proof that you don't need early exposure to fashion to have a love for it.""

Archibald's grandfather, John Marriner, was a Maori All Black in the 1950s, and though fashion and rugby might not seem a natural fit, his family's sporting legacy inspired him to create his graduation collection. ""Fashion is an amazing way to identify ourselves. I wanted to show people my heritage, but in a new way.""

The collection scored Archibald a job with New Zealand designer Kate Sylvester, with whom he worked for two years.

In 2011, he flew to Australia on an eight-day trip and ended up forgoing his return ticket, staying on in Melbourne to launch his label in 2013.

Archibald, right, says fashion designers ""need to have a moral compass and think about the supply chain"". Supplied

From the very beginning, he was focused on sustainability. ""Fashion designers need to be responsible,"" he says.

""We need to have a moral compass and think about the supply chain. We need to think very carefully about the materials we use and the people we hire. And we need to ask ourselves, why are we making this?""

Sustainable and recyclable

For his part, Archibald is now able to trace all the materials he uses back to their sources, and upcycles items to make new garments. His Woolmark entry, a bottle-green coat, was made with repurposed wool blankets, recycled wool fibre and plastic bottles compressed into a soft, fine yarn that perfectly resembled first-cycle wool.

The next step, he says, is to ensure that every step in the design process is as eco-friendly as it can be. ""I've tried very hard with my suppliers to get evidence of their credentials that I can then pass on to buyers and clients – this is how much water is used, this is how the waste is taken care of – that sort of thing. A lot of the information is hard to access, but you have to keep trying.""

Graeme Lewsey, chief executive of Virgin Australia Melbourne Fashion Festival (VAMFF) and one of the judges of the National Designer Award, says Archibald is ""the whole package"".

Superb craftsmanship

""Blair is an amazing craftsman, with a beautiful tailoring background. He's got a great sense of business acumen. He's very much in tune with his customers. His grasp on sustainability is second to none. He has it all, really.""

Although the award, announced on March 1, went to menswear designer Christian Kimber, Lewsey says being a finalist is validation that the industry at large sees a bright future for Archibald.

""The whole idea of the NDA is to invest in designers who are really worth it,"" he says. ""Fashion is a very tough world to survive in. We want to highlight the designers we think are going to last the distance.""

Chris Wilson, menswear buyer at David Jones (which sponsors the award), says Archibald was a ""standout applicant"". ""Blair has established a foundation of high-quality, enduring pieces. They're timeless.""

Archibald, who's gearing up for his Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week show in May, has his sights set on the future – and firmly within Australia.

""A lot of Australian and New Zealand designers feel this need to leave Australia because they feel like they're not really understood here, but I think it's great to stay and try to change things from the inside and break the boundaries from within. There's so much happening here right now. I want to be part of that."""
"Alice Smellie (pictured) quality testing fast fashion to find out if the pieces pass the 30 wear test

The business model behind the UK’s booming ‘fast fashion’ industry is broken.

One million tonnes of clothing are thrown away every year, with 300,000 tonnes going to landfill or being incinerated.

And no wonder — T-shirts are now on sale for £2, dresses for a fiver; clothes so cheap you can throw them away after a big night out without a second thought.

A recent study of 1,500 women found we only wear clothes an average of seven times — with a third of us considering items to be ‘old’ after just three outings.

We’ve been investigating fast fashion in Parliament for over six months. What’s clear is that business-as-usual no longer fits.

In the UK we buy more clothes per person than any other country in Europe. Italians are famed for being the world’s best dressed, but they only buy half the weight in clothes we do each year.

Our demand for fast, cheap fashion comes with a catastrophic environmental price tag. Textile production contributes more to climate change than international flights and shipping combined.

Cotton production consumes lake-sized volumes of fresh water and often involves pesticides. Every time we put on a wash, thousands of plastic fibres go down the drain and into the oceans. Plastic-based fibres from polyester and acrylic jumpers are being found in the deep sea, in Arctic sea ice and the fish we eat.

The social cost of our clothes is also high. When we rejoice at the £5 tag on a dress, we don’t question the real cost of making it. But someone is paying the price.

Forced labour is used to pick cotton in two of the world’s biggest cotton-producing countries, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.

In China, prison camps are used as textile factories. Girls in India are sold into three years of bonded labour by their families to earn their marriage dowry.

Our biggest retailers have ‘chased the cheap needle around the planet’, commissioning production in countries with low pay, little trade union representation and weak environmental laws.

We all have a responsibility to buy less and rent, reuse, repair and recycle more. Given the warnings we face on climate change and biodiversity loss, we must chart a new direction. In Parliament, we’ve been talking to businesses and designers forging an exciting, sustainable vision for fashion — making garments with reused or recycled materials, offering fashion rental and even lifetime repair services.

But they face tough competition from businesses driven to maximise profits through cost-cutting, regardless of environmental or social impact. We found retailers, including Boohoo, Amazon and TK Maxx, to be lagging behind the rest of the industry.

None has signed up to the Sustainable Clothing Action Plan to reduce their carbon, water and waste footprints or the ACT labour rights and living-wage agreement.

Producers must take responsibility for the waste they create and help pay for clearing it up. We want the Government to make retailers pay a penny for each garment produced. This could raise £35million a year to be spent on better clothing collection and sorting services.

Fixing fast fashion can’t wait; the time to act is now. Our clothes shouldn’t cost the earth.

WHAT'S SPECIAL ABOUT THE 30 WEAR TEST

SUSTAINABILITY consultancy Eco Age say shoppers should be considering lifespan, not just price, and launched a #30 Wears campaign to encourage us to wear everything we buy at least 30 times.

You may think that you can take your old clothes to the charity shop when you tire of them, but poor quality clothes have little resell value, meaning they often end up in landfill.

HOW THE TEST WORKED

ALICE SMELLIE and scientist Jim Hicks, owner of the independent STTC Test Laboratory in Glasgow, submitted primary coloured clothing staples from eight popular retailers to a range of laboratory and home tests to determine their sartorial staying power.

HOME RESULTS

Alice bought two of each item and took measurements such as from neck to hem and armpit to armpit. Then they were washed five times as per label recommendation. Shrinkage, stretching and difference in fabric were observed and measurements retaken.

LAB RESULTS

PILLING: Samples were rubbed against themselves at low pressures and in continuously changing directions — as happens when we move around — to see whether fabric bobbles.

STRENGTH: This tested the fabric by clamping it in place and blowing compressed air at it until the material literally bursts.

COLOUR FASTNESS: The fabric was sprayed with liquids which mimic the composition of human sweat. Discolourisation was exposed by the dye bleeding onto a white fabric swatch underneath.

Jim measured the above tests using a leading high street chain’s standards from around a decade ago. Whether they would last 30 wears and still be of reasonable quality is based on our observations of fading, feel of fabric and pilling.

You could probably wear most for this long, but they certainly wouldn’t look as smart."
"Danish fashion brand GANNI has come under fire from fashion watchers for using underprivileged women as 'props' in a 'tone deaf' Copenhagen Fashion Week show.

The brand collaborated with National Geographic photographer Ami Vitale for the show, who provided images taken in countries such as Bangladesh during her travels around the developing world.

Her photos, featuring women in headscarves and children wading through water on their way to school, were used as backdrops as models strutted down the catwalk during the brand's Life On Earth show.

However, New York blogger Anaa Nadim Saber has since accused the brand of using underprivileged women as 'marketing props', writing on Instagram: 'These women were not treated as humans with agency and with stories of their own to tell.

'Instead, they are shown through the ‘white’ gaze, reduced only to their aesthetic value. It looked “cool” in the background, right? It “gelled well” with the aesthetic of depicting the “human spirit”, right? Wrong. My people are not your aesthetic.

A spokesperson for the brand told Femail: 'At GANNI it is always our mission to celebrate women around the world. For the GANNI FW19 show, we drew inspiration from the beauty of life on earth and wanted to portray the diversity and connectivity we share on this planet.

GANNI's Life On Earth fashion show has been accused of being 'tone deaf' for using images of women in developing countries as a backdrop

New York fashion blogger Anaa Nadim Saber (pictured) has criticised trendy brand GANNI's Copenhagen Fashion Week show for using images of women in developing countries as a backdrop

The images were taken by National Geographic photographer Ami Vitale, and the brand has now apologised for the 'insensitivity' of showing the collection alongside the photos

'To illustrate this, we collaborated with photographer Ami Vitale on our set design. Ami has dedicated her life to documenting and amplifying stories of all forms of life.

'While well intentioned, we now understand the sensitivities we've broached by showing our collection within the context of these images.

'We sincerely apologize for this, as it was never our intention. We will learn from this mistake and we promise to turn your invaluable insight into action so that we can do better in the future.'

In her Instagram post, Anaa added that the show proved why more diversity is needed in the fashion industry.

Anaa accused GANNI of fetishizing women from underprivileged backgrounds in developing countries as marketing tools by showcasing a selection of images taken by Ami Vitale

She said: 'It's worrying how this got approved. From the photography, to the set design, did this pass any people of colour? Did nobody in management realize how this would be perceived by non-white audience members?

'This is why building diverse teams is critical. The fashion industry likes to throw around buzzwords like ""diversity, inclusitivity and sustainability"", without introspecting on how exactly they are promoting these causes.

'It is unlikely that the women in these photographs received any compensation for ""participating"" in this show, while the brand profits.'

Award-winning photojournalist Ami Vitale, who is a photographer for National Geographic is known for her work in countries including India and Sri Lanka. One image showed schoolgirls wading through water, although it's not clear where the photo was taken

The post received a flood of comments with many agreeing with Anaa and praising her for speaking up to highlight issues surrounding representation in the fashion industry.

One person wrote: 'Unfortunately this kind of fetishisation and cultural appropriation happens ALL the time in Denmark. Because it has historically been a more homogeneous society, it does not have the discourse to dissect this (and is all too willing to dismiss criticism). I could go on and on. Thank you for speaking up.'

Another added: 'Your post is eloquent and powerful. We see this kind of imagery so often we are desensitized to the impact. In European culture we are silenced implicitly and occasion explicitly, and when any female of colour dare to challenge this exploitation, we are seen as being over sensitive.

'We have the right to be seen as equal. In this show the models walking were most likely paid a premium. What did the girls in the photos get?'

A flood of comments on Instagram agreed with Anaa that the photos were use to exploit women of colour and praised her for addressing the issue on her platform

Another slammed the photos being featured in the show, saying: 'Women of colour from developing countries are not props that we should be using to juxtapose the models on the runway.

'They do not exist for our paradigms; they are individuals of their own, and if we celebrate them, it should be on a platform that doesn't exploit them.'

However, a dissenting voice said: 'A person without a streak of racism and classicism in their blood would not see these lovely photos as props. YOU are the one claiming them to be props, not me.

What sparked the criticism of GANNI's Fashion Week show? Anaa Nadim Saber posted on Instagram: 'I need to take a break from all this fashion week hype to talk about something that has made me feel extremely uncomfortable. Today, I attended The GANNI FW 19 show “LIFE ON EARTH” during Copenhagen Fashion Week, which was centered on “sustainability” and the “global GANNI girl”. Throughout the show, there was a slideshow of images taken by Ami Vitale in the background, depicting underprivileged women in developing countries, while models gallivanted across the runway. How were these pictures of poor brown women aligned with the theme of of sustainability? How did this show benefit these women? 'The brand fetishized these women and used them as props and marketing tools. This was not a platform for these marginalized women to get representation; they were not treated as humans with agency and with stories of their own to tell. Instead, they are shown through the ‘white’ gaze, reduced only to their aesthetic value. It looked “cool” in the background, right? It “gelled well” with the aesthetic of depicting the “human spirit”, right? 'Wrong. My people are not your aesthetic. 'It’s worrying how this got approved. From the photography to the set design, did this pass before any people of color? Did nobody in management realize how this would be perceived by non-white audience members? This is why building diverse teams is critical. The fashion industry likes to throw around buzzwords like “diversity, inclusivity, and sustainability”, without introspecting on how exactly they are promoting these causes. It is unlikely that the women in these photographs received any compensation for “participating” in this show, while the brand profits. 'This is not just meant to call out GANNI for being problematic. This is a larger pattern of exploitation in the fashion industry. It is exactly women like the ones in these pictures that are worst affected by our industry: poor wages and terrible working conditions in sweatshops that manufacture clothing for many western brands. This treatment of women of color is particularly painful given how “progressive” the fashion industry claims to be. 'Stop being tone deaf and blind to your own internalized colonial mentality. Do better.'

'You see a prop, I see a lovely smiling young girl. And when I look at the runway models, it reminds me that beauty is universal.

'That a thin, gaunt white woman in a designer garment is not the epitome of beauty.

'That beauty comes in many shapes, colors, ethnicities, religions and backgrounds. It was quite brave of the organizers to include the photos of these women. Why are you not seeing what I see?'

A spokesperson from GANNI revealed the brand always aims to celebrate women from all over the world and wanted to portray diversity

A number of Instagram users began arguing among themselves over the assumption that the women photographed didn't receive compensation for their participation"
"CEBU, Philippines — Dexter Alazas arrived and made his name in Cebu’s fashion scene by riding on his “trial and error” journey, embracing mistakes as his motivation to pursue the craft he loves to do.

Dexter is one of the few fashion designer activists in Cebu, whose hands do not only create beautiful designs for the affluent segment, but also provides a way for the deprived women to make a living by providing them an opportunity to earn extra income.

The owner of Alazas Atelier, Dexter led the revival of Hablon, a centuries’ old handloom weaving industry that originated and thrived in Argao, Cebu.

He purposely created a retail arm, the Amano Craft Creations, to make Hablon accessible to both local and foreign customers. Not only that, he is also trying to make “banig” products to re-enter in the fashion scene by designing banig-based accessories in home furnishings, and fashion ensembles.

Today, Dexter champions in helping more women, mostly housewives in rural areas, find their place and recognize their value in the fashion scene not only in Cebu, but around the world.

Nurse by profession, designer in action

Persuaded by the trend of taking up nursing to easily get his way to the United States and join his family there, Dexter took up Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) after high school.

“I’m the youngest among eight siblings, and they were all (living and working) in the US, including my parents,” Dexter shared explaining that the goal of finishing a profession in nursing was only to finally work and live in the United States.

But he discovered that while nursing is a noble profession, his heart is beating somewhere else, and the act of creating anything and turn it into a beautiful piece of art, is what lift his spirit and makes him happier and excited.

While studying, Dexter often made his way to feed his longing of creating something.

Until, he got drawn to the world of fashion industry, “that I forgot finishing my nursing review.”

Ever since, Dexter said there is something about the fashion industry that thrilled him. “There’s so much fun and creativity here. I feel alive and somehow feels at home whenever do I am doing anything in regards to fashion designing.”

Pursuing his heart, Dexter decided to leave the goal to settle in America behind, and chose to do the thing he is made to do—fashion designing.

“Life has its way of leading you to other paths,” he followed the beat of his heart and paid attention to hunches.

“And the rest is history,” he quipped.

Dressing up personalities

His “trial and error” journey continued and never left him even after he was able to dress the rich and famous personalities, politicians in Cebu, Manila and other parts of the country.

Dexter Alazas, a brand himself considers mistakes as his mentor, a great teacher. After all, what he had when he started was only a passion, not even a formal training in fashion designing.

After working with different veterans and established names in the fashion industry in Cebu, the likes of Furne One (now a famous fashion designer in Dubai), Cary Santiago, among others, Dexter was more empowered to do something on his own—one-piece-of-creation-at-a-time bearing his name on it.

True enough, Dexter slowly made his way up. His first breakthrough was during the Joie de Vivre (Joy of Living) fashion show that proudly included his collection, together with already popular designers in Cebu.

From that show, Dexter caught the discerning eyes of some showbiz personalities. One day he found himself dressing up famous personalities like Claudine Barreto, among others.

One of his pieces landed in the front cover of the Preview magazine that was worn by Barretto. He acknowledged his entry to the discriminating fashion taste of showbiz and national sphere as a blessing that inspired him to pursue his craft some more—perhaps something meaningful and of value.

Reaching the ground

In 2014, Dexter formalized his plan to reach out to the people who he saw a potential to be part of the ever growing, and constantly evolving fashion industry—the women in rural communities.

Through his act of kindness and bravery to rescue the dying industry in Argao the “hablon” weaving, Dexter gave a ray of hope among women weavers. Today, the industry is able to regain its momentum following the different support afforded by the government.

Hablon is derived from the Hiligaynon word ""habol"", which means to weave and, therefore, refers both to the process and the finished products.

Alazas gained the support from the DTI to showcase the fabric to the market during the Apec Exhibit which eventually led to the installation of the hablon facility worth P825,000 that consists of 29 handloom weaving machines at the Cebu Technological University (CTU) Argao campus, through DTI's Shared Service Facility Program.

The Mandaue Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MCCI) also offered its support to the Hablon weavers by linking them to the market.

Dexter’s fascination with hablon started in 2007 when he was searching for fabrics for a fashion show. Since then, he has never stopped looking for fabrics that he would eventually call Cebu’s own.

A series of favors followed after Dexter’s decision to revive the hablon industry. A growing number of women weavers are now earning extra income because of growing orders from customers here and abroad.

And he is not finished yet, this fashion designer, entrepreneur and a “stylographer” is starting to put the “banig” weave to the fashion scene.

He is slowly reaching out the banig weavers in Badian town, as well as other parts of the province.

Glocal trend

Fashion products made out of “hablon” are now gaining attention from the world market, especially to those consumers who understood the essence of social entrepreneurship.

Branded under his retail arm, Amano Craft Creations, Dexter believes that export market offers good opportunity for Hablon and the local weavers to improve their income level. At the same time, bannering the local Cebu product to the world market.

At present, fashion and lifestyle products made of Hablon are displayed in Parklane Hotel, and at Alazas Shop.

Gowns, formal dresses, caftan , shoes and clutch bags,, scarf, and other resort ensembles made of Hablon and a bit of banig materials are also being constantly showcased in different fashions shows here and other parts of the country.

Since he re-introduced Hablon to be of his design creations about three years ago, he noted that these kind of intricate, handcrafted creations appeal mostly to foreign customers—either for fashion collection, or as souvenir from Cebu.

Already, Dexter has been serving clients who buy products made of hablon and banig to different countries, through Filipinos residing abroad.

He is confident that export move will make hablon an international hit. Making it a “Glocal” fashion sensation especially that the trend now is going towards nature-based materials.

The increasing number of responsible consumers, whose preference are to buy sustainable products, is seen to benefit the old-age industries such as hablon weaving, as Dexter believes that consumers whose passion is to support sustainable fashion and believe in local product are surprisingly increasing.

Part of social entrepreneurship advocacy as a designer and creative industry player in Cebu is also to promote ""barong bisaya.""

Bigger dream

Aside from making the hablon and banig weavers a legitimate part of the export business as soon as the export of hablon-made lifestyle products will take off, Alazas is moving towards convincing the government to and society for hablon to be declared as official cebu fabric.

If this will be officially declared as Cebu Fabric, a lot of women weavers will be benefitted and will also push Cebu’s authority in fashion and supporting local craftsmanship.

It is his dream for Cebu to eventually introduce a fabric that is uniquely Cebuano made to local and international fashion events not only to preserve the old-age weaving industry but also to help uplift the lives of the weavers in Argao.

“You see, other provinces have their own identities, like piña in Iloilo and tinalac in Davao. Cebu, with its rich creativity, still has to make its own identity in this area,” he is more proactive in putting Cebu’s fashion design and creativity reputation to higher level.

From following the rugged edges of his “trial and error” journey to fashion design, Dexter has gone a long way when he started his own shop in 1994.

Truly, success is never a straight line. Like Dexter, he had to start with bare hands, zero technical know-how while dropping off his “American Dream.”

After building his name in the fashion industry, he is heading towards re-building the pride of old-age Cebuano culture in fashion—promoting local, sustainable lifestyle designer products made out of what is abundant in Cebu. (FREEMAN)"

"Podcast: Two Cents' Worth

Two Cents’ Worth: Refashioning NZ’s rag trade

This week's business podcast looks at some of the economic pressures facing NZ's increasingly volatile fashion industry

New Zealand-made fashion is becoming increasingly unaffordable.

Our clothing manufacturers are facing growing pressure over sustainable fashion and calls for transparency around where our clothes are made.

The result is the closure of outlets as they cave under major competition from online shopping markets and international clothing giants.

Stephen Blase, the managing director of independent clothing manufacturer, The Pattern Table, has diversified. He’s now making items like tracksuits, leotards and babywear.

Adaptability and diversification has been the key to The Pattern Table’s success, since its launch four years ago.

“We’re only a small factory,” said Blase, “What we’re good at is being versatile.”

“We kind of do a little bit of everything in here. And that’s how we survive in a market that’s relatively difficult to work in.”

The Pattern Table, absorbed the Figaro sportswear company which has been around since the 70s, and it’s now one of the last remaining factories in NZ that makes garments from start to finish.

In the industry this is called CMT or Cut, Make and Trim. Blase said they do everything from cutting pattern blocks, to sourcing fabrics, sewing samples and doing production runs for mainly mid to high end fashion labels including Paris Georgia and womenswear label Harman Grubisa.

He said CMTs were very common in the late 90s, early 2000s.

“This establishment used to be a sportswear specialist factory and in its heyday there were 50 machinists, there was a screen printer and an embroiderer. But with the Chinese revolution, everything went off shore and it’s not sustained anymore.”

Nowadays NZ manufacturing is highly niche, said Blase.

“You’ve got the fabric suppliers, silk suppliers, wool suppliers and then you have contract cutters, contract sewers and then there’s me and one other business that does buttons and buttonholes.”

And the thing is, tapping into all these niche businesses or even making something new from scratch in New Zealand is not cheap.

Even if it has cost Blase $200 to make a coat, it will be sold wholesale for $400 and then the retailer puts three or four times on it. The coat ends up costing $1000.

“That’s just the cost of manufacturing locally.”

Which doesn’t stake up when people are more than happy to go to a chain store and buy a t-shirt for $10.

In comparison, for a nice shirt with all the bells and whistles Blase estimates you’re looking at 2 hours of sewing.

“That’s 40 or 50 dollars of labour in the shirt. We can charge at the most $40 an hour because if it’s more than that, the garment is not worth what it’s worth anymore. What the staff can do in here is pretty incredible. It’s just not worth what it’s worth,” he said.

This is how shipping production offshore becomes more feasible, as long as you’re transparent about it.

Blase believes people are willing to spend a bit more buying New Zealand made, they just have to trust it is locally made.

Which sounds appealing but has its own challenges.

The industry is also facing a significant skill shortage and Blase said growing emerging talent is difficult because there’s no margin for training people and there is no room for error when the cost of producing a garment is so high.

“Every year, there’s a thousand kids graduating from tech schools and sewing schools. They can make a garment ok, but they can’t make it as fast and as good as we need them to in here,” he said.

He is watching the changes in the industry closely as many of the skilled workers are aging and none of the new graduates want to be machinists, they all want to be designers.

Sue Prescott is a senior lecturer in Fashion at Massey University and she agrees the current industry isn’t sustainable and because of the limited opportunities here, fashion graduates are likely to head offshore.

But with a downsizing industry, Prescott said it is very hard for new graduates.

“People always need to be looking for niche areas. But people are also looking for new and innovative ways, they’re setting up small businesses and there are fewer Cut, Make and Trim factories and some machinists are very scarce, so people are looking for different ways to do things,” said Prescott.

She would like to see the government reinvest in training students in craftsmanship and artisanal practices.

“All those lovely slow methods and the beauty that comes from those. So, in the ideal world it would be wonderful to see a return to that.”

But even she admits that’s probably a long way off.

"Chanel has announced it will no longer use exotic animal pelts in its collections, making it one of the first major luxury labels to turn its back on crocodile and lizard skin.

In a move hailed by animal rights groups, Chanel's head of fashion Bruno Pavlovsky said the brand 'would no longer use exotic skins in our future creations', adding it was becoming more difficult to source high-quality pelts ethically.

The new policy will also see it ban fur from animals such as raccoon dog, mink and rabbit.

Handbags, coats and shoes made from snake, crocodile and stingray skin command premium prices, with vintage Chanel handbags made from pelts selling for upwards of £20,000 online.

Python skin bags were removed from Chanel's official website on Tuesday, although second-hand bags are still on sale for tens of thousands of pounds on vintage sites.

Chanel has announced it is banning the use of animal skin in its collections, although vintage handbags are still available to buy elsewhere (this stingray skin cross-body bag is currently on sale for £2,968.53 at 1stdibs.co.uk)

Karl Lagerfeld, Chanel's longtime creative director (pictured in Paris in October 2017) said that he used fur so rarely at Chanel that he couldn't remember when it last featured on the catwalk

Chanel's veteran designer Karl Lagerfeld told the website Women's Wear Daily that the French brand had chosen itself to drop exotic skins rather than it 'being imposed on us', adding: 'We did it because it's in the air.

'It's a free choice,' he added, insisting that he used fur so rarely at Chanel that he couldn't remember when it last featured on the catwalk.

Animal rights groups welcomed the move, with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) hailing Chanel as giving a lead to other luxury brands.

'There's nothing trendy about using stolen skins from tormented animals for clothing or accessories,' it said.

'It's clear that the time is now for all companies, like Louis Vuitton, to follow Chanel's lead and move to innovative materials that spare countless animals a miserable life and a violent, painful death,' PETA added.

This second-hand Chanel quilted chain bag, from the 1990s, is made from lizard skin and while animal pelt products have now been banned from the label's website this one is available to buy for £3,360.61 on 1stdibs.co.uk

This vintage Chanel 2.55 shoulder bag is cut from crocodile skin, now banned in the label's collections, and is listed for an eye-watering £22,000 on FarFetch

Although top fashion brands have been under heavy pressure to renounce fur, with Gucci, Armani, Versace and John Galliano all deciding to go fur free, Chanel's decision to stop using exotic skins came out of the blue.

Animal rights campaigns against the use of crocodile and snake skin products have not got the same traction with the public as similar crusades against fur, with some luxury brands even investing in reptile farms so they can guarantee that skins are sourced ethically.

Humane Society International (HSI) UK Executive Director Claire Bass said 'Fur is a bloody business that condemns millions of animals to miserable lives on fur farms, so HSI is delighted that Chanel has become yet another global fashion giant to drop fur from its collections.

A Chanel Grey Python Mini Flap Bag on sale from HardlyEverWornIt (HEWI) for £3,950. The value of second-hand pieces like this vintage number is now likely to soar

'The last two years have seen an unprecedented wave of the world's top designers forgoing fur, and every single one strengthens the message that fur is firmly out of fashion.

'Chanel is also turning its back on exotic skins, saving countless crocodiles, lizards, snakes and stingrays from suffering.

'The growth in fabulous luxury and eco-friendly fibres that don't involve animals suffering and dying is helping to drive forward this new era of ethical fashion.

'Fur-using brands such as Fendi, Dolce & Gabbana and Louis Vuitton need to take heed and embrace this fur-free future.'"
"Cotton On and Target investigate suppliers after forced labour of Uyghurs exposed in China's Xinjiang

Updated

阅读中文版本

On a cold Melbourne afternoon in June this year, 34-year-old Gulnur Idreis's phone started to ring. It was a video call coming from her elderly parents in Xinjiang, China. Any contact with them was precious.

Key points New evidence that China is funnelling Uyghurs from re-education camps into factory work

Major fashion retailers are now investigating whether their suppliers use forced labour

Women have spoken out about being forced to work in factories making clothes and gloves

Like all members of the Uyghur Muslim minority in China, they had spent the past two years living through a dystopian nightmare.

In early 2017, the Communist Party began a new incarceration campaign, rounding up, detaining and forcibly indoctrinating Uyghurs and other Muslim minority ethnic groups in the far-western region. Islam has effectively been outlawed in the far-western region, with people routinely labelled as extremists and imprisoned for practising their religion.

A UN committee describes the province as resembling a ""mass internment camp"", with estimates more than 1 million Uyghurs have been sent to prison or re-education camps. Many of those not detained have had their passports seized and live under constant surveillance.

Whenever they could, Gulnur's parents in Urumqi would quickly call her in Melbourne on the Chinese social media app WeChat to let her know they were OK.

The calls couldn't last long. The Chinese government can monitor all communication in the region. Contacting relatives overseas is enough to get Uyghurs sent off to a camp.

When Gulnur answered the call that afternoon, she was shocked to see the face of her older sister, Dilnur.

In February 2017, 38-year-old Dilnur and her husband were both arrested and sent to camps. A qualified nurse, Dilnur had spent years working at the hospital attached to Xinjiang Medical University.

Fearful of authorities listening in, Dilnur quickly began to desperately scribble out a series of notes and held them up for her sister in Melbourne to read.

She said that in May she was sent from the camp to work against her will in a factory and that she wanted Gulnur to take the dangerous step of telling the world her story.

""'Please speak up for me. Stand for me. Never give up.'""

""She wrote this down and showed it to me and I saw it,"" Gulnur told Four Corners.

Gulnur quickly took screenshots of the notes that described what was happening to her sister:

""660 people are brought in shackled and handcuffed and it is big,"" she said.

""They have no choice, they will end up in jail, if they say something.

""Tell them it has been two years, [I have] not been released.

""They don't want the journalist to know about it and they don't want it to be spread.""

Most disturbingly, Gulnur said her sister kept motioning that she wanted to end her life, running her hand across her neck.

""She looked very exhausted and emotionally very distressed. She doesn't like to live anymore,"" Gulnur said.

""She said for me, please help me. If I can't [get] out of this place, you can tell the international [community], the government. Whatever you can do.""

Dilnur still doesn't know where her husband is.

The factory

Using the screenshot of her employee ID card, Four Corners has tracked down the company Dilnur says she is being forced to work for.

It appears to be a textile company called Urumqi Shengshi Huaer Culture Technology Co, based in a technology park 30 kilometres north of Xinjiang's capital, Urumqi.

Dilnur told her sister that she sleeps in the factory dormitory and that she's only allowed home once a week to see her children and parents.

She said her eyesight is poor and if she can't do the complicated embroidery required, then she is forced to clean the factory.

""My sister is a nurse. She didn't know how to make the clothes,"" Gulnur said.

Mounting evidence of forced labour

Mounting evidence suggests a system of forced labour is emerging in Xinjiang.

Last October, Chinese State TV broadcast Uyghurs dutifully sewing at a camp in Hotan, raising the alarm that detainees were being put to work.

Satellite imagery of what appeared to be large warehouses in close proximity to re-education camps began to gain the interest of researchers around the globe, including Nathan Ruser, a satellite analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.

""You'll see attached buildings which appear to be factories,"" he said.

""When you look at their construction, you'll see that they're a large, single-room building which basically looks like an enormous warehouse. There's no internal structure to these buildings.""

A mother made to sew gloves

In Almaty, Kazakhstan, Four Corners interviewed Gulzira Auelkhan, another Chinese citizen who says she was forced to work in a factory in Xinjiang.

Gulzira says she was detained in Yining County and made to sew gloves that she was told would be sold in Europe.

""There were police when you enter and leave the factory, they will check our phones and conduct body search,"" Gulzira said.

""Even while we were working, there will be police, observing us.""

Gulzira had spent more than a year in re-education camps, separated from her young daughter and husband back in Kazakhstan.

She told Four Corners detainees were not the only people forced to work against their will — unemployed people and farmers were also being sent to the textile park.

""They were told by their local government: 'instead of unemployment, why not go work in these factories … but if you don't want to, you will be sent to the camp',"" she said.

Gulzira, who has residency in Kazakhstan, says she was eventually released and was allowed to leave Xinjiang in January 2019, after the Chinese released a small number of Kazakhs detainees.

Evidence of plans for a wider scheme

German academic Adrian Zenz is credited with helping to uncover the network of camps in Xinjiang when they first emerged in 2017.

He says he has shocking new evidence that these women's stories of forced labour are not isolated cases.

""Basically, there's a huge scheme going on, a huge plan in Xinjiang to put all kinds of people into different forms of involuntary labour,"" he told Four Corners.

""I realised it was kind of next level material in terms of what the Chinese state is capable of doing.""

Dr Zenz has been analysing a new trove of Communist Party official documents and state media articles.

He believes the Chinese government has plans to put as many camp detainees to work as they can.

""It's not sustainable to keep one or more million people locked up in camps for very long amounts of time. The goal of the government is to eventually release people, but not to release them into freedom,"" he said.

""They're being moved around a bit like figures on a chess board and they're put into places where the government can control them.

""Knowing Xinjiang, this kind of cooperation is not voluntary, it's being enforced.""

Official government notices and state media found by Dr Zenz describe the process of funnelling camp detainees into factory work.

Other reports detail how detainee labour is being used to attract companies to set up shop in Xinjiang.

""For example, if a factory trains and then employs a camp detainee, they get 5,000 renminbi per worker over a course of three years. They also get intensive subsidies, for example they can use a factory building for free for the first two years,"" Dr Zenz said.

Dr Zenz believes the labour schemes are about creating total social control over the Uyghurs.

""Those who are in the camps are supposed to get jobs, permanent factory jobs. The reason is that in these jobs the government can control them,"" he said.

""They can't take off on Friday to go to the mosque, they also can't fast, they cannot do basic religious practise. It's about total ideological control and it means that the party is going to control everything.""

Australian companies investigating supply chains

Four Corners can reveal that the following brands sold in Australia source cotton from Xinjiang: Target, Cotton On, Jeanswest, Dangerfield, Ikea and H&M.

Cotton On and Target Australia are now investigating their relationships with suppliers in Xinjiang.

The Cotton On Group sources cotton from Xinjiang-based subcontractors, Litai Textiles.

Litai Textiles operates two factories in the cities of Korla and Kuytun.

Chinese government notices viewed by Four Corners said the company's Kuytun branch was working with government officials to train and recruit surplus farm labourers for work in factories.

Asked if Cotton On was confident the cotton yarn it sourced from Litai Textiles was not being produced by people working against their will, the company told Four Corners it was not aware of the issues raised and would now undertake an investigation.

The company also confirmed a staff member last year visited Litai Textiles' Korla factory, which is located just six kilometres away from a massive re-education camp in the town.

Target Australia told Four Corners that one of its direct suppliers is using a small amount of cotton yarn from a mill owned by a company called Huafu Fashion Co in Xinjiang.

In May, a worker at a Huafu mill in the city of Aksu told the Wall Street Journal she had come to the mill from a secret training program which removed her ""extremist thoughts"".

In a call, the manager of the Huafu factory denied to Four Corners that his company used any form of involuntary labour.

Target Australia said it was, ""conducting a review of the situation"".

Questions remain about well-known brands

International brands H&M, Adidas and Esprit are investigating or have suspended their relationships with Huafu following The Wall Street Journal report and UNIQLO, Nike, and PVH Corp — the company behind Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger — said they are looking into the issue of forced labour in Xinjiang.

Nike said it was reviewing whether its suppliers sourced materials from the far-western region.

Ikea told Four Corners that about 15 per cent of its cotton comes from Xinjiang, but that is not aware of any forced labour among its sub suppliers in China.

Australian fashion brand Dangerfield says it sources up to 7 per cent of its cotton from Xinjiang, but that it inspects factories and that its suppliers have signed agreements not to purchase cotton that is produced from forced labour camps.

Woolworths said some of the cotton Big W sources is likely to be from Xinjiang and that it is ""working to improve traceability and transparency in key high-risk commodity areas, like cotton, through our Responsible Sourcing Program over the next 12 months.""

Questions still remain about the cotton supply of many other well-known Australian brands.

Just Group, which owns Just Jeans, Dotti, Jacqui E, Peter Alexander, Portmans and Jay Jays, sources 84 per cent of their products from China but would not tell Four Corners which regions the goods come from or rule out that they were from Xinjiang.

Similarly, the Noni B group, which owns Rockmans, Katies, Liz Jordan, W.Lane, Table Eight, Rivers, Millers, Crossroads and Autograph, said China is one of its four main suppliers and would not rule out that products came from Xinjiang.

Dr Zenz says it will soon become impossible to determine whether manufacturing products made in Xinjiang are made with labour from former detainees or not.

""Western companies stand an increasing risk of having products made by forced or at least highly involuntary labour somewhere in the supply chains. It's going to become inevitable as the scheme is unfolding and getting bigger and bigger,"" he said.

Ambassador questioned

The Chinese embassy did not respond to Four Corners' repeated requests to visit Xinjiang.

Last month when Four Corners put the allegations to ambassador Cheng Jingye at an event in Canberra, he denied there was a system of forced labour in Xinjiang.

""It's a training and education centre to help people who are affected by radical ideas, ideology to better integrate,"" he said.

Dr Zenz believes that the forced labour schemes in Xinjiang will lead to systemic breakdown of Uyghur family life as it was once known.

""The way that you re-engineer and change an ethnic group, an ethnic society is if you break up their core units,"" he said.

""You break up the family unit by making the parents work full-time in different places.

""That's also how you inhibit what's called intergenerational transmission of culture and religion. Meaning the parent's ability to pass on the cultural and the spiritual heritage to the next generation.

""If you can control that, then you basically have control over the entire next generation of these ethnic groups.""

La Trobe University associate professor James Leibold, one of the world's leading experts on ethnic minorities in China, told Four Corners that China's attempt to re-engineer the thoughts, behaviour and beliefs of 11 million Uyghurs to create a society loyal to the Communist Party amounts to cultural genocide.

""If you look at the legal definition of genocide, it has to be systematic, it has to be intentional. This is an act of cultural genocide and one of the worst human rights abuses of our time,"" he said.

On 24th April, Leonard Cheshire Disability are hosting a fashion event in aid of their Go Digital Programme.

Leonard Cheshire are one of Scotland’s leading disability charities and social care providers, who support and encourage people to live their lives however they choose, whatever their ability. They go beyond just offering social care, by giving guidance and support on an array of subjects and by helping build confidence and introducing new digital skill sets that enable disabled people to find and keep employment. Leonard Cheshire recently became the first charity in Scotland to achieve accreditation for the coveted investors in People Platinum Award, which recognised excellent people management. Additionally, they achieved the Gold Standard of the Investors in Young People Good Practice Award and the Investors in Health & Wellbeing Good Practice Award.

“A third of disabled people have never used the internet, compared to just 8% of non-disabled people - a ‘digital divide’ of 25%” – Leonard Cheshire.

All proceeds will go towards funding the expansion of their Go Digital programme, which enables disabled people to use revolutionary IT and assistive technology to help develop a range of digital skills. This in turn, increases their confidence and enables them to gain qualifications. With proceeds from the fashion show, Leonard Cheshire will be expanding this life-changing programme across the West of Scotland.

Leonard Cheshire are also passionate about the inclusion of disabled people in the world of fashion, so will be using disabled models and models with additional support needs to showcase the pieces on the catwalk. There are an array of popular fashion brands and designers that are involved in this event, including Totty Rocks, CADARRA and Harris Tweed, who will all be showcasing their pieces on the night.

Totty Rocks

Totty Rocks is a popular independent womenswear fashion label and boutique situated in the Bruntsfield area of Edinburgh. They offer a unique, fashion forward range of women’s clothing, all designed and produced in Scotland. Their product range includes the bestselling Totty Rocks Mac, as well as trousers, blouses, skirts and dresses. Totty Rocks is aimed at style conscious women with an eye for quality and who want something different. The brand are extremely successful and have had many celebrity clients over the years, including Kate Moss and Gok Wan. Totty Rocks cater clothing for women of all shapes and sizes and will be showcasing some of their designs on the catwalk at the Leonard Cheshire fashion show.

“For us to be included in this event resonates because as a brand we completely believe in diversity and inclusion within all areas of life and for our part, fashion. We have a diverse customer base, we create clothing for all ages, genders and all shapes and sizes as our pieces are cut and made to measure for the individual based on their needs. We believe passionately in Leonard Cheshire as a charity and greatly appreciate the efforts and work that is done to improve and fulfil the lives of disabled people.” – Totty Rocks.

CADARRA

CADARRA is an Australian multiway fashion garment, designed by company owner and director Patsy Cadell, that can be styled in over 20 ways. The CADARRA was designed out of necessity resulting from inadequacies in the ‘wardrobe to go’ market. The garment has endless styling possibilities for women of every shape and size as shown in the company’s mission statement:

“MINIMISE your fashion stress, DOWNSIZE your fashion wardrobe, SIMPLIFY your fashion options. CADARRA provides the tools to enable women of all ages and body shapes to look and feel FASHONABLY FABULOUS, especially when travelling. CADARRA truly is your… EMERGENCY FASHION SURVIVIAL KIT”

CADARRA is currently sold online and at Sydney’s Paddington Markets each Saturday where Patsy conducts styling demonstrations throughout the day, like the ones she will conduct in aid of Leonard Cheshire on 25th April at the Scottish Youth Theatre in Glasgow. As a result of its success in Australia, CADARRA will now be launching in the United Kingdom in five different colourways and will be available to view at the fashion show.

“7 years ago when I first designed CADARRA, I was working full time as a fundraising consultant, coordinating major events for charities. Previously I had been employed as fundraising manager with several major Australian charities including the Institute for Deaf and Blind Children, the Cancer Council and the Children's Medical Research Institute. Whenever I showcase CADARRA, I endeavour to include a fundraising component into the event. Regardless of their disability CADARRA suits all fashion-conscious women. A number of the styles can also easily adapt to suit those who are wheel chair bound, we should applaud these differences and the inner strength of those who cope so well despite their differences. When I was approached to feature CADARRA in the Glasgow fashion show for Leonard Cheshire in Scotland I was delighted and honoured to do so. After researching the work of Leonard Cheshire Disability, I was even more willing to be involved. This trip is as a result of the Fashion Show organiser, Mary Leishman, visiting Paddington Markets at the end of last year and inviting me to participate. I have extended my time and will be doing styling workshop sessions and soirees through clients in the Cotswolds and Dublin as well. With the Glasgow Fashion show aiding Leonard Cheshire Disability, I am donating 10% from orders placed as a result of the Styling Workshop Sessions.” – Patsy at CADARRA

Harris Tweed

Harris Tweed Hebrides are working with Walker Slater for the Leonard Cheshire fashion show. Walker Slater will be supplying the garments as Harris Tweed is actually a cloth that is handwoven, dyed and finished by islanders in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland. It is protected by the Harris Tweed act of Parliament 1993, which outlines the conditions in which the cloth can be genuinely made. Authentic Harris Tweed is recognised through the Harris Tweed Orb Mark, the UK’s oldest registered trademark, after inspection by the Harris Tweed Authority, the industry's governing body. Walker Slater sell a variety of genuine Harris Tweed pieces, in both menswear and womenswear and also accessories. The product range at Walker Slater also extends to non-Harris Tweed products such as shirts and jumpers and they get new product lines often.

Mark Hogarth, creative director of Harris Tweed Hebrides, said: ""Fashion and style are for everybody and Harris Tweed Hebrides are proud to support Leonard Cheshire in putting forward an inclusive message. People with disabilities can participate both as consumers and as contributors. The fashion industry embraces a huge range of skills and the digital expertise which Leonard Cheshire is promoting through this event is relevant to fashion and design, as to many other sectors of the economy”.

The Leonard Cheshire fashion event will be showcasing each of these brands along with Serenity and Grace + Sarah Haran and will feature canapes, prosecco and a raffle draw. (www.leonardcheshire.org)

The Leonard Cheshire Fashion Event will start at 7pm at the Scottish Youth Theatre in Glasgow on Wednesday 24th April. Tickets priced at £20 and are available from Eventbrite. (www.eventbrite.com)"

"Cotton On and Target investigate suppliers after forced labour of Uyghurs exposed in China's Xinjiang

""Basically, there's a huge scheme going on, a huge plan in Xinjiang to put all kinds of people into different forms of involuntary labour,"" he told Four Corners.

""I realised it was kind of next level material in terms of what the Chinese state is capable of doing.""

Dr Zenz has been analysing a new trove of Communist Party official documents and state media articles.

He believes the Chinese government has plans to put as many camp detainees to work as they can.

""It's not sustainable to keep one or more million people locked up in camps for very long amounts of time. The goal of the government is to eventually release people, but not to release them into freedom,"" he said.

""They're being moved around a bit like figures on a chess board and they're put into places where the government can control them.

""Knowing Xinjiang, this kind of cooperation is not voluntary, it's being enforced.""

Official government notices and state media found by Dr Zenz describe the process of funnelling camp detainees into factory work.

Other reports detail how detainee labour is being used to attract companies to set up shop in Xinjiang.

""For example, if a factory trains and then employs a camp detainee, they get 5,000 renminbi per worker over a course of three years. They also get intensive subsidies, for example they can use a factory building for free for the first two years,"" Dr Zenz said.

Dr Zenz believes the labour schemes are about creating total social control over the Uyghurs.

""Those who are in the camps are supposed to get jobs, permanent factory jobs. The reason is that in these jobs the government can control them,"" he said.

""They can't take off on Friday to go to the mosque, they also can't fast, they cannot do basic religious practise. It's about total ideological control and it means that the party is going to control everything.""

Australian companies investigating supply chains

Four Corners can reveal that the following brands sold in Australia source cotton from Xinjiang: Target, Cotton On, Jeanswest, Dangerfield, Ikea and H&M.

Cotton On and Target Australia are now investigating their relationships with suppliers in Xinjiang.

The Cotton On Group sources cotton from Xinjiang-based subcontractors, Litai Textiles.

Litai Textiles operates two factories in the cities of Korla and Kuytun.

Chinese government notices viewed by Four Corners said the company's Kuytun branch was working with government officials to train and recruit surplus farm labourers for work in factories.

Asked if Cotton On was confident the cotton yarn it sourced from Litai Textiles was not being produced by people working against their will, the company told Four Corners it was not aware of the issues raised and would now undertake an investigation.

The company also confirmed a staff member last year visited Litai Textiles' Korla factory, which is located just six kilometres away from a massive re-education camp in the town.

Target Australia told Four Corners that one of its direct suppliers is using a small amount of cotton yarn from a mill owned by a company called Huafu Fashion Co in Xinjiang.

In May, a worker at a Huafu mill in the city of Aksu told the Wall Street Journal she had come to the mill from a secret training program which removed her ""extremist thoughts"".

In a call, the manager of the Huafu factory denied to Four Corners that his company used any form of involuntary labour.

Target Australia said it was, ""conducting a review of the situation"".

Questions remain about well-known brands

International brands H&M, Adidas and Esprit are investigating or have suspended their relationships with Huafu following The Wall Street Journal report and UNIQLO, Nike, and PVH Corp — the company behind Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger — said they are looking into the issue of forced labour in Xinjiang.

Nike said it was reviewing whether its suppliers sourced materials from the far-western region.

Ikea told Four Corners that about 15 per cent of its cotton comes from Xinjiang, but that is not aware of any forced labour among its sub suppliers in China.

Australian fashion brand Dangerfield says it sources up to 7 per cent of its cotton from Xinjiang, but that it inspects factories and that its suppliers have signed agreements not to purchase cotton that is produced from forced labour camps.

Woolworths said some of the cotton Big W sources is likely to be from Xinjiang and that it is ""working to improve traceability and transparency in key high-risk commodity areas, like cotton, through our Responsible Sourcing Program over the next 12 months.""

Questions still remain about the cotton supply of many other well-known Australian brands.

Just Group, which owns Just Jeans, Dotti, Jacqui E, Peter Alexander, Portmans and Jay Jays, sources 84 per cent of their products from China but would not tell Four Corners which regions the goods come from or rule out that they were from Xinjiang.

Similarly, the Noni B group, which owns Rockmans, Katies, Liz Jordan, W.Lane, Table Eight, Rivers, Millers, Crossroads and Autograph, said China is one of its four main suppliers and would not rule out that products came from Xinjiang.

Dr Zenz says it will soon become impossible to determine whether manufacturing products made in Xinjiang are made with labour from former detainees or not.

""Western companies stand an increasing risk of having products made by forced or at least highly involuntary labour somewhere in the supply chains. It's going to become inevitable as the scheme is unfolding and getting bigger and bigger,"" he said.

Ambassador questioned

The Chinese embassy did not respond to Four Corners' repeated requests to visit Xinjiang.

Last month when Four Corners put the allegations to ambassador Cheng Jingye at an event in Canberra, he denied there was a system of forced labour in Xinjiang.

""It's a training and education centre to help people who are affected by radical ideas, ideology to better integrate,"" he said.

Dr Zenz believes that the forced labour schemes in Xinjiang will lead to systemic breakdown of Uyghur family life as it was once known.

""The way that you re-engineer and change an ethnic group, an ethnic society is if you break up their core units,"" he said.

""You break up the family unit by making the parents work full-time in different places.

""That's also how you inhibit what's called intergenerational transmission of culture and religion. Meaning the parent's ability to pass on the cultural and the spiritual heritage to the next generation.

""If you can control that, then you basically have control over the entire next generation of these ethnic groups.""

La Trobe University associate professor James Leibold, one of the world's leading experts on ethnic minorities in China, told Four Corners that China's attempt to re-engineer the thoughts, behaviour and beliefs of 11 million Uyghurs to create a society loyal to the Communist Party amounts to cultural genocide.

""If you look at the legal definition of genocide, it has to be systematic, it has to be intentional. This is an act of cultural genocide and one of the worst human rights abuses of our time,"" he said.

"MILAN (AP) - Milan Fashion Week launched Wednesday on a note of optimism with news that sales have reached pre-crisis levels.

The Italian Fashion Chamber says sales are expected to reach 90 billion euros ($105 billion) this year, matching levels of a decade ago, with exports driving growth of 3 percent.

More numbers: The September spring-summer womenswear previews are the highlight of the Milan fashion calendar, and the fashion chamber boasts that the 60 runway shows, 80 presentations and 44 collateral events this time around make it the biggest in the world.

Highlights from Wednesday's shows, including Jil Sander, Arthur Arbesser, Moncler and Annakiki.

SEEKING SUSTAINABILITY AT ARTHUR ARBESSER

Milan-based Austrian designer Arthur Arbesser takes eco-sustainability seriously in fashion and life.

Italian ceramics inspire the swirling patterns and textures on garments, like a pleated skirt with a swirling pattern worn beneath a masculine check jacket belted at the side.

For Arbesser, the world of ceramics represents ""rawness and a certain glamour. It is also the process of ceramic, to go from something basic like clay and turn it into something beautiful, like a shiny sculpture.""

So he combined basic, raw textiles, like an unfinished linen, with more showy sequins arranged in a print. He said he wanted to give a signal about the importance of sustainability in fashion by incorporating organic textiles - while also conceding how difficult it is in this era to remain sustainable.

""I tried this summer to live without plastic,"" Arbesser said. But he had to give in to plastic water bottles while traveling for work with collaborators in Tuscany in the 40 degree Celsius (104F) heat. ""It is not easy.""

JIL SANDER'S MANTLE

Lucie and Luke Meier have taken up the Jil Sander mantle, literally and figuratively.

The designers presenting their third womenswear collection for the fashion house have shown their mastery of the Sander minimalist aesthetic but have developed the confidence to imbue it with some nostalgia. Hitting the target: A long crocheted white dress with slits for arms like a yesteryear mantle, over a sheer white skirt.

There was no inspiration beyond the simple line.

The looks were clean, bearing the codes of uniforms with tunics, trousers and big shirts, but with feminine touches, like pleats, layered body-hugging knitwear and crocheted pieces that portrayed both power and delicacy.

On shirts and dresses, the designers created oversized, arched cuffs that gave an architectural whimsy to the looks. Denim was set off by trailing sheers. Fringe gave weight and movement to a light skirt. The colors were basic, whites, gray, blue, browns and sage.

Extreme platforms finished the looks, or flat booties with slightly gathered toes. Handbags were practical square purses or oversized shoppers, held impractically sideways.

ANNAKIKI'S FASHION GLITCH

Chinese designer Anna Yang's Annakiki's collection popped with youthful energy.

The young designer founded her brand in 2012 and was showing in Milan for the fourth time, drawing a dedicated crowd to the temporary exhibition space La Permanente.

Yang has her finger on the youth pulse. Her looks were fun with a hint of rebellion. In her notes, she said her style was the result of a ""fashion glitch"" giving way to innovation.

An off-shoulder pink dress with a shiny finish suggests party. She employed blurred prints with her name to great effect, including a shirt-brief combo in black and white enhanced by a big green ruffle, which could have been a skirt but instead was worn across the shoulders. A pink anorak appeared to be covered with candy dots.

Yang plays with luxury, employing PVC as a liquidy textile on puffy-sleeved blousons worn with pleated skirts. And she has tapped into the younger generation's love of streetwear, with athletic trousers worn with a cropped jacket, or knit briefs and bra top under a silvery overcoat.

The color palette of bright pinks and greens, contrasting with black and neutrals, including denim, but never plain, decorated with beads.

N.21 PARTY GIRL

Alessandro Dell'Acqua's party girl looks for N.21 are black, essential and elegant. And then the palette changes to camel, coral, pink and greens - emerald and lime. But the constant throughout the collection: dresses.

She may start off with a straight dress. But then she dresses it up with a beaded dress of repeating triangles. Or a feathery overlay that give the looks movement. Or a glimmering rhinestone accent piece.

Silhouettes were disciplined and tailored, from pencil skirts, to pretty cocktail dresses with long ribbons flowing like streamers from the back, to fuller dresses with big ruffle hems and modern racing backs.

Dell'Acqua said this season marked a purposeful turn away from streetwear that has dominated runways in recent seasons. ""I wanted to return to real dresses, because it is also our duty to provide an education in creativity,"" he said.

"Sustainable living: Yoga teacher Sieske Valk switched her banking to Triodos

Millions of households already choose to buy fairtrade food, eco-friendly cosmetics and sustainable fashion.

But tens of thousands of customers are now also opting for 'moral' current accounts, loans, credit cards, savings and mortgages.

The amount of money paid into these 'ethical' banks has risen from £2,077 billion to £2,518 billion in 12 months, according to Ethical Consumer.

Typically, these banks do not invest in, or lend to, companies involved in commodities such as weapons, alcohol, tobacco and fur.

Instead, they often lend to companies which have a positive impact on the world, such as community projects or renewable energy, and hand out mortgages to people building sustainable homes.

Banks which claim to be ethical include Triodos Bank, Charity Bank, Reliance Bank, Ecology Building Society and The Co-operative Bank.

Rachel Springall at Moneyfacts says: 'Many consumers now want to know exactly where profits are being spent, and there are brands around who can give them an alternative to the big banks.

'The rates tend to be fairly poor in comparison to the best buys, but they are often still much better than the biggest banks.'

On easy access savings accounts, the rates are mixed. Triodos offers up to 1 per cent while Ecology Building Society offers 0.85 per cent compared to 1.5 per cent from mainstream rival Virgin Money.

On a £10,000 deposit, going green would mean giving up at least £15 in interest.

Regardless, the rates are still a good way ahead of major banks such as NatWest and HSBC, which offer 0.2 per cent on their standard easy access accounts.

For fixed rate accounts, some ethical banks even top the tables. For a one-year fixed deal, for example, Gatehouse offers the highest rate at 2.15 per cent.

Ethical banks lend to firms which have a positive impact on the world, such as community projects or renewable energy, and hand out mortgages to people building sustainable homes.

Despite being lesser-known, these banks are still covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, which means that up to £85,000 of your savings is protected should they go bust.

Triodos Bank, based in Bristol, has seen its customer accounts numbers rise by 13 per cent in the past year from 52,200 to 58,800.

It also publishes which businesses it lends to, believing banks should be transparent about who they fund.

These include organic beauty firm Neal's Yard, magazine for the homeless The Big Issue and River Cottage, the brand of television chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall who campaigns for sustainable farming.

Triodos Bank is currently offering some customers £40 vouchers to spend at vegan and eco-friendly online shop the Ethical Superstore.

It also offers customers with current accounts biodegradable debit cards made from compacted plant leaves and corn.

Pioneer: The Co-operative Bank has had an 'ethical policy' since 1992. It does not lend to, or invest in, companies which do not fit with its values, such as the oil, coal or gas industry

But bear in mind that there is a £3 monthly fee and no financial rewards. The bank also refuses to give customers credit cards. The other major downside is that there are no UK branches and you can only deposit cheques.

Yoga teacher Sieske Valk now banks with Triodos because she wanted her finances to match with her ethical lifestyle.

The 31-year-old vegetarian, who lives in South East London, says: 'It seems strange to do everything else 'fair and green' if your banking still supports things like the weapons trade and tobacco.

'Switching bank is such an easy thing to do and can make a real difference.'

Reliance, the Salvation Army's bank, offers current accounts, with all profits going to support the Christian charity's work in everything from addiction to emergency response.

But, like Triodos, it won't be handing you a credit card as it would contravene the Salvation Army's ethics.

Huw Davies, head of retail banking at Triodos Bank UK, says: 'People are increasingly making sustainable choices with green energy suppliers and in their shopping.

'And more are realising that savings and investments also play a crucial role in addressing environmental and social issues. We believe in using money as a force for good.'

If you want an ethical current account which still gives you rewards, Co-op pays up to £5.50 a month if you fulfil a list of criteria, including depositing £800 a month, staying in credit and paperless statements.

But the bank's ethical reputation has taken a hit in recent years after it nearly collapsed in 2013 after suffering a £1.5 billion capital shortfall and its then-chairman Paul Flowers was caught in a drugs scandal.

It was taken over by U.S. hedge fund owners last year, who seized almost full control of the bank, raising question marks over whether it could retain its ethical stance.

Banks do not need to fulfil any criteria in order to call themselves ethical; there is no official accreditation.

The Co-operative Bank has had an 'ethical policy' since 1992. It does not lend to, or invest in, companies which do not fit with its values, such as the oil, coal or gas industry. Customers can vote on this.

"PARIS, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Luxury conglomerate LVMH has bought a majority holding in Jean Patou, a French couture label it will attempt to revive by relaunching its ready-to-wear clothing collections.

The label, founded in 1912 by designer Jean Patou, a contemporary of Coco Chanel, was of late solely focused on its fragrance business. It is best known for its ""Joy"" perfume.

LVMH, the world's biggest luxury group and owner of Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, bought the controlling stake from Britain's Designer Parfums Ltd, a spokesman said, confirming a report on industry site FashionNetwork.

The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.

To design its fashion lines, LVMH has recruited Guillaume Henry, formerly of Nina Ricci, who is also credited with reviving Carven, another faded French fashion house from the 1940s.

Patou joins a handful of couture labels being revived, although most are expected to remain small players in an age of mega-brands like Vuitton or Kering's Gucci.

They include France's Poiret, a label founded at the turn of the 20th century by Paul Poiret and which in February turned out its first catwalk collection since closing nine decades earlier.

"Britain's Prince Harry attends the WE Day UK event at the SSE Arena in Wembley. Picture: Reuters

London - The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have been putting sustainability at the heart of many of the design decisions for their new home in Berkshire. It is arguably the hottest trend this year. Having been a hit in the fashion world and the food industry, sustainability is now big business in home interiors.

Meghan has enlisted the help of interior designer Vicky Charles to work on Frogmore Cottage on the Windsor Estate ahead of the birth of her and Harry’s first child.

So far, we know they have chosen a non-toxic, vegan paint for the nursery and a £50 000 (about R950 000) eco-friendly boiler.

But while the demand for ethically sourced homewares is on the rise, it’s not necessary to spend a fortune to update your home with eco-friendly designs.

RECYCLED RUBBISH

A growing interest in repurposed materials has seen more and more designers creating style from what is essentially rubbish. And it’s finding its way into big retail stores.

BREATHING NEW LIFE

Wood can be easily repurposed. Ben Adams, co-founder of online furniture firm Rust Collections, sources salvaged wood from reclamation yards. ""By using recycled wood, you give new purpose to a material that has already had a life and, in doing so, the carbon footprint is kept low,"" he says.

Jenny Wanstall, ethical trade manager at Oliver Bonas, says: ""Mango trees are grown for their fruit for around 20 years. When the tree reaches its full height, it will stop bearing fruit. In the past, these trees were cut down and used as fuel or left to rot releasing carbon emissions. Farmers are now selling the wood, reducing waste.""

HOW TO ‘UPCYCLE’

The ultimate in sustainable living, ""upcycling"" means saving something from landfill and using it to create something new.

In Joanna Thornhill’s new book, My Bedroom Is An Office (Laurence King), the stylist and author explores upcycling around the home. ""Before replacing a piece of furniture that’s no longer to your taste, consider whether that could be rectified,"" she says. ""Fussy Victorian pieces can be transformed by painting them in a contemporary colour or recovering them in a modern fabric.""

NATURAL PAINT

Choosing paint is no longer just about finding the perfect shade. There’s more to it. Household paint brands tend to use milk or beeswax as a binding agent, which means it’s not vegan, and many use ingredients that have been tested on animals.

The Organic & Natural Paint Co - the brand Harry and Meghan reportedly used - is not only vegan, it’s also odourless, non-toxic, eco-friendly and infused with eucalyptus essential oils, said to enhance memory, boost the immune system and stimulate creativity.

Interior designer and architect Edward Bulmer has been working with specialist paint manufacturers for ten years to develop non-toxic paint.

Many mainstream ones are made from chemicals derived from refined crude oil. Bulmer’s paint is made from raw materials such as plant extracts, chalk, minerals and linseed.

"New York (CNN Business) Bankrupt Gymboree has found a buyer for its brands. The Children's Place and Gap have agreed to purchase most of what's left of the company.

It's the latest shakeup in the sector as brick-and-mortar stores try to find their footing in a challenging environment.

Children's Place will spend $76 million to acquire the rights to the Gymboree and Crazy 8 brands, and will take over the contract for Gymboree Play & Music, which was spun off in 2016, according to court documents filed Saturday.

Gap appears to be going all-in on Gymboree's more upscale Janie and Jack brand. It's paying $35 million for the online business and leases to Janie and Jack stores, with an additional agreement to buy Janie and Jack's inventory.

The moves follow Gymboree's decision in January to file for bankruptcy for the second time in less than two years.

"Does your bedding do better? Not just for your sleep cycle, but also for the planet?

It’s a question more people — and brands — seem to be asking themselves as new options pop up featuring organic textiles and fair manufacturing process. It’s yet another way to explore the movement of conscious consumption — while also adding cool items to your home.

The Montreal-based brand Maison Tess is one company attempting to do its part to offer bedding that’s, well, better. The products, which are Oeko Tex organic certified, according to the brand, are crafted from hypoallergenic linen and cotton that is part of the Better Cotton Initiative, an NGO that aims for sustainable and environmentally effective ways to deal with cotton.

We caught up with Laura Nezri, the founder of Maison Tess, to learn more.

Q. For those who aren’t familiar, what is Maison Tess?

A. Maison Tess is an online home linen brand. We sell premium bedding made in Portugal and sold via our website.

Q. What makes it different from other bedding brands?

Q. Who is your target customer?

A. Our products are designed and developed for the couples and families of today. We are most definitely a brand that predominantly attracts a female customer who is fashion-forward and trend savvy.

A. You should expect a new colour coming in May. We work on two types of colours: basics and seasonal. The seasonal ones are colours that are on trend, available on a season-based approach, and that compliment the basic colour palette.

Q. What more can you share about where the pieces are designed/made?

A. Our manufacturer is family owned, fourth generation, has the oldest mill in the area, and they specialized in small-to-medium production. So, no mass production and less waste. I made my way there and I was blown away. These employees were artists, all of them. You can see the trans-generational work being applied on each product. These amazing women weaving the product, looking at them one by one to make sure the that quality control was met. Real authentic craftsmanship!

I loved the fact that each Tess product is dyed specifically for us. I am the one who does the research before each collection and I determine the colours I think will be on trend for the following season, based on fashion trends. Once that work is done, I send them my colours and they get back to me with samples of colours in all our fabrics. Once approved, it is produced and received in our Montreal office.

Q. What is the price range for Maison Tess bedding?

A. Our prices start at $50 up to $515.

Q. Where can people check them out?

A. Online at maisontess.com.

Just like your personal style, we want your rooms to come to life as an extension of your personality and your lifestyle. Our products become a part of your reality as they let you embrace the practicality that lies in the beauty of the mess. Your home should be a reflection of who you are — no filter needed.

Q. Who is your target customer?

A. Our products are designed and developed for the couples and families of today. We are most definitely a brand that predominantly attracts a female customer who is fashion-forward and trend savvy.

Q. What’s new for the spring season?

A. You should expect a new colour coming in May. We work on two types of colours: basics and seasonal. The seasonal ones are colours that are on trend, available on a season-based approach, and that compliment the basic colour palette.

Q. What more can you share about where the pieces are designed/made?

A. Our manufacturer is family owned, fourth generation, has the oldest mill in the area, and they specialized in small-to-medium production. So, no mass production and less waste. I made my way there and I was blown away. These employees were artists, all of them. You can see the trans-generational work being applied on each product. These amazing women weaving the product, looking at them one by one to make sure the that quality control was met. Real authentic craftsmanship!

I loved the fact that each Tess product is dyed specifically for us. I am the one who does the research before each collection and I determine the colours I think will be on trend for the following season, based on fashion trends. Once that work is done, I send them my colours and they get back to me with samples of colours in all our fabrics. Once approved, it is produced and received in our Montreal office.

Q. What is the price range for Maison Tess bedding?

A. Our prices start at $50 up to $515.

Q. Where can people check them out?

A. Online at maisontess.com.

"Anneline Nagan, of Phoenix, is a plus-size model headed for the catwalk at the Durban Fashion Fair later this year. Picture: Supplied

ANNELINE Nagan, of Phoenix, is all about owning her image. The plus-size model is one of 37 models (standard and plus-size combined) currently participating in the Durban Fashion Fair’s Bootcamp 2019.

The fashion fair will take place from September 25 to 28, at the Durban ICC, where she will walk the catwalk at the highbrow event.

Nagan, 32, is the only representative from the Indian community and is excited her journey has got her this far.

Her mantra - giving up is never an option, no matter how hard the road gets, keep moving forward in pursuit of the dream - spurs her on.

“There were a few times when I was either ushered out of a boutique, as my size was never available, or laughed at due to being plus-size,” she said.

“Yes this is damaging emotionally but, as a plus-sized woman, you have to believe in yourself first, and progressively overcome the slander and hate against being plus-size. I’m never too shy to compliment a woman - plus-size or standard size - with the hope that this has a ripple effect.”

Commenting on what made her enter the 2019 Durban Fashion Fair model search, she said: “I did plus-size modelling for a well-known clothing brand about five years ago and appeared in a leading national magazine and a Durban newspaper. Unfortunately, I was advised there was not much of a demand for plus-size models in Durban.

“During this period, my confidence levels did a 180. But that changed. A work colleague tagged me on the Facebook post for plus-size model search and told me I needed to do this because she knew I would get it. Another reason was because of the community I am from.

“Truth be told, on many plus-size campaigns, you hardly see an Indian model. I want to encourage women that big is beautiful and why not show off those curves?”

In an era overcome by the social media hype of fake beauty filters, fad diets, and cosmetic body alterations, we asked Nagan for her advice to other women.

“The most important aspect about loving yourself is accepting the body and beauty you were born with.

“You do not have to be a size 32 waist with those waist trimmers. You can be plus-size or standard size and still be beautiful. Do not adjust to society’s demands and beliefs. Let society adjust to you.”

She said she was amped for her new experience.

“Ramp modelling is new to me, but what will make me enjoy it more, is the live audience and meeting the designers Durban has a lot of hidden talent, especially in the fashion industry. We have the opportunity to showcase our cultural fashion sense across the world. At the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in California, Beyoncé wore a Zulu hat. A fashion evolution is what we are aiming towards, so a competitive fashion industry is a must.“

On her future plans, she said: “I hope I get the exposure I did not get previously, not only for myself but for all * lus-size Indian wome* .”

Sindi Shangase, convener for the Durban Fashion Fair (DFF) said this year, the inclusion of a plus size model category in their model search was to embrace what many other high profile fashion events in both South Africa and abroad have not: “The so-called size acceptance movement,” she explained.

“This not only embraces the realisation, by many top fashion brands and retailers, that one size doesn’t necessarily fit all, and that the number of stereotypical skinny models is extremely limited. Many of the designers, who create collections for the DFF ramp, primarily cater for larger figured ladies who are prepared to do what their thinner counter parts have not done - support local designers and invest in clothing that suits their bodies and embraces their individual style and personality.”

Shangase said the DFF was created by the eThekwini Municipality to support entrepreneurship and grow the fashion design sector of the economy.

“Worldwide, a lack of fashionable attire for larger sized ladies has left a huge gap in the market that is now being embraced by fashion retailers At DFF 2019, we are decolonising fashion. We are embracing both the size and shape of ‘real’ African women and helping create a far more inclusive African fashion industry, that can be embraced by designers and fashion lovers alike.”

She added: “In the past we have had DFF designers working with fuller figure models, now we are taking this further and have included the plus-size models, and created a conducive programme (DFF Bootcamp) for them to receive proper training in preparation for them to launch their careers, within the modelling industry that has now started to recognise them”.

"LONDON (Reuters) - Outfits inspired by the first female astronaut’s trip into space and “an ode to England” kicked off London Fashion Week on Friday as the British capital began its leg of the month-long catwalk calendar.

Known for its established brands such as Burberry and Vivienne Westwood as well as new designers including Matty Bovan and Molly Goddard, London’s event is the second stop of the autumn/winter 2019 womenswear season which began in New York and later heads to Milan and Paris.

Turkish designer Bora Aksu took inspiration from Russian cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova, the first woman to go into space in 1963, spending almost three days in orbit.

Models wore luminous organza and tulle outfits - layered skirts, tiered ruffled lace dresses and frilly cardigans in a soft colors such as pale pink, green and lilac.

Boxed and puffer jackets were a nod to the space suits, with silver and suede boots adding to the look. The outfits were completed with knitted headpieces - a reference to Tereshkova’s upbringing in a village and then working in a textiles factory before joining the Soviet space program.

“She had such a normal life but she had a dream and pursued it,” Aksu said backstage. “I was drawn to her determination.”

Meanwhile, Matty Bovan said his eclectic collection of colorful prints, tapestry-like knitwear and crinoline skirts was an “ode to England”.

Models wore Liberty print blouses with Edwardian necklines and frilled shoulders, at times deconstructed and matched with other florals. Voluminous skirts were sequined or layered in clashing prints, knit crochet or a mix of fabrics. The looks were topped with eye-catching headgear and large keyrings.

“We have so many traditional fabrics, so many traditional English suppliers,” Bovan said. “It’s really turned into my love affair with all those textiles and histories.”

ANIMAL RIGHTS

London Fashion Week declared itself fur-free at September’s shows and designers confirmed this was also the case this season, British Fashion Council (BFC) Chief Executive Caroline Rush told Reuters.

“We see it as a cultural change, something that is very much what about the consumer is asking for at the moment,” she said.

This did not stop a small demonstration from animal rights activists PETA outside, where three blindfolded protesters held up signs and a “bloody shorn lamb” replica to highlight what they said was “the suffering of sheep exploited for wool”.

Fashion editors and buyers from around the world have come to London for the event, the last before Britain’s exit from the European Union, due on March 29.

Uncertainty over how Britain will leave the bloc hangs over an industry reliant on materials, workforces and business from the countries within the EU.

“The majority of (UK fashion) businesses ... voted to remain ... so there’s a huge amount of frustration in terms of there not only being no deal in place as it stands at the moment but the idea that we might go to a no-deal scenario,” Rush said.

Last month, Burberry said leaving the EU without a deal would cost the fashion house tens of millions of pounds in tariffs and disrupt the movement of fabrics and products.

“London has very much been known as a global fashion capital, our businesses are known globally for being brilliant creators and collaborators and that narrative really has to continue,” Rush said."
"Sustainable living: Yoga teacher Sieske Valk switched her banking to Triodos

Millions of households already choose to buy fairtrade food, eco-friendly cosmetics and sustainable fashion.

But tens of thousands of customers are now also opting for 'moral' current accounts, loans, credit cards, savings and mortgages.

The amount of money paid into these 'ethical' banks has risen from £2,077 billion to £2,518 billion in 12 months, according to Ethical Consumer.

Typically, these banks do not invest in, or lend to, companies involved in commodities such as weapons, alcohol, tobacco and fur.

Instead, they often lend to companies which have a positive impact on the world, such as community projects or renewable energy, and hand out mortgages to people building sustainable homes.

Banks which claim to be ethical include Triodos Bank, Charity Bank, Reliance Bank, Ecology Building Society and The Co-operative Bank.

Rachel Springall at Moneyfacts says: 'Many consumers now want to know exactly where profits are being spent, and there are brands around who can give them an alternative to the big banks.

'The rates tend to be fairly poor in comparison to the best buys, but they are often still much better than the biggest banks.'

On easy access savings accounts, the rates are mixed. Triodos offers up to 1 per cent while Ecology Building Society offers 0.85 per cent compared to 1.5 per cent from mainstream rival Virgin Money.

On a £10,000 deposit, going green would mean giving up at least £15 in interest.

Regardless, the rates are still a good way ahead of major banks such as NatWest and HSBC, which offer 0.2 per cent on their standard easy access accounts.

For fixed rate accounts, some ethical banks even top the tables. For a one-year fixed deal, for example, Gatehouse offers the highest rate at 2.15 per cent.

Ethical banks lend to firms which have a positive impact on the world, such as community projects or renewable energy, and hand out mortgages to people building sustainable homes.

Despite being lesser-known, these banks are still covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, which means that up to £85,000 of your savings is protected should they go bust.

Triodos Bank, based in Bristol, has seen its customer accounts numbers rise by 13 per cent in the past year from 52,200 to 58,800.

It also publishes which businesses it lends to, believing banks should be transparent about who they fund.

These include organic beauty firm Neal's Yard, magazine for the homeless The Big Issue and River Cottage, the brand of television chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall who campaigns for sustainable farming.

Triodos Bank is currently offering some customers £40 vouchers to spend at vegan and eco-friendly online shop the Ethical Superstore.

It also offers customers with current accounts biodegradable debit cards made from compacted plant leaves and corn.

Pioneer: The Co-operative Bank has had an 'ethical policy' since 1992. It does not lend to, or invest in, companies which do not fit with its values, such as the oil, coal or gas industry

But bear in mind that there is a £3 monthly fee and no financial rewards. The bank also refuses to give customers credit cards. The other major downside is that there are no UK branches and you can only deposit cheques.

Yoga teacher Sieske Valk now banks with Triodos because she wanted her finances to match with her ethical lifestyle.

The 31-year-old vegetarian, who lives in South East London, says: 'It seems strange to do everything else 'fair and green' if your banking still supports things like the weapons trade and tobacco.

'Switching bank is such an easy thing to do and can make a real difference.'

Reliance, the Salvation Army's bank, offers current accounts, with all profits going to support the Christian charity's work in everything from addiction to emergency response.

But, like Triodos, it won't be handing you a credit card as it would contravene the Salvation Army's ethics.

Huw Davies, head of retail banking at Triodos Bank UK, says: 'People are increasingly making sustainable choices with green energy suppliers and in their shopping.

'And more are realising that savings and investments also play a crucial role in addressing environmental and social issues. We believe in using money as a force for good.'

If you want an ethical current account which still gives you rewards, Co-op pays up to £5.50 a month if you fulfil a list of criteria, including depositing £800 a month, staying in credit and paperless statements.

But the bank's ethical reputation has taken a hit in recent years after it nearly collapsed in 2013 after suffering a £1.5 billion capital shortfall and its then-chairman Paul Flowers was caught in a drugs scandal.

It was taken over by U.S. hedge fund owners last year, who seized almost full control of the bank, raising question marks over whether it could retain its ethical stance.

Banks do not need to fulfil any criteria in order to call themselves ethical; there is no official accreditation.

The Co-operative Bank has had an 'ethical policy' since 1992. It does not lend to, or invest in, companies which do not fit with its values, such as the oil, coal or gas industry. Customers can vote on this.

"The detrimental environmental effects of fast fashion are well documented, but now MPs are claiming that the nation’s penchant for cheap, trend-driven clothing is taking a toll on charity shops, which are being inundated with low-quality items to the extent that they are turning down donations.

Shoppers are buying clothes for very low prices and looking to dispose of them after just a couple of wears so they can make room for new items, claims Labour MP Mary Creagh, chairwoman of the environmental audit committee.

This results in more clothes being sent to landfill sites, with 235 million garments going to waste in 2017 alone, evidence submitted to the committee reveals.

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.

“Charity shops can’t be the dumping ground for the high street’s dirty little secret – much of what they take back they can’t sell because of the quality and it’s very difficult to recycle the fibres,” Creagh told The Daily Telegraph.

“They are turning it away as they can’t sell it so fabric either goes to Europe or the developing world. It’s disrupting markets in other countries.”

A spokesperson from Oxfam added that their stores have seen a surge in donations in recent years. They think this may be due to the rise of fast fashion, which sees shops selling individual items of clothing for as little as £2.

Fashion bosses from leading luxury and high street retailers were asked to explain what they were doing to promote sustainability in a hearing in the House of Commons yesterday.

Executives from Primark, Topshop, Boohoo, Asos, Burberry and Marks and Spencer gathered to address some of the most pressing concerns and, according to Creagh, they have a long way to go if the UK is ever to achieve an eco-friendly fashion industry.

“Evidence we heard today justifies our concerns that the current system allows fashion retailers to mark their own homework when it comes to workers’ rights, fair pay and sustainability,” she said in a statement.

“Marks and Spencer are supposed to be a leading light in corporate responsibility, but even they pulled out of a scheme seeking to achieve living wages for garment workers through collective bargaining.”

The MP added that the committee was particularly unimpressed that Missguided CEO Nitin Passi refused to attend Parliament in person to answer questions about his supply chain."
"Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’ll know there’s a horrifying amount of plastic waste floating in the world’s oceans: around eight million metric tonnes of the stuff. And if things continue as they are, it’s predicted that by 2050 there will be more of it than fish in the sea.

Our single-use plastic addiction is declining thanks to plastic bag taxes and the rise of reusable coffee cups and water bottles, but it’s still a massive problem. And while recycling doesn’t solve everything, it’s certainly going to help – especially if plastic is fished out of the sea to be reused.

Jumping on this bandwagon are many clothing brands who are tapping into our new-found consciousness for the environment. Don’t be too cynical – many of these companies are surf brands who see the problem firsthand on our beaches, coastlines and in our oceans, and want to fight back to save the ecosystem they love.

The most common type of recycled plastic is PET bottles. To be reused, the bottles are sorted, cleaned and stripped of labels and caps, melted down into little pellets and then spun into yarn to make garments.

From swimwear and snow wear to jumpers and backpacks, here’s our tried and tested roundup of the companies who are making something useful out of all of our plastic waste, and saving it from landfill.

Batoko cockatoo swimsuit: £40, Batoko

Having already recycled the equivalent weight of 220,000 plastic bottles, Batoko uses collected ocean waste to make its gorgeous swimsuits, which come in just nine bold designs in a bid to also combat the perils of fast fashion. All of the British brand’s incredible prints use non-toxic inks and are created digitally, which saves water and energy and produces little waste. Of course, everything is packaged and delivered in compostable bags too, giving them extra brownie points. Our favourite is the cockatoo print that’s just made for holidays on tropical beaches. Each suit is lined, with a low scoop back and a medium cut leg. The brand has recently – after popular demand – brought back its children’s range too.

Lefrik multi wash bag: £17.50, Lefrik

This Spanish brand has been making bags out recycled PET bottles since 2012 and pride themselves on being functional, fashionable and eco-friendly. If you need them to tick any more boxes, they’re also vegan too (and Peta-approved). This waterproof washbag – great for travelling and any spillages that might occur while doing so – has four separate removable compartments, easily attached by poppers, which is great if you only want to use part of it. We also liked that it could be hung up with the top loop.

Brothers We Stand recycled sweatshirt: £35, Brothers We Stand

Proving that being ethical doesn’t put a stop to fashionable menswear is the store Brothers We Stand. As well as sourcing and selling other ethical and sustainable menswear brands on its website and in its Bristol outlet, including Elvis & Kresse and Jollie socks, it also has its own label.

Every product from Brothers We Stand has a transparent footprint and Soil Association accreditation. Using a blend of recycled cotton and PET bottles, the crewneck sweatshirts feature classic ribbed cuffs and a fleecy inner, which are created from waste cuttings that are shredded and turned back into reusable fibres. It’s an easily wearable jumper that quickly becomes a wardrobe staple.

Kanken Fjallraven backpack: £67.50, Surfdome

What started as a simple school bag in Sweden in 1978 designed to help school children carry lots of books has become a well-loved design around the world. It’s now sold in a huge array of colours and fabrics, and this special edition is made from 11 recycled plastic bottles. It is also dyed using “spindye”, which uses much less water than the traditional way of dying materials.

O’Neill hybrid mesh leggings, £59.99, O’Neill

O’Neill founder and Californian surfer, Jack O’Neill, is often credited as creating the wetsuit. And never shying away from innovation, O’Neill has had an eco-friendly activewear line since 2017, called Our Ocean Blue. All of these items are made using recycled bottles and have been created with the help of New York brand Bionic, who create the threads from plastic recovered from beaches. The first line of clothing in the range is estimated to have recovered 200,000 bottles from shorelines worldwide.

And staying true to the brand’s form, most of the items come in a range of amazing prints and colours, with matching leggings and sports bras. They’re stretchy, comfy and can be used for most activities from yoga to running, as well as casualwear if you’re not working out.

Picture Organic snow pants: £166, Surfdome

Set up by three snow and skate-mad school friends in France in 2008, Picture Organic has been sustainability focused from the start. All of its products – designed for skiing, skating, surfing and outdoors – are either made from recycled plastic, organic cotton or material scraps that would otherwise be burned, which are all responsibly sourced and free of harmful chemicals too.

These lightweight pants are pretty technical: we especially like the snow skirt, the leg vents and the fact they’re vegan. We also like the slim-fit design, but they do come up pretty snug, so think about going up a size. Available in five colours with matching jackets.

Riley Studio oversized hoody: £90, Riley Studio

Riley Studio uses a range of waste and recycled materials. This oversized hoody is made in Portugal from a mixture of recycled plastic bottles and cotton. This keeps materials from landfill and reduces the carbon footprint production of the item by 75 per cent. We love its baggy fit and super soft fleece feel on the inside, and that it’s a gender neutral hoody that’s also available in reversed colours.

Quiksilver highline boardshorts: £60, Quiksilver

As one of the original surf brands, hailing from Australia in 1969, Quiksilver are best known for their surfing essential board shorts – and these are the modern day version. Teaming up with Repreve and using recycled PET nylon, around nine bottles go into each pair of shorts. They have so far used more than 109 million bottles – and counting – since starting the line in January 2012.

Choose from 42 different designs and expect all the normal features such as the v-shaped waist, tie fastening and fast drying.

Patagonia down sweater jacket: £200, Patagonia

For the founder of Patagonia, Yvon Chouinard, the brand had always been about sustainability. And that’s why its classic down sweater jackets are made from 100 per cent recycled polyester. It’s also made with goose down for the best insulation, but Patagonia promises to use only traceable non-live plucked feathers. The brand has also remodelled its long-sleeve logo tee – renamed the responsibility-tee – each of which is now made from 4.8 plastic bottles.

Planks Good Times eco snow jacket: £199.99, Surfdome

Founded by ex-professional British skier Jim Adlington, everything by this brand is made for skiers, by skiers. This limited edition eco jacket is made entirely from recycled bottles, using recycled yarn from Repreve – the world’s leading recycled yarn manufacturer. Repreve has already recycled 10bn bottles and aims to double that by 2020.

The jacket has a waterproof rating of 15,000mm (high enough to withstand most snowfalls) and has fully taped seams to keep out water. However, it’s also breathable, and has pit zips, a helmet compatible hood, and a powder skirt with large front and side pockets. We love the relaxed fit too. It’s a durable, reliable jacket that will see you through season after season.

Verdict: Clothes made from recycled plastic

We love the Batoko swimsuit for many reasons: its amazing prints, great cut, use of plastic waste from the ocean and its limited range of designs to combat fast fashion. It’s comfy and you’ll get loads of compliments about it, too. We also really love the credentials of Picture Organic for its great designs and true dedication to sustainability from the outset.

"Dutch airline KLM has advised its passengers to fly less and take the train instead in an eye-catching effort to boost its environmental credentials.

In a campaign entitled 'Fly Responsibly', KLM asks its customers: 'Do you always have to meet face to face?' and 'Could you take the train instead?'.

The Dutch flag carrier has vowed to 'do business in a more sustainable way' amid growing pressure on airlines to limit their impact on the planet.

Politicians are also facing ever greater demands to take action to prevent climate disaster - prompting airlines into action in an effort to prove that they can fix the problem without new taxes and regulations.

Fly Responsibly: KLM has advised its passengers to seek alternatives to flying as airlines try to prove their environmental credentials and head off government regulations

Dutch flag carrier KLM has vowed to 'do business in a more sustainable way' amid growing pressure on airlines to limit their impact on the planet (a KLM plane is pictured in a file photo)

Advising passengers to 'explore other travel options', the airline said: 'In some cases, railway or other modes of transportation can be more sustainable than flying, especially for short distances such as within Europe.

'Do you know that flying from Amsterdam to Brussels takes longer than going by train?​

'KLM is a supporter of sustainable alternative models of transport for short distances instead of short-haul flights.

'Even the smallest actions can make a serious impact. Every choice you make matters, so consider them carefully.'

Backing the publicity drive, KLM chief executive Pieter Elbers said: 'When we started 100 years ago, our major concern was your safety. Little did we know about the impact we would have on the environment.

'Today we know aviation comes with another big responsibility - to make sure our children have a planet to explore, as well.

'We invite the aviation industry to join us in making the world aware of our shared responsibility. And, we invite all air travellers to make responsible decisions about flying.'

The airline said it was working on sustainable fuel production, using cooking oil and industry waste, in order to reduce its carbon footprint.

The Dutch airline is asking passengers whether they could take the train instead of flying - pointing out quicker journey times between some cities

Airline bosses also asked customers if they could avoid unnecessary flights if they do not need to meet people face to face

It also invites passengers to make a donation called CO2ZERO in order to pay for the environmental impact of their flight.

KLM says the money is used towards planting tropical forests which 'also promote the local workforce'.

German airline Lufthansa has a similar voluntary contribution scheme.

Airlines are expected to produce some 930million tons of carbon dioxide this year, more than an industrial country such as Germany.

This week, France unveiled a new charge on plane tickets, promising to use the revenue to fund environment-friendly alternatives.

The 'ecotax' costing up to €18 will apply to most flights departing in France, the country's transport minister said on Tuesday.

The only exceptions will be for domestic flights to Corsica and France's overseas territories, and connecting flights that pass through France.

Industry group IATA called the new taxes 'misguided', saying: 'National taxes will do nothing to assist the aviation industry in its sustainability efforts.'

The industry argues that flying only makes up a small share of greenhouse gas emissions and that planes are becoming ever more efficient."
"COMMENT:

We all know that plastics in our oceans are a danger not only to marine life but also to our food supply. Banning single-use plastic bags from our supermarkets and microbeads from our body wash has got New Zealand started in addressing some of the problems, but for a bigger impact, it might pay to read the label on your clothing.

Polyester, Lycra, and nylon are all cheap and versatile materials that give you the comfortable, breathable stretch in your activewear and the warm, long-lasting durability in your outerwear. These materials are also synthetic or man-made fibres created from plastic and making up about 60 per cent of all clothing globally.

With the rise of fast fashion, where high-street brands produce cheap, low-quality clothing to meet consumer demands for on-trend clothing, the amount of clothing dumped into landfills each year is steadily rising.

This over-consumption of clothing, however, is only one part of the challenge when it comes to what we wear. Scientists are now looking into the contribution that synthetic fabric clothing could be making to ocean plastic pollution from a simple act that most of us do every week.

Throwing your clothes into the washing machine is part of the process of owning and maintaining them. The machine along with water and detergent cleans your clothes through a process of agitation in the drum.

This agitation not only gets the dirt out of your clothing but, according to a study published in the journal Environmental Science and Technology, also breaks off small pieces of loose fibre from your clothing.

These tiny fibres, known as microfibres are so small that they easily pass through the filtration system in the washing machine as well as the sewage filters in the waste water facility and can end up flowing out through our waterways as microplastics.

The researchers set up a series of experiments where they washed new and old clothing that was made from either polyester fleece or nylon shell material. Alarmingly, they found that on average one synthetic fleece jacket released 1.7g of plastic microfibres with each wash.

They also found that older clothing shed almost twice as much than new jackets. When they compared types of washing machines they found that the mass of microfibre produced from top-load washing machines was approximately seven times more than was produced by a front-loading machine.

Microfibres are typically less than 5mm in length with a diameter of a few micrometres - thinner than a human hair. They are easily consumed by fish and other wildlife, where they accumulate in the stomach of the animal.

The shape of the fibres creates another problem too – specifically their high surface area to volume ratio. The surface of plastic is charged in a way that means it strongly attracts and absorbs chemicals known as ""persistent organic pollutants"" or POPs, which include polychlorinated biphenyls and dioxins.

POPs have been found in the human body and are linked to adverse reproductive, developmental, behavioural, neurological and immunologic health effects. In the ocean these absorbed POPs can accumulate with the plastics in the animals, leading to high concentrations in their tissues, which further magnify as they move up through the food chain.

So, if you don't want to inadvertently eat plastic from your clothing, natural fibres like cotton and wool are more friendly as they biodegrade more easily. However, if you still love your fleece – and the planet - you might want to consider wearing it one more time before throwing it in for a wash."
"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump's surprise threat to impose escalating tariffs on Mexican imports jolted industry leaders throughout the U.S. economy Friday, sparked opposition even from usual Trump allies and set the stage for American consumers to face higher prices.

It also sent stock markets tumbling, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing down roughly 355 points, or 1.4%. Investors poured money instead into the safety of bonds, sending yields lower and signaling that they fear the economy will slow in the coming months.

Trump vowed Thursday to slap a 5% tariff on all Mexican imports on June 10, just over a week away, and raise those tariffs to 25% by October, unless Mexico stops the flow of Central American migrants into the U.S.

If the tariffs were to take effect, they could eventually raise prices for a new Chevrolet Blazer SUV, a burrito at Chipotle, a new shirt or a Corona beer. A 5% duty on the $346.5 billion of goods imported from Mexico translates into $17 billion in tariffs. Some of that higher cost might be paid, at least initially, by U.S. companies. But a significant portion would likely be passed on to U.S. shoppers.

The impact of Trump's latest tariffs, should they be imposed, will fall first on U.S. companies. Businesses in many industries have set up tightly linked supply chains with Mexico. Billions of dollars of auto parts, for example, are sent back and forth across the U.S.-Mexico border, in some cases several times, as components are added and integrated into finished cars. Similar networks exist in other industries, from clothing to electronics. The import taxes could quickly translate into much higher costs.

""That's what's so concerning about these tariffs,"" said John Mitchell, president of IPC, a trade group representing the electronics industry. ""It undercuts the region's ability to leverage each other's strengths to benefit North American manufacturing.""

Peter Navarro, a top trade adviser to the Trump White House, insisted in an interview on CNBC that the Mexican government and businesses would pay the tariffs. But about 40% of imports from Mexico are from U.S.-affiliated companies, meaning there is no Mexican company that would pay. Instead the tariffs will simply raise costs for U.S. companies — and ultimately for consumers — particularly for parts that cross the border several times, Mitchell said.

The U.S. economy has been integrating with Mexico's since the implementation of NAFTA in 1994. All U.S.-made cars now include at least some parts from overseas, and 37% of those parts are from Mexico.

""Any barrier to the flow of commerce across the U.S.-Mexico border will have a cascading effect — harming U.S. consumers, threatening American jobs and investment, curtailing the economic progress that the administration is working to re-ignite,"" said David Schwietert, interim president of the Auto Alliance trade group, which represents U.S. automakers and foreign companies that build cars in the United States, such as BMW and Toyota.

Shares of General Motors Co., which imports more vehicles into the U.S. than any other automaker, tumbled 4.25% Friday.

""For GM, we roughly estimate that a 5% tariff could be a several-hundred-million dollar annual earnings hit,"" said Itay Michaeli of Citi Investment Research.

The new tariffs came as a surprise for many companies because the Trump administration had just renewed its push to win congressional approval for the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, its update to NAFTA.

Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, a usual Trump ally and the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, condemned the president's action as ""a misuse of presidential tariff authority"" that would burden American consumers and ""seriously jeopardize passage of USMCA.""

Some industry representatives said the duties would not encourage companies to return production to the U.S., as Trump has said he wants, but actually have the opposite effect: It will discourage them from relocating to the U.S. because they'd have to pay more for imported parts.

""If you can't buy your components here, you're not going to think about coming back here,"" Mitchell said.

Americans may also see higher prices in grocery stores. The U.S. imports $12 billion of fresh fruits and vegetables from Mexico, including tomatoes, avocados, peppers and lemons.

""This is a tax on healthy diets, plain and simple,"" said Lance Jungmeyer, president of the Fresh Produce Association of the Americas.

Jungmeyer noted that food imports from Mexico haven't been subject to tariffs for decades, and importers would have to file paperwork with Customs to pay duties. That can 10 days or more to process, potentially leaving many companies unable to import for a time after June 10.

""I've got to educate a whole range of people who haven't paid tariffs on Mexican produce since 1995,"" Jungmeyer said.

Many U.S. restaurant chains buy tomatoes and other fresh produce from Mexico. Laurie Schalow, an executive for Chipotle Mexican Grill, said the chain has sought to diversify its supplier base and now buys some avocados from Chile and Peru and is less dependent on Mexico. Still, the tariffs would hurt the company, Schalow said.

Trump has already imposed 25% tariffs on $250 billion of goods from China. The additional duties on Mexican imports could weaken the U.S. economy. Growth was already forecast to slip to a roughly 1.5% annual pace in the April-June quarter, down from 3.1% in the first three months of the year.

Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, estimates that if the full 25% duties on Mexican goods were put in place, U.S. growth next year would be cut by 0.7 percentage point.

The U.S. imports $2.4 billion of clothing and textiles from Mexico. Stephen Lamar, executive vice president of American Apparel and Footwear Association, said companies are already thinking about how to cut costs but will likely have to raise prices because their profit margins are so thin.

Mexico is the eighth-largest supplier of clothing and seventh-largest supplier of footwear to the U.S. market. It's the largest supplier of men's and boy's jeans, accounting for 35% of imports, according to the AAFA.

Shares of Kontoor Brands, which includes Wrangler and Lee, fell nearly 8%, while shares of Levi Strauss dropped 7%. Both companies obtain some of their denim from Mexico.

About 70% of imported beer is from Mexico, up from less than 20% in 1990, according to the National Beer Wholesalers Association. Shares of Constellation Brands, which makes Corona and Modelo beers, among others, fell nearly 6% Friday.

Jeremy Seaver, owner of Tios Mexican Cafe in Ann Arbor, Michigan, said the tariffs would hurt his business. He uses avocados from Mexico, serves Mexican tequila, beer and soda and sells Mexican hot sauces. Even his restaurant's decorations are all from Mexico, he said.

""I'm very concerned,"" he said. ""Five percent (tariff) doesn't sound like a lot, but to a small business like mine, that's a lot."""
"SINGAPORE - Fashion giant H&M will soon start charging customers in Singapore 10 cents for each plastic or paper bag as part of a new initiative to reduce waste.

The move, which takes effect at all H&M stores from next Thursday (July 25), is part of a packaging strategy to reduce plastic use in the long run, said the Swedish retailer in a press release on Monday (July 15).

All proceeds collected from the shopping bag charge will be donated to WWF Singapore's Plastic ACTion (PACT) initiative, which is an industry-wide initiative to reduce plastic use by 2030.

Under PACT, proceeds from H&M's shopping bag charge will go towards innovations to find sustainable alternative materials, research into plastic pollution and conservation projects.

Shoppers who patronise the fashion giant have welcomed the move against plastic use.

Graphic designer Audrey Ng, 25, who shops at H&M every other month, said she does not mind paying for a bag.

""If I really needed a bag, then why not pay for it? It's 10 cents, which is not expensive and the money also goes to a good cause.""

Ms Ng added that the charge would also cause shoppers to determine if they really needed a bag before accepting one.

Civil servant Ginny Goh, 44, said that while she does not think plastic bags should be banned entirely, charging for them is the right move.

""I think all single-use bags should be chargeable. We need to drastically cut down on their use and the only way is to charge. This way, people will only take what they need.""

Ms Goh's two teenage daughters also shop at H&M and she regularly encourages them to bring their own bags.

""I don't think it's a big deal to charge for bags. People will get used to it. In many other countries, bags are already chargeable everywhere, in the shops and in the supermarkets.""

H&M has already rolled out charges for shopping bags in other countries including Sweden, Malaysia, the United Kingdom, Japan and Switzerland.

H&M is not the first company in Singapore to charge for shopping bags.

In October last year, the Cotton On Group embarked on a similar programme to phase out plastic shopping bags from all its stores worldwide, including in Singapore. The fashion chain now provides shoppers with recyclable paper bags which cost 10 cents each.

Cosmetics and skincare company The Body Shop stopped providing plastic bags in January 2018, and it also charges 10 cents for each recyclable paper bag.

Lifestyle brand Miniso and clothing chain Bossini have also been charging 10 cents for a bag since 2017 and 2012 respectively.

Swedish furniture giant Ikea started charging for plastic bags in 2007 before phasing them out in 2013. Today, shoppers must bring their own bags or buy a reusable polypropylene bag at 90 cents each.

Asked about customer reaction to the zero plastic bag policy, the head of sustainability for Ikea South-east Asia, Ms Soh Bee Lian, said there was almost no negative reaction.

""We believe that Singaporeans want to do what they can for the environment,"" she said.

Speaking about H&M's initiative, the company's country manager for South-east Asia, Mr Fredrik Famm, said: ""To create a more sustainable fashion future, we need to take the lead by tackling some of the most significant challenges that are facing our planet and society.""

WWF Singapore chief executive officer Maureen DeRooij said that H&M's move comes at a crucial time when bold action is needed to change how plastics are produced, used and disposed off.

""A bag charge, proven to be effective in reducing plastic use, is a crucial step that retail businesses can take to stop plastic pollution,"" she said."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walmart Inc (WMT.N) on Tuesday said it will acquire Eloquii, a fashion startup that sells plus-sized clothing, for an undisclosed amount as it continues to look for ways to appeal to younger shoppers and differentiate from rival Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O).

Eloquii, a four-year-old startup, sells apparel starting at size 14 through its own website and through five of its own stores. Walmart, the world’s largest brick-and-mortar retailer, said Eloquii has seen its revenue grow by three times since 2015, without giving more details.

Plus-size apparel is part of a $21 billion market and represents one of the fastest growing segments in women’s apparel, Walmart said in a statement. More than half of women between the ages of 18 to 65 in the United States wear size 14 or higher, the retailer said.

“These customers have been historically underserved, with clothing limited by its lack of fashion, lack of fit, or both,” Walmart said.

The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer has previously acquired smaller digital brands like Modcloth and Bonobos to complement its online assortment.

Eloquii CEO Mariah Chase, the startup’s management team and 100 employees will continue to be based in Long Island City, New York, and Columbus, Ohio. They will join Walmart’s U.S. e-commerce team, reporting to Andy Dunn, senior vice-president of digital consumer brands at Walmart U.S. eCommerce.

“We are laser focused on developing a portfolio of direct to consumer brands with a unique assortment you can’t find anywhere else,” Dunn said in a separate blog post on Tuesday.

The Eloquii brand was first created by retail chain The Limited in 2011 but was discontinued a little over a year later. A team of employees with help from an outside investor bought the brand and relaunched it in 2014.

Walmart said the deal is expected to close this quarter."
