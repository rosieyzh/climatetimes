      "Miami (AFP) – As glaciers melt due to climate change, the increasingly hot and parched Earth is absorbing some of that water inland, slowing sea level rise, NASA experts said Thursday.[Satellite measurements over the past decade show for the first time that the Earth’s continents have soaked up and stored an extra 3.2 trillion tons of water in soils, lakes and underground aquifers, the experts said in a study in the journal Science. advertisement, This has temporarily slowed the rate of sea level rise by about 20 percent, it said. “We always assumed that people’s increased reliance on groundwater for irrigation and consumption was resulting in a net transfer of water from the land to the ocean,” said lead author J.T. Reager of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. “What we didn’t realize until now is that over the past decade, changes in the global water cycle more than offset the losses that occurred from groundwater pumping, causing the land to act like a sponge — at least temporarily.”, The global water cycle involves the flow of moisture, from the evaporation over the oceans to the fall of precipitation, to runoff and rivers that lead back into the ocean. Just how much effect on sea level rise this kind of land storage would have has remained unknown until now because there are no land-based instruments that can measure such changes planet-wide. The latest data came from a pair of NASA satellites launched in 2002 — known as the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE). Researchers learned that the “water gains over land were spread globally, but taken together they equal the volume of Lake Huron, the world’s seventh largest lake,” said a NASA statement. Researchers said the findings will help scientists better calculate sea level changes in the years ahead. “These results will lead to a refinement of global sea level budgets, such as those presented in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports, which acknowledge the importance of climate-driven changes in hydrology, but have been unable to include any reliable estimate of their contribution to sea level changes,” said senior author Jay Famiglietti, a professor at the University of California, Irvine. “But we’ll need a much longer data record to fully understand the underlying cause of the patterns and whether they will persist.”\n",

The only other one to have come close to this position was former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott – but he just didn’t have the support base to maintain it and was ousted in a coup staged by one of the climate alarmist establishment, Malcolm Turnbull. But with a climate skeptic running the most powerful nation in the world, the $1.5 trillion per annum climate change industry is going to start to unravel big time. A Trump presidency is likely to be good news for fossil fuels (and heavy industry that needs cheap energy to survive) and very bad news for renewables. To get an idea of the horrors to come for the greenies, look at how they reacted to the prospect of his new Environmental Protection Agency Dismantler-in-Chief Myron Ebell. Ebell is an old friend of mine who works on climate and energy issues at the Competitive Enterprise Institute. The fact that he’s an old friend of mine probably tells you all you need to know about where he stands on global warming. Here’s how Newsweek views him:, Ebell is sometimes described as climate denier-in-chief, and he revels in it, crowing in his biography that he’s been called one of the leading “misleaders” on climate change and “villain of the month” by one environmental group. David Goldston, a policy analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund, says Ebell “doesn’t believe in climate change and wants to reverse the advances we’ve had in environmental protection and decimate—if not utterly destroy—the Environmental Protection Agency.” The Competitive Enterprise Institute, Ebell’s employer, “has done everything it can politically and through litigation to block any forward movement on climate and to try to harass anybody who is trying to get forward movement,” Goldston says. Ebell is also the chairman of the Cooler Heads Coalition, more than two dozen nonprofit groups “that question global warming alarmism and oppose energy rationing policies,” according to the coalition’s website. Those positions line up nicely with Trump’s goals, which include “saving” the coal industry, reviving the Keystone XL oil pipeline and expanding offshore oil drilling. Ebell has attacked nearly every aspect of Obama’s environmental policies and accomplishments. He has said that the president’s decision in September to sign the Paris climate accord—which commits nations to sharp reductions in the greenhouse gas emissions responsible for climate change—was “clearly an unconstitutional usurpation of the Senate’s authority” because treaties need approval by two-thirds of the Senate. (The White House argued that it was an agreement, not a treaty.) In a speech in August at the Detroit Economic Club, Trump said he would cancel the agreement and stop all payments of U.S. tax dollars to U.N. climate change programs. Yup, greenies. That climate change gravy train you’ve been riding these last four decades looks like it’s headed for a major, Atlas-Shrugged-style tunnel incident…\n",
      "The unchecked use of fossil fuels will produce a climate not seen since the Triassic period about 200 million years ago, researchers warn in a new report.[The culprit for this unprecedented warming is atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), suggest researchers led by the University of Southampton in the UK, which by the year 2250 could reach levels equivalent to those of the “age of reptiles,” when dinosaurs roamed the earth. advertisement, In their research, the researchers admit that CO2 levels are “much lower now” than they have been at other, hotter points in the earth’s history, yet they warn that levels are rising rapidly. During hotter periods in the planet’s history, the concentration of CO2 has climbed as high as 3,000 parts per million (ppm), whereas in 2016, the concentration was only 400 ppm. If fossil fuel use continues unabated, the researchers predict, the concentration of carbon dioxide will reach 2,000 ppm by about 2250. By the year 2400, the earth could reach temperatures not seen for more than 400 million years, they said. “So not only will the resultant climate change be faster than anything the Earth has seen for millions of years, the climate that will exist is likely to have no natural counterpart, as far as we can tell, in at least the last 420 million years,” said geochemist Gavin Foster from the University of Southampton in the UK. “We found no past time period when the drivers of climate, or climate forcing, was as high as it will be in the future if we burn all the readily available fossil fuel,” Foster said. At the same time, Foster recognized that scientists have no way of measuring CO2 concentrations from millions of years ago but must “rely on indirect ‘proxies’ in the rock record.”, Climate proxies have come under heavy fire from a number of scientists, however, who consider them to be beyond inaccurate. The “primitive modeling” involved with the use of climate proxies is “inaccurate and unreliable well beyond what is required for the conclusions drawn,” said Dr. Duane Thresher, a climate scientist with a PhD from Columbia University and NASA GISS. Climate proxies are very sparse, Thresher has noted, and a single measurement often has to represent thousands of square miles or more. “A single temperature for the Earth averaged from these measurements is meaningless and absurd,” he stated. But the use of unreliable proxies is not the only issue of contention among climate scientists. A deeper problem is the function and consequences of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the way that the earth reacts to it. Last fall, a group of scientists were amazed to discover that the world’s plants have somehow increased their capacity to assimilate carbon, resulting in an actual decline in the percentage of human-produced CO2 remaining in the atmosphere. Researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found that despite the increased human emissions of greenhouse gases, between 2002 and 2014, plants were somehow able to absorb more carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere than in previous decades. In their study published in Nature Communications, the researchers noted that “terrestrial ecosystems play a significant role in the global carbon cycle and offset a large fraction of anthropogenic CO2 emissions.”, Moreover, some scientists vehemently disagree with treating carbon dioxide as a pollutant at all, suggesting that it is a necessary and beneficial component of the atmosphere. Dr. William Happer, professor emeritus of physics at Princeton University and a member of the National Academy of Sciences, has insisted that fearmongering regarding global warming creates needless hysteria. “We’ve heard that CO2 is a demon molecule that causes global warming,” Happer said, whereas in reality more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere produces increased crop yields and a greener planet. According to Happer, an increase in carbon dioxide would only benefit both plant life and human life. “We should tell the truth: CO2 will benefit the Earth,” he said. Follow Thomas D.

      "With Al Gore by her side, Hillary Clinton channeled climate change alarmism into her speech in Florida, by blaming Hurricane Matthew on global warming.[“Hurricane Matthew was likely more destructive because of climate change right now,” she said, citing “record high” ocean temperatures. advertisement, She insisted that climate change “contributed” to the torrential rainfall and the flash flooding in North and South Carolina. “Sea levels have risen one foot in much of the Southeast which means Matthew’s storm surge was higher and the flooding more severe,” she said ominously. It didn’t stop there. Clinton and Gore teamed up to warn that most of the destructive natural disasters in the past decade were a result of climate change. Global warming, Gore said, was creating the energy that was “equivalent to what would be released by 400,000 Hiroshima class atomic bombs going off every day.”, Zika and Lyme disease were more threatening because summers lasted longer, they argued, allowing ticks and mosquitoes to live longer. “Every single night on the television news is like a major hike through the Book of Revelation,” Gore said. “You look at the floods and the droughts and the mudslides and the fires and the incredible downpours…”, Longer summers made it worse for children who suffered from allergies and asthma, Clinton said, and also caused more wildfires. Gore urged Floridians to vote for Hillary Clinton, because she would take climate change seriously. “Mother Nature is giving us a very clear and powerful message,” he said. “We cannot continue putting 110 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere every day as if it’s an open sewer.

      "In the latest in radical climate doomsaying, a new report warns that fossil fuel consumption will need to be reduced “below a quarter of primary energy supply by 2100” to avoid possibly disastrous effects on global temperatures.[In their report, titled “Pathways for balancing CO2 emissions and sinks,” a team of eight scientists warns that “anthropogenic emissions need to peak within the next 10 years, to maintain realistic pathways to meeting the COP21 emissions and warming targets.”, advertisement, The statement was immediately repackaged by environmentalists to read: “Scientists say we have ten years to save the earth.”, As is always the case in studies of this sort, the scientists juggle dozens of variables, none of which is entirely predictable and which taken together tell us virtually nothing about the future of the environment. Although the scientists admit that “there are significant uncertainties associated with projecting energy consumption several decades into the future,” they fail to acknowledge a number of even greater uncertainties implicit in their calculations. Despite their valiant efforts to produce trustworthy projections, the scientists rely on basic presumptions that are contested by extremely capable minds within their own field. Dr. Duane Thresher, a climate scientist with a Ph.D. from Columbia University and NASA GISS, has stated bluntly that it is “mathematically impossible for climate models to predict climate.”, Appealing to corollaries of the well-known “Butterfly Effect,” Thresher said that long-term climate forecasting is “a quintessential example of this phenomenon” because of the elevated number of variables playing into climate phenomena. “Climate models are just more complex/chaotic weather models,” Thresher has noted, “which have a theoretical maximum predictive ability of just 10 days into the future.”, “Predicting climate decades or even just years into the future is a lie, albeit a useful one for publication and funding,” he said. Undaunted, the team of scientists has declared that achieving global, net decarbonization of human activities “would halt and even reverse anthropogenic climate change through the net removal of carbon from the atmosphere.”, Among the many unproven assumptions behind this assertion is the implied claim that human-induced climate change (itself a contested concept) is a function solely of carbon emissions, such that “net decarbonization” would halt or reverse it. Here the scientists state as fact what is by all accounts very much an unproven hypothesis. In recent studies, plants have been found to adapt to a greater carbon concentration in the atmosphere, unexpectedly accelerating their ability to assimilate carbon, something unaccounted for in the new report. Moreover, there is still significant debate within the scientific community regarding the precise relationship between carbon presence in the atmosphere, global temperatures and the health of the planet. While this study takes for granted that carbon dioxide is an evil that must be severely restricted, other eminent scholars have suggested that the contrary is true. One such scientist, Dr. William Happer, professor emeritus of physics at Princeton University and a member of the National Academy of Sciences, has insisted that the earth can handle substantially more carbon dioxide than is currently found in the atmosphere and would actually benefit from a higher concentration. “We’ve heard that CO2 is a demon molecule that causes global warming,” Happer has stated, whereas in reality more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere produces increased crop yields and a greener planet. According to Happer, an increase in carbon dioxide would only benefit both plant life and human life. Similarly, Dr. Indur Goklany, who has previously represented the United States on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), has asserted that the rising level of carbon dioxide in the earth’s atmosphere “is currently net beneficial for both humanity and the biosphere generally”. The benefits are real, whereas the costs of warming are uncertain,” he said in a 2015 paper titled “Carbon Dioxide: The Good News.”, Follow Thomas D. Williams on Twitter  Follow @tdwilliamsrome\n",

Gore insisted that it is a moral imperative to fight against climate change. “Regarding the climate movement,” Gore said warming to his point, “there are people who say, ‘God is in complete control of everything that happens, and if the Earth is getting warmer, then maybe God intends that.'”, Gore then rejected that conceit. “Well, no,” the million-dollar mansion-owing former veep insisted. “God intends for us to take responsibility for how we treat God’s creation, and if we choose to use the thin shell of atmosphere surrounding our planet as an open sewer for 110-million tons of global-warming pollution every day, the consequences are attributable to us.”, He concluded saying, “And if you are a believer, as I am, I think God intends for us to open our eyes and take responsibility for the moral consequences of our actions.”, Gore’s new film is a sequel to his famed “An Inconvenient Truth,” a shockumentary filled with mistaken assertions and failed predictions. Despite the many inaccuracies of his previous film, in an interview last year Gore still insisted that he “underestimated” how bad global warming is. “I wish the film had over-estimated the seriousness of the crisis, but unfortunately it actually underestimated how serious it is,” the one-time Tennessee Senator said.

That he doesn’t care about their pain?” Weaver challenged. “This is a moment when we as a nation have to decide whether we will ignore the facts and allow people to continue to suffer, or whether we will come together to do what’s right.”, Weaver concluded her brief speech by endorsing Clinton as the best possible candidate to tackle climate change issues. “Hillary Clinton she gets it,” the actress said. “She cares. She is committed. She understands that taking a stand against climate change — it’s not about politics. It is about our moral obligation to one another and to our children, and to the generations that will one day inherit this beautiful earth.”, It appeared Weaver had a bit more to say, but the actress was cut off by the start of Avatar director James Cameron’s pro-Clinton climate change warning video.  , Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum\n",

It’s not just the people around Trump who reject the science of climate change. The leadership of the Republican Party — from House Speaker Paul Ryan to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, to the chairs of the key science and technology committees in Congress, to the Republicans’ favorite think tanks — all share the fossil fuel industry’s preference that the U.S. government does nothing to address the most serious planetary crisis humanity has ever faced. The Republicans’ cravenness on climate change is clear. After claiming for years that the science was “inconclusive” (or a “hoax”), they held the public position that they opposed any concerted action to reduce greenhouse gases because China and India would never go along. Then, in 2015, when China and India signed on to the Paris Climate accords, Mitch McConnell and the Republican leaders began telling foreign governments that the Republicans would fight against any international deal on climate change in any case. Palermo has a history of radical statements. Writing in the LA Progressive, Palermo claimed that the 2016 Presidential election “felt at times like the prolonged public lynching of the nation’s first black president.”\n",

      "WASHINGTON, April 15 (UPI) — Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin slammed Bill Nye’s view on climate change, saying he does not have the scientific chops to say climate-change skeptics are wrong.[Palin, speaking Thursday after the opening screening of the anti-climate change documentary, Climate Hustle, said the popular children’s show host was nothing more than an actor and had no authority to speak about climate change. advertisement, Palin, the 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate, said Nye “is using his position of authority to harm children by teaching them that climate change is real and man-made.” Nye frequently speaks about the negative effects of climate change, both on camera and during in-person appearances. “Bill Nye is as much a scientist as I am,” Palin told the gathering. “He’s a kids’ show actor. He’s not a scientist.”, Before he was “The Science Guy,” Nye studied mechanical engineering at Cornell University and worked as a Boeing engineer. His show, Bill Nye The Science Guy, aired from 1993 to 1998 and is still popular with children. He has worked with NASA on projects that include creating a sun dial for the Mars exploration rover project, among other things. He has also written several children’s books with a focus on science. The film Climate Hustle, created by the conservative think tank Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow, seeks “to debunk the myths and hype about man-made global warming in an informative and entertaining style,” the organization said. In a video clip of a conversation between Nye and producer Marc Morano shown after the film debuted Thursday night, Nye advocated for investigating companies and corporate leaders who have a reputation for doubting climate change. “The introduction of this extreme doubt … about climate change is affecting my quality of life as a public citizen,” he said. “So I can see where people are very concerned about this and are pursuing criminal investigations as well engaging in discussions like this … they’re keeping us from getting to work, they’re holding us back.”, Palin responded to the clip by warning the audience to be wary of climate-change discussions because of a hidden political agenda among scientists. “They have studied the data that they are erroneously delivering to the public to make us think that we can somehow change the weather.” she said. “How they do that is to grow government and allow the government to have more control over us, our homes, our businesses, our families, our lives, and it’s quite unfortunate because these people must be purposely doing this, right? Because they are smart enough to know better.”\n",
      "Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged voters to look at their personal habits in order to stop climate change, calling it one of the world’s biggest problems that the next president would have to face.[“On an individual level, you know there are a lot of things that if more people did it, you would see results,” she said. advertisement, Clinton shared her thoughts on global warming during a town hall with YouTube creators in Los Angeles, California. During the conversation, Clinton took a question from a person named “Swoozie” who said he felt “helpless” when driving by industrial sites and watching towers of smoke float into the sky. “I feel like these guys are just doing this stuff, just polluting our world and here in L.A. I just recently moved and the pollution here and the smog is ridiculous,” he said. After praising Obama for implementing more regulations on power plants and pursuing an international agreement to reduce emissions Clinton asked everyone to look at their personal energy consumption habits. “Be careful about your own energy use, pay attention to your energy use, pay attention to how much you’re driving, if you have an electric car, more power to you,” she said. “Do what you can to reduce your own carbon load. It’s hard, you know, I don’t know, most people are doing something but maybe not enough, and I include myself in that.”, Clinton expressed her own frustration with Republicans who opposed oppressive regulations on the economy and argued with the scientists who warned of global catastrophes as a result of climate change. She said sometimes Republicans made her want to “yell” every time they replied to an answer on climate change by informing voters that they weren’t scientists. “Go talk to a scientist!” she said. “I really am tired of the debate, which is a phony debate.

As Breitbart News noted in October:, Scientists are rebuking California Gov. Jerry Brown over his attempt to link recent California wildfires to climate change. (Even more remarkably, the Los Angeles Times is reporting it.), As Breitbart News reported in August, Brown blamed climate change for the Rocky fire in August, and specifically challenged Republican presidential candidates to tackle climate change in the context of “Longer fire seasons, extreme weather and severe droughts.” …, However, scientists say Brown is wrong and that the scientific evidence does not link recent fires to climate change. Scientists accused Brown of engaging in “noble-cause corruption” of climate science. While fires could become more likely in the future, the link in the present has not been established. False statements like the president’s could, they warn, lead to inappropriate policies. The president’s statement was only the latest example of climate change hysteria from the president. Earlier this month, he warned that Manhattan would be “underwater” unless action was taken soon on climate change. (Scientists say that some portions of Manhattan could experience flooding, but not the entire island, even under the most catastrophic models.), Obama also touted his administration’s record in expanding public lands and taking regulatory actions, including enforcing the Endangered Species Act (which many Californians blame for overzealous protection of the Delta smelt at the expense of water allocations to farmers). He said that every child should have the chance to visit a national park, citing his own childhood visit to Yellowstone. Obama’s trip to Yosemite –the first by a sitting president since John F. Kennedy in 1962 — thrilled some visitors, but frustrated others: the White House asked tourists to avoid entering the park between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. during his Saturday hike and speech. Joel B.

      "After years of imposed “scientific consensus” on global warming, a number of skeptical climate scientists are hopeful that their views may finally get a hearing under the new administration.[Georgia Tech scientist Judith Curry, for instance, labelled a “climate heretic” by Scientific American for her contrarian views, sees a light at the end of the long Obama tunnel. advertisement, “Here’s to hoping the Age of Trump will herald the demise of climate change dogma, and acceptance of a broader range of perspectives in climate science and our policy options,” she wrote last month on her popular blog Climate Etc. Part of the problem is that no one really knows how many climate change skeptics there are among scientists because of the high personal and professional cost of heterodoxy. Dilbert creator Scott Adams has compared climate change skeptics within the scientific community to “Shy Trump Supporters” who are too afraid to say what they really think for fear of being ridiculed or worse. As we can plainly see, he wrote, “the cost of disagreeing with climate science is unreasonably high if you are a scientist.”, William Happer, professor emeritus of physics at Princeton University and a member of the National Academy of Sciences, played his cards close to the vest for years in order survive in a hostile scientific climate. “I held my tongue for a long time because friends told me I would not be elected to the National Academy of Sciences if I didn’t toe the alarmists’ company line,” he said. As the political climate changes, however, climate change skeptics may find their voice and enter a debate that has hitherto been closed off to them. Happer, for instance, is more optimistic of what the future holds. “I think we’re making progress,” he said. “I see reassuring signs.”, Dr. Duane Thresher, a climate scientist with a PhD from Columbia University and NASA GISS, has pointed to “publication and funding bias” as a key to understanding how scientific consensus can be manipulated. Although scientists are held up as models of independent thinkers and unbiased seekers of truth, the reality is that they depend on funding even more than other professions, since much of their research has no market value. Thus, they will study what they are funded to study. The Obama administration, which doggedly denied that a climate debate even existed, funneled billions of federal dollars into programs and studies that supported its claims, while silencing contrary opinions. “In reality, it’s the government, not the scientists, that asks the questions,” said David Wojick, an expert on climate research spending and a longtime government consultant. Federal agencies order up studies that focus on their concerns, so politics ends up guiding science according to its particular interests. “Government actions have corrupted science, which has been flooded by money to produce politically correct results,” said Happer. “It is time for governments to finally admit the truth about global warming. Warming is not the problem. Government action is the problem.”, Thresher, who has done pioneering work in both tree ring climate proxy modeling and ocean climate proxy modeling, says that scientists know far less about historical climate than people are led to believe. Scientists us climate “proxies” like tree rings and ice cores, Thresher says, as substitutes for real climate measurements. The inferences reached are “inaccurate and unreliable well beyond what is required for the conclusions drawn,” he states. When it comes to forecasting future climate trends, however, the situation is even worse, Thresher contends. “Climate models are just more complex/chaotic weather models, which have a theoretical maximum predictive ability of just 10 days into the future,” he notes. “Predicting climate decades or even just years into the future is a lie, albeit a useful one for publication and funding.”, President-elect Donald Trump’s choices for key cabinet posts have exhilarated climate scientists tired of being black-balled as “climate change deniers” just because they raise uncomfortable questions. Tapping former Texas Gov. Rick Perry to run the Energy Department, Attorney General Scott Pruitt of Oklahoma to run the Environmental Protection Agency, and Exxon chief executive Rex Tillerson as secretary of state signals a radical change from Obama’s conforming climate alarmists.

We have received information about it and have referred it to the FBI to consider whether or not it meets the criteria for which we could take action on,” said Attorney General Loretta Lynch, responding to a question from green activist Sen Sheldon Whitehouse at a Senate Judiciary Hearing. advertisement, Whitehouse said:, “The similarities between the mischief of the tobacco industry pretending that the science of tobacco’s dangers was unsettled and the fossil fuel industry pretending that the science of carbon emissions’ dangers is unsettled has been remarked on widely, particularly by those who study the climate denial apparatus that the fossil fuel industry has erected.”, “Under President Clinton, the Department of Justice brought and won a civil RICO action against the tobacco industry for its fraud. Under President Obama, the Department of Justice has done nothing so far about the climate denial scheme,”, Perhaps the kind of RICO action Whitehouse has in mind is similar to the one proposed to President Obama a few months ago by a number of key climate scientists, led by one Jagadish Shukla of George Mason University.

The six-time Oscar nominee, who has called climate change “the most existential human crisis that the world has ever known,” raised eyebrows last month when he suggested that “warm gusts of wind” that blew through the snow-capped Canada set of The Revenant were caused by the effects of climate change. DiCaprio was referring to the Chinook winds, a common seasonal wind that affects portions of Alberta every year. The actor met with Pope Francis in Vatican City last week, where the two exchanged gifts and discussed climate change during a brief 15-minute meeting.

      "Every year the UN runs a poll which surveys people’s greatest concerns across the world.[It’s significant because the responses run into the millions and canvas the views of people from all countries, rich and poor. advertisement, So guess where ‘climate change’ comes on the global population’s list of priorities. Yes, that’s right. It comes right at the bottom. , More than three times as many people care about education, and well over twice as many want better healthcare, job opportunities, and honest government than want “action taken on climate change”. Only when the surveys are broken down between rich and poor countries does “climate change” creep higher up the list. But only in rich countries. In poor countries, as a ratio of the total number of votes made, it becomes even less of a concern. , , “Action on climate change”, in other words, is the decadent preoccupation of spoilt Westerners who have nothing serious to worry about because they have all the basics – education, healthcare, jobs, political freedoms, phone and internet access – more or less covered. The poll gives the lie to all those people – usual of a left-liberal persuasion – who insist that more needs to be done, more scarce resources diverted, to ‘combat’ climate change. If the money currently squandered by our governments on this non-problem – $1.5 trillion a year – reflected people’s actual concerns (as governments are supposed to do), then the funding would dry up and a lot of worthless troughers would suddenly find themselves going very hungry. Which would be good for them, in a way, because for the first time in their miserable parasitical lives they might get a sense of the harm their policies are inflicting around the world – most especially on the poor who, more than anyone, need the cheap fossil fuel energy the greenies are determined to deny them.\n",
      "In a surprising turn of events, climate change doomsayers have turned their attention to cattle, as environmentalists have been compelled to acknowledge that “livestock emissions” are more dangerous for the environment than automobiles.[A recent article at EcoWatch says that greenhouse gas emissions from livestock actually account for a higher percentage of total global emissions than the world’s 1.2 billion automobiles. advertisement, Whereas the transportation sector accounts for only some 14 percent of global emissions, cows produce a remarkable 14.5 to 18 percent of the global total, the article confesses. These uncomfortable statistics — touted by the eco-lobby itself — would seem to be good news to right-thinking people. After all, when normal biological functions of mammalian quadrupeds put out more greenhouse gases than the entire transportation sector, there is reason to suppose that man is not the enemy of the environment that many have supposed. Yet by a clever feat of mental legerdemain, environmentalists have drawn the unlikely conclusion that it is time to reduce the number of cows in the world, and obviously, western consumption of meat. So now vegans, vegetarians, and animal rights activists can join hands with climate change agitators to insist that meat-eating is no longer an ecologically acceptable human activity. Although it has taken climate change activists years to admit it, the bovine contribution to gas emissions has been a well-established fact for years. A 2012 United Nations report asserted that the earth’s cattle population actually produces more CO2 than automobiles, planes, and all other forms of transport combined. Moreover, the cow pies they drop and the wind they break produce a third of the world’s twenty-times-more-detrimental methane emissions. As such, it may be no more arbitrary to outlaw McDonald’s to solve the alleged crisis than to regulate the use of fossil fuels. Besides, either way, Texas gets it (which is really the point). Trying to keep a literary straight face, EcoWatch writer Jordyn Cormier suggests that in the absence of total vegetarianism, buying grass-fed beef reduces entropic emissions in cows simply because their stomachs are designed to digest grass, not grains, meaning that “methane gas flatulence” is minimized. Amidst much hand-wringing that “meat consumption is skyrocketing across the globe” — meaning that, for the first time in human history, poorer nations have access to protein-rich meat — Cormier proposes that westerners aim at the modest goal of “one meatless day a week,” by which, he intimates, “livestock emissions could be greatly reduced.”, The irony of all this is that eco-friendly Amish farmers in Pennsylvania may well be producing more greenhouse gases than SUV-driving soccer moms in Iowa.

      "One of the leading purveyors of climate change panic has described the Presidential election of Donald J. Trump as a “global disaster,” adding that if were to meet Trump he would tell him: “Kill yourself immediately.”[Evolutionary biologist John Wiens of the University of Arizona claims that the earth is racing toward “global extinction” similar to the era of the dinosaurs, as half the world’s species are allegedly failing to cope with global warming. advertisement, Wiens said that while we may not quite be at the level of “global extinction of entire species that have already happened,” we are unfortunately “on track for that to happen.”, “If we don’t do anything,” Wiens warned, “it seems like that’s going to happen in the next 50 to 100 years.”, Wiens said that the Trump election bodes badly for the future of the planet, exacerbated by his appointment of climate change skeptic Scott Pruitt as head of the EPA and his determination to pull out of the Paris Climate Change Accord (COP21). “The EPA in this country, they are the ones supposed to be protecting the environment,” he said. Wiens suggested the U.K. should invade the U.S. or the U.S. should swap leaders with Canada, with Justin Trudeau taking over in the White House. Wiens published an article this week in the journal PLOS Biology, claiming that climate-related “local extinctions” are already widespread among plant and animal species. He concluded that “species cannot change fast enough to keep up with a small change in climate.”, “In almost half the species looked at, there have been local extinctions already,” he said. Meanwhile, last month a group of scientists discovered to their surprise that the world’s plants have somehow increased their capacity to assimilate carbon, resulting in a decline in the percentage of human-produced CO2 remaining in the atmosphere. Researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found that despite the increased human emissions of greenhouse gases, between 2002 and 2014, plants were somehow able to absorb more carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere than in previous decades.

      "Oscar-winning actor Leonardo DiCaprio told reporters in Japan on Wednesday the United States must elect a president who takes climate change science seriously.[At a press conference in Tokyo promoting The Revenant, the actor and environmental activist told the media, “We should not have a candidate who doesn’t believe in modern science to be leading our country,” according to the AFP. advertisement, He added: “Climate change is one of the most concerning issues facing all humanity and the United States needs to do its part.”, Of his filmmaking partner Fisher Stevens, who produced the 2010 documentary The Cove, DiCaprio said, “We’ve been traveling around the world documenting climate change.”, DiCaprio is working on a climate change documentary that will be released before November, and he reportedly visited China, India, and the North Pole and South Pole with Stevens. Republican presidential candidates Sen. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump have both expressed doubts about the science behind climate change. Trump described the hysteria as a “very, very expensive form of tax,” adding, “A lot of people are making a lot of money.”, Trump has also tweeted about his opinion on climate change on numerous occasions in recent years. The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2012, , Ice storm rolls from Texas to Tennessee – I'm in Los Angeles and it's freezing. Global warming is a total, and very expensive, hoax!, — Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 26, 2014, , On the campaign trail in New Hampshire earlier this year, Cruz also shared his skepticism: “John Kerry said in 2009 the polar ice caps will be entirely melted by 2013 … Has anyone noticed the polar ice caps are still there? In fact, there was an expedition that went down to Antarctica to prove that the polar ice caps were melting … (the ship) got stuck in the ice because in fact the polar ice caps have increased.”, Cruz added: “They are larger than they were. So not only was Kerry incorrect, he was spectacularly absolutely opposite the facts.”, Long shot GOP candidate John Kasich, meanwhile, has stated he believes in the concept of climate change but is not sure of the science behind it. Both Democratic candidates have taken extreme positions on the issue. Hillary Clinton recently linked climate change to the Syrian refugee crisis, while Sen. Bernie Sanders previously stated, “climate change is directly related to the rise of global terrorism.”, Attorney General Loretta Lynch stated earlier this month the U.S. Department of Justice has been considering whether people should be prosecuted for denying climate change, despite the fact that the issue is far from settled. At last month’s Oscars, after winning his first Academy Award, Leonardo DiCaprio used his acceptance speech to ask for international support in stopping the world’s “big polluters.”, “Climate change is real. It is happening right now,” said DiCaprio. “It is the most urgent threat facing our entire species, and we need to work collectively together and stop procrastinating.”, In 2014, the Environmental Policy Alliance mocked Leonardo DiCaprio for being “just another celebrity hypocrite,” calling out the star for traveling around the world in super yachts and private jets and wasting “thousands of gallons of jet fuel to indulge his lavish tastes.”, The group also called out the actor for owning five homes.\n",

      "Former President Barack Obama returned to his gospel of climate change alarmism, preaching to Italians in Milan about the impending doom facing the planet.[“When it comes to climate change, the hour is almost upon us,” he warned, urging the world to “set aside our parochial differences” to create a better planet for the world’s children. advertisement, The former president spoke at the “Seeds and Chips” global innovation summit on food, but Obama used the occasion to focus on his climate change agenda and his signature Obamacare legislation. “If we seize the future, there is nothing that we cannot do … I do not believe that this planet is condemned to ever-rising temperatures,” Obama said. “I believe these are problems that were caused by man and can be solved by man.”, The former president warned that climate refugees would be fleeing to Europe, causing population disruptions and global challenges. “Some of the refugee flow into Europe originate not only from conflict, but also from places where there are food shortages that will get far worse as climate change continues,” he said. Obama boasted about his record as president, cutting global emissions and making investments in clean energy. But he admitted that the Trump administration was ratcheting back his fuel standards and climate change progress. He also complained that Americans were wasting too much food, while becoming more obese, during a discussion about food with his former chef Sam Kass. The amount of cows, he explained, were contributing to global pollution, and urged the world to consume less meat. “People aren’t as familiar with the impact of cows and methane,” he said, adding that “as people want to increase more meat consumption, that in turn is spiking the growth of greenhouse emissions coming out of the agricultural sectors.”, More advanced countries, Obama said, would have to teach people to “have a smaller steak” and how to reduce their meat consumption. “What it does mean is that we’re also going to have to find ways to produce protein in a more efficient way,” he said. At one point, Obama argued with Kass about how many steaks he had cooked him. Kass said that he probably cooked “thousands of steaks” for the president, but Obama interrupted. “I don’t think, thousands,” he protested. “Well hundreds maybe,” Kass backtracked.  \n",
      "Three U.S. professors teaching an online course called Medical Humanities in the Digital Age at the University of Colorado-Colorado Springs have told students that the “science” of climate change is not up for debate and have asked anyone who thinks otherwise not to join the course.[According to an email provided to Kate Hardiman of The College Fix by a student on the course:, advertisement, The point of departure for this course is based on the scientific premise that human induced climate change is valid and occurring. We will not, at any time, debate the science of climate change, nor will the ‘other side’ of the climate change debate be taught or discussed in this course. Opening up a debate that 98% of climate scientists unequivocally agree to be a non-debate would detract from the central concerns of environment and health addressed in this course. … If you believe this premise to be an issue for you, we respectfully ask that you do not take this course, as there are options within the Humanities program for face to face this semester and online next. Nor, reports Hardiman, does the alarmist zealotry end there:, The professors also note this ban on debate extends to discussion among students in the online forums. Moreover, students who choose to use outside sources for research during their time in the course may select only those that have been peer-reviewed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the email states. One section of the course deals with the subject of “fracking” but again, from only one side of the argument:, The reading assignments in the fracking section focus on only its negative impacts and fail to present the other side of the issue, namely the possible benefits of fracking. The three professors are:, Wendy Haggren, who specialises in the genetic engineering of yeast for the production of biofuels, Rebecca Larouche, a literature professor, specialising in early modern recipe collections, and, Eileen Skahill, whose “area of inquiry is the Sociology of Climate Change with an emphasis on environmental justice and social justice movements and the importance of indigenous ways of knowing the natural world.”, So: no magna cum laude for guessing which of the three profs is most likely behind this ban.\n",
      "Across the US, the usual suspects are taking to the streets to march in protest of the thing today they are pretending is called “climate change” – but which, if they were honest, they would call by his proper name: President Donald J. Trump.[Make no mistake, these marches today are no more about global warming than last weekend’s were about defending science. They’re just an anti-Trump protest by the same people who in January this year were marching around dressed as vaginas, and who in Berkeley the last few weekends have been beating people up wearing facemasks. advertisement, It’s no coincidence that many of the organizations on the People’s Climate March steering committee are in receipt of millions from Democrat donor, arch-globalist, and Agent of Evil George Soros. Mr. Soros, who heads the Open Society Foundations, contributed over $36 million between 2000 and 2014 to 18 of the 55 organizations on the march’s steering committee, according to an analysis released Friday by the conservative Media Research Center. Six of the groups received during that time more than $1 million each: the Center for Community Change, the NAACP, the Natural Resources Defense Council, People’s Action, Public Citizen and the Union of Concerned Scientists.

      "A global warming research study in Canada has been cancelled because of “unprecedented” thick summer ice.[Naturally, the scientist in charge has blamed it on ‘climate change.’, advertisement, According to Vice:, The study, entitled BaySys, is a $17-million four-year-long program headed by the University of Manitoba. It was planning to conduct the third leg of its research by sending 40 scientists from five Canadian universities out into the Bay on the Canadian Research Icebreaker CCGS Amundsen to study “contributions of climate change and regulation on the Hudson Bay system.”, But it had to be cancelled because the scientists’ icebreaker was required by the Canadian Coast Guard for a rather more urgent purpose – rescuing fishing boats and supply ships which had got stuck in the “unprecedented ice conditions”. “It became clear to me very quickly that these weren’t just heavy ice conditions, these were unprecedented ice conditions,” Dr. David Barber, the lead scientist on the study, told VICE. “We were finding thick multi-year sea ice floes which on level ice were five metres thick… it was much, much thicker and much, much heavier than anything you would expect at that latitude and at that time of year.”, Clearly not one to let a crisis go to waste, Barber seized the opportunity to perform the usual alarmist clown dance for the media, explaining why this incident definitely shows that global warming is a major problem and deserving of our urgent attention. He told Vice:, “It was clear it was from the Arctic, I just needed to be among the ice to see it,” said Dr. Barber. “What was also clear to me was that climate change has caused this event to happen.”, [Don’t you just love that “I just needed to be among the ice”? I think what he’s trying in his subtle way to tell us is: “Not all superheroes wear capes”], Warming to his theme, he told Global News:, “This is climate change fully in action – affecting our ability to make use of marine resources and transport things.”, and, “This is a wake-up call for all of us in the country.”, Of course it is. Now Barber has the perfect excuse to share his war stories with all the other global warming experts who have had their research expeditions/publicity stunts stymied by unseasonal bouts of global warming. There was the Ship of Fools expedition in which an Australian climate researcher called Chris Turkey had to call an expedition to the melting Antarctic after his ship got stuck in the ice. The Caitlin Expedition – supported by the Prince of Wales – in which Pen Haddow and his team had to abandon their trip to the North Pole because it was colder than they’d expected. Most recently there was Ship of Fools II, in which a global warming research voyage by David Hempleman Adams had to be curtailed because of unexpected ice. What on earth can Mother Gaia be trying to tell them?, Possibly the same message she’s trying to send out to the Greenies in California with this unexpected fall of white global warming. Why, if you didn’t know better you’d almost think unseasonal bouts of snow and ice were nothing to do with “global warming” but were a natural phenomenon which had been with us since time immemorial….\n",

      "Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte has stated he will not abide by the Paris Agreement, an international climate change pact, calling the deal “stupid” and “absurd,” and accusing developed countries of “imposing” on less wealthy states after having committed their own share of environmental atrocities.[Duterte was addressing the Philippine Olympic team at the presidential palace in Manila, sending them off to Rio de Janeiro to compete in next month’s games. He told an anecdote of an unnamed ambassador questioning whether the Philippines will be able to keep its carbon emissions low as per the climate change pact signed in December. The question, Duterte admitted, made him want “to kick him.”, advertisement, “I said, ‘No. I cannot tell. … You don’t do it that way, Mr. Ambassador. [Your country] had reached the apex [of industrialization] and along the way put a lot of contaminants and emission and went ahead in destroying the climate,’” Duterte said he responded to the ambassador. “We have not reached the age of industrialization. We’re now going into it. But you are trying [to] stymie (our growth) with an agreement that says you can only go up to here,” he added, calling abiding by climate pacts “stupid.”, “Kalokohan yan [That’s absurd],” he continued, “So that is how very competitive and that is how very constricted our lives [are] now. It’s being controlled by the world. It’s being imposed upon us by the industrialized countries. They think that they can dictate the destiny of the rest of the nation.”, “I will not honor that,” he concluded. As to whether the Paris Agreement is binding, as the Philippines signed the deal before Duterte took office, he asserted, “That’s not my signature.”, , The Philippine Star notes that Duterte had previously said he would abide by the Paris deal, but only if developed countries paid for the Philippines to buy the technology necessary to cut emissions. “They were enjoying the booming [economy] and flooding the air with contaminants. Now that they are rich because of coal and industrialization, we are being asked to cut emission and limit our activities,” he declared. Environmentalists urged Duterte to engage in a dialogue with them. “Climate change is a complex political issue that requires reflection from the point of view of climate justice. As such, since climate change was largely caused by rich countries, fairness dictates that they shall have a larger share of the responsibility in solving the problem,” Naderev “Yeb” Saño, a climate change activist, told the Philippine outlet Rappler. “We are willing to sit down with him to discuss the comprehensiveness of the Philippine position and the Paris agreement,” Rodne Galicha, another activist representing the Climate Reality Project Philippines, said. Rappler notes that “highly industrialized countries like China, the United States, Japan, India and other oil-producing Gulf nations account for almost 70% of the greenhouse gas emissions in 2011.”, The refusal to abide by international climate change regulations comes for Duterte at a time of high tension between the Philippines and its closest developed neighbor, China. Last week, the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague rejected Chinese claims to the South China Sea consisting largely of Philippine territory. China has refused to abide by the verdict, calling it an imposition from Japan and the United States, neither of which had a role in the trial. During its illegal occupation of the South China Sea, China has destroyed at least 17 reefs, constructing artificial islands to be used as military assets. Philippine activists have also found evidence of China’s dumping chemicals into South China Sea fishing grounds traditionally frequented by Filipino fishermen so as to deter them from being present in sovereign Philippine territory. The Chinese government, through the propaganda outlet The Global Times, vowed to protect the environmental integrity of the disputed territory in the region in May. “Once China’s construction activities are complete, ecological environmental protection on relevant islands and reefs will be notably enhanced and such action will stand the test of time,” an official vowed.\n",

I understand,” he said, acknowledging that there was hail when he landed on Air Force One in Newark. But Obama insisted that it was still a reality, citing “overwhelming consensus” from the scientific community to back his claim. He also mocked Republican critics who used the weather to suggest that climate change wasn’t real. He referred directly to the stunt by Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-OK) in which he threw a snowball on the Senate floor. , “A while back, you may have seen a United States senator trotted out a snowball during a floor speech in the middle of winter as ‘proof’ that the world was not warming,” he said as the audience laughed with him. “Imagine if Benjamin Franklin had seen that senator with the snowball, what he would think. Imagine if your 5th grade science teacher had seen that. He’d get a D. And he’s a senator!”, Obama told graduates that climate change was not an issue that could be ignored. “I mean, listen, climate change is not something subject to political spin. There is evidence. There are facts. We can see it happening right now,” he said, adding that “your generation will feel the brunt of this catastrophe.”, He told them that “facts” and evidence were more important than ever, cautioning against what he called lies and conspiracies that exist on the internet. “We assume whatever is on the web must be true. We search for sites that just reinforce our own predispositions. Opinions masquerade as facts,” he complained. “The wildest conspiracy theories are taken for gospel.”, As his speech went on, Obama again acknowledged the cold weather as he wrapped up the points of his argument. “I know it’s getting cold and you guys have to graduate,” he said.\n",

Opponents of the climate deal were concerned after White House economic advisor Gary Cohn told reporters that the president was “evolving on the issue” during his trip overseas. His daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner reportedly channelled support for the deal behind the scenes at the White House, encouraging climate change activists that Trump might change his mind. Trump’s Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the former Exxon CEO, also supported remaining in the treaty. On May 9th, Obama defended his climate change legacy, calling the agreement “the one that will define the contours of this century more dramatically perhaps than any other.” In October 2016, Obama described the deal as “the best possible shot to save the one planet we’ve got.”, New York and Washington elites agreed, downplaying the future of coal as an energy source and urging more federal subsidies for wind and solar investments. Trump’s EPA Secretary Scott Pruitt and White House senior advisor Stephen K. Bannon urged the president to keep his campaign promise to kill the agreement and put American energy and job growth first.  \n",
      "BATON ROUGE, Louisiana – Following unprecedented flooding that took the lives of 13 people and displaced more than 100,000 residents, the mainstream media were late to the scene for all the wrong reasons.[Weeks after the storms, even The New York Times editors admitted they had failed to cover the natural disaster, saying it took them two days before a story was ever posted on their website. advertisement, The Obama Administration’s recent labeling of the event as proof of “climate change” has piqued the mainstream media’s attention, however. In a new report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), scientist Karin van der Wiel claims that climate change was the cause of much of the flooding that swept southeast Louisiana. “Human-caused, heat-trapping greenhouses played a ‘measurable’ role in the colossal rainfall totals, which were fueled by high humidity and a stalled storm system above the Gulf Coast,” van der Wiel said in the report, according to USA Today. “The burning of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal releases greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide into the Earth’s atmosphere, which has warmed to levels that cannot be explained by natural variability, scientists say,” USA Today reports. “Rainfall patterns and humidity levels are also affected by this process, as warmer air can hold additional amounts of water vapor.”, Van der Wiel argues that rainfall in the state “is now expected to occur at least 40% more often” than in the past, citing computer models from NOAA which measured the amount of rain that impacted the region. Likewise, The New York Times reported on the finding as well, though the liberal-leaning newspaper actually released a story in August immediately after the storm titled “Flooding in the South Looks a Lot Like Climate Change.”, The Washington Post reported the study as almost being settled fact, writing “The disaster was caused by two weather-related features, extreme humidity and near-stationary low pressure that hovered over the Gulf Coast for days. The moisture component is where climate change comes in — warmer air can hold more water vapor.”, And in lockstep with The New York Times, The Washington Post’s editorial board published a piece after the flooding, claiming the disaster should serve as a “warning” of climate change, complete with social Marxist language. “The future is being rigged against vulnerable people by a system in which government and industry are complicit,” the Post wrote at the time. “No, we are not talking about the electoral system — we are talking about the climate.”, During the Louisiana flooding, famed New Orleans Meteorologist Bob Breck cautioned that the mainstream media and federal agencies would begin pushing the climate change narrative. Breck wrote on his blog at the time that “Before the Global Warming folks jump on our recent extreme rain event” they needed to look at the issue of urbanization, writing “Man building and paving over previous fields that soaked up the rains. Now that additional runoff is causing water in areas that had never seen water before.”, John Binder is a contributor for Breitbart Texas. Follow him on Twitter at @JxhnBinder.\n",

On the 100th Day of the Trump Administration, we will be in the streets of Washington D.C. to show the world and our leaders that we will resist attacks on our people, our communities and our planet. We will come together from across the United States to strengthen our movement. We will demonstrate our power and resistance at the gates of the White House. We will bring our solutions to the climate crisis, the problems that affect our communities and the threats to peace to our leaders in Congress to demand action. Meanwhile, the Washington Post reports, “Environmentalists will once again rally in the nation’s capital this weekend, this time for the People’s Climate March,” noting that the march “will be more political and aimed at specific Trump administration policies.”, The Post said it’s “unclear” just how many people will show up, but “organizers are prepared to accommodate 50,000 to 100,000 people.”\n",
      "Environment and Energy Policy research fellow at the Heartland Institute, H. Sterling Burnett, spoke with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Tuesday regarding President Trump’s position on the Paris Climate Agreement. The Heartland Institute has called for the United States to withdraw.[The press release reads in part:, advertisement, The Paris Climate Treaty puts America last, the exact opposite of what candidate Trump and now President Trump has promised. The treaty would require the United States to make massive reductions in emissions and pay billions of dollars in ‘climate reparations’ to Third World dictators, while requiring no emission cuts from developing countries including India and China. Why should the United States pay hundreds of billions of dollars to developing countries at a time when the U.S. government is running massive debts, when economic growth is slower for a longer period of time than at any time since the Great Depression, and when American workers are losing out to lower-paid workers in China and India?, Burnett said Wednesday, “Trump rightly said he was going to withdraw from this, but … there are two factions in the White House. There are those like Scott Pruitt, head of the EPA, like Steve Bannon, his adviser, that say keep your campaign promise. Withdraw from the Paris Climate agreement. Let America grow.”, “But then there’s the other faction,” he continued, “that’s led by Rex Tillerson, who has a lot of influence … as secretary of state, who said we should stay in the agreement. It’s led by his daughter and son-in-law, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. … She wants to make climate change her signature issue. So he’s got powerful interests trying to keep him in the agreement, saying not [to] leave it as it is, but renegotiate it. Cut a better deal.”, “Problem is, there are no terms within the treaty to cut a better deal. You’re not allowed within the treaty to cut a better deal. And the worst problem is, is there’s no better deal to be had, in the sense that if you’re forcing America to cut its emissions, you’re having big government intervene in the economy,” he concluded.

      "Leonardo DiCaprio has flown by private jet to the World Economic Forum’s annual conference for sinister plutocrats and craven politicians in Davos, Switzerland, to attack the “greed” of the energy industry.[“We simply cannot afford to allow the corporate greed of the coal, oil and gas industries to determine the future of humanity. Those entities with a financial interest in preserving this destructive system have denied, and even covered up the evidence of our changing climate.”, DiCaprio’s views are very much in tune with those of the event’s sponsors. According to the WEF’s Global Risks 2016 report — as decided by “750 experts and decision makers” from “multistakeholder communities” [!!!] — the single greatest risk facing the world right now is “failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation.”, advertisement, No really. This is not made up. In a world where China’s economy may be on the brink of hard landing, with Europe about to collapse under the weight of Islamic immigration, with ISIS, Al Qaeda, Boko Haram and Al Shabaab still a potent force and the rock bottom oil price playing havoc with the markets, the resident “experts” at the World Economic Forum agree with Leo DiCaprio that the biggest problem facing us all right now is that we haven’t done enough about climate change. Happily for common sense, though, the conference delegates aren’t buying it. According to a survey of 1,400 CEOs from around the world compiled by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and published at Davos this week. Instead, over-regulation was listed as the biggest threat to business (by 79% of CEOs), followed by geopolitical uncertainty (74%) and other key threats including cyber attacks (61%). In contrast, climate change and environmental damage was mentioned as a threat to business growth by just 50% of CEOs. The findings were similar to a separate survey of 13,000 business leaders produced by the World Economic Forum (WEF). It also found a relative absence of concern about climate change and environmental risk amongst business leaders. Those 79 per cent of CEOs who voted “over-regulation” the biggest threat to business are probably right. But that doesn’t mean that around half of them — the 50 per cent who voted “climate change and environmental damage” as a threat — aren’t complete idiots. What, numbskulls, do you think is the greatest contributory factor to all that extra regulation business is being forced to wear by national and supranational regulation?, Climate change and environmental scaremongering — as promoted by actors with IQs about the same as their shoe size — of course!\n",
      "California Gov. Jerry Brown signed the most aggressive climate change bill yet in America on Thursday, calling the new SB 32 “far-reaching” and “backed up by the real power of the state of California.”[Brown signed signed the bill in a Los Angeles park, according to the Sacramento Bee. “California is doing something that no other state has done,” Brown reportedly said at the ceremony. ” We’re putting in to law real measures, backed up by the real power of the state of California. This is big and I hope it sends a message across the country.”, advertisement, The new law is a more aggressive version of former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s AB 32, enacted in 2006, which aimed to reduce carbon emissions in the state to 1990 levels by 2020. That bill created the burly and bureaucratic California Air Resources Board (CARB), which was given authority over seeing those levels achieved. The new SB 32 requires a massive 40 percent cut from 1990 levels, with a deadline of December 31, 2030. The Bee reports that the new measure gives CARB extended authority to force the extreme reductions upon Californians without setting the parameters of those regulations. The emissions target is just one piece of what Brown committed the state to achieve in an extremely ambitious multinational climate change pact he signed last year with 12 regional governments in seven countries, including four U.S. states. That agreement committed each signatory to drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Brown’s office stated at the time, “Under today’s agreement, the signatories commit to either reduce greenhouse gas emissions 80 to 95 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 or achieve a per capita annual emission target of less than 2 metric tons by 2050.”, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory staff scientist Jeffery Greenblatt admitted to the Bee that if California halted all emissions the “global warming picture” wouldn’t really change. Rather he said, the reductions would be a political action, aimed at encouraging others to do the same. The Bee reported that the state of California “is planning to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on a range of emission-reduction programs, from clean vehicle rebates and high-speed rail to efforts to reduce methane from dairies.” Along those lines, the explosively pricey High-Speed Rail endeavor is a legacy project for Brown. Jon Fleischman previously analyzed SB 32 and several other bills at Breitbart News, noticing the pork inherent in the program:, Two related bills, AB 1550 and AB 2722, set out the wealth redistribution piece of the regulatory scheme, taking moneys collected in fines and through extorting businesses and forcing those funds to be spent in districts represented by many legislators voting for SB 32. Brown appears bent on forcing cap-and-trade on Californians, stating last month that “they’re going to plead for a market system called cap-and-trade so they can respond in a way that’s more beneficial to their bottom line.” The Bee reported  that Brown also lambasted his opponents in Sacramento, calling them “Trump-inspired acolytes,” but concluded that “they have been vanquished” with the passage of SB 32.

A day later, DiCaprio was back in France giving a speech at amfAR’s Cinema Against AIDS gala. One week, two continents, and 8,000 carbon emission-powered miles later, Leonardo DiCaprio was already back to his hashtag activism and fighting climate change on social media. All this from the man who says that “a massive change is required right now, one that leads to a new collective consciousness, a new collective evolution of the human race, inspired and enabled by a sense of urgency.”, An inside source, according to the New York Post, said DiCaprio had “hitched a ride with someone already flying back [and] to Cannes. Hitching a ride was the only way he could make it in time for both events.”, How does a man who called manmade climate change “the most existential human crisis that the world has ever known” rationalize flying 8,000 miles in five days?, By saying, “Hey, it wasn’t my private jet.”, Leonardo DiCaprio “demonstrates exactly why our consumption of fossil fuels continues to grow,” environmental analyst Robert Rapier told the Post. “It’s because everyone loves the combination of cost and convenience they offer. Alternatives usually require sacrifice of one form or another.”, Two months ago, DiCaprio told a room of reporters that “climate change is one of the most concerning issues facing all humanity and the United States needs to do its part.”, How can Leonardo DiCaprio persistently lecture Americans about the perils of being reliant on fossil fuels, when he’s so brazenly hypocritical and obviously guilty of the same sin?, Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @jeromeehudson.\n",
      "Rep. Barbara Lee (D-CA) said on Tuesday that she does not agree with states’ rights because President Donald Trump believes in restoring states’ authority on a wide range of issues, including education and health care insurance markets.[Lee made the remarks at the left-wing Center for American Progress in Washington, DC, where she referenced states rights as it applies to Trump’s decision this month to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate change agreement, a move she claims would hurt the U.S. economy. advertisement, Moreover, Lee said, California is still committed to fighting global warming. “Pulling out of the Paris Accord is also a job killer,” Lee said. “Because the energy sector — the green sector — coming from California we’re doing a lot of things — I think some other states will follow. “Because the jobs that are being created will be destroyed now as a result of what this president has done,” Lee said. “I don’t agree with states’ rights because that is kind of this administration’s push but in some instances when we have to just go at it on our own — we need to go at it on our own,” Lee said. But according to Robertson Williams, a professor at the University of Maryland and director of academic programs for Resources for the Future, a non-partisan group that studied the climate change agreement, it is difficult to know exactly what the economic impacts of withdrawing will be. Williams was interviewed by the Boston public radio station in May where he was asked about the economic impact of leaving the agreement. “One of the problems we have, we’re much better at modeling the cost of doing something to reduce emissions than we are modeling the cost of doing nothing,” Williams said. “We don’t know very well how other countries are gonna react. “If other countries react by doing less to fight climate change, that has very real costs,” Williams said. “That unchecked climate change could have very serious costs for the U.S. economy. “But knowing exactly how big that is is really hard,” Williams said.\n",
      "National Geographic released the first trailer for Leonardo DiCaprio’s climate change documentary Before the Flood on Tuesday.[The two-minute clip follows the Oscar-winning Revenant actor as he travels the world to learn about and advocate for an end to man-made global warming. On the journey, the actor meets dignitaries and business leaders including President Obama, Pope Francis, John Kerry and Elon Musk in an attempt to learn more about what can be done to save the planet from the effects of climate change. advertisement, , The film, which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival earlier this month, is set to be screened on the White House’s South Lawn on October 3 as part of the inaugural South by South Lawn (SXSL) arts festival. Before the screening, DiCaprio will meet with President Obama and climate scientist Dr. Katharine Hayhoe for a conversation focusing on ways to end climate change. Before the Flood is directed by Fisher Stevens, who won an Oscar for his 2009 documentary The Cove. In an interview with Variety at the Toronto Film Festival, Stevens said the project had gotten off the ground when DiCaprio called him and expressed interest in making a climate change documentary, and added that the actor was the perfect ambassador to carry the film’s message. “He was made the Messenger of Peace for climate change by the U.N. so we kind of used that as our jump-off for the movie,” Stevens said of DiCaprio’s involvement. “Leo’s an amazing voice. He looks great. He knows a lot. I was shocked at how much Leo knew about the subject before we even started filming.”, The release of Before the Flood comes as DiCaprio has faced increased scrutiny over his environmental foundation’s reported connections to wealthy donors involved in a $3 billion Malaysian embezzlement scheme. Environmental activist groups have called on the actor to return some donations alleged to have been funded with money misappropriated from a Malaysian sovereign wealth fund.

      "It’s that time of year again, a holiday where you stand around the grill and patiently (or not) explain the truth to your liberal relatives and friends.[Mentioning an article that ran in the Washington Post in 1922, misreporting evidence of short-term weather variability in the Arctic as evidence of a long-term warming trend, is a good way to poke a stick in the eye of your global warming alarmist friends. A conversation starter!, advertisement, The article illustrates a past case where (quoting Snopes, the liberal self-described fact checker) “current warming trends” were misinterpreted as being “indicative of long-term climatic changes rather than relatively short-term weather pattern variability.” Don’t oversell it! It doesn’t prove that people today who refer to warming in the Arctic region as proof of a long-term warming trend are necessarily wrong… only that they might be, that the mistake was made in the past (when man-made emissions could not have been a factor), and so the burden of proof rests on those who say this time is different. Global warming alarmists often claim the recent Arctic warming is unprecedented or must be due to the human presence. On its face, the 1922 article makes those claims dubious. Closer study reveals they haven’t made the case. For example, a scholarly article released just this month suggests the recent reduction in Arctic ice is most likely just a natural correction to a build-up that occurred from the 1940s to the 1970s. Scientists with the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC) produced a lengthy review of the literature in 2014 that essentially found the same thing.

      "Climate deniers should not be allowed to hold public office, Leonardo DiCaprio has said in a thinly-veiled attack on Donald Trump, staged in co-ordination with the Obama administration.[Speaking on a platform at the inaugural South By South Lawn event at the White House with President Obama and alarmist scientist Katharine Hayhoe, DiCaprio told his enraptured audience:, advertisement, “The scientific consensus is in and the argument is now over. If you do not believe in climate change, you do not believe in facts, or in science or empirical truths and therefore, in my humble opinion, should not be allowed to hold public office.”, DiCaprio was there mainly to promote his new National Geographic disaster-porn documentary Before the Flood in which he tours the world by private jet talking to celebrities who agree with him on climate change – President Obama, Pope Francis, Elon Musk – and also canvassing the opinions of picturesque natives in exotic locations all testifying in a range of languages and accents that, yes, man-made climate change really is the worst thing ever and they can see its effects all around them. Obama – watch the video if you can bear – was in full “I don’t want you to think of me of anything so boring as President of the USA. I want you to think of me more like a Hollywood movie star, like Leo, who is totally down with the kids and really cool” mode. He took the opportunity to reiterate just how incredibly important an issue climate change is – as indeed he would, given that if this isn’t the case then he has just gone and blown two whole terms of a US presidency on absolutely nothing. Hayhoe, meanwhile, was there to lend the event the veneer of scientific credibility. She was certainly right on one thing. The bit where she said:, “We are pouring all of our money, all of our effort, all of our prayers into a bucket and the bucket has a hole in the bottom. That hole is climate change.”, This is probably the truest, wisest, cleverest thing any climate alarmist scientist has ever said in history – even the truth only came out by accident and not in the way she intended. But yes, the whole climate change industry is indeed like pouring trillions of dollars (and hope and effort and prayers, etc) into a bucket with an almighty hole in it. Here, by way of a reminder, is the rough annual cost of the climate change industry – $1.5 trillion. And here is what the combined decarbonisation efforts of the world’s industrial and developing nations are going to achieve by the end of the century thanks to the vital COP21 summit in Paris last year. A reduction in global temperatures by the end of the century of 0.048 degrees C – ie around 1/20th of a degree C. If this represents a sensible use of scarce resources, I would love to hear acclaimed climate expert and economist Leonardo DiCaprio explain how. Then perhaps he could go on to explain the still unexplained mystery of the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation’s connections with a $3 billion  Malaysian embezzlement scheme.\n",
      "Former President Barack Obama warned the world that more people on the planet were eating meat, causing a dramatic rise in climate emissions.[“As people want to increase meat consumption, that in turn is spiking the growth of greenhouse emissions coming out of the agricultural sector,” Obama said, pointing to countries that were consuming more meat. advertisement, The former president shared his views about the growing threat during a conversation about food with his former chef Sam Kass at a food innovation summit in Milan. “People aren’t as familiar with the impact of cows and methane,” Obama said, adding that “as people want to increase more meat consumption, that in turn is spiking the growth of greenhouse emissions coming out of the agricultural sectors.”, The amount of cows, Obama explained, were contributing to global pollution, alluding to the amounts of methane gas emissions from cow herds. “No matter what, we are going to see an increase in meat consumption,” Obama said, pointing to developing economies in China, India, Indonesia, and Vietnam. More advanced countries, Obama said, would have to teach people to “have a smaller steak” and explore reductions to their meat consumption. “What it does mean is that we’re also going to have to find ways to produce protein in a more efficient way,” he said. During the conversation, Obama argued with Kass about how many steaks he had cooked him. Kass said that he probably cooked “thousands of steaks” for the president, but Obama interrupted. “I don’t think, thousands,” he protested. “Well hundreds maybe,” Kass backtracked. “I’ve been cooking for you for 10 years.”, “What is true is that I’m not a vegetarian,” Obama admitted, adding that he “respected vegetarians” but continued to eat meat.\n",

      "Exile all the top climate scientists in the U.S. to a failing economy where unemployment is rising, taxes are prohibitive and terrorism is rife. What kind of a vicious, sadistic bastard would dream of such a proposal?[Well, his name is Emmanuel Macron and he is the new French president. He has invited America’s entire climate change industry to France in order for them to escape what he clearly imagines to be President Trump’s anti-science Terror. advertisement, He made his offer in a video on Facebook in February this year, before he knew for certain that his rivals had been nobbled to point where he was definitely going to win. “This is a message for American researchers, entrepreneurs, engineers working on climate change…I do know how your new president has decided to jeopardize your budget, your initiatives as he is extremely skeptical about climate change. I have no doubt about climate change… Please come to France. You are welcome. It’s your nation. We like innovation. We want innovative people. We want people working on climate change, energy, renewables, and new technologies. France is your nation.”, If President Macron keeps his promise it will be truly awesome news for the U.S. economy. No one has ever calculated how much the U.S. squanders annually on the great climate change scam. But the annual global figure has been estimated at $1.5 trillion so we can probably extrapolate from this that the U.S. pays at least one third of that. Here is what half a trillion dollars looks like in figures: $500,000,000,000. Imagine if, instead of being squandered on foreign junkets, kickbacks for presidential donors (that means you Solyndra), subsidies for the wind industry, and salaries for crooked scientists fiddling with the data for political ends, that money was instead spent on something useful like bigger bombs to drop on America’s enemies, fighter jets that weren’t obsolete, or, better still, on paying off the U.S. deficit?, Also, it would rid the U.S. of what Macron mysteriously calls “entrepreneurs” but which you and I would more accurately call “rent-seeking parasites.”, The climate change industry is full of such creatures, attracted like blowflies to a rotting corpse. They contribute nothing of value to the economy – almost entirely dependent, as they are, on taxpayer subsidies. Elon Musk alone has cost the U.S. taxpayer $4.9 billion. It is typical of a Frenchman not to understand this. France has always been a big believer in the power of the state and in massive, capital-intensive ‘grands projets”. So long as they don’t have any issues with France’s increasingly rich and diverse culture, I can imagine that American climate scientists will be very happy. And once they’ve gone there, so will everyone in the US.\n",

And, just a taste of this, to link it to some of the events that the UK and the European Union are going through and I know that’s another source of stress because we are now on the eve next week of the Brexit process – but think for a moment about what happened in Syria. You know we look at the gates of hell opening, they long since have opened, but before the gates of hell opened in Syria, what happened was a climate-related extreme drought.”, “The scientists have published these peer review studies for several years now showing exactly why it’s related to the climate crisis. From 2006 to 2010, 60 percent of the farms in Syria were destroyed and had to be abandoned and 80 per cent of the livestock were killed. The drought in the eastern Mediterranean is the worst ever on record – the records only go back 900 years, but it’s historic. And 1.5 million climate refugees were driven into the cities in Syria, where they collided with refugees from the Iraq War. And Wikileaks revealed the internal conversations in the Syrian government where they were saying to one another ‘we can’t handle this, there’s going to be a social explosion’. There are other causes of the Syrian civil war, but this was the principal one. And those in the region recognize that. And it has unleashed, with other factors an incredible flow of refugees into Europe which is creating political instability in Europe and which contributed in some ways to the desire of some in the UK to say ‘Whoa we’re not sure we want to be a part of that anymore.’ And you can go through the list of countries around the worlds where stability and political success of governance is really challenged.

Obama said that Trump managed to “up the ante” in anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant sentiment, which Obama said was repeated by other candidates.

The president also said that the GOP candidates’ views on climate change concerned business leaders around the world. “I think that’s troubling to the international community since the science is unequivocal,“ he added. “This is not just Mr. Trump,” he stated. “Look at the statements that are being made by the other candidates. There’s not a single candidate in the Republican primary that thinks we should do anything about climate change.”\n",
      "The Competitive Enterprise Institute has released a video urging President Trump to keep his campaign promise and withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement.[It features a speech President Trump gave in May 2016 explaining exactly why he wanted to pull out:, advertisement, “This agreement gives foreign bureaucrats control over our energy and how much we use right here in America. No way!”, He adds:, “We’re going to cancel the Paris Climate Agreement and stop all payments of the United States’ tax dollars to UN global warming programs”. The video concludes:, Mr President. Don’t listen to the Swamp. Keep your promise. Withdraw from the Paris climate treaty. Send it to the Senate. Now, however, he appears to be having second thoughts. His administration is reportedly divided on the issue, with White House insiders including Jared Kushner and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson arguing for the U.S. to remain inside the UN Paris agreement, supposedly in order to keep a “seat at the table.”, That would make it more expensive than a solid gold, diamond-encrusted seat at the table of King Croesus then. In fact, it would make it – at $65 trillion – the most expensive seat at the table in the history of the world. And the $65 trillion, by the way, is a conservative estimate. This – according to calculations by Bjorn Lomborg – is the lower end estimate of how much it would cost the world if all the signatories of the Paris climate agreement stuck to their CO2 reduction commitments. First, Bjorn Lomborg, accepting climate-change advocates’ assumptions about how much warming comes from carbon dioxide, showed in a peer-reviewed study that implementing all provisions of all signers to Paris would prevent only 0.306 degrees Fahrenheit of global warming by 2100. What would it cost? Unofficial estimates by the United States, European Union, Mexico and China amount to $739-$757 billion per year. All told, $924-$946 billion. Per year. Every year from 2030 to the end of the century. “And that’s if the politicians do everything right. If not, the real cost could double,” Mr. Lomborg said. So, for $65-$132 trillion, we might — if the alarmists are right — reduce global average temperature by a third of one degree by 2100. That’s $212-$431 billion per thousandth of a degree of cooling. But if you think things just couldn’t any more stupid, wait till you hear what the effect of pouring all that money down the drain on futile carbon-dioxide reductions schemes will have on the state of the Earth’s climate. Here is what a peer-reviewed study by Bjorn Lomborg says. It will, by 2030, reduce “global warming” by the almost immeasurable 0.048 degrees C. And by the end of the century, it will reduce “global warming” by 0.17 degrees C. This, of course, depends on the heroic assumption that all the signatories to the Paris agreement stick to their carbon dioxide emissions targets. Which they won’t a) because the targets aren’t legally binding or in any way enforceable and b) many countries – including the biggest polluter China – just don’t give a damn anyway: as far as they’re concerned, these UN climate targets are just a handy way of shackling idiot Western nations with regulations and maybe grabbing a bit of Western guilt-baksheesh. Which very much suggests that President Trump’s first instincts were right: there is no logical reason as to why the US should pay even lip service to this ludicrous climate agreement – signed off by President Obama in the dog days of his failing administration, without Congressional approval. That he is wavering on the issue now can, therefore, clearly not be excused as the hesitancy of a man who has studied the evidence more closely and been persuaded that to remain in the Paris agreement is the rational course of action. Rather, it is further depressing evidence that President Trump is being got at by members of his inner circle who would prefer him to maintain the establishment status quo – however wrongheaded and counterproductive – than to fulfil his promise to drain the swamp. When this administration finally makes its decision on this issue – it was due on Tuesday but the meeting was cancelled because the president had other appointments – we will be closer to answering one of the great questions of our time: who is going to win the battle for the soul of Trump presidency – the people or the swamp?\n",
      "France’s Socialist President has said the Paris climate change agreement is “irreversible”, in a warning to President-elect Donald Trump who wants to scrap the deal.[François Hollande was speaking a day after a United Nations climate summit in Marrakesh, Morocco, when he claimed Mr. Trump had no choice but to abide by the decision of his predecessor President Barack Obama. advertisement, “This Paris agreement… is irreversible, no one can get out of it,” Mr. Hollande said during a speech in the south-west of France. “And even if he could be tempted, there will be forces, amongst them American democracy, who will ensure that it is respected”, he added. Mr. Trump has been vocal about his sceptical attitude towards climate change deals, questioning their effect on growth and Western industry. “Give me clean, beautiful and healthy air – not the same old climate change (global warming) bullshit! I am tired of hearing this nonsense”, he tweeted on the 29th of January 2014. The Paris accord went into effect on November 4, after being ratifying following the agreement being adopted at the UN climate conference in December 2015. The incoming head of the UN body that will be implementing it, Moroccan foreign minister Salaheddine Mezouar, told AFP after the meeting of Marrakesh last week: “The Paris Agreement is here… Its entry into force means that governments must face up to their responsibilities.”, “It would be, I think, extremely difficult to retreat – there’s no turning back,” he added. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has also claimed that Mr. Trump will come to understand the “seriousness and urgency” of the deal. Last Thursday, President Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel penned a joint op-ed, insisting, “Our countries share a joint responsibility to protect and preserve our way of life”. They claimed that a “U.S.-German partnership was essential to achieving a global agreement in Paris that offers the world a framework for protecting our planet”.\n",
      "Right now, President Trump faces a terrible dilemma on climate change and the UN.[Should he:, advertisement, a) follow the example of his predecessors — the Bushes, Clinton, and Obama — and take the dumb, cowardly, economically damaging, scientifically illiterate and totally wrong decision?, or, b) stay true to his campaign promises and do the right thing by America, by honest science, and by the whole world?, Personally, I would have thought it was a no-brainer. But not, apparently. The New York Times is urging President Trump to ignore the facts and the evidence, and instead listen to the siren voices of his daughter Ivanka, his Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and the various assorted members of the Climate Industrial Complex who would prefer the U.S. to remain shackled to one of the most stupid and pointless agreements in American history. They want him to keep the U.S. stuck in the disastrous and ill-advised United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). At least George H.W. Bush, who nodded through the deal at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, had the excuse that he was going with the flow of the popular mood and acting in accordance with the known science of the time. But that was 25 years ago, when Taylor Swift was three, Justin Bieber was still in the womb, and no one had ever heard of twerking, virtue-signalling, Grand Theft Auto, Breaking Bad, the Second Gulf War, Islamic State or Amy Schumer’s comedy vagina — since when, an awful lot has changed. One of the big things that has changed with regard to the UNFCCC agreement is that anyone who has done any background reading on the subject now knows that it is based on a pack of lies, junk science and barely concealed left-wing political activism. The distinguished physicist Dr. Richard Lindzen recently set out the case well in an open letter to the president, signed by more than 300 eminent scientists and other qualified individuals:, We petition the American and other governments to change course on an outdated international agreement that targets minor greenhouse gases, primarily Carbon Dioxide, CO2 for harsh regulation. Since 2009, the US and other governments have undertaken actions with respect to global climate that are not scientifically justified and that already have, and will continue to cause serious social and economic harm—with no environmental benefits. While we support effective, affordable, reasonable and direct controls on conventional environmental pollutants, carbon dioxide is not a pollutant. To the contrary, there is clear evidence that increased atmospheric carbon dioxide is environmentally helpful to food crops and other plants that nourish all life. It is plant food, not poison. Restricting access to fossil fuels has very negative effects upon the wellbeing of people around the world. It condemns over 4 billion people in still underdeveloped countries to continued poverty. Lindzen could scarcely be clearer — but let’s just spell it out for the dumb kids at the back of the class. [What’s Rex Tillerson doing there? Search me. All I know is that during his tenure at Exxon, he was no friend to free markets, severed all ties with the free market think tanks Exxon used to sponsor and engaged in an orgy of environmental virtue-signalling designed to appease the green movement. I think it’s what’s known as ‘paying Danegeld to the Dane’.], Carbon dioxide is not a pollutant — it is plant food and it is turning the planet greener. Therefore, a global agreement that binds nation states, at great expense, to treating CO2 as a menace is clearly a bad agreement which deserves to be nixed as quickly as possible. Worse, it is actively immoral. As Lindzen notes, the people hit hardest by the UNFCCC agreement are the world’s poorest. Which makes it even odder that socially conscious liberals like Ivanka and the New York Times are trying to defend it.\n",
      "Researchers in UC Davis’s Violence Prevention Research Program are worried President Trump will simply erase their data the way his administration erased climate change data from the White House web site.[The fear took hold on inauguration day, when members of the Violence Prevention Research Program watched the Climate Change information disappear. advertisement, Wired reports that Magdalena Cerdá saw the Climate Change information vanish and viewed is as a “call to action.” She said she “worried the same thing could happen to gun violence data on websites belonging to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Bureau of Justice Statistics, or the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.”, Cerdá was on an Amtrak train when she noticed the Climate Change material disappearing and she “sent an email to Garen Wintemute saying [they] needed to start downloading … data immediately.” The goal was to get all the online resource material saved to a back-up drive so they would have it, even if an outside party ordered it removed or inaccessible on the internet. Veronica Pear is a data analyst at the Violence Prevention Research Center. She said, “I was scared.”, Pear is using “federal data for a paper on firearm mortality—tracking hotspots in California between 1999 and 2015—and her work is almost complete.” She said she had grown accustomed to finding the information she needed via online searches, and had therefore never downloaded or backed anything up. But once Cerda announced the erasure of Climate Change information, Pearl began searching and storing information. She said, “I had to enter around 50 different queries, I felt frantic.”, UC Davis now has untold numbers of resources saved on secure servers.

      "Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson has been taking flak from the eco loons.[His crime? Failing (so far at any rate) to censor the guest on this week’s Virgin podcast – an appalling, notorious climate change denier by the name of James Delingpole. advertisement, According to a finger-wagging article in the Guardian by one of the more obscure specimens in its vast menagerie of house eco prats – one Graham Readfern – this simply should not have been allowed. Inviting a consistently wrong non-expert who once wrote that the “climate alarmist industry” should answer questions in the “defendant’s dock in a court of law, before a judge wearing a black cap [worn by UK judges when handing out death sentences]” hardly seems like a safe route to inclusiveness. What never ceases to astonish me about the environmental movement is its shrill intolerance. Heaven forfend that both sides of the climate change argument should be aired freely so that people can make up their own minds where they stand. No, as far as activists like Readfern are concerned, the correct response in these situations is a) aggressively to challenge the interviewer – Dominic Frisby – for even thinking of engaging with such disgraceful people and b) demand an explanation from Virgin. Yet among Frisby’s previous guests on the podcast are three of the world’s most egregious purveyors of green bullshit – renewable energy entrepeneur and eco-crusader Jeremy Leggett Australian alarmist-in-chief (and kangaroo dung expert) Tim Flannery and disgraced Maldives president Mohamed Nasheed.

      "President Donald Trump announced on Thursday that the United States will not comply with the Paris Climate Change Agreement agreed to by former President Barack Obama in 2015 without the consent of Congress.[Not everyone agrees with the decision, including Democrats, Vladimir Putin and the communist Chinese government. advertisement, “The Russian Government has said it supports the Paris Agreement on climate change ahead of Donald Trump’s expected announcement that he will withdraw the US from the landmark accord,” the UK Independent reported on Thursday. The Kremlin said the deal, which seeks to limit global warming to as close to a 1.5 degrees Celsius increase as possible, would be less effective without the participation of major countries, Reuters reported. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a conference call with reporters that “President (Vladimir) Putin signed this convention in Paris. Russia attaches great significance to it. “At the same time, it goes without saying that the effectiveness of this convention is likely to be reduced without its key participants,” Peskov said. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said there was an “international responsibility” for countries to take action over climate change during a trip to Europe for talks with European Union officials. The communist leader also claimed there is a “global consensus” on the need to fight climate change. “In an unprecedented step, the European Union and China are to release a joint statement in a sign of the increasing closeness between Brussels and Beijing – and the widening divide between Brussels and Washington under Mr Trump,” the Independent reported. Meanwhile, Democrats have launched a war of words since the moment Trump made the announcement, including former President Barack Obama. “Even in the absence of American leadership even as this Administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future I’m confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we’ve got,” Obama said in a statement.

      "Newly confirmed EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt told Tea Party activist and conservative commentator Dr. Gina Loudon in an interview conducted on the main stage at CPAC Saturday that the country needs to get back to the rule of law.[Pruitt predicted: “I really believe that at the end of eight years [of the Trump administration], we’re going to have better air quality, we’re going to have better water quality because we’ve invested in a partnership,”, advertisement, The partnership between the states and the federal government, Pruitt said, is one “that exists legally, that exists constitutionally.”, Pruitt also focused on two of the themes that he addressed last month during his confirmation hearings:, (1) The actions of the Environmental Protection Agency must be guided by the rule of law. (2) The goals of environmental quality and energy production are not incompatible. “I think when we have a mutually exclusive kind of approach — that if you’re pro-energy you’re anti-environment, when you’re pro-environment, you’re anti-energy — what that means is that we’ve been used to serve political ends,” Pruitt told Loudon. “We as a nation are better than that,” he added. “Because we do both. We grow jobs we also take care of our air, our water we also take care of our children,” the former Oklahoma Attorney General added. “How can the people here at CPAC help you take that message to their peers, their work environments, their schools as they go back out into the real world?” Loudon asked. “Another key term is trust. There’s distrust right now that exists between the states and Washington, D.C. as it relates to the environment,” Pruitt responded. “We need to do what we can to restore trust. I’m going to be spending time in West Virginia and Ohio with the state governors and the executive branches of government there,” Pruitt promised. “I’m going to send a message.

      "The Pacific Gas and Electric Company, joined by labor and environmental interests, announced that it will close the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant by 2025 — long before the end of its useful life, and despite ongoing state power shortages.[Southern California faces potential blackouts in the midst of an ongoing heat wave, due to the lack of available backup power after a massive natural gas leak at Porter Ranch earlier this year, and the recent closure of the San Onofre nuclear plant. advertisement, Diablo Canyon is the state’s last nuclear power plant, and its closure has divided environmentalists. Some regard nuclear power as too risky, especially given the damage done by the meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan in 2011, after an earthquake and tsunami disabled the reactors’ power supplies and cooling mechanisms. Like that plant, Diablo Canyon sits on the coast — in order to access large quantities of water needed for cooling — and is near earthquake fault lines as well. Other environmentalists see nuclear power as a key component of the effort to fight climate change, since nuclear involves few greenhouse gas emissions and substitutes for traditional fossil fuel energy sources. Renewable energy is not yet able to generate large quantities of power at an affordable cost on the scale required to provide electricity, including air conditioning, to millions of consumers. Nuclear energy currently makes up 9% of the state’s supply. Supporters of the plant are not giving up, according to Bay Area public radio station KQED, and intend to lobby state regulators to keep Diablo Canyon open. NPR reports that Pacific Gas is promising to replace the plant’s power with an “a greenhouse gas free portfolio.”,  \n",

      "In what may be a new record in climate change hyperbole, an article in Esquire magazine Tuesday declares that man-made global warming is creating “vast deserts” out of once verdant lands, even as we speak.[Starting from the typical “conservatives-hate-science” leitmotiv, writer Charles S. Pierce goes on to make a series of ridiculously unscientific claims based on historical ignorance and bad math. advertisement, Climate change, Pierce asserts, “is piling up an impressive record of destroying the lives of many species, including our own.” One wonders: if climate change is on record as having destroyed the life of the human species, why wasn’t anyone told? Which scientific journal documented the destruction of the human race?, To back up his claim, Pierce notes that in various parts of the world, such as Madagascar, people are experiencing droughts and severe hunger, while failing to mention that famines have been going on literally for all of human history, even without the benefits of global warming. Pierce also cites a New York Times article about China’s expanding deserts, which in turn cites “one recent estimate” that China’s deserts have grown by 21,000 square miles in the last 40 years (since 1975), and that the expansion may have been “accelerated” by climate change. If this estimate is anywhere near correct, it suggests that the rate of expansion of China’s deserts has actually slowed dramatically since 1975. The New York Times admits that for many years, China’s deserts “spread at an annual rate of more than 1,300 square miles.” If they had been increasing at 1,300 square miles a year since 1975, desert land would have grown by 53,300 square miles—more than double the quoted estimate. Moreover, later in the article, one reads that “generations of families have made a living herding animals on the edge of the desert” and that “overgrazing is contributing to the desert’s growth.”, So, if one takes the New York Times at its word, China’s deserts are growing far more slowly than in earlier decades, and much of that growth is due to “overgrazing.”, By any measure, that has nothing to do with global warming creating “vast deserts.”, Unwilling to let the facts get in his way, Pierce goes on to predict that the American west will also be facing desertification—just like what happened in the 1930s, he says. Once again he fails to note that the massive droughts that produced the dust bowl had nothing whatsoever to do with global warming. “The next time it happens, it will happen in an era of profound ecological damage that by then may be irreversible,” Pierce ominously prophesies. For a magazine devoted to combating the idea of “the Great Climate Change Hoax,” Esquire might want to look for a more convincing spokesperson next time. Or try fact-checking. Follow Thomas D.

      "A study in Nature has confirmed what to many non-climate-scientists is probably blindingly obvious: far from being traumatised by global warming, plants simply adapt to it.[Here’s the abstract of the study, lead authored by Professor Peter Reich, an ecologist and plant physiologist from the University of Minnesota. advertisement, Boreal and temperate trees show strong acclimation of respiration to warming, Plant respiration results in an annual flux of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere that is six times as large as that due to the emissions from fossil fuel burning, so changes in either will impact future climate. As plant respiration responds positively to temperature, a warming world may result in additional respiratory CO2 release, and hence further atmospheric warming. Plant respiration can acclimate to altered temperatures, however, weakening the positive feedback of plant respiration to rising global air temperature, but a lack of evidence on long-term (weeks to years) acclimation to climate warming in field settings currently hinders realistic predictions of respiratory release of CO2 under future climatic conditions. Here we demonstrate strong acclimation of leaf respiration to both experimental warming and seasonal temperature variation for juveniles of ten North American tree species growing for several years in forest conditions. Plants grown and measured at 3.4 °C above ambient temperature increased leaf respiration by an average of 5% compared to plants grown and measured at ambient temperature without acclimation, these increases would have been 23%. Thus, acclimation eliminated 80% of the expected increase in leaf respiration of non-acclimated plants. Acclimation of leaf respiration per degree temperature change was similar for experimental warming and seasonal temperature variation. Moreover, the observed increase in leaf respiration per degree increase in temperature was less than half as large as the average reported for previous studies, which were conducted largely over shorter time scales in laboratory settings. If such dampening effects of leaf thermal acclimation occur generally, the increase in respiration rates of terrestrial plants in response to climate warming may be less than predicted, and thus may not raise atmospheric CO2 concentrations as much as anticipated. Some previous alarmist studies have suggested that global warming will create a positive feedback loop, whereby plants exposed to more heat will increase their production of carbon dioxide, making the planet even warmer still. If you believe in anthropogenic warming theory, this would indeed be a scary prospect given that plants produce six times more CO2 than humans produce by burning fossil fuels. As the Nature press release puts it:, For every 10 degrees Celsius of temperature increase, plants are known to double their rate of metabolism, which has led to fears that global warming will trigger a positive-feedback loop, switching plants from being a net carbon dioxide sink — absorbing more carbon dioxide than they release — to becoming a net source of the warming gas. However the study found that this wasn’t the case. They found that 10 types of North American trees, in artificially heated outdoor forest plots, adapted to higher temperatures without drastically boosting the amount of carbon produced by their leaves.  “Plants play less of a role than previously thought in speeding up global warming through accelerated respiratory carbon dioxide emissions,” lead author Peter Reich of the University of Minnesota told an online news conference. “Given the number of plants on Earth this is a big deal,” he said of their role in the carbon cycle. Plants aren’t bothered by warmer weather and adapt to changing conditions.  Who would ever have imagined it?,  \n",
      "The Swedish government is showing their commitment to green principles and fighting climate change by spending tax payer money on developing ‘meat’ made out of crickets and mealworms.[Vinnova, the Swedish government agency that distributes money for research and development, spending some 2.7 billion kronor (£230 million) a year has announced its latest tranche of funding for creating a greener, more sustainable future — by weaning Europe off meat. It is hoped people will want to eat a so-called “climate smart” diet instead, reports FriaTider. advertisement, Green activists and the United Nations are behind such political initiatives as ‘Meat Free Mondays’ — a gateway to full vegetarianism — which are based on the premise that meat consumption is driving man-made climate change. Another method to reduce that so-called burden on the earth is replacing meat protein with that harvested from insects instead. To that end, Vinnova is awarding half a million kronor each to fifteen different projects across the country, each of which tasked with creating an “edible prototype” of a new food. Among the mouth-watering projects being funded are an attempt to produce a “good and healthy product from mealworms which are fed on vegetable food scraps to become a climate friendly source of protein”, “food prototypes” made from “refined mealworms”, and mincemeat made out of “climate smart insects” such as crickets. Other enticing offerings not involving insects include “climate-fungal protein”, a “healthy vegetarian barbecue” made from by-products” and “fibrous raw materials”, and a “blue cheese-like product” made from beans. A competition in November will select the best product, with a potential of an extra two million kronor investment from the government to get the “food” off the ground. Speaking on the reasons for launching the initiative in their press release, Vinnova explains that insect-based nourishment will reduce food miles by encouraging interest in food grown in Sweden. They said: “Vinnova make an effort to develop climate-friendly proteins to help develop innovative, healthy and delicious food for the future, as an alternative to conventional meat production. “The projects can also increase the Swedish food industry’s competitiveness by products that are developed based on raw materials that can be produced cost-effectively in Sweden”. This is not the first time Sweden has attempted to kick-start interest in this food of the future. Last year the city of Stockholm launched a “climate-smart” cookbook which advocated insect larvae as an “environmentally friendly” pizza topping. According to press surrounding the release of the book “larvae tastes good! Freeze Dried caterpillars taste like cashew nuts with a gentle tone of the yolk”.\n",

Yet according to his CV he sits on the Climate Accountability Institute’s advisory board and has done since 2014. Porkie Number Two, Mann denied having called his fellow climate scientist and special witness, former Georgia Tech Judith Curry, a “denier”. “A number of statements have been attributed to me. I don’t believe I’ve called anybody a denier,” he solemnly told the hearing. To which Judith Curry, sitting next to him, replied: “It’s in your written testimony. Go read it again.”, You can watch the moment where Curry smacks him down below:, , Mann then proceeded indignantly to quibble that though he might have called Curry a “climate science denier” he hadn’t called her a “climate change denier”. [As if there’s any meaningful distinction between the two slurs]. But this claim – as Stephen McIntyre notes – was also a lie. confronted with written evidence that he called Curry “climate science denier”, Mann said he hadnt called her “climate CHANGE denier”. #FAKE pic.twitter.com/RfkPEu0lO9, — Stephen McIntyre (@ClimateAudit) March 29, 2017, , Porkie Number Three, Mann – busily trying to develop the case that climate scientists like himself are the innocent victims of vicious slurs – was asked whether he’d ever dismissed another of the expert witnesses on the panel, Roger Pielke Jr with the phrase “carnival barker”, “You’d have to provide me with the context. I don’t remember everything I have said or done,” said Mann. Here’s one example:, Mann said that he didn’t remember calling @RogerPielkeJr a “carnival barker”. But https://t.co/VTWr4eanrm pic.twitter.com/Ng3BGgVNiV, — Stephen McIntyre (@ClimateAudit) March 29, 2017, , And here’s Mann again using the insult – clearly a personal favourite – on Judith Curry:, Mann also called @curryja a “carnival barker” pic.twitter.com/hmDCRVb02c, — Stephen McIntyre (@ClimateAudit) March 29, 2017, , Porkie Number Four, Mann, in yet another bid to present himself as a persecuted martyr of anti-science Republicans, claimed that Joe Barton – the Chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee – had demanded all his “personal emails and correspondence with other scientists.”, This, again, was a lie. Barton had asked for Mann’s funding sources – which Mann, in his congressional testimony, said was fair game – but not for his personal emails. Here, once again, Steve McIntyre has the evidence. Mann: #fake claim tht Barton demanded “all of my personal emails and correspondence”. Barton: funding info,which Mann said “fair game” pic.twitter.com/5R8JBde3fb, — Stephen McIntyre (@ClimateAudit) March 29, 2017, , Michael Mann claims to be an expert on climate change and is frequently called on by official panels like this Congressional committee to speak on behalf of the scientific establishment.

      "Senators John McCain (R-AZ), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), and Susan Collins (R-ME) voted to keep an Obama-era climate rule limiting methane emissions from oil and natural gas drilling.[Forty-nine Republicans voted to abolish the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) rule, one vote short of passing through the Senate. Vice President Mike Pence stood ready at the Capitol to break the 50-50 tie. advertisement, Graham and Collins previously publicized their intention to vote against the legislation. McCain’s vote came as a surprise to Senate leadership. McCain said he voted against the bill because he fears that it would prevent the BLM from writing improved regulation in the future. “While I am concerned that the BLM rule may be onerous, passage of the resolution would have prevented the federal government, under any administration, from issuing a rule that is ‘similar,’ according to the plain reading of the Congressional Review Act,” McCain said in a statement. McCain added, “I believe that the public interest is best served if the Interior Department issues a new rule to revise and improve the BLM methane rule.”, The bill marks the first time Republicans failed to pass a Congressional Review Act (CRA) bill to repeal an Obama administration rule since President Donald Trump took office. Critics of the Obama-era rule argue that it adds unnecessary costs to oil and natural gas drilling in federal lands. Senator John Barrasso (R-WY) told reporters, “This was a very duplicative, unnecessary act of government interference in an area where BLM had no authority.”, Barrasso said that he will ask Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to repeal the rule instead of attempting to repeal the rule again in the Senate. “It was over-regulation by the Obama administration, and we tried to remove it with the Congressional Review Act. That fell one vote short today, and as a result we’ll call on the secretary to withdraw it.”, Secretary Zinke told Sen. Bob Portman (R-OH) that no matter the result for the CRA bill, the BLM will take action to reduce methane pollution. Erik Milito, an executive at the American Petroleum Institute, lamented:, While it is disappointing that the Senate did not act to correct the rule more quickly, we look forward to working with the administration on policies that continue our commitment to safely produce the energy that Americans rely on, help consumers, create jobs, strengthen our national security, and protect our environment. American Energy Alliance President Thomas Pyle issued a statement condemning the Senate’s inability to repeal the methane rule. He said:, The Senate just squandered an opportunity to protect American workers and families from a regulation aimed at making energy more expensive. The evidence against this regulation is overwhelming. Not only does this regulation fall outside of the BLM’s jurisdiction, but the energy sector is already significantly reducing methane emissions without this top-down directive from the federal government. The cost of complying with this regulation will ultimately fall on the shoulders of the American people. Fortunately, the fight isn’t over. It’s now up to the Trump administration to do what the Senate failed to do and protect the American people from this unnecessary and costly regulation. Despite the setback in the Senate, the Interior Department will attempt to repeal the rule through administrative action. Kate McGregor, the Interior Department’s acting secretary for land and minerals, said, regarding the methane rule, that the agency will “suspend, revise or rescind given its significant regulatory burden that encumbers American energy production, economic growth and job creation.”, The agency did not signal which option it might choose. McGregor cited Trump’s executive order asking agencies to repeal or change rules that damage domestic energy production. The Interior secretary added, “The rule is expected to have real and harmful impacts on onshore energy development and could impact state and local jobs and revenue. Small independent oil and gas producers in states like North Dakota, Colorado and New Mexico, which account for a substantial portion of our nation’s energy wealth, could be hit the hardest.”\n",

      "The president is expected to formally announce this week that the U.S. will exit the Paris climate agreement, a move that will have negligible impact on the environment but will have major benefits for the U.S. economy.[The Paris climate agreement was deeply flawed from its start. It was legally and constitutionally suspect, based on politics rather than science, and contained unrealistic goals. It promised not only a dramatic expansion of the administrative state and a huge increase in the regulatory burden on American businesses, it threatened to put the brakes on U.S. economic output at a time when most economists think the U.S. will struggle to achieve even a meager two percent growth. advertisement, It’s likely that it was already acting as a drag on the U.S. economy. After President Barack Obama unofficially committed the U.S. to the Paris agreement, businesses began preparing for its impact. Knowing that it would diminish U.S. economic output, businesses invested less and directed more investment toward less-productive technology to meet the climate deal’s mandates. Banks and financiers withdrew capital from sectors expected to suffer under the climate deal and pushed it toward those expected to benefit. A classic example of regulation-driven malinvestment. The Paris climate agreement was adopted on December 12, 2015 at the conclusion of the United Nation’s Climate Change Conference. Parties to the agreement are expected to begin taking measures to reduce emissions in 2020, mainly by enacting rules that sharply reduce carbon emissions. Countries are supposed to publicly announce “Intended Nationally Determined Contributions” to combat climate change and periodically report on their progress.  The Obama administration announced the U.S. would commit to reduce emissions by 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025, a quarter of which was supposedly achievable by the implementation of the previous administration’s legally-questionable Clean Power Plan. To get the rest of the way, the U.S. would have to make major investments in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and cleaner motor vehicles. This likely explains why the Paris climate deal was so popular with many in Silicon Valley and many on Wall Street. It promised a bonanza of spending and investment, most likely subsidized by taxpayers, in technologies that wouldn’t otherwise be attractive. It was practically calling out for making self-driving, solar powered cars mandatory. Dropping out of the agreement will let the U.S. avoid several deleterious effects of the agreement. The Paris deal was, in short, a disaster for America and a nothing-burger for climate.  \n",

      "Between 2010 and 2013 residents of the states surrounding the Great Lakes were told that climate change was permanently altering their environment and the record low water levels being recorded in the lakes may be the new normal. But now, only three years later, news reports are worried about beach erosion because the lakes have rebounded to record high levels of water.[This week, throughout the Chicago media landscape, as well as in reports in Michigan and Wisconsin, stories about a loss of swimming areas on public beaches are filling airwaves and newspaper pages. Residents and city officials are warning citizens that water levels in Lake Michigan and the other lakes are so high that the shallow swimming areas have been reduced as the water rises. Reports are also express worry over beach erosion and fears that the rising water is a danger to other infrastructure like roads. advertisement, In Chicago, DNAInfro.com, for instance, notes that water levels have risen a whopping four feet since 2013 and the new water is “swallowing up beaches.”, According to the Army Corps of Engineers, the water has risen 15 inches higher than this time last year and may rise another six inches before the summer heat starts its cycle of evaporation. The Chicago Tribune reports that the northern suburb of Evanston is losing beachfront property. “All our beaches are shrinking,” Evanston parks director Lawrence Hemingway said. For its part, Chicago’s Fox affiliate worries that the city’s lakeshore bike path is being destroyed by the higher water levels. The Detroit Free Press also noted that the high water is erasing beaches and the water is at highs not seen since the 1990s. Lake Michigan, of course, isn’t the only lake rising. As a report from April about Lake Huron points out, all the lakes are rising. But even as these news outlets are shocked and concerned about the record high levels of water filling the Great Lakes to overflowing today, only a few short years ago these same sort of news outlets were worried that the lakes were irreversibly shrinking and that climate change was desolating both commerce and the environment. In 2013, for instance, Chicago’s Public Television WTTW bemoaned a “dramatic” change in the climate that was warming the lakes, lowering water levels, and threatening to destroy commerce and the environment. The local PBS story also went national as the PBS Newshour ran stories on the environmental disaster the lakes were experiencing. In 2012 National Geographic sonorously warned that the “climate-related trend” was on the verge of laying waste to the region. Crain’s Detroit was also writing in 2013 that communities living on the edges of the region’s monumental bodies of water were going to have to “adapt” to the new normal of climate change. Naturally, far left sources were absolutely sure that global warming was drying up the lakes. In 2013 far left website Think Progress worried its readers with claims that climate change was “damaging” the lakes and would present “implications for the environment and the economy.”, The Natural Resource Defense Council even contemplated lawsuits to prevent cities on the lakes from tapping into them as a source of water. On the other hand, less alarmist stories noted that the water level was affected by things other than global warming. In 2013 USA Today properly noted that some of the water drop was a result of the massive dredging campaigns launched by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, a project meant to allow shipping and transportation to more easily ply the waters of the Great Lakes. Still, it is amazing to see the difference in coverage. Today, with water levels hitting record highs, news reporters and city officials worry over their loss of beachfront property and not a word is mentioned of climate change. Yet only three years ago the same officials and news reporters were sure that climate change was here to stay and we’d better get used to the shrunken Great Lakes.

      "MOST POPULAR[During Saturday’s Weekly Address, President Obama stated, “the threat of climate change means that protecting our public lands and waters is more important than ever. Rising temperatures could mean no more glaciers in Glacier National Park. No more Joshua Trees in Joshua Tree National Park. Rising seas could destroy vital ecosystems in the Everglades, even threaten Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty.”, advertisement, Transcript as Follows:, “Hi everybody. Earlier this summer, Michelle, Malia, Sasha and I headed west—to the national parks at Carlsbad Caverns and Yosemite. And I’ve got to say, it was a breath of fresh air. We explored hundreds of feet underground, standing beneath dripping stalactites in New Mexico. We hiked up a misty trail next to a waterfall in California. And I even took a few pictures of my own – not bad, right?, But the truth is, no camera – especially one with me behind it – can fully capture the beauty and majesty of America’s national parks. From Glacier and Denali to Gettysburg and Seneca Falls, our more than 400 parks and other sites capture our history and our sense of wonder. As FDR once said: ‘There is nothing so American as our national parks… the fundamental idea behind the parks… is that the country belongs to the people.’, This month, we’re celebrating the 100th anniversary of the National Park Service. And I want to encourage all of you to ‘Find Your Park’ so that you and your family can experience these sacred places, too. If you’re a military family, you can even get in free through Michelle and Jill Biden’s Joining Forces initiative. And if you’ve got a fourth grader in your family, you can get a free pass, too, by going to EveryKidInAPark.org. I hope you do. Because all across the country, the National Park Service is preparing for a big year. We’re revitalizing a grove of giant Sequoias in Yosemite repairing the Lincoln Memorial and enhancing the iconic entrance to our first national park at Yellowstone. As President, I’m proud to have built upon America’s tradition of conservation. We’ve protected more than 265 million acres of public lands and waters – more than any administration in history. We’ve recovered endangered wildlife species and restored vulnerable ecosystems. We’ve designated new monuments to Cesar Chavez in California, the Pullman porters in Chicago, and the folks who stood up for equality at Stonewall in New York – to better reflect the full history of our nation. And we’ve got more work to do to preserve our lands, culture, and history. So we’re not done yet. As we look ahead, the threat of climate change means that protecting our public lands and waters is more important than ever. Rising temperatures could mean no more glaciers in Glacier National Park. No more Joshua Trees in Joshua Tree National Park. Rising seas could destroy vital ecosystems in the Everglades, even threaten Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty. So in the coming years and decades, we have to have the foresight, and the faith in our future, to do what it takes to protect our parks and protect our planet for generations to come. Because these parks belong to all of us. And they’re worth celebrating – not just this year, but every year. Thanks everybody. Have a great weekend.

      "Two pieces of excellent news from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) show that incoming administrator Scott Pruitt is doing the Lord’s work.[First, he has come clean and said what he should have ‘fessed up to a while back: he doesn’t believe in the Carbon Fairy. advertisement, Asked his views on the role of carbon dioxide, the heat-trapping gas produced by burning fossil fuels, in increasing global warming, Mr. Pruitt said on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” that “I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do and there’s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact, so, no, I would not agree that it’s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see.”, That phrase, “the heat-trapping gas produced by burning fossil fuels,” is just a bit of New York Times editorializing, by the way. No serious person thinks that man-made carbon dioxide poses any kind of major climate threat because there’s just no evidence to support that theory. It’s just one of those cherished left-liberal myths that goes next to other fantasy concepts like “equality,” “sustainability,” and “social justice.”, Speaking of which, the second piece of good news is that the Environmental Protection Agency has just lost its head of Environmental Justice. Probably you didn’t know that the EPA had a head of Environmental Justice, but you should because you’ve been paying his salary since the George H.W. Bush era. His name is Mustafa Ali, and, according to a tearful requiem in Inside Climate, he has resigned in protest at EPA budget cuts, which will see the agency lose 20 percent of its 15,000 staff and $2 billion from its $8 billion. “Jumped before he was pushed” is the phrase that comes to mind, for it is likely that Ali’s department will be dismantled altogether. Ali has written a resignation letter to Scott Pruitt saying what a mistake this would be. But if you go to the EPA’s website and see what the Environmental Justice Department has been doing for the last few years, you may disagree with this assessment. Check out this page About EJ 2020. By the end, you’ll have no more idea what the Environmental Justice Department does than you did at the beginning. Here’s a taste:, Through EJ 2020, EPA will advance our environmental justice efforts to a new level in improving the health and environment of overburdened communities. By 2020, we will:, Our vision of how EPA will make a difference in the environmental and public health landscape over the next five years is detailed on the key results page of the plan. It is, as I think you’ll agree, pure gibberish. How do you measure this department’s success in advancing the cause of “environmental justice”? Well, of course, you don’t. You can’t because “environmental justice” is a nebulous concept, which can mean pretty much anything you want it to mean. Reading between the lines, though, what you can guess is that it’s basically another race-guilt make-work scheme. It’s based on the (spurious, identity-politics-driven) notion that environmental problems are felt more keenly by people of color because they live in poorer areas more vulnerable to pollution. Well, George H.W. Bush fell for it, clearly: it was under his administration in 1992 that the department was inaugurated. Not so, thank heavens, Donald Trump. If you’re in any doubt that this was a department ripe for deep-sixing, listen to the sad words of former EPA administrator Gina McCarthy:, “I am heartbroken that Mustafa feels that his time of productivity in the agency has passed,” McCarthy said in an interview. “He managed the interagency working group on environmental justice,” she said, referring to a conclave of federal agencies that met to discuss common concerns. “So when I say we brought actions and strategies to the table, it wasn’t just EPA, it was throughout the federal government.”, Did any of these people do anything useful with all that taxpayer money they’ve been getting? Ever??\n",
      "White House economic advisor Gary Cohn made the curious comment in Sicily on Friday that President Donald Trump’s views on climate change were “evolving.”[It was not clear exactly what that meant. “Evolution” could mean moving towards the alarmist consensus of the left — or it could also mean toward a skeptical view, one more carefully informed by scientific and economic reality. advertisement, In political terms, “evolving” is usually a term used by the left, a euphemism to describe when a politician has changed his or her position. Its most significant use was in regards to President Barack Obama’s views on gay marriage, which were said to have “evolved” from outright Christian opposition to full-throated liberal embrace. Like the term “progressive,” the term “evolution” implies an improvement in moral and intellectual terms, from prejudice and ignorance to reason and enlightenment. The left, presuming that its own views are superior, and that the “long arc of history” bends in its direction, expects people to “evolve” in its direction. What was stranger were Cohn’s words explaining how Trump is said to be evolving. The president, he said, was becoming “smarter” and becoming “more knowledgeable” about the issue. Again, that could mean Trump is growing skeptical of the alarmist, non-scientific view around which our public debate on climate change revolves. (In obtaining a degree in environmental science and public policy from Harvard, for instance, I became more knowledgeable about the problems in modeling climate — problems that have not improved much since then, despite the radical advances in computer technology and data analysis.), It is also possible that Cohn was shaping his assessment of the president’s views to flatter his largely European audience, which believes in climate change the way people on other continents believe in religion. That flattery may have been appropriate, for diplomatic reasons. What defies explanation is why he would imply that his boss had previously been less “smart” about the issue, or less well informed. It is the kind of comment that tends to reinforce the false narrative the media spins about every single Republican president — i.e. that he is stupid. It is also a comment that carries considerable political risk. Conservatives resent being told, usually by leftists, that their generally skeptical views on climate change are poorly informed, or “denialist.” Often, the leftists making such accusations cannot actually explain themselves how climate change is presumed to take place, and never consider a view other than their own. For now, conservatives continue to hold out hope that the president “evolves” the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement and toward a more sensible policy that uses innovation in energy technology to harness domestic resources of all kinds, and grow the U.S. economy while reducing emissions.

      "A leading skeptical scientist has reported that seven shots were fired at his workplace during the weekend’s Earth Day and March for Science events — likely as a threat and warning.[Dr Roy Spencer, meteorologist and noted climate skeptic at the University of Huntsville, Alabama, reports at his website that the shots were aimed at the office of his colleague and fellow sceptic, Dr John Christy:, advertisement, A total of seven shots were fired into our National Space Science and Technology Center (NSSTC) building here at UAH over the weekend. All bullets hit the 4th floor, which is where John Christy’s office is (my office is in another part of the building). Given that this was Earth Day weekend, with a March for Science passing right past our building on Saturday afternoon, I think this is more than coincidence. When some people cannot argue facts, they resort to violence to get their way. It doesn’t matter that we don’t “deny global warming” the fact we disagree with its seriousness and the level of human involvement in warming is enough to send some radicals into a tizzy. Our street is fairly quiet, so I doubt the shots were fired during Saturday’s march here. It was probably late night Saturday or Sunday for the shooter to have a chance of being unnoticed. Maybe the “March For Science” should have been called the “March To Silence”. Campus and city police say they believe the shots were fired from a passing car, based upon the angle of entry into one of the offices. Shell casings were recovered outside. The closest distance a passing car would have been is 70 yards away. Both Spencer and Christy have long incurred the wrath of climate alarmists for the work they do debunking the junk science behind the global warming scare. What they have shown is that the “global warming” recorded by accurate satellite measurements is considerably less dramatic than that shown on the heavily adjusted earth surface temperature datasets preferred by climate alarmists. Christy has made himself especially unpopular by testifying in Congress last month that the climate establishment is corrupt and untrustworthy and that a Red Team needs to be created to correct false “Consensus Science.”, He told Congress:, I’ve often stated that climate science is a “murky” science. We do not have laboratory methods of testing our hypotheses as many other sciences do. As a result what passes for science includes, opinion, arguments-from-authority, dramatic press releases, and fuzzynotions of consensus generated by preselected groups. This is not science. I noticed the House passed an amendment last year to de-fund the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC.) We know from Climategate emails and many other sources that the IPCC has had problems with those who take different positions on climate change than what the IPCC promotes. There is another way to deal with this however. Since the IPCC activity is funded by US taxpayers, then I propose that five to ten percent of the funds be allocated to a group of well-credentialed scientists to produce an assessment that expresses legitimate, alternative hypotheses that have been (in their view) marginalized, misrepresented or ignored in previous IPCC reports (and thus EPA and National Climate Assessments). Such activities are often called “Red Team” reports and are widely used in government and industry. This is not, it would appear, a message that those in the Climate Change industry — sometimes known as the Climate Industrial Complex or the Green Blob —want to hear. Especially not the more extreme elements, it seems.\n",
      "An expedition to the North Pole intended to measure the effects of global warming ground to a halt this month when the scientist’s ship got blocked by the ice packs near Murmansk, Russia, reports reveal.[The Polar Ocean Challenge set out on a two-month campaign hoping to prove that the ice at the North Pole was melting. As the expedition’s website explains, the group aimed to show “that the Arctic sea ice coverage shrinks back so far now in the summer months that sea that was permanently locked up now can allow passage through.”, advertisement, Despite their best intentions to show that the ice is melting and the temperature at the pole is higher than normal, the group has only been confronted with the exact opposite as ice continues to block their path. The website Real Climate Science notes that the Polar melt season is half over, but temperatures have not climbed high enough to sponsor a large melt off of ice. According to the site, there has not been a big melt, and ice gains seem to be very close to the amount of ice lost because temperatures near the pole have been persistently below normal this year. And at the very least, large ice floes have blocked the ocean passages around the area. The global warming expedition expected to be able to sail all around the Arctic Ocean through the Northeast and Northwest Passages because they assumed the ice would be gone, but they have been stymied because ice blocks most of the route they planned to take.

Which is why this week both a leading U.S. scientist and a number of top Senate Republicans have had to urge the president to see sense and ignore the siren voices urging him to stay in the UN’s Paris climate agreement. advertisement, The 20 top Republicans, led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., have signed a letter warning the president that remaining in Paris “would subject the United States to significant litigation risk that could up-end your administration’s ability to fulfill its goal of rescinding the Clean Power Plan.”, Meanwhile, the distinguished physicist Will Happer – long mooted as a possible Science Advisor in the Trump administration – has argued that staying in Paris will not only be pointless but will be a betrayal of Trump’s election promise to voters that he would pull out. Climate policy, however, poses a grave threat. Yes, those who engineered the Paris Agreement will be upset if the United States withdraws. Withdrawal will also outrage the many who profit from climate alarmism. But remaining in the Paris Agreement will not sit well with many of those who voted for Mr. Trump in part because of his campaign promises to withdraw from the agreement. These voters rightly perceived that the agreement would benefit a privileged international elite, at the expense of the common people of the United States and of the rest of the world. You might think that such interventions ought to be unnecessary. President Trump is, after all, an avowed climate skeptic who has already taken several important steps towards tackling the Green Blob, most recently by promising to eliminate “nearly $1.6 billion in international programs aimed at promoting green energy and fighting global warming.”, Among the targets on his hit list: the United Nations’ Green Climate Fund (GCF), which hands out money for programs to adapt or mitigate global warming the Clean Technology Fund and the Strategic Climate Fund – saving $239 million and the Global Climate Change Initiative, saving U.S. taxpayers $362 million. But Trump is still wavering over the Paris climate agreement, which senior members of his administration, including Jared Kushner, daughter Ivanka, and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson are urging him not to quit. Anyone puzzled by the fact that the former CEO of Exxon is supporting an agreement totally opposed to the company’s business model and shareholder interests really needs to read this eye-opening piece by Steve Milloy. Exxon, Milloy explains, like most Big Oil companies has effectively been hijacked by green activists. As described in George Washington University professor Jarol B. Manheim’s 2004 book “Biz-War and the Out-of-Power Elite: The Progressive Attack on the Corporation,” left-wing political activists met and decided after the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980 that one way back to political power was to become activist shareholders in publicly owned corporations. That is, they would exercise the rights and status of shareholders to pressure, if not, capture corporate managements so as to use corporate resources and influence to help achieve their political agenda. It has been an enormously successful strategy for the activists, especially when it comes to the controversy over climate change. Not only do many of the largest and best-known publicly-owned corporations now openly advocate for climate policies, even oil and gas companies have been pressured into pursuing policies that militate against their own products. This is one of the many disastrous side effects of the growing power of the green blob: it is stopping businesses from doing business, making everyone poorer as a result. As Milton Friedman famously wrote in 1970: “There is one and only one social responsibility of business — to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits so long as it stays within the rules of the game, which is to say, engages in open and free competition without deception or fraud.”, So businesses serve as society’s wealth generators. They are not governments, charities, or activist groups. When it comes to climate, Exxon Mobil’s job is to create wealth via production and sale of oil and gas — not to participate in the dubious pursuit of returning the atmosphere to pre-Industrial Revolution conditions. Amen, bro. Mr President – jobs, the economy and the American way are in peril here. Are you listening?\n",

The WWF has done even better out of this cosy relationship. In the same period, as Richard North has reported, it manage to grab itself €53,813,343 (over £40 million) for its services to itself and the EU empire. So, between them, the WWF and the RSPB have been snaffling £10 million a year from the EU – as a reward for all the lobbying they do on its behalf. But at least, in return for all this money, we get a safer, cleaner environment, right?, Not necessarily. In fact, I’d say almost certainly not. The WWF and the RSPB parted company with the interests of the environment and nature quite some time ago – as I’ll explain in my next piece.

      "On Monday, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the American Energy Alliance, and 38 other prominent conservative groups urged Donald Trump to withdraw from the Paris climate treaty.[The letter outlines how the Paris agreement would act contrary to President Trump’s energy agenda and does not act in the best interest of the American people. advertisement, “The Paris Climate Treaty is an all pain for no gain agreement that will produce no measurable climate benefits and exacerbate energy poverty around the globe,” said Myron Ebell, director of CEI’s Center for Energy and Environment and former head of Trump’s EPA transition team. “The Paris treaty undermines American democracy and allows foreign bureaucrats to determine the direction of U.S. domestic economic and energy policy. Its main goal is to build a green industrial complex on the backs of American consumers and taxpayers.”, The conservative coalition argues that the Paris treaty does not allow for the Trump White House to renegotiate or lower the United States’ agreement to reduce the usage of fossil fuels, but instead would require more ambitious commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions every five years in perpetuity. Further, the free-market groups argue that remaining in the Paris agreement while eliminating Obama’s climate agenda would subject key parts of the Trump’s deregulatory agenda to unnecessary legal risk. “Remaining in the Paris Climate Treaty would undermine the Trump administration’s efforts to protect American families from unnecessary and burdensome climate regulations,” said Thomas Pyle, president of the American Energy Alliance and former head of Trump’s DOE transition team. The Paris agreement would bind countries to cut greenhouse emissions on a country-by-country basis. Obama committed the United States to reduce carbon emissions by at least 26 percent by 2025. Conservatives contend that Trump promised to withdraw from the Paris agreement on the campaign trail and that the political fallout of not withdrawing from the accord would be devastating. Mike McKenna, a conservative energy lobbyist said, “This is a campaign promise — a specific promise the president made repeatedly. He’s not just going to be able to walk away from it.”, Senior White House adviser Steve Bannon and Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt argued against staying in the Paris agreement. White House advisers Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson argue that the United States should remain in the Paris agreement. “The treaty is based on the idea that from now on developed nations like the U.S. must live with less and pay more. That is not the American way,” said Pyle. “President Trump’s ‘America First’ energy plan is about making energy more affordable and giving Americans more say over their energy choices. The Paris treaty stands in the way of achieving that goal. It’s time for President Trump to fulfill the promise he made to the American worker and withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Climate Treaty.”​, Read the letter here:\n",

      "Increased “extreme weather events” caused by man-made global warming are an alarmist myth, a study shows.[In fact, contradicting claims by the Royal Society, the National Academy of Sciences and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, there was more “extreme weather” in the first half of the 20th Century than the second half. advertisement, Hence the title chosen by the paper’s author Cambridge Professor of Engineering Mike Kelly : Trends In Extreme Weather Events Since 1900 – An Enduring Conundrum For Wise Policy Advice. Here is the abstract:, It is widely promulgated and believed that human-caused global warming comes with increases in both the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. A survey of official weather sites and the scientific literature provides strong evidence that the first half of the 20th century had more extreme weather than the second half, when anthropogenic global warming is claimed to have been mainly responsible for observed climate change. The disconnect between real-world historical data on the 100 years’ time scale and the current predictions provides a real conundrum when any engineer tries to make a professional assessment of the real future value of any infrastructure project which aims to mitigate or adapt to climate change. What is the appropriate basis on which to make judgements when theory and data are in such disagreement?, The ‘Conundrum’ – as Kelly politely and restrainedly puts it – is very simply this. All the “experts” have been telling us that extreme weather has been increasing as a result of global warming caused by man-made carbon emissions. But all the historical data shows otherwise. As Kelly demonstrates, there were more extreme changes of warming and cooling in the late 19th and early 20th century, more extreme precipitation, deadlier hurricanes, worse tornadoes, and more damaging floods than there were in the second half of the Twentieth century. Also, he notes, there were many more extreme weather related deaths in the first half of the Twentieth century than the second half. Kelly drily concludes that from an engineering point of view (his particular field of expertise), making exaggerated and misleading claims about increasing climate disaster makes no economic sense. Over-adaptation that is not needed leaves clients free to sue advisors if the problems have been oversold and the costs of protection prove to have been excessive, even on a 20-year basis. Unsurprisingly, Kelly reports that he had great difficulty getting his study published in any of the mainstream scientific journals, none of which welcomed this rejection of the fashionable “extreme weather” orthodoxy. He writes:, The story of getting it published is worth a paper on its own – I tried the usual suspects but they were not interested in anything challenging.  In one journal they tried 12 regional editors, none of whom would touch it, and I was told that I had to find an editor to take it any further.  The would not reject it, nor would they process it – it is in limbo.  In another it languished without comment for 3 months, so I resubmitted and another three months later nothing had happened to either submission!  I gave up and went to an on-line journal. But then, Kelly is not popular with the alarmist establishment. Last year, he spoke out against the debasement of the Royal Society (of which he is a Fellow, one of 43 dissenters who wrote to complain about its stance on “global warming”), under left-wing, climate activist presidents like Paul Nurse. Those who fail to provide balance are not giving advice, but lobbying. It is with the deepest regret that I must now state that this is the role which has been adopted by the Royal Society. And when scientists abandon neutral inquiry for lobbying, they jeopardise their purpose and integrity.  ,  \n",
      "Ten years on from his overrated, pimped up powerpoint lecture An Inconvenient Truth, eco-huckster Al Gore is trying to tell anyone who’ll still listen how he (almost) singlehandedly saved the world from ManBearPig.[And some of them actually believe him, like the fawning journalist who wrote this Wired interview. advertisement, Yet this year Gore and his fellow activists have a rare reason to celebrate. In April, 175 world leaders gathered at the United Nations to sign the Paris Agreement, a global pact that aims to keep global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. Now, a decade after his movie sounded the alarm about climate change and 16 years after he ran for president, it looks like Al Gore might finally be … winning?, Gore is understandably eager to agree that yes, all those airmiles he’s racked up in his private jet, flying back and forth across the world lecturing people on how to rein in their carbon-guzzling lifestyles, really have made a difference. It really does. Sometimes in sports you can sense a palpable shift in the momentum of the contest. A team will be behind on the scoreboard, but the shift in momentum is so obvious and dramatic that you just have the feeling they’re going to win. That’s where we are in solving the climate crisis. We’re still behind on the scoreboard, but the momentum has shifted. We are winning. Really? Not according to this brutal new assessment of the Paris climate talks by a leading expert on international law produced for the Global Warming Policy Foundation. Professor David Campbell of Lancaster University Law School says that the Paris Climate Agreement is nothing more than a blank cheque that allows China and India to burn as much carbon dioxide as they like in pursuit of economic growth. It will do little if anything to secure a reduction in global CO2 emissions – not least because it gives the world’s biggest polluter a free pass. Everyone involved in the climate negotiations knew this all along. China and India were never going to sign without this let out clause. But it suited the COP21 organizers not to mention this embarrassing detail when crowing about the success of their summit. The devil lies in Article 4 (7) of the Paris agreement:, The extent to which developing country Parties will effectively implement their commitments under the Convention. . .will take fully into account that economic and social development and poverty eradication are the first and overriding priorities of the developing country Parties. Both India and China count as “developing” countries. What this subclause means is that no matter what commitments they may make to reduce their CO2 emissions, these must take second place to economic growth. So basically they can produce as much CO2 as they like without being in breach of the Paris Agreement. No wonder they put up so little resistance. Professor Campbell reserves the most scathing part of his report for the UK government, especially its Committee on Climate Change. The Committee on Climate Change is the cadre of environmental zealots – several with interests in the renewables industry – led by Lord Deben, whose raison d’etre is to ensure that the UK government cleaves to its carbon reduction commitments, as set out by the disastrous Climate Change Act. But the advice the Committee is giving the government, Professor Campbell argues, is technically and scientifically unsound. It has previously claimed:, The UN has formally adopted an objective to limit warming to 2◦C and is working towards an agreement aimed at peaking and reducing emissions consistent with this goal. . .Progress towards a global deal has been slow but broadly as expected. The key challenge is to get agreement on global emissions pathways to 2030 compatible with achieving the climate objective. The Durban Platform provides the opportunity to address this challenge, with the aim that agreement is reached in Paris by the end of 2015. Recently it restated this alleged 2◦C objective, claiming it had been endorsed by the Paris Agreement. This, Professor Campbell notes, is “completely wrong”, represents a “profound misunderstanding” of the Paris Agreement, and thus represents “extremely poor” advice.\n",

      "The publisher of the New York Times is personally reaching out to former subscribers who canceled their subscriptions over the paper’s decision to hire conservative columnist Bret Stephens.[Publisher Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr. sent an email Friday afternoon to former subscribers who specifically mentioned Stephens as the reason they canceled their subscriptions but still opted in to receive messages from the Times, Politico reported. advertisement, “Our customer care team shared with me that your reason for unsubscribing from the New York Times included our decision to hire Bret Stephens as an Opinion columnist. I wanted to provide a bit more context,” Sulzberger began the letter. Less than six percent of readers who cancelled their subscriptions to the Times listed Stephens as a reason for dropping their subscriptions, according to a Times spokesman. Stephens, a former Wall Street Journal columnist and critic of President Trump, got slammed by Times readers after he penned his first column questioning the validity of the science behind climate change. The column led to complaints from various progressives on Twitter, a Change.org petition demanding the paper rescind Stephens’ job offer, canceled subscriptions, and a public editor column devoted to responding to readers’ complaints about Stephens. Sulzberger said in the letter that it is important that readers recognize the difference between news and opinion while noting that NYT Executive Editor Dean Baquet “has sharply expanded the team of reporters and editors who cover climate change.”, The publisher mentioned several recent Times articles on climate change, such as one article that suggested climate change caused rising waters in China, and then encouraged readers to “sign up for a free newsletter” from the “climate desk” for news about the subject. “The Times’s Opinion pages remain an independent and unblinking forum for debate from a wide range of viewpoints among open-minded, informed writers and readers. I don’t think, in these polarizing and partisan times, there’s anything quite like it in American journalism,” Sulzberger wrote. He added that with so many people “talking past each other about how best to address climate change,” he hoped that exposing people to different viewpoints on the subject will encourage people to work together to come up with bipartisan solutions. Sulzberger, however, still maintains that the paper will only publish certain points of view over others. “This does not mean that the Times will publish any commentary. Some points of view are not welcome, including those promoting prejudice or denying basic truths about our world. But it does mean that, in the coming years, we aim to further enrich the quality of our debate with other honest and intelligent voices, including some currently underrepresented in our pages,” he wrote.\n",
      "In a logic-defying leap of reason, a several journals and news outlets have accused Donald Trump of “environmental racism” by pulling the United States out of the Paris climate accord.[As Breitbart News reported earlier, President Trump has already been blamed for a “war on the environment” tantamount to genocide. Now, his critics have upped the ante, projecting a nefarious racial tone onto the President’s decision. advertisement, Essence magazine said that Donald Trump had continued “his war on people of color in America” when he announced the United States would withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord. Blavity, a website that caters to people of color, said that Trump’s decision “will worsen environmental racism,” insisting that climate change is “inherently a black issue and not just a ‘human issue.’”, The Atlantic went so far as to suggest that environmental racism is “the new Jim Crow,” referring to laws that segregated blacks and whites in their use of public schools, public places, transportation, restrooms and restaurants. Since it may not be evident to readers how a refusal to bind America to a certain level of carbon dioxide emissions constitutes racism, these same outlets have helpfully connected the dots, explaining how neglect of environmental concerns is an attack on blacks. “If Climate Change persist (sic), and the world’s average temperature rises more than two degrees Celsius,” Blavity writer Dominic A. Williams contends, “it would mean widespread extinctions, changing weather patterns, droughts, strong storms, rising sea levels and consequently the disappearance of coastal cities, and a plethora of not yet realized consequences.”, These man-made disasters, Williams insists, will disproportionately affect people of color. Environmental Racism, he writes, “can be described as a lack of access to healthy environments and disproportionate exposure to pollutants. This means that predominantly black neighborhoods are more likely to suffer from polluted air and water than white neighborhoods.”, As Breitbart News noted earlier this week, the Paris climate accord has nothing whatsoever to do with “polluted air and water” and only seeks to regulate the emissions of carbon dioxide, a colorless, odorless, non-toxic gas that is a part of a healthy environment. Be that as it may, Williams eventually gets to the real bone of contention. “In addition to causing health crisis,” he argues, “Climate Change will cause meteorological disasters that will decimate vulnerable black neighborhoods. The warming of Earth will cause super-storms, such as Hurricane Katrina, to occur quite regularly.”, “While climate change will affect everyone on this planet, marginalized groups will always be the ones who suffer the most,” he adds. “Environmental issues, for that reason, are inherently black issues.”, In the minds of Dominic A. Williams and other key critics of “environmental racism,” a person doesn’t need to have race in mind to be a racist. If one’s actions intentionally or unintentionally affect black people, they constitute racism. The odd thing is, these same authors are silent about a national disaster that does affect blacks far more than whites, actually causing a disproportionate number of black deaths and the decimation of the black population. This is the legally sanctioned practice of abortion. The rate of abortion among blacks is far higher than among whites, with 365 black babies aborted for every 1,000 that are born. While blacks account for roughly 38% of all abortions in the country, they represent only 13 percent of the population, statistics that have led black Christian leaders to speak of a “black genocide” occurring at the hands of abortionists. In New York City, for instance, in recent years there were more abortions among black women in the city than there were black babies born. Both nationally and in New York City, the abortion rates among black women are significantly higher than among any other demographic group.

      "President Donald Trump gave a shout-out to the “forgotten” industrial heartland that delivered him the White House as he announced America’s unilateral withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accords Thursday.[“I was elected to help the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris,” Trump told those gathered in the White House Rose Garden, as he gave a forceful economic-nationalist condemnation of the global climate agreement, under which the United States is to meet progressively lower caps on certain emissions while subsidizing developing countries in the hope they do the same. advertisement, “This agreement is less about the climate and more about other countries gaining a financial advantage over the United States, ” Trump explained. Citing a comprehensive report by NERA Economic Consulting, Trump laid out the economic disadvantage that would befall American workers, especially those in the Appalachian energy industries and the Midwestern industrial heartland. That report, for example, envisions a potential 86% reduction in American coal output and a 38% reduction in iron and steel production by 2040 if the Paris Agreement’s targets were actually met. According to Trump, apparently citing the MAGICC/SCENGEN climate model, the most climate activists could hope to gain from America’s dearly bought reductions in carbon dioxide emissions is  0.2 degrees Celsius less warming over the rest of the century. This did not stop the political left from accusing the President of “telling the Earth to drop dead,” by pulling out of the Obama-brokered climate accord. Trump cast doubt on the lofty goals supposedly motivating the accord, pointing out how it allows to China, India, and even Europe to continue to ramp up coal production while placing incredible burdens on our own domestic industry. “In short the agreement doesn’t eliminate coal jobs, it just transfers those jobs out of America … and ships them to foreign countries,” he told the crowd. “The current agreement effectively blocks development of clean coal in America.”, At several points, Trump took the opportunity to highlight the economic benefits he claims have already returned to the heartland since his election. “And the mines are starting to open up. Having a big opening in two weeks. Pennsylvannia, Ohio, West Virginia, so many places. A big opening of a brand new mine, it’s unheard of. For many many years it hasn’t happened,” Trump said, referring to the Acosta Coal Mine due to open in Somerset County, PA amid the slew of mine openings announced across the rich energy region. Trump’s rejection of the the globalist economic paradigm underpinning agreements like the Paris accord became more explicit as the speech went on. “It would once have been unthinkable that an international agreement could prevent the United States from conducting its own domestic economic affairs. But this is the reality we face if we do not leave the agreement,” he said before making his appeal directly to the Midwestern voters who put him over the top in November. “It is time to put Youngstown, Ohio Detroit, Michigan and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, along with many other locations within our great country, before Paris, France,” Trump said. “It is time to make America great again.”, The President also promised that the withdrawal from the Paris Accord will not be the end of his economic-nationalist reexamination of America’s position in the international economic landscape. “Many trade deals will soon be under renegotiation.”\n",
      "Former President Barack Obama broke his silence again to criticize President Donald Trump for pulling the United States out of the Paris climate change agreement.[Obama criticized Trump’s decision as “an absence of American leadership” that moved the United States backward. advertisement, “Even as this Administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future I’m confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we’ve got,” he wrote in a statement. Obama recalled his “steady, principled” leadership on the climate change agreement and “bold American ambition” that convinced other countries to follow their lead. “The nations that remain in the Paris Agreement will be the nations that reap the benefits in jobs and industries created,” he said. Obama praised business interests for investing in green energy, but did not mention the government subsidies that made it possible.

      "Al Gore has issued a devastating riposte to President Trump’s Executive Order on Energy: he has unleashed the trailer for An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth To Power.[Unlike its creaky predecessor – basically an extended powerpoint lecture featuring crap animations of drowning polar bears and a fat, sweating, failed presidential candidate in a suit clambering up onto a hydraulic elevator to make some tendentious, whiney point about a graph – this sequel uses shock, awe and spectacular footage to bludgeon its audience into submission. advertisement, A maelstrom of brown, boiling floodwaters, calving glaciers, burning mountainsides and lashing tornadoes, Gore’s production team have pulled out the stops to create a propaganda movie so lavishly convincing it makes Triumph Of The Will look like Snakes On A Plane. At the heart of the movie is Gore himself – whose caring, nurturing, brow-furrowed sensitivity as he travels the world’s weather disaster zones to marvel at the damage done by man’s selfishness, greed and refusal-to-amend-his-lifestyle (TM) is contrasted with the smirking evil of the movie’s arch-villain, Donald J. Trump. Trump, of course, represents the “Power” to whom the heroic Gore figure is speaking “Truth.”, What is clear, though, even from the two-and-a-half-minute trailer, is that among the things left behind on the cutting room floor are science, integrity, and credibility. There is, for example, absolutely no evidence that man-made carbon dioxide has produced an increase in extreme weather events. In fact tornadoes, hurricanes, droughts, bitter winters and extreme precipitation have all either remained much the same or reduced since “global warming” began. So what Gore is doing here, in other words, is misleading his audience with weather horror porn of extreme events which have nothing at all to do with climate change. As for the prominently featured wind turbines and solar arrays – these are a blatant attempt to push the expensive, environmentally damaging, inefficient renewables to which green shysters like Gore are ideologically committed but which will make no difference to climate change. Their sole purpose is to enrich, at taxpayers’ expense, a few of the rent-seekers, troughers, crony-capitalists and other charlatans who are leeching off the back of this disgusting $1.5 trillion per annum scam. Follow the money: this is the real reason Gore has made this movie. And it’s the reason there has been such squealing objection to President Trump’s (actually quite disappointingly modest) attempts to take on the Climate Industrial Complex.

Leona Philpot, on the other hand, would provide less latency for users — since more than half of the world’s population is located near coastal waters — while using the sea it is submerged in for cooling. If connected to offshore renewable energy sources, the data center would be capable of doing all of this with zero emissions. The steel-clad data center was equipped with sensors to help it monitor environmental conditions during the test. Now that Microsoft has retrieved Leona, it is currently analyzing the results of the test — and the effects on the center itself — back at their Redmond headquarters. So Microsoft’s new data center is faster, more efficient, and potentially environmentally clean as a whistle. You’d think that everyone would be happy about this, right?, Wrong.

Tom Dowdall, one of the organization’s climate campaigners, claims, “Microsoft is far behind Apple, Google, and Facebook in sourcing renewable energy for existing data centers.”, Experimental underwater data centres could be more sustainable if connected to offshore wind power, but Microsoft must focus more on investing in new renewable energy now.

      "Current and former officials at the United Nations responded negatively to President Trump’s announcement Thursday that the U.S. is pulling out of the Paris climate accord — with one senior U.N. adviser calling Trump “an idiot” and a former climate envoy saying the U.S. is now “a rogue state.”[Jeffrey Sachs, an economist and senior adviser to the U.N. Secretary-General since 2002, told Bloomberg Television Friday that President Trump lives in a “dream world” and is an “idiot” for his decision to pull out of the treaty. He also blamed the decision on the left’s favorite boogeymen — the Koch Brothers. advertisement, “The president doesn’t know what he’s doing, this is obvious he’s an idiot,” he said. “But what’s happening behind here is real politics. This is the victory paid and carried out for 20 years by two people: David and Charles Koch.”, “This is all about the Koch brothers, I’m sorry to say it, they have bought and purchased the top of the Republican Party,” Sachs said, pointing also to House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s (R-KY) support of Trump’s position. Sach’s Koch claim is particularly unusual in that President Trump and the Koch Brothers have frequently clashed on a number of issues.

In April, he wrote a column titled: “Donald Trump’s Climate Fantasies.”, “In less than 100 days, we have learned that Trump is a man living in a fantasy world. He issues decrees, barks orders, sends out midnight Tweets, but to no avail. The facts – real ones, not his ‘alternative’ variety – keep intervening,” Sachs wrote. He has also called Trump a “non-stop font of lies” in a column in March. Sachs’ remarks come after a former U.N. special envoy on climate change, Mary Robinson, said the decision makes “a rogue state on the international stage.”, It isn’t the first time Robinson, a former president of Ireland, has made such remarks. In November, she said in a Reuters interview, “It would be a tragedy for the United States and the people of the United States if the U.S. becomes a kind of rogue country, the only country in the world that is somehow not going to go ahead with the Paris Agreement.”, Secretary-General Guterres was more restrained in his language, calling Trump’s decision “a major disappointment.”, “The decision by the United States to withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change is a major disappointment for global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote global security,” Guterres’ spokesman Stéphane Dujarric said in a statement Thursday. However, he remained optimistic and said he “looks forward to engaging with the American government and  all actors in the United States and around the world to build the sustainable future on which our grandchildren depend.”, Adam Shaw is a politics reporter for Breitbart News based in New York.

      "Executives from a rainforest charity that has been critical of the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation’s reported ties to a Malaysian embezzlement scheme were reportedly denied entry to the London premiere of the actor’s climate change documentary on Saturday night.[According to the Hollywood Reporter, Bruno Manser Funds executive director Lukas Straumann and campaign manager Johanna Michel were barred from entering the London Film Festival premiere of Before the Flood on Saturday at the Odeon in Leicester Square. advertisement, The two were reportedly rebuffed by security guards, despite having tickets to the screening. At a press conference in London on Friday, Straumann publicly called on the Oscar-winning Revenant star to return what his charity organization has termed “stolen money” to the Malaysian people, or else resign his position as the UN Messenger of Peace with a focus on climate change. The Bruno Manser Funds’ charity efforts center on rainforest preservation in the Southeast Asian country. “If DiCaprio is unwilling to come clean, we ask him to step down as UN Messenger of Peace for climate change, because he simply lacks the credibility for such an important role,” executive director Straumann said at the event. Earlier this summer, DiCaprio’s environmental-focused charity organization was the subject of a Hollywood Reporter exposé that claimed it received donations from funds misappropriated in the world’s largest embezzlement scheme. According to a Justice Department complaint, $238 million improperly taken from Malaysian sovereign wealth fund 1MDB went to fund the production of DiCaprio’s 2013 film The Wolf of Wall Street, for which the actor won a Golden Globe in the starring role. The studio behind the film, Red Granite Pictures, was co-founded by Riza Aziz, the step-son of the Malaysian prime minister and now a central figure in international investigations concerning the 1MDB fund. The exposé also alleged that figures connected to the embezzlement scheme donated artwork that was later auctioned off by the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation at its glitzy annual gala in St. Tropez, France. Since the exposé was released in August, pressure has mounted on DiCaprio to return what some have called the “ill-gotten” donations. The pressure comes as the actor has taken his National Geographic climate change documentary — in which he serves as narrator and tour guide — to film festivals around the world, including on the White House’s South Lawn for the inaugural SXSL festival earlier this month.  , Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum\n",

      "A high-level whistleblower at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has revealed that the organization published manipulated data in a major 2015 report on climate change in order to maximize impact on world leaders at the UN climate conference in Paris in 2015.[According to a report in The Mail on Sunday, NOAA scientist Dr. John Bates has produced “irrefutable evidence” that the NOAA study denying the “pause” in global warming in the period since 1998 was based on false and misleading data. advertisement, The NOAA study was published in June 2015 by the journal Science under the title “Possible artifacts of data biases in the recent global surface warming hiatus.”, Dr. Bates accused the lead author of the paper, Thomas Karl, of “insisting on decisions and scientific choices that maximized warming and minimized documentation.” Bates says that Karl did so “in an effort to discredit the notion of a global warming pause, rushed so that he could time publication to influence national and international deliberations on climate policy.”, Bates said that NOAA bypassed its own protocol, never subjecting the report to NOAA’s strict internal evaluation process. Rather, NOAA superiors rushed the study through in a “blatant attempt to intensify the impact” of the paper on the Paris meeting on climate change, he said. The “Pausebuster” paper produced by NOAA in 2015 was based on two new sets of temperature data—one measuring land temperatures and the other sea temperatures—both of which turned out to be flawed. According to reports, NOAA has now decided to replace the sea temperature dataset just 18 months after it was issued, because it used “unreliable methods which overstated the speed of warming.”, A reported increase in sea surface temperatures was due to upwards adjustments of readings from fixed and floating buoys to agree with water temperature measured by ships, according to Bates. Bates said that NOAA had good data from buoys but then “they threw it out and ‘corrected’ it by using the bad data from ships. You never change good data to agree with bad, but that’s what they did – so as to make it look as if the sea was warmer.”, The land temperature dataset, on the other hand, was the victim of software bugs that rendered its conclusions “unstable,” Bates said. Climate change skeptics have long insisted that scientists are susceptible to political and social pressures to produce the “right kind” of data to back up specific policy decisions. Dr. Duane Thresher, a climate scientist with a PhD from Columbia University and NASA GISS, has pointed to a “publication and funding bias” as a key to understanding how scientific consensus can be manipulated. Although scientists are held up as models of independent thinkers and unbiased seekers of truth, the reality is that they depend on funding even more than other professions, and will study what they are paid to study. The Obama administration, which persistently denied that a climate debate even existed, channeled billions of federal dollars into programs and studies that supported its claims, while silencing contrary opinions. Thomas Karl, the lead author on the Pausebuster paper, had a longstanding relationship with President Obama’s chief science adviser, John Holdren, giving him a “hotline to the White House.” Holdren was an ardent advocate of vigorous measures to curb emissions. “In reality, it’s the government, not the scientists, that asks the questions,” said David Wojick, an expert on climate research spending and a longtime government consultant. Federal agencies order up studies that focus on their concerns, so politics ends up guiding science according to its particular interests. “Government actions have corrupted science, which has been flooded by money to produce politically correct results,” said Dr. William Happer, professor emeritus of physics at Princeton University and a member of the National Academy of Sciences. “It is time for governments to finally admit the truth about global warming. Warming is not the problem. Government action is the problem,” he said. NOAA, the world’s leading source of climate data, not only produced a severely flawed study for political motives, it also mounted a cover-up when challenged over its data. Not long after the study’s publication, the US House of Representatives Science Committee initiated an inquiry into its claims that no pause in global warming had existed. NOAA refused to comply with subpoenas demanding internal emails and falsely claimed that no one had raised concerns about the paper internally. President Donald Trump has pledged he will withdraw from the Paris Agreement that binds signer countries to a series of stringent measures to lessen emissions. Follow Thomas D.

Truth be told, next January, on the occasion of Trump’s first year in office, if he has passed either a full-scale Obamacare repeal and replace measure or a major tax reform measure, that would be a reasonably good legislative record for a first year. This is not the New Deal or the Great Society, when there are huge filibuster-proof majorities in Congress and giant bills coming one after another. In today’s atmosphere and party alignments, Trump will do well to get one big thing passed. So on the 100 days, call the president an executive success. Click here for the rest of the article.\n",

Obama aides informed the Post that the president met the billionaire for lunch. In April, Ma became Asia’s richest man, overtaking the title from Wanda Group Co.’s Wang Jianlin, according to Bloomberg News. Obama interviewed Ma last year during the APEC CEO summit on the subject of climate change. “If we do not care about this Earth, we do not care about the water, food, environment, I think nobody can survive whether you’re big or small,” Ma said, urging all businesses to take environmental concerns seriously. “So this is the concern. This is the worry I have.”, During the interview, Obama praised Ma’s financial success. , “Jack, you have the benefit of having been on both sides of the equation — early entrepreneur, scratching and clawing to get things done, and then now obviously a very successful businessman,” he said, before asking him how to create the right “climate for innovation” for businesses. “Government is useful just to reduce the tax, so no tax for these guys,” Ma joked as the crowd laughed. “There you go,” Obama replied. “Well, you’ve got a lot of cheers from your fellow CEOs.”\n",
      "The New York Times ran a story on Saturday implicating Breitbart News in what it claimed was a misleading effort to state that former FBI Director James Comey had testified under oath that he had not been pressured to stop an investigation.[The Times‘ Jeremy W. Peters — normally one of its more credible journalists — reported that a tweet by Jack Posobiec led Breitbart News and other conservative outlets to conclude — falsely, in its view — that Comey had exonerated President Donald Trump of wrongdoing, under oath. advertisement, “Mr. Posobiec wrote on May 17 that Mr. Comey, the recently ousted F.B.I. director, had ‘said under oath that Trump did not ask him to halt any investigation’,” the Times reported. “It mattered little that Mr. Comey had said no such thing. The tweet quickly ricocheted through the ecosystem of fake news and disinformation on the far right, where Trump partisans like Mr. Posobiec have intensified their efforts to sow doubt about the legitimacy of expanding investigations into Trump associates’ ties to Russia. The Times included Breitbart News in that “ecosystem,” citing an article at Breitbart News that mentioned Posobiec’s tweet. But the Breitbart article was careful to note that Comey’s testimony on May 8 had not responded specifically to a question about whether Trump himself had asked him to stop an investigation. It did draw the inference that Comey’s comment could have included Trump — but was precise in its language: “Although Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI) didn’t specifically ask about Trump in the question she posed to Comey, the inquiry was about whether or not he had experienced having a higher authority stop an FBI investigation.”, The inference is not the only possible one — but neither is the inference that the Times prefers to draw against Trump, and to present as established fact. The Breitbart headline also did not specifically mention Trump. Comey did not volunteer any information about Trump during that testimony. He only accused Trump of having asked him to stop the investigation into former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn — by allegedly expressing a “hope” — once Comey had been fired. Joel B.

      "Rachel Rothschild writes in Business Insider that the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) could become a big problem for Hillary Clinton’s campaign.[Hillary Clinton and many of her fellow Democrats meeting in Philadelphia hope to show the party unity arguably lacking when the Republicans gathered in Cleveland. advertisement, A sticking point to a unified Democratic Party, however, has been the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), one of the most contentious topics of debate between supporters of Clinton and erstwhile rival Bernie Sanders. Despite significant lobbying, Sanders failed to secure opposition to the TPP in a draft of the Democratic Party platform. As a result, the TPP could become a key issue in the election this fall. Donald Trump’s antipathy to the deal is well-known, and he managed to convince “the party of free trade” to drop any mention of the TPP in its party platform, whether in support or opposition. And exit polls from the primaries showed that antitrade sentiment was a key driver of support for Sanders over Clinton. But, as my research on the history of environmental science and diplomacy highlights, there’s one significant drawback of the TPP that neither side has talked about: how it departs from a half-century of diplomatic progress on the environment and human rights. The TPP, a trade accord among a dozen Asia-Pacific countries, has received significant criticism from both sides of the political spectrum. The main concern has been the potential impact on American workers and the U.S. economy. However, the TPP has other glaring deficiencies that also deserve attention by Congress and the presidential candidates: the poor protection given to the environment, food safety and human rights. There is not a single mention of climate change or human rights in the treaty text. Conservation protections for wildlife are minimal at best. Foreign companies are granted the ability, for example, to challenge environmental laws of other countries through a controversial clause known as the investor-state dispute settlement system. And the TPP’s environment chapter is weaker than those in previous free trade agreements. Because of these flaws, more than 1,500 organizations, including major U.S. environmental and humanitarian groups, have come out against the TPP. While leaked documents from the TPP negotiations suggest the U.S. acquiesced to other countries attempts to weaken the agreement, history shows that tying environmental and human rights issues into larger strategic agreements actually strengthens these treaties.

      "MOST POPULAR[Lions Gate released the first teaser for Deepwater Horizon on Wednesday, which is based on events surrounding the 2010 BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. advertisement, The film, which stars Mark Wahlberg, Kurt Russell, Kate Hudson, and John Malkovich, is set on the offshore drilling rig Deepwater Horizon, which experienced a blowout in 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico and created the worst oil spill in U.S. history. While the teaser mainly focuses on the young daughter of Wahlberg and Hudson, it also shows several scenes recreating the disaster, which occurred on April 20, 2010, resulting in explosions and fires onboard the rig. In the trailer, the couple’s daughter describes oil as a “monster” during a dramatic recreation of oil drilling gone awry using a soda can. Eleven men were killed in the Deepwater Horizon accident, which left oil and methane gas spewing from an uncapped wellhead for 87 days. A judge later ruled BP was responsible for the release of 3.1 million barrels of oil into the Gulf. The federal government estimated the damage was closer to 4.2 million barrels. Deepwater Horizon is expected to premiere September 30.\n",
      "In his message for the “World Day of Prayer for the Care of Creation” Thursday, Pope Francis said that human-induced global warming, as well as a loss of biodiversity are “sins” against God, which must be atoned for by planting trees, avoiding the use of plastic and paper and “separating refuse.”[“Global warming continues, due in part to human activity,” Francis said, adding that “2015 was the warmest year on record, and 2016 will likely be warmer still.”, advertisement, “This is leading to ever more severe droughts, floods, fires and extreme weather events. Climate change is also contributing to the heart-rending refugee crisis. The world’s poor, though least responsible for climate change, are most vulnerable and already suffering its impact,” he wrote. Repeatedly citing the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, who has “courageously and prophetically continued to point out our sins against creation,” Francis made his own a new list of such environmental sins, which include pollution, global warming and deforestation. For human beings to “destroy the biological diversity of God’s creation,” to “degrade the integrity of the earth by causing changes in its climate,” to “contaminate the earth’s waters, its land, its air, and its life–these are sins,” he wrote. Summing up, the Pope stated that “to commit a crime against the natural world is a sin against ourselves and a sin against God.”, Lamenting “the devastation of the environment,” Francis said that “God gave us a bountiful garden, but we have turned it into a polluted wasteland of debris, desolation and filth.”, Specifically regarding a loss of biodiversity, the Pope suggested that now there are fewer species to give glory to God. “We must not be indifferent or resigned to the loss of biodiversity and the destruction of ecosystems, often caused by our irresponsible and selfish behavior,” Francis said. “Because of us, thousands of species will no longer give glory to God by their very existence, nor convey their message to us. We have no such right.”, The Pope said that the World Day of Prayer for the Care of Creation was instituted in order to give believers an opportunity to “reaffirm their personal vocation to be stewards of creation.” It also furnishes an occasion to thank God for the gift of creation, to implore his help for its protection and to beg “his pardon for the sins committed against the world in which we live.”, During this Jubilee Year, “let us learn to implore God’s mercy for those sins against creation that we have not hitherto acknowledged and confessed,” Francis said, while proposing that Christians need to undergo an “ecological conversion.”, Now is the time to “acknowledge our sins against creation,” the Pope said. “Inasmuch as we all generate small ecological damage,” we are called to acknowledge “our contribution, smaller or greater, to the disfigurement and destruction of creation.”, “Let us repent of the harm we are doing to our common home,” he added. If our ecological conversion is real, Francis said, it will lead to concrete ways of thinking and acting that are more respectful of creation. Among these are “avoiding the use of plastic and paper, reducing water consumption, separating refuse, cooking only what can reasonably be consumed, showing care for other living beings, using public transport or car-pooling, planting trees, turning off unnecessary lights, or any number of other practices.”, In his message, the Pope also applauded “a growing global political consensus” regarding the environment, praising the adoption of “Sustainable Development Goals” as well as last December’s Paris Agreement on climate change, “which set the demanding yet fundamental goal of halting the rise of the global temperature.”, Apparently the pontiff’s prayers have already been heard, since scientists are now forecasting that 2017 will be a cooler year than 2016.

      "A charity focused on rainforest preservation has called on actor and environmental advocate Leonardo DiCaprio to step down from his role as a UN Messenger of Peace for climate change due to his own charity’s reported connection to a $3 billion Malaysian embezzlement scheme.[The Bruno Manser Funds — which in August urged the actor and his Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation to return what it called “stolen money” — repeated its demand at a press conference in London on Friday, according to the Hollywood Reporter. advertisement, “If DiCaprio is unwilling to come clean, we ask him to step down as UN Messenger of Peace for climate change, because he simply lacks the credibility for such an important role,” Bruno Manser Funds director Lukas Straumann said, according to THR. The calls for DiCaprio to resign from his position at the United Nations, which was bestowed upon him in 2014, stem from the actor’s reported connection to several figures embroiled in the world’s largest embezzlement scheme. According to a Department of Justice complaint, the 2013 film The Wolf of Wall Street — for which DiCaprio won a Golden Globe — was funded with $238 million stolen from 1MDB, a Malaysian sovereign wealth fund holding billions of dollars earmarked for development in the country. Red Granite Pictures, which produced the film, was founded by the stepson of the Malaysian prime minister, Riza Aziz, now a central figure in the investigation into the mismanagement of the 1MDB fund. The complaint also alleges that DiCaprio’s environmental-focused charity organization received donations or benefitted from auction items purchased with money stolen from the Malaysian fund. The actor’s charity has faced increasing pressure to return what some have called its “ill-gotten” donations. In an open letter to the charity last month, Malaysian attorney and civil rights advocate Ambiga Sreenevasan expressed “shock” and “embarrassment” to learn that the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation was, as she put it, “connected with the heist of the decade that has undermined the [Malaysian] people in so many ways.”, Malaysia-based environmental organization Save Rivers has also called on the actor to return questionable donations. The increased pressure comes as DiCaprio is on a tour of film festivals around the world to unveil his National Geographic climate change documentary Before the Flood. The actor was reportedly in London on Saturday for the film’s premiere at the BFI London Film Festival, and previously premiered the film at the Toronto International Film Festival in September. Earlier this month, the actor joined President Obama and climate scientist Dr. Katharine Hayhoe for a discussion about climate change at the White House, which was followed by a screening of his film on the White House’s South Lawn.  , Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum\n",
      "In the midst of national debates concerning free speech on college campuses, the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs has opted to clamp down on students who challenge the reigning orthodoxy regarding manmade global warming.[Last week, three professors co-teaching a course titled “Medical Humanities in the Digital Age” emailed a statement to all students informing them that anthropogenic climate change is not up for debate in their course. advertisement, “We will not, at any time, debate the science of climate change, nor will the ‘other side’ of the climate change debate be taught or discussed in this course,” the professors said in their letter obtained by The College Fix. Regarding those inquisitive students who would like to discuss the issue rather than blindly accepting the global warming dogma, the professors “respectfully ask that you do not take this course.”, “The point of departure for this course is based on the scientific premise that human induced climate change is valid and occurring,” the letters states. The letter, signed by course instructors Rebecca Laroche, Wendy Haggren and Eileen Skahill, was sent in response to concerns expressed by several students after watching the first online lecture about the impacts of climate change. The professors, backed by University Communications Director Tom Hutton, said that the ban on debate even extends to discussion among students in the online forums. Students are also forbidden from using outside sources for research in the course, and may only reference materials that have been approved by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The decision by the University of Colorado to eliminate free inquiry came hard on the heels of the University of Chicago’s contrary decision to encourage debate and discussion, even on unpopular subjects. In an August letter to incoming freshmen, Chicago’s Dean of Students Jay Ellison reiterated the University’s “commitment to freedom of inquiry and expression” against the restrictive political correctness codes in force on many U.S. college campuses. Countering the trend toward less freedom of expression in higher education, Chicago stated that its commitment to academic freedom “means that we do not support so-called ‘trigger warnings,’ we do not cancel invited speakers because their topics might prove controversial, and we do not condone the creation of intellectual ‘safe spaces’ where individuals can retreat from ideas and perspectives at odds with their own.”, In other words, if you are afraid of others disagreeing with you or challenging your ideas, then Chicago is not for you. “You will find that we expect members of our community to be engaged in rigorous debate, discussion, and even disagreement. At times this may challenge you and even cause discomfort,” the letter warned. In an earlier report on freedom of expression, University officials cited former Chicago President Hanna Holborn Gray, who observed that “education should not be intended to make people comfortable, it is meant to make them think.”, “Universities should be expected to provide the conditions within which hard thought, and therefore strong disagreement, independent judgment, and the questioning of stubborn assumptions, can flourish in an environment of the greatest freedom,” the report stated. The University of Chicago’s decision garnered plaudits from First Amendment advocates. “Free speech is at risk at the very institution where it should be assured: the university,” University of Chicago president Robert Zimmer said. The university is preparing students for the real world and would not be serving them by shielding them from unpleasantness, said Geoffrey Stone, chair of the committee, law professor and past provost at the U. of C. “The right thing to do is empower the students, help them understand how to fight, combat and respond, not to insulate them from things they will have to face later,” Stone said. Last May, DePaul University cancelled a speech by Breitbart’s Milo Yiannopoulos after protests broke out on campus. When Yiannopoulos tried to reschedule, DePaul declared that he was banned from the University. Follow Thomas D. Williams on Twitter\n",

I doubt it,” Guillen proclaimed. “Despite everything, he is too smart for that. My impression is he’s become the Donald Trump of science, given to saying outrageous things for the fun of it and to attract attention.”, “Apart from being spectacularly unscientific, his prophecy is also wrongheaded,” he continued. “Hawking says we ought to escape to Mars. Interestingly, some scientists think micro-organisms once lived on the Red Planet. But a global catastrophe produced what we see today, a moribund world lacking a thick, blanket-like atmosphere – wanting for greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, to keep warm.”, Guillen added that “Winter temperatures can dip below minus 195 degrees Fahrenheit and summer temperatures barely reach 70 degrees,” before declaring that “for the adventure, I’d go to Mars this minute.

He has a history of working out environmental issues across state lines.”, advertisement, EPA “policies over the last eight years, the overreach, either on the permitting side, but also on the regulatory side, has crushed us in West Virginia,” said Capito. “We’ve lost tens of thousands of jobs.”, “You have to go back to when President Obama ran and said, ‘If you try to build a coal-fired plant, I’m going to bankrupt you.’ And he’s pretty much bankrupted almost every coal company in the country, with few exceptions. So it’s been a rough go in West Virginia,” said Capito. The Senator is optimistic that Pruitt can turn that around, while still watching over the environment in a responsible manner. Capito said she is interested in seeing “a common-sense balance” at the EPA that protects jobs, helps the economy, and protects the environment as appropriate. She also seems convinced that Pruitt shares that attitude, based upon his record of success in Oklahoma.

      "Carbon Brief – a green propaganda outlet, lavishly funded by the European Union – has produced a map depicting the world’s most influential environmental campaigners and the world’s most dangerous deniers.[In the former category, it’s no surprise that tragic bear-rape victim and private-jet-setting eco-crusader Leo DiCaprio comes top of the list. advertisement, And in the latter?, It gives me no small pleasure to tell you that I, James Delingpole, am depicted sitting dangerously close to the very epicentre of the global nexus of pure denialist evil.

The singer of Starry Eyes features prominently on the list simply because, being an international pop star she has lots of Twitter followers, and happened to retweet DiCaprio’s tweet. But anyway, let’s get back to the main point which is that I am now officially one of the top ten most powerful voices in the entire denialist universe. This was never the plan, I must admit, when I graduated from Oxford with my degree in English Language and Literature. Really, what I would have much preferred would have been to have become a millionaire Master of Foxhounds or a Pablo Escobar drugs kingpin or the man who broke the world record for the most supermodels shagged in one year. Unfortunately, in life you have to play the cards you’re dealt. The hand life dealt me, as a journalist, was to shove right under my nose one of the most important stories – and probably the single biggest scandal – of our generation. Much as I’d like a break from writing about environmentalism and climate change I can never take one because the stories keeping coming and if I don’t cover them hardly anyone else will because most of the people in my trade are either too ill-informed or too scared to take on Big Green. Imagine a conspiracy so vast that it embraces everyone from the world’s most famous bear-rape victim movie star (see above) to Bono and Thom Yorke out of Radiohead to NASA, the National Academy of Sciences, NOAA, the Royal Society to the universities of Oxford, Harvard and Yale to the BBC, ABC, CNN, CNBC, the Discovery Channel and the Disney Channel to the United Nations and the European Union to the Dalai Lama and the Pope to all the world’s big corporations (and that includes the oil industry), insurance companies and mega-banks to pretty much the entire political class barring a few mavericks. If it existed it would be the biggest story ever, right?, Well you’d think but actually the conspiracy does exist. Yet even though it’s so flagrant that none of the participants bothers to hide their role in it, the number of media outlets covering the story accurately and honestly is tiny. There are various reasons for this, one of which I shall be covering in my next article, which will concern the scandal of the Putrid Peers who tried to greenmail The Times newspaper into abandoning its honest coverage of climate issues. Seriously, this is the kind of shit you can imagine going on in Stalin’s Soviet Union or Mao’s China, but not in a liberal democracy where freedom of the press is supposed to be paramount. That’s why I call the climate change story the “gift that goes on giving.” Because that’s what it is. If only more people in my trade did their homework, I might never have made the global deniers’ big time list. So I’d like to conclude my Top Denier acceptance speech by thanking 99.99 per cent of my contemporaries in the media for being so totally effing useless at their jobs. Guys, it’s thanks to your criminal incompetence that I’m up here collecting this award today!\n",
      "The international climate mob have made President Trump an offer he can’t refuse: “Stay in Paris – or the U.S. gets it!”[Among the threats made so far, should the president honor his election trail promise to quit the UN Paris climate agreement. advertisement, The U.S. will lose $6 trillion worth of jobs in “clean” energy. The U.S. will become a “rogue country”. The U.S. will be removed from Angela Merkel’s Weihnachtskarte list. The U.S. may become the victim of further weaponized handshakes and other typically Gallic “your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries” insults from prepubescent Mummy’s little tough boy President Macron of France. The U.S. presidential administration may become subject to further awkward rifts between those who want a “seat at the table” in Paris – Tillerson Jared Kushner Ivanka Gary Cohn Rick Perry – and those who want out. The U.S. may add to “global warming” by 0.3 degrees C,  causing the world to boil and melt or, if not that, then at least provoking much bitterness and resentment among all the countries that haven’t yet quit Paris even though they’d all secretly like to. Quite how Trump will respond to these threats is still anyone’s guess. On the one hand, he has reportedly told various allies that he intends to pull out. On the other, he is known for changing his mind at the last minute. What we do know is that the climate gravy train is trundling on regardless. And that as far as the U.S. climate negotiators are concerned, the current president might still just as well be Barack Obama. Yup, that’s the inside gossip from EU news specialist Euractiv:, But, according to our sources, the US team are exploiting the vacuum to press ahead with the agreement, which was signed by Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama. They told open-mouthed officials, “We are following the Obama procedure. As long as there are no new instructions, the old ones are still valid.”, They agreed a limited budget increase to plans in Bonn. Diplomats told their opposite numbers that they should seize the opportunity to get as much agreed before Trump makes up his mind, awestruck sources gossiped. Another source blasted that “climate should be humanity’s number one concern and this guy hasn’t found the time to sit down with his climate negotiators in more than 120 days in office”. This international determination to keep the U.S. in the Paris Agreement at all costs sits slightly at odds with reports that several other signatory nations are privately desperate to escape. According to Climate Home,  former Eastern Bloc countries Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary are trying to “gut, block or water down” the Paris accord’s emissions-reductions promises because they interfere with their economic growth and commit them to useless, expensive renewable energy. Europe’s steelmakers – among them, Arcelor-Mittal , Germany’s Thyssenkrupp and Austria’s Voestalpine – have written to EU leaders begging not to be burdened with any of the carbon emissions costs they say would make them uncompetitive against foreign rivals. Meanwhile a report produced by the Commission on Carbon Prices claims that says the carbon dioxide price needs to rise ten- or twentyfold if it is to meet Paris pledges. This would – to coin a phrase – cause electricity prices necessarily to skyrocket…, As Cliff Forrest notes in the Wall Street Journal, the ‘business case’ for Paris is bunk. The economic merits of the Paris Agreement take on a different air when more fully considered. Climate-change advocates’ bizarre premise is that economic gains will come from restricting access to the most abundant, reliable and affordable fuel sources. Never mind that this defies the experience of many European nations that have invested heavily in renewable energy. After “Germany’s aggressive and reckless expansion of wind and solar,” for example, the magazine Der Spiegel declared in 2013 that electricity had become “a luxury good.” Apparently this time will be different. Which is why – as I remarked yesterday – it is so absurd and wrong and dishonest of the President’s so-called Economics Adviser Gary ‘Wormtongue’ Cohn to be pretending otherwise. No one is pretending Trump won’t get a lot of stick from the Climate Industrial Complex, from the Euro weenies, from the globalists, the Bilderbergers, the eco Nazis and Davos Man if he does the right thing and pulls out of Paris. No one is pretending that pulling out of Paris won’t earn him an even stiffer handshake from President Macron and even dirtier looks from Mrs Merkel next time they meet. But increasingly – at least from this Englishman’s perspective – whether President Trump pulls the U.S. out of Paris boils down to one very simple question:, “Are you a man or a mouse, Mister President?”\n",

But Obama also paid homage to the Facebook CEO, praising him for contributing to the social media revolution. “Well, if you think about just 2008, and what’s happened in social media, as something that you helped to lead obviously, that has been an incredible transformation,” Obama said. “We didn’t talk about this beforehand,” Zuckerberg informed his viewers awkwardly. “No we did not,” Obama replied, but praised Zuckerberg for social media changing politics, education, and economics. “That’s powerful,” he said, praising platforms like Facebook for changing the world. Obama added that social media was disruptive, which could cause fear in some communities. “I think you’re always going to have people who react to all this new stuff by saying, ‘That’s a little scary,’” he said. Later Obama glowingly praised Zuckerberg for being a role model for young people. “You could see, Mark, when you met some of these young entrepreneurs, all of them look up to you as a role model and Facebook as an example of the transformative power of one good idea and the doggedness and the determination to build it out,” he said. \n",
      "MOST POPULAR[Amie Parnes writes at The Hill:, advertisement, The scorched-earth playbook employed by Donald Trump’s presidential campaign is stirring alarm among allies of Hillary Clinton, with some fearing the negativity will depress turnout on Election Day. Some Clinton supporters say they’re concerned that voters are nearly fed up with the constant accusations and name-calling that has defined the campaign. “Of course there’s reason to worry, both about the ‘turn off’ effect or the impact if polling continues to show her leading by a wide margin,” one longtime Clinton adviser acknowledged on Thursday. “That, too, could lead some to stay home.”, The hostile atmosphere in the race has been worsening by the day. In the past 48 hours, several women have come forward to accuse Trump of sexual misconduct following reports of a tape in which the Republican nominee talks about grabbing women by the genitals. Protestors have been interrupting Clinton to accuse her husband of rape, after Trump brought women who have accused former President Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct to the second debate. Trump is increasingly warning of a “conspiracy” that he says is being waged against him by the Republican Party, corporate interests and the mainstream media. And amid the chaos, there’s been a slow drip of emails from WikiLeaks that appear to detail the inner workings of the Hillary Clinton campaign. You can read the rest of the story here.\n",

Donald Trump would take us in the wrong direction on so many issues we care about, economic justice, workers rights, civil rights, human rights. the environment. All of that is on the line in this election.”, “When Donald Trump says a distinguished judge born in Indiana can’t do his job because of his Mexican heritage or mocks a reporter with disabilities or denigrates Muslims and immigrants, it goes against everything we stand for,” she continued. “He does not see all Americans as Americans.

      "Update: Several sources have since changed their reporting to indicate that it was not DiCaprio who paid for Hamilton’s services.[“Representatives for DiCaprio say Hamilton was not a member of his Oscars glam squad and he did not fund her flying visit to the US,” the Sydney Morning Herald reported. advertisement, Original story below:, Leonardo DiCaprio apparently spared no expense while getting ready for last weekend’s Academy Awards — the Oscar-winning actor and environmental activist reportedly flew a renowned “eyebrow artist” to the stars more than 7,000 miles around the world to have his face tended to ahead of Hollywood’s big night. According to reports in the Sydney Morning Herald and the Independent, the 42-year-old Revenant star and fellow actor Tobey Maguire enlisted the services of beautician Sharon-Lee Hamilton, who made the 7,500-mile trip from Sydney, Australia to Los Angeles to ensure the stars’ brows were just right for the big show. While the artists’s eyebrow services are reported to cost a relatively affordable $200, Hamilton — whose previous clients are said to include Beyoncé, George Clooney and Kim Kardashian — told the Herald that when traveling for work, her costs are covered by her clients. Hamilton also told the paper that she would be doing work for two other A-list celebrities while in town before the Oscars. DiCaprio is one of Hollywood’s foremost environmental activists and green jobs campaigners. In December, the actor — whose eponymous Foundation is dedicated to fighting climate change — met with then-President-elect Donald Trump at Trump Tower in Manhattan to discuss how jobs in sustainable energy could help contribute to an economic revival in the United States. The actor also recently produced a National Geographic documentary on global warming, Before the Flood, that was shown on the South Lawn of the White House in October. DiCaprio has previously said that climate change “deniers” should be barred from holding public office. But the A-list star and environmental warrior has also come under fire for his apparent affinity for private air travel. In April 2015, leaked emails taken from Sony Pictures revealed that DiCaprio used a private jet six times over a six-week period the previous year to travel between New York and Los Angeles for filmmaker’s meetings in May, the star reportedly flew 8,000 miles between Cannes, France and New York City on a private jet to collect an environmental activism award. DiCaprio also hosts his annual Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation climate change gala in St. Tropez, France, which requires its A-list guests to travel thousands of miles by air to attend. In October, executives from a rainforest charity demanded the actor resign from his position as a UN Messenger of Peace for climate change due to his foundation’s alleged links to a $3 billion Malaysian embezzlement scheme. DiCaprio was on hand at the Academy Awards Sunday night to present the Best Actress award to La La Land star Emma Stone. The actor also became embroiled in the now-famous “Envelope-gate” scandal, in which the wrong winner for Best Picture was announced.  , Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum,  \n",
      "Scott Adams has gone full-on climate denialist in his latest Dilbert strip, causing liberal heads to explode.[, advertisement, Some of his old fans just aren’t happy at this betrayal of The Cause:, it’s a shame to see this as I used to think he was very funny. The Way of the Weasel was an awesome book.it could be dementia – that is a thing that happens to people , On Scott Adams, his comic strip and thought processes have pretty clearly jumped the shark, No doubt it is an accident of the pen. But the “climate scientist” in the cartoon bears more than a passing resemblance to Michael Mann, globally renowned inventor of the “Hockey Stick” and winner – or so he used to claim till he got rumbled – of the Nobel Prize. As Homer would say, this cartoon is funny because it’s true. In fact it sums up pretty much everything the layman needs to know about the state of climate “science” and how it abuses the public trust. So, it starts with truths which are widely accepted – “the basic science of physics and chemistry”. Then – like a street magician or a confidence trickster – it slips quickly from the realm of evident truth into a world of illusion: “We put that data into dozens of different climate models and ignore the ones that look wrong to us.”, Anyone who questions this groupthink is labelled a “science denier.”, But as Adams has grasped it has nothing to do with science. Rather it’s about the politically driven misapplication of models which have no real-world basis. This cartoon is by no means Adams’s first brush with WrongThink. In September last year, he caused more liberal heads to explode by publicly switching his allegiance from Hillary Clinton to Donald Trump. One of his cannier insights was that Trump’s bluster is actually a sign of emotional intelligence and deal-making skills rather than a sign – as the progressives continue to believe – that he is a dangerous lunatic. Trump “paces” the public – meaning he matches them in their emotional state, and then some. He does that with his extreme responses on immigration, fighting ISIS, stop-and-frisk, etc. Once Trump has established himself as the biggest bad-ass on the topic, he is free to “lead,” which we see him do by softening his deportation stand, limiting his stop-and-frisk comment to Chicago, reversing his first answer on penalties for abortion, and so on. If you are not trained in persuasion, Trump look scary. If you understand pacing and leading, you might see him as the safest candidate who has ever gotten this close to the presidency. That’s how I see him. “Dilbert has gone fascist“, Salon’s Amanda Marcotte responded, with typical verve, wit and lightness of touch. Then in March this year, the jack-booted, blackshirted cartoonist caused further outrage by composing one of the best essays ever written as to why the claims of climate alarmists should be taken with a huge pinch of salt. It was titled How To Convince Skeptics That Climate Change Is A Problem. Here are two of my favorite entries:, Don’t tell me how well your models predict the past. Tell me how many climate models have ever been created, since we started doing this sort of thing, and tell me how many have now been discarded because they didn’t predict correctly. If the answer is “All of the old ones failed and we were totally surprised because they were good at hindcasting,” then why would I trust the new ones?, and, If skeptics make you retreat to Pascal’s Wager as your main argument for aggressively responding the climate change, please understand that you lost the debate. The world is full of risks that might happen. We don’t treat all of them as real. And we can’t rank any of these risks to know how to allocate our capital to the best path. Should we put a trillion dollars into climate remediation or use that money for a missile defense system to better protect us from North Korea?, Needless to say, this also caused liberal heads to explode. Here’s a sample from one particularly virulent climate activist. None of Adams’ concepts are supported in any manner. He produces no research tied to it. There is no rigorous method applied to rationalize it. It’s little more than cultish ramblings validated by a small loyal following acquired through his previous success as a cartoonist. As Adams must be painfully aware by now, when you’re taking flak it means you’re over the target. Carry on Scott!\n",

Google will keep working hard for a cleaner, more prosperous future for all.”, Brad Smith, the President and Chief Legal Officer at Microsoft took to LinkedIn to write a lengthy disapproval of the U.S. leaving the Paris Climate Accord saying, “We are disappointed with today’s decision by the White House to withdraw the United States from the landmark, globally supported Paris Agreement on climate change,” Smith writes. “We believe that continued U.S. participation benefits U.S. businesses and the economy in important and multiple ways. A global framework strengthens competitiveness for American businesses. It creates new markets for innovative clean technologies, from green power to smart grids to cloud-enabled solutions. And by strengthening global action over time, the Agreement reduces future climate damage to people and organizations around the world.”, Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote an internal letter to Apple staff where he too expressed his concerns and disapproval. The full letter, as reported by TechCrunch, reads,, Team,, I know many of you share my disappointment with the White House’s decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement. I spoke with President Trump on Tuesday and tried to persuade him to keep the U.S. in the agreement. But it wasn’t enough. Climate change is real and we all share a responsibility to fight it. I want to reassure you that today’s developments will have no impact on Apple’s efforts to protect the environment. We power nearly all of our operations with renewable energy, which we believe is an example of something that’s good for our planet and makes good business sense as well. We will keep working toward the ambitious goals of a closed-loop supply chain, and to eventually stop mining new materials altogether. Of course, we’re going to keep working with our suppliers to help them do more to power their businesses with clean energy. And we will keep challenging ourselves to do even more. Knowing the good work that we and countless others around the world are doing, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about our planet’s future.

      "Donald Trump is the only leader left in the world defending Western democracy against eco fascism.[Don’t just take it from me. Read this Belgian philosopher, Drieu Godefridi, interviewed in the French liberal newspaper Contrepoints and translated here by Friends of Science Calgary. advertisement, He believes that the Paris climate agreement was a global socialist plot which the U.S. was absolutely right to escape:, [President Trump] perfectly grasped the essence of the Paris Agreement, which is to redistribute the wealth of the West to the rest of the world – he expressly declared it on the Lawn of the White House, on June 1st, 2017 when making the American exit from Paris official. In so doing, he has stopped the formidable internationalist socialist machinery that was in the process of being set up. In other words, he has refused to validate the third-world moral intuition, and the scientific pretext that gave birth to the Paris Agreement. Environmentalism, argues Godefridi, is just another facet of the left’s ongoing war against democracy:, What we have been seeing for the past two decades, in the areas of climate, gender theory, immigration and terrorism, and so on, is that activist minority ideologues have confiscated democratic debate. What makes it so especially dangerous is that unlike, say, gender theory – which everyone knows to be made-up leftist nonsense – climate change has a superficial scientific plausibility capable of fooling people who ought to know better. But really, it’s just another mask for globalism. Climate is something else! Every time since its birth in the fold of the IPCC, the ideology of the climate has claimed science as its foundational authority – and science in its most precise version! Physics! The politicized IPCC has never stopped claiming it is presenting science since. So, it is this second globalization, a prelude to a world government that is openly called for by the elites of internationalist socialism, which is threatened today by the American exit of the Paris Agreement. By quitting Paris, Trump hasn’t merely saved the U.S. an awful lot of money. He also saved the democratic values which the previous administration was half way towards destroying. Under the aegis of the previous occupants of the White House, America itself, traditionally more resistant to socialism than the Europeans, has already largely embarked on this path. Therefore, from this point of view, the American break from the Paris-globalist bank heist, deserves to be described as a re-founding – as a return to the roots of American democracy and the wisdom of its founding fathers. Nope, I’d never heard of Godefridi either till this interview. But he is now officially my fourth favorite Belgian, after Tintin, Jacques Brel and Plastic Bertrand\n",
      "Film director and climate change activist James Cameron says President Donald Trump has filled his cabinet with crazy people.[“[Trump] nominated a guy to run the EPA [Scott Pruitt] who has eight lawsuits against the EPA, and refuses to recuse himself from those lawsuits! It’s basically the upside-down world right now, and the kind of dialogue coming out of these guys sounds like George Orwell,” Cameron told The Daily Beast. advertisement, “Alternate facts? There’s no such thing as an alternate fact! These people are insane,” Cameron said. Cameron said President Trump is going to undo all the work that was done to help avoid a climate-related disaster that could put the planet in peril. “Years ago, we sort of spotted the iceberg ahead of us and we called out the order to turn, and we’ve been slowly, slowly, slowly trying to turn this big-ass ship to not hit the iceberg, and then Trump grabbed the tiller and just plunged it right back at the center of the iceberg,” Cameron said. He added:, So am I worried? Of course. I’m like anyone of good conscience and reasonable intelligence. I think we’re the biggest freakin’ idiot civilization in history right now, and they’ll probably be talking about us 4,000 years from now scratching their heads—like they talk about Atlantis. “Who are those guys?

Indeed, for example, Cameron debuted a documentary warning of the dangers of climate change at the Democratic National Convention in July. The five-minute video, which featured dramatic music, extreme weather, and natural disasters, championed Hillary Clinton as the only presidential candidate capable of saving the planet from mankind. A few months later, Cameron was among the left-wing filmmakers behind an anti-Trump video that aired in swing states on behalf of a pro-Clinton super PAC just weeks before Election Day. Now, following President Trump’s first week in office, Cameron said he is keeping his “head down” and “doing the stuff that [he] thought [he] would be doing if Hillary was elected.”, “I’m making my Avatar films, I’m doing my climate work, I’m doing my sustainable agriculture work.

      "Five U.S. Republican Senators sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch demanding that she end the Department of Justice (DOJ) witch hunt against political opponents of President Obama’s energy agenda. They warn her that any improper assertion of federal investigatory or prosecutorial power is an abuse of power.[Senators Ted Cruz (R-TX), Mike Lee (R-UT), Jeff Sessions (R-AL), David Vitter (R-LA), and David Perdue (R-GA), signed the letter warning Lynch that “As you well know, initiating criminal prosecution for a private entity’s opinions on climate change is a blatant violation of the First Amendment and an abuse of power that rises to the level of prosecutorial misconduct.”, advertisement, They add, “These actions provide disturbing confirmation that government officials at all levels are threatening to wield the sword of law enforcement to silence debate on climate change.”, The U.S. senators note in their letter that “in 2015, the [DOJ] was asked by a ‘coalition of environmentalists and lawmakers’ to investigate whether the past decisions of a private sector company to adopt and publicly disclose certain views on climate issues, and to refrain from adopting and publicly disclosing others, may have violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and related laws.”, Statements from a March 29, 2016, press conference held by Democrat attorneys general from five states, and staff from Democrat AG offices in eleven other states, clearly exposed that similar investigations are ongoing, they write. As reported by Logan Churchwell for Breitbart Texas, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, in conjunction with Alabama AG Luther Strange filed a motion to intervene in the case involving Irving-based ExxonMobil on May 16. ExxonMobil received a subpoena from U.S. Virgin Islands Attorney General Claude Walker seeking decades worth of internal records concerning the company’s public statements over the potential impacts of climate change. The AG from the Virgin Islands is seeking to ascertain if ExxonMobil violated a Virgin Islands law – the Criminally Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (CICO). Walker is also seeking to determine if the oil giant committed securities fraud. The AG from the Virgin Islands also issued a subpoena seeking documents and communications from over 100 private conservative organizations and parties. The subpoena seeks decades of anything that refers to the issues of climate change, greenhouse gases, carbon tax, or climate science, as noted in the letters from the senators. “This case is about abusing the power of the subpoena to force Exxon to turn over many decades’ worth of records, so an attorney general with an agenda can pore over them in hopes of finding something incriminating,” General Paxton said in a statement obtained by Breitbart Texas. The State of Texas warns that such sweeping subpoenas could “set a precedent that anyone can be criminally investigated” for views that differ from President Obama’s and the federal goverment. In their letter, the senators demand that the U.S. Attorney General confirm that all investigations into any private individual’s views on climate change end within fourteen days. They also demand that U.S. AG Lynch promise not to initiate any such investigations in the future. “Freedom of thought and inquiry is at the very heart of liberty,” Sen. Cruz said. “Sadly, the Obama administration and its allies in state attorney general offices across the country are threatening to use the power of government to intimidate and ultimately silence companies and researchers who do not agree with the government’s opinions about the allegedly harmful effects of climate change and what should be done about it. This is an abuse of power and a direct assault on the First Amendment. The Obama Justice Department should immediately cease any further consideration of such action and should instead do everything in its power to protect the freedom of thought of all Americans.”, “Threatening prosecution of those who dare to challenge the most outlandish scaremongering by climate activists strikes at the very heart of the Free Speech protections on which this nation was founded,” Sen. Lee said. “Issuing subpoenas to harass researchers and academics with whom they have communicated, as some state attorneys general offices have done, shows a basic disregard for Americans’ Freedom of Association. The public expects us to prevent such abuses, not perpetrate them. It is our responsibility to contain the inevitable chilling effects by calling for an end to any consideration by the Department of Justice of such harassment at once.”, “Unnecessary government intrusion of private citizens’ lives is an unfortunate characteristic of the reign of the Obama Administration,” Sen. Vitter said. “It is contemptible for the Justice Department to target and threaten individual American citizens and private or non-profit organizations in pursuit of its far-left environmental agenda.”, The Breitbart Texas report about the Texas Attorney General filing a motion to intervene in the ExxonMobil action, noted the well-funded political actors behind the environmental witch hunt. The Wall Street Journal reported in April that a close-knit coalition led by 350.org formed “to establish in public’s mind that Exxon is a corrupt institution that has pushed humanity (and all creation) toward climate chaos and grave harm.”, The activists set out to work with state and federal prosecutors to subpoena documents to “delegitimize [Exxon] as a political actor” and to control them through litigation. The effort is reportedly funded in large part by The Rockefeller Family Fund, operated by the heirs of John D. Rockefeller, founder of Standard Oil, now known as ExxonMobil.

      "“And would sir like a regular or large fries, with that? And how about a McFlurry?”[I do hope that Gavin “Toast” Schmidt, the head of NASA’s Goddard Institute of Space Studies (GISS), followed the advice I gave him a few months back. Because it now looks very much as if he and many of his colleagues are about to face exciting new job opportunities, hopefully in areas best suited to their talents, such as the challenging world of fast-food retail. advertisement, Yes, as we predicted, NASA is going to be stripped of the two main roles it enjoyed under the Obama administration – Muslim outreach and green propaganda – and return to its original day (and night) job as an agency dedicated to space exploration. The U.S. Senate passed legislation recently cutting funding for NASA’s global warming research. The House is expected to pass the bill, and President Trump will likely sign it. Supporters say it “re-balances” NASA’s budget back toward space exploration and away from global warming and earth science research. Republicans plan to end the more than $2 billion NASA spends on its Earth Science Mission Directorate. “By rebalancing, I’d like for more funds to go into space exploration we’re not going to zero out earth sciences,” Texas Republican Rep. Lamar Smith, who chairs the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, told E&ampE News. “I’d like for us to remember what our priorities are, and there are another dozen agencies that study earth science and climate change, and they can continue to do that.”, Before we shed too many tears for the plight of Gavin Schmidt and the rest of his global warming research team, though, let’s just pause to reflect on how much damage they have done to the cause of honest science over the years and what eye-wateringly vast quantities of our money they have wasted. A good place to start is this excellent piece by Steve Goddard, entitled The Pause Is Real: NASA Temperatures Aren’t. Here is the damning chart that says it all:, , How did a supposedly respectable government agency get away with such blatant fraud?, Well, one answer is that it was encouraged to do so by the US government which paid its Earth Science research division $2 billion a year, while giving only $781.5 million and $826.7 million to its astrophysics and space technology divisions. Obama wanted “global warming” to be real and dangerous: and – lo! – thanks to the magic of his crack prestidigitators at NASA, NOAA and the rest, it was. But the longer answer is that this is what happens when green ideologues are allowed to infiltrate and hijack government institutions. As we’ve reported before, NASA has been caught out fiddling temperature data on “an unbelievable scale”. So too has NOAA. That’s because their global warming departments are mostly run by true believers – scientists who want to show the world that global warming is a major threat in urgent need of more grant funding, regardless of what the actual temperature data shows. Hence the many, many adjustments. This has done tremendous damage not just in the US but across the world because it has enabled green propagandists to point at the dodgy adjusted data from NASA and NOAA and claim: “The Experts say…”, Now, thanks to Donald Trump, that fraud is about to come to a sudden and painful end. It never ceases to amaze and nauseate me that more people, especially on the right, aren’t more grateful for what is being done here. While mainstream media commentators on both left and right bloviate about Trump’s style (clearly they prefer Obama’s empty rhetoric) and stoke up fake news stories about Russian plots, Trump is busily getting on with one of the most valuable and important missions ever conducted by a US president: he is putting an end to the biggest and most expensive scientific scam in history. Oh, and he is also working wonders for property rights and business by rescinding such damaging regulations as the Waters Of The US and the Climate Action Plan. A source briefed on the matter told The Washington Post one of the orders “will instruct the Environmental Protection Agency to begin rewriting the 2015 regulation that limits greenhouse-gas emissions from existing electric utilities” and order “the Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to lift a moratorium on federal coal leasing.”, Trump will issue a second order instructing the EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to rewrite the “Waters of the U.S.” (WOTUS) rule that expanded federal control over rivers, streams and wetlands — even those on private property. If ever a swamp needed draining, it’s the swamp of the $1.5 trillion environmental scam. This could have gone on for ever and ever. Our grandchildren ought to be properly grateful to President Trump that it didn’t.\n",

John Cornyn (R.-Texas), who serves as the GOP Whip in the upper chamber. “I think, for myself, I think he’s a better choice.”, advertisement, In April, Cornyn warned Republicans that Trump, who was running against his Texas colleague Sen. Ted Cruz (R.-Texas), could be an albatross around the neck of the party. But, by April Cornyn was telling reporters Trump was the new exciting paradigm. “He could change the electoral map in ways that we haven’t seen before,” he said. “This disrupts the usual Republican versus Democrat, conservative versus liberal paradigm and I just think we don’t know how this will all turn out.”, At the Austin event, the senator was asked if he harbored doubts about Trump and his effect on other state and federal races for other Republicans. “I don’t think there’s any doubt about it, but I’ve been wrong before,” he said. “Who would have predicted this outcome? This is an unusual political environment we’re living in, but not just here in the United States.”, The Texan also pointed out the Democrats are struggling with their own unresolved nomination contest. “Obviously, our Democratic friends are having some challenges on their side with Bernie Sanders,” he said. “That this works is that the party politics, the voters get to choose the nominee and that’s the person who represents the party.”, But, he said with Trump as the nominee on the Republican side of the aisle, it was time for the party to focus on winning back the White House and everything that flows from that victory.\n",
      "President-elect Donald Trump wants Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to serve as director of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA.)[Pruitt’s nomination is certain to worry environmental activists focused on global warming issues. But Pruitt, who has led Oklahoma’s challenge against President Obama’s “Clean Power Plan” (CPP), could guide the EPA back to its core mission of environmental protection, rather than continue its recent obsession with reducing industrial carbon dioxide emissions. advertisement, In selecting Pruitt, the president-elect has staked out a clear position on the looming debate over U.S. energy independence vs. climate change austerity. While serving as Oklahoma’s attorney general, Pruitt argued that the Clean Power Plan infringes on state sovereignty over power generation—a view shared by 27 other states currently challenging the measure. Overall, the choice of Pruitt suggests that the president-elect is on track to roll back some of the more onerous initiatives of the Obama Administration. Significantly, the CPP is one of three efforts that have combined to help dismantle much of America’s coal industry. Opponents of the plan note that it would vastly expand the EPA’s authority to regulate state power grids—a move never previously interpreted in the Clean Air Act. And the plan would impose harsh costs on coal-fired power generation to achieve a theoretical 0.018 degrees Celsius reduction in global temperatures by 2100. If the Clean Power Plan were not enough to shut down the domestic coal industry, President Obama has also prepared a “Stream Protection Rule” (SPR) that duplicates existing state and federal controls on coal mining. The rule, which was drafted without the input of coal-producing states, has been written so broadly as to potentially designate half of all U.S. coal reserves off-limits to mining. And where the coal industry has already shed 68,000 jobs in recent years, a fully realized SPR could potentially cost another 78,000 jobs. The Obama Administration’s hostility to coal also extends to the recent moratorium on federal coal leases. Under the guise of seeking a more equitable leasing program, the administration launched a review of the federal coal program that generated revenues of $1 billion for American taxpayers in 2014 while also producing 40 percent of the total coal-generated electricity in the United States. Overall, this trifecta of regulations has grievously burdened the nation’s coal producers while also driving up the cost of power generation in at least 13 states that rely principally on coal-fired power. At the same time, the president has happily subsidized measures to ramp up wind and solar power. That such renewable energy continues to prove expensive and intermittent (since the wind doesn’t always blow and the sun doesn’t always shine) has mattered little to green advocates. Ironically, this investment in green energy has yielded only modest returns even as the domestic coal industry has made enormous investments to reduce emissions. Modern U.S. coal plants are 90 percent cleaner than 30 years ago, thanks to impressive advances in scrubbing technologies. The same money being generously funneled to wind and solar projects could also yield even cleaner coal—which would be a sensible priority since coal has formed the backbone of reliable, robust, and affordable domestic power generation for decades. The measures implemented by President Obama have obviously been aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions. But the president’s guiding assumption has been that 20th Century global warming is a principally manmade phenomenon. Unfortunately, this discounts the work of a broad array of climate activists who continue to argue that increased solar activity, not rising carbon dioxide, has driven recent climate trends. And so, President Obama has unilaterally imposed stunning costs on the nation’s power sector based on a potentially flawed ideology. Pruitt’s selection for the EPA has sparked yet another round of divisive climate debate. But there are reasons to appreciate his nomination since Pruitt appears to recognize the benefits of affordable power for the working people of the United States. It’s worth noting that cleaner coal and expanded natural gas production provide sturdy, reliable power generation. Along with nuclear power, they are the only proven means of reliably producing the massive supplies of electricity needed to treat municipal drinking water, for example, and to process the enormous waste water and sanitation byproducts of large metropolitan areas. And so, there are valid reasons to prioritize such environmental safety issues for the American people. President Obama’s rush to dismantle coal without assuring a robust alternative could actually threaten the sanitary living conditions of major cities. And so, the nomination of Scott Pruitt to lead the EPA could help to foster a wider debate on the growing energy needs of America’s expanding population. While green activists may rush to condemn him, there are important priorities to consider. President-elect Trump’s choice of Pruitt could redefine some of these pressing environmental concerns, even as the new administration prepares to take office.\n",

      "Despite the left’s attempt to deny it, some anti-Trump protesters are indeed paid to show up — including those from a growing number of tech companies who are paying their employees to participate in anti-Trump rallies.[The San Francisco Chronicle reported on Saturday, in an article titled “Bay Area demonstrators may be paid to protest, by employers,” that the “common accusation lobbed at liberal protesters” that “they’re being paid to protest” is at least partially based in fact. advertisement, According to the Chronicle, “an increasing number of companies have unveiled policies that allow employees to take paid time off work for political or civic activities, such as protesting, canvassing, voting, volunteering or even running for office.” The progressive movement’s vocal opposition to President Donald Trump has translated into employers (at least, those who can afford it) providing paid leave as a way to increase political engagement after what many of them took as a devastating loss. Adam Kleinberg, CEO of San Francisco marketing firm Traction, reportedly allows employees two paid “Days of Action” to participate in political rallies and protests annually. “It’s not sufficient anymore to say we’re a profit engine and we’re making money and screw everything else. It’s part of our responsibility to be engaged, to be active,” William Morgan, CEO and founder of cloud-infrastructure startup Buoyant, told the Chronicle. His company reportedly offers about three to four weeks of paid time off to its workers, who are able to use the time for political activity or vacations. “We as individuals, we as companies exist in an ecosystem. We’re only here because there’s this environment around us. It can’t just be a one-way relationship.”, The Chronicle notes that while the majority of these companies are on the smaller side, and tend to have more liberal workforces, larger companies like Facebook are looking to entertain similar policies. They reportedly told employees that they could use paid leave time to attend and participate in pro-immigrant May Day demonstrations. However, the Chronicle also notes that some companies who offer their employees paid leave for political action have experienced an intense backlash.\n",
      "The University of Wisconsin-Madison is in the process of hiring more counselors after students claimed that the university has a problem with microaggressions and racial bias.[Chancellor Rebecca Blank recently announced university plans to accelerate “the hiring of additional student support counseling services … for student mental health issues related to diversity and climate.” She also mentioned plans to have incoming freshmen attend a newly designed “cultural competency” program that aims to rid students of their biases before future transgressions are committed against the university’s social minorities. advertisement, “In support of this student-led plan, I’m going to commit resources out of the Chancellor’s Office to provide short-term funding for two dedicated positions for student mental health issues related to diversity and climate,” Blank stated in her open letter to the UW community. “This will allow us to hire before permanent funds become available. Recruitment for these positions will begin immediately.”, Blank listed four initiatives designed to combat these campus climate issues:, The changes were prompted by the Twitter hashtag #TheRealUW, which attempted to bring light to campus issues of racial bias, microaggressions, and discrimination. According to the students, a common microaggression is students assuming that an African-American peer is an athlete on the basis of their skin color. A Latin-American student claimed that she had been on the receiving end of microaggressions based on her cultural heritage, detailing her experience with peers wanting to guess her ethnicity, and others assuming that she is a good cook. Another incident that influenced Blank’s new policies involved a Vietnamese student who was allegedly spit on by a middle aged white man, who told her to “go back to China.”, The university is also focused on combating some of the alleged issues that have occurred on Yik Yak, such as one comment that criticized an African-American student for claiming to be oppressed despite attending the university on a full scholarship. “I am seeking a partnership with students, faculty and staff who have ideas and initiatives that address cultural and behavioral change…” Blank concluded. “It is very clear that we still have much work to do in our community.”, Tom Ciccotta writes about Free Speech and Intellectual Diversity for Breitbart.

      "MOST POPULAR[Cosmopolitan Magazine warns that 2016 will be a big year for shark attacks around the world and global warming is to blame. advertisement, In a Cosmo essay shared with Esquire Magazine, Sarah Rense writes that last year saw “a record number of shark attacks” with a total of 98 attacks and six deaths. In comparison, she says, ten years ago there were only 58 attacks. Moreover, experts have predicted that 2016 will be “a big shark attack year,” she writes. Her foregone conclusion? The cause “is largely climate change.”, Oddly, Ms. Rense does not examine statistics on numbers of swimmers, or on seal migration patterns (which account for killer sharks’ primary food source) or even a year-by-year analysis of shark attacks going back beyond ten years to see whether the trend holds up over time. Instead, she employs the single, unremarkable statistic of 98 incidents of shark attacks in 2015 to insist that global warming must be the culprit. Rense does, of course, throw in a dollop of pseudo-science, citing a “recent study” according to which warmer oceans are pushing sharks 20 miles further up the coast each decade. This slow northerly push means that sharks are crossing paths with more humans and “reaching New York and New Jersey beaches, where fewer people will be expecting them,” Rense writes. If Rense’s theory holds and “global warming” is truly to blame, then the extra shark attacks should fall within that 20-mile swath of beach where sharks are allegedly venturing for the first time. Unfortunately for Rense—and Cosmopolitan—this simply isn’t the case. There was only one shark attack in New York and none in New Jersey since the year 2000. The most serious shark incidents in New Jersey history occurred exactly a century ago, in 1916, when a series of shark attacks between July 1 and 12 left four people dead and one injured. In 2015, by contrast, the greatest increase in attacks actually occurred in North Carolina and Florida, regular haunts for sharks having nothing to do with climate change. Of the eight U.S. counties with more than 15 shark attacks since the year 2000, four are in Florida (accounting for a whopping total of 273 attacks), two in Hawaii and the other two in South Carolina. According to a report from the International Shark Attack File at the Florida Museum of Natural History, the most likely explanation for the greater number of shark attacks has nothing to do with “climate change” at all. “The number of shark-human interactions occurring in a given year is directly correlated with the amount of time humans spend in the sea,” the Museum’s report states. Moreover, “as world population continues its upsurge and interest in aquatic recreation concurrently rises, we realistically should expect increases in the number of shark attacks and other aquatic recreation-related injuries,” the report says. The Museum warns against the sort of inferences drawn by Ms. Rense as highly unscientific, noting that “short-term trends in the number of shark bites up or down must be viewed with caution.”, “Such marked yearly fluctuations in shark-human interactions, be they regional or international in scope, are not unusual,” it says. But there is no reason to let facts get in the way of a good story, especially when the villain of the story is the bogey man of “climate change.”, Follow Thomas D.

      "Former president Barack Obama’s speech on climate change in Italy raised €3 million ($3.26m) in ticket sales for his personal foundation, according to a report from The Times.[Having travelled to Milan in a private jet, Obama settled into a presidential suite at the Park Hyatt hotel, costing roughly €8,400 a night. Meanwhile, his entourage of security occupied two separate floors across the hotel, while his security detail required a convoy of 14 cars, a helicopter, and 300 extra police. advertisement, The event, which attracted 3500 people paying €850 a ticket, raised nearly €3 million, all of which will go to the Obama Foundation dedicated to “renewal and global progress.”, “When it comes to climate change, the hour is almost upon us,” Obama told the summit, urging the world to “set aside our parochial differences” to create a better planet for the world’s children. “If we seize the future, there is nothing that we cannot do … I do not believe that this planet is condemned to ever-rising temperatures,” Obama said. “I believe these are problems that were caused by man and can be solved by man.”, Obama’s visit to Italy forms part of a series of speeches in which he defends his record in office and attempts to undermine the policies of the Trump administration. In an acceptance speech after receiving the John F. Kennedy “Profile in Courage” award, Obama urged lawmakers to show “political courage” to save his landmark healthcare bill known as the Affordable Care Act. In April, Obama agreed to a $400,000 speaking fee to give a speech at the prominent Wall Street firm Cantor Fitzgerald. Responding to the news, Sen.

      "The ‘Pause’ in global warming is real and the computer models predicting dramatically increased temperatures have failed.[This is the shocking admission of a paper published this week in Nature Geoscience. It’s shocking because the paper’s lead author is none other than Ben Santer – one of the more vociferous and energetic alarmists exposed in the Climategate emails. advertisement, According to the paper’s abstract:, In the early twenty-first century, satellite-derived tropospheric warming trends were generally smaller than trends estimated from a large multi-model ensemble. And:, We conclude that model overestimation of tropospheric warming in the early twenty-first century is partly due to systematic deficiencies in some of the post-2000 external forcings used in the model simulations. Translation: the real-world temperature increases were much smaller than our spiffy, expensive computer models predicted. Its significance did not pass unnoticed by this veteran climate scientist:, Wow! \"most early 21st century…model tropospheric warming is substantially larger than observed\" https://t.co/M86CYsRdMk  h/t @RyanMaue, — Roger A. Pielke Sr (@RogerAPielkeSr) June 19, 2017, , His surprise is understandable given that, previously, alarmist scientists like Ben Santer have gone to great lengths to deny the existence of a ‘Pause’ in global warming, to pour scorn on those who have argued otherwise and to insist that their computer models are fundamentally reliable. Indeed, only last week the Spectator published an article by one such Pause Denier – a scientist from the University of East Anglia (ground zero of the Climategate scandal), fondly known as the University of Easy Access, named Phil Williamson. It is titled The Great Myth of the Global Warming Pause and it claims, somewhat imaginatively:, The Paris agreement will be the future, whereas the so-called global-warming hiatus is already history. And let’s not forget that in the dog days of the Obama administration, alarmist scientists were so desperate to pooh pooh the “Pause” in the run up to the Paris climate talks that they concocted a junk science paper – now the subject of a federal investigation – which used dodgy data to try to airbrush the Pause out of history. Truly, as the Daily Caller notes, the alarmists’ flip-flopping on this subject has of late been remarkable. Do they believe in the ‘Pause’ (or ‘hiatus’ as they sometimes term it) or don’t they?, Santer recently co-authored a separate paper that purported to debunk statements EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt made that global warming had “leveled off.” But Santer’s paper only evaluated a selectively-edited and out-of-context portion of Pruitt’s statement by removing the term “hiatus.”, Moreover, climate scientists mocked Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz for talking about the global warming “hiatus” during a 2015 congressional hearing. Instead, activist scientists worked hard to airbrush the global warming slowdown from data records and advance media claim that it was a “myth.”, Santer and Carl Mears, who operate the Remote Sensing System satellite temperature dataset, authored a lengthy blog post in 2016 critical of Cruz’s contention there was an 18-year “hiatus” in warming that climate models didn’t predict. The fact that Ben Santer is involved in this embarrassing retraction – his admission on the Pause is bad enough, but what the paper says about the unreliability of the computer models is breathtaking in its implications – will be particularly piquant to those who remember his prominent role in the Climategate emails. Santer revealed himself to be one of the nastier and more aggressive members of Michael Mann’s “Hockey” team when he emailed one of his colleagues:, Next time I see Pat Michaels at a scientific meeting, I’ll be tempted to beat the crap out of him. Very tempted. (Climatologist Pat Michaels, now of the Cato Institute, incurred Santer’s wrath by being one of the first climate scientists to pour cold water on Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming theory. In other words, Michaels made the disgusting, punishment-worthy error of using actual science and being right). But perhaps Santer’s lowest point was the occasion where he effectively hijacked one of the early IPCC Assessment Reports and ramped up the scaremongering in a way that had rather more to do with political activism than it did to science. I describe it in my book Watermelons:, Ben who? Well quite. Unless his name rings a bell as the guy from the Climategate emails who wanted to “beat the crap out of” climate sceptic Pat Michaels, you almost certainly won’t have heard of him. Yet in the mid-90s this climate modeling nonenity was somehow placed in the extraordinary position of being able to dictate world opinion on global warming at the stroke of a pen. He achieved this in his role as “lead author” of Chapter 8 of the scientific working group report on the IPCC’s Second Assessment Report (SAR). Nothing to write home about there, you might think, except that Santer was personally responsible for by far the most widely reported sentence in the entire report: the one from the Summary for Policy Makers (the only part of the IPCC’s Assessment Report most people actually bother to read) claiming “the balance of evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence on global climate.”, But was this line actually true? Was this really a fair summary – the kind of summary the IPCC purports rigorously and definitively to give of us – of the general state of scientific understanding at that particular moment? Er, well not according to some of the scientists who’d contributed to that chapter of the report, no. The original version of the chapter – as agreed on and signed off by all 28 contributing authors – expressed considerably more doubt about AGW than was indicated in Santer’s summary. It included these passages:, “None of the studies cited above has shown clear evidence that we can attribute the observed changes to the specific cause of increases in greenhouse gases.”, “No study to date has positively attributed all or part (of the climate change observed) to (man-made) causes.”, “Any claims of positive detection and attribution of significant climate change are likely to remain controversial until uncertainties in the total natural variability of the climate system are reduced.”, “When will an anthropogenic climate be identified? It is not surprising that the best answer to the question is “We do not know.”, Strangely, none of these passages made it to the final draft. They were among 15 deleted after the event by Santer, who also inserted a phrase entirely of his own to the effect that “the body of statistical evidence” now “points to a discernible human influence on climate.” In other words the chapter did not represent the “consensus” position reached by 28 scientists. What it in fact represented was the scientifically unsupported opinion of one man, Benjamin D Santer. We climate rationalists do still get an awful lot of stick from the alarmists for our old fashioned belief that scientists should stick to the evidence and use actual data rather than plucking stuff from thin air based on their fanciful notions of what ought to be true or what might get them more grant-funding. How delightful it is to have it confirmed – albeit in the arid language of a science paper – that yet again are 100 percent correct.\n",
      "A new study conducted by Duke University found that hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, has not contaminated the groundwater in West Virginia.[Duke’s study found that the claim by many environmentalists that fracking contaminates the groundwater does not hold up, because the groundwater was already contaminated from methane and salts before the fracking occurred. advertisement, “Based on consistent evidence from comprehensive testing, we found no indication of groundwater contamination over the three-year course of our study,” Avner Vengosh, the professor of geochemistry and water quality at Duke’s Nicholas School of the Environment, said. Vengosh and other scientists concluded that, while fracking did not contaminate the groundwater, accidental spills of fracking wastewater could pose a threat to surface water in the area. ”However, we did find that spill water associated with fracked wells and their wastewater has an impact on the quality of streams in areas of intense shale gas development,” Vengosh added. “The bottom-line assessment,” he continued, “is that groundwater is so far not being impacted, but surface water is more readily contaminated because of the frequency of spills.”, Researchers collected water samples from 112 drinking wells in northwestern West Virginia and studied them over a three year period. They sampled 20 of the water wells before drilling or fracking started in the area in order to obtain a baseline for later comparisons. Duke’s study draws similar conclusions to the scientific studies from regulatory bodies, academics, and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) that determined that fracking has not contaminated groundwater or drinking water.\n",

      "Finally the Trump administration is starting to get serious about taking on the Green Blob.[EPA administrator Scott Pruitt – perhaps stung by criticisms that he was turning into a squish – today reaffirmed, in an interview with CNBC, that he is not a believer in catastrophic man-made global warming. advertisement, “I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do and there’s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact. So no, I would not agree that it’s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see. But we don’t know that yet…”, This new boldness coincides with a purge of warmist scientific advisers at both the EPA and the Interior Department. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has chosen to replace half of the members on one of its key scientific review boards, while Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is “reviewing the charter and charge” of more than 200 advisory boards, committees, and other entities both within and outside of his department. EPA and Interior officials began informing outside advisers of the move on Friday, and notifications continued over the weekend. Pruitt’s move could significantly change the makeup of the 18-member Board of Scientific Counselors, which advises EPA’s key scientific arm on whether the research it does has sufficient rigor and integrity. All of the members being dismissed were at the end of serving at least one three-year term, although these terms are often renewed instead of terminated. Among the tragic victims is Robert Richardson, a Michigan professor and “ecological economist”, who tweeted movingly about his martyrdom. Today, I was Trumped.

Oh dear. How sad. Never mind. But the biggest sign of Trump’s commitment to slaying the Green Blob is expected tomorrow when we’ll finally hear whether or not the president means to keep his election promise to pull the US out of the Paris climate agreement. If this happens it will be a disaster for the U.S. with the only beneficiary being White House chief strategist Steve Bannon. At least that’s what environmental journalist David Roberts claims in Vox. Given that Roberts is the guy who once called for Nuremberg-style trials for climate skeptics perhaps his views should be taken with a pinch of salt. Nonetheless, he is quite right when he argues that whether the U.S. stays in or out of Paris it will make little difference on the policy front. [The agreement] asks participants only to state what they are willing to do and to account for what they’ve done. It is, in a word, voluntary. Roberts suspects, as I do, that the legalistic reasons being advanced for pulling out of Paris have probably been overdone. But whatever works is fine by me. The important thing is for the U.S. to pull out of Paris not in order to facilitate exit from Obama’s Clean Power Plan or to avert legal action from politicized litigators like the Sierra Club but purely as an upward extension of the presidential middle finger to the bloated, corrupt and overmighty Climate Industrial Complex. If and when Trump pulls the U.S. out of Paris it won’t be the end for the Green Blob, nor even the beginning of the end. But it might, perhaps, be the end of the beginning. It will be arguably the first big signal by any major leader of the Western world that the tide on the Great Global Warming Scam is about to turn and that the Alarmists are about to be crushed by fortune’s wheel.\n",

      "The executive director of the environmentalist Sierra Club said that abortion is a critical tool for protecting the environment from the threat of overpopulation.[On Thursday, the Sierra Club’s Michael Brune appeared on Fox News Channel’s Tucker Carlson Tonight to argue for the importance of “reproductive rights” as a means of culling the world’s population and protecting the environment. advertisement, Brune said that abortion “helps to address the number of the people that we have on this planet. We feel that one of the ways in which we can get to a sustainable population is to empower women to make choices about their own families.”, When abortion is legalized, Brune suggested, it helps keep the population from expanding out of control. “We believe in empowering women’s rights. We believe that women who have rights and who have the ability to have choice about their reproductive—make their own reproductive choices—will help to produce strong families and will help to protect the environment at the same time.”, “Sierra club is pro-choice, Brune said. , On January 14, the Sierra Club issued a statement summoning Americans to join Planned Parenthood and other organizations in protesting President Donald Trump. “Today, the Sierra Club is mobilizing its members across the country to join Center for Community Change, United We Dream, SEIU, Planned Parenthood, the Human Rights Campaign and other allies in national-day-of-action rallies to support immigrants and oppose Trump’s xenophobia,” the statement read. Curiously, Michael Brune said that Sierra would speak out and show up in support of immigrants and families threatened by Trump’s “hateful promises to deport millions,” while simultaneously supporting abortion policies aimed at eliminating large numbers of the population. Earlier this week Brune issued a statement opposing Trump’s nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, describing Gorsuch as “more extreme than Justice Scalia.”, “Gorsuch has proven himself hostile to environmental protection, women’s rights, and the rights of workers and cannot be trusted to protect our air, our water, or our communities,” Brune said in a statement.

      "In his final address to America’s armed forces, President Barack Obama reminded troops that once Donald J. Trump becomes president, soldiers have a duty to question his authority and criticize him. Obama also said the Second Amendment and global warming can be blamed for terrorism.[Obama stood before soldiers at MacDill Air Force Base, in Tampa, Florida on Tuesday, December 6, to talk about “the foundation that we will leave for the next administration,” CNSNews.com reported. advertisement, Characterizing the military’s mission as a fight against “violent extremism,” Obama insisted that soldiers need to rise up against Trump if they feel he is pushing policies that are ill considered. Obama told the troops, “each of us has…the universal right to speak your minds and to protest against authority to live in a society that’s open and free that can criticize our president without retribution.”, Obama went on to insist that a proper U.S. policy against “violent extremism” is a “long term” policy. “So rather than offer false promises that we can eliminate terrorism by dropping more bombs or deploying more and more troops or fencing ourselves off from the rest of the world,” Obama said, “we have to take a long view of the terrorist threat. And we have to pursue a smart strategy that can be sustained. In the time remaining, let me just suggest what I think should guide this approach.”, The lame duck president also went on to blame terrorism on the Second Amendment and global warming. In addressing the war-torn Middle East, Obama insisted that global warming forms a large part of that conflict. “A changing climate is increasing competition for food and water,” which, he claimed, drives the conflict in Syria and other nearby nations. Obama also blamed the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution for “violent extremism” in the United States. “Somebody who is trying to kill and willing to be killed is dangerous, particularly when we live in a country where it’s very easy for that person to buy a very powerful weapon,” Obama insisted. The presidential short-timer also placed blame on the Constitution’s First Amendment, hinting that he thinks free speech is too freely indulged to prevent “impressionable minds” from being warped by “extremism” on the Internet. Obama touted his efforts to limit the reach of terror recruiters online saying, “We’ve worked with our tech sector to support efforts to push back on terrorist messages on social media that motivate people to kill.”, The president also defended Islam against the charge of extremism:, We are fighting terrorists who claim to fight on behalf of Islam. But they do not speak for over a billion Muslims around the world, and they do not speak for American Muslims including many who wear the uniform of the United States of America’s military. If we stigmatize good patriotic Muslims, that just feeds the terrorists’ narrative. It fuels the same false grievances they they use to motivate people to kill. If we act like this is a war between the United States and Islam, we’re not gonna lose more Americans to terrorist attacks, but we’ll also lose the sight of the very principles we claim to defend, As to the rise of ISIS, Obama insisted it was not given aide by his actions of pulling out of Iraq in 2011 but was instead given succor by the policies of George W. Bush. “By 2011, Iraqis wanted our military presence to end, and they were unwilling to sign a new status of forces agreement to protect our troops from prosecution if they were trying to defend themselves in Iraq,” Obama proclaimed. “In addition, maintaining American troops in Iraq at the time could not have reversed the forces that contributed to ISIL’s rise.”, Obama added, “Some of the mistakes of the 2003 invasion have helped to give rise to the organization that became ISIL in the first place.”, Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.\n",
      "Ivanka Trump has been tapped by her father, President Donald Trump, to review the United States’ commitment to the Paris Climate Change agreement, signed by former President Barack Obama as an executive agreement in 2015 without congressional approval, the Associated Press is reporting.[The agreement requires countries to cut greenhouse emissions on a country-by-country basis, with Obama committing the U.S. to reduce carbon emissions by at least 26 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. advertisement, The U.S. is expected to have a representative at the United Nations’ climate change meeting in Bonn, Germany, next week but Trump’s advisers — including daughter Ivanka and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt — are meeting on Tuesday in Washington to decide whether to stick with or withdraw from the deal. Last month, in an interview with FOX and Friends, Pruitt said that the “Paris [agreement] is something that we need to really look at closely. It’s something we need to exit, in my opinion. It’s a bad deal for America. It was an America second, third, or fourth kind of approach. “China and India had no obligations under the agreement until 2030,” Pruitt added. “We front-loaded all of our costs.”, Trump, on the other hand, has expressed support for the agreement and has backing from some in the U.S. oil and gas industry, including Exxon Mobil, which was led by Rex Tillerson before he was nominated for Secretary of State, a post he now holds. “The industry campaign to stick with the Paris accord comes amid deep divisions in the Trump administration over the carbon-cutting agreement,” Bloomberg reported last month. “Both the president’s daughter, Ivanka Trump, and her husband, Jared Kushner, a White House special adviser, have urged the president to stay in the deal, along with Tillerson.”, “The decision to participate in next week’s U.N. climate talks shouldn’t be construed as a sign that Trump has decided to stay in the Paris pact,” a State Department official told the AP. “To the contrary, the U.S. will be sending a ‘much smaller’ delegation than it has in years past, the official said, adding that they weren’t authorized to discuss specifics and requested anonymity from the AP. According to the United Nations, 144 of the 197 countries that signed the Paris agreement have ratified it. It is unclear which 53 countries have not ratified it.\n",
      "“Hoist by his own petard.”[This is the phrase Shakespeare invented for “being blown up by your own bomb.” It’s also the perfect description for what has happened to one of the RICO 20 – the climate alarmist tenured professors who wrote to President Obama last year demanding that he use racketeering laws to prosecute climate “deniers.”, advertisement, The RICO plan of attack was devised by the green activist Senator Sheldon Whitehouse. It has since been controversially endorsed by Attorney General Loretta Lynch who admitted earlier this week that the matter had been “discussed” by the Department of Justice and “referred to the FBI.”, But if the courtroom exchange below is anything to go by, using lawfare to harass skeptics is going to backfire horribly – and for a very simple reason. All the fraudulent and dishonest behaviour to do with “global warming” has been committed not by the skeptics but by climate alarmists. What’s quite astonishing – not to mention squirm-inducingly embarrassing but also deliciously enjoyable in a Schadenfreude-on-steroids kind of way – is just how completely unaware of their own weakness these climate alarmists are. Consider Specimen A. His name is Professor Edward Maibach, he runs the Center for Climate Change Communication at George Mason University (GMU), and is the guy who actually drafted the RICO 20 letter calling for the legal pursuit of climate skeptics. Unfortunately one of the big mistakes they made was writing the letter on GMU headed note paper rather than in a private capacity. This gave the Competitive Enterprise Institute the perfect excuse to bring a FOIA case in order to “obtain documents shedding light on how taxpayer-funded professors used their public positions and resources in this campaign.”, The result was the extremely sticky exchange below as Maibach was cross-examined by petitioners Chris Horner and Matthew Hardin, as relayed by Watts Up With That?, (If wading through the transcripts is too much just skip past and I’ll explain what’s so utterly hopeless about the Warmist position), Q. So what you’re telling me is, while you’re not aware of the specifics of RICO and how the law works, you think that what ExxonMobil specifically was doing was troubling and you wanted that stopped?, A. Correct. Q. So what is climate denial? I’ll ask that.A. What’s climate denial? Good question. Activities that are intentionally misrepresenting what is known to be true about climate change so as to convince people that climate change is not, in fact, a reality. Q. So climate denial broadly bothers you then?A. Mischaracterization of the truth specifically intended to undermine the public’s well-being, yes, typically does bother me. Q. Can you give me an example of these misrepresentations by ExxonMobil or others?A. No, not off the top of my head. …,  , Q. So you believe that someone knowingly misrepresenting a risk posed by climate change merits investigation?A. Yes, I do. Q. Okay. So if someone, for example, were to knowingly hide data indicating an increase in temperatures over the years, that would merit investigation?A. Say it again, please.Q. If someone were to hide or misrepresent or deceive the public relating to data which showed an increase in global temperatures over time, that would merit investigation?, A. It would be — I suppose it depends on who it is.  But, yes, it would certainly be a deception. And as such, it would be an act that, in my view, ought to be exposed. …, Q. So you said hiding an increase in temperatures would be a knowing deception, depending on who it is. I believe that’s what you said a  minute ago is that correct?A. Sure.Q. What if you knowingly hid a decrease in 20 global temperatures? Would that be a knowing deception?A. Sure. …, Q. I have one question — I’m sorry, Thomas, and Professor Maibach — I forgot.I want to follow up on one thing. Mr. Hardin had asked you about individuals, if they knowingly deceived the American — is – knowingly deceived the American people about the risk of climate change is the offense or what warrants investigation, right?A. In my view.Q. Okay. So if Christy and Spenser[sic]  — they  keep the satellite temperature record. If they were found to have increased — I’m sorry, not increased — hidden an increase in the temperature in the satellite record, would that warrant investigation as knowingly deceiving the American people?, A. They — they as individual climate scientists, if they are fudging their data, then I would say, yes, that would be investigation worthy.But I wouldn’t think that that would be investigation worthy by the Federal Government. I would think it would be investigation worthy by their funders or by the journals that had published their work. MR. MONCURE: You’ve already made it clear that you’re not an expert on RICO.  A. Correct.MR. HORNER: But he is an expert on what he wrote. He’s the world’s leading expert on what he wrote. And he wrote that, “knowingly deceiving the American people about the risk of climate change warrants investigation.”, BY MR. HORNER:, Q. And I’m saying, it’s not just — I mean, of all the people who know, it would seem to be climate scientists as opposed to CEOs is my premise. So as opposed to going after CEOs, how about a scientist?, If they knowingly deceived the public by hiding an increase in temperatures, does that also warrant investigation? That’s my question.A. It does.Q. Okay. What if they hide a decline in 6 temperatures? Does that warrant an investigation?A. Any knowing deception warrants – in science warrants an investigation. Here’s the key: this GMU climate communication Professor Maibaich has been coaxed into admitting, under oath, that his own side should be investigated for climate fraud. (It is, after all, climate alarmist scientists from NOAA who have been caught fudging data to hide the “Pause”, not climate skeptics), He has also admitted that he drafted that RICO letter without knowing how RICO laws operate and without knowing precisely what kind of offense the “deniers” he wanted punished were actually guilty of. It appears, reading elsewhere through the court transcript, that he isn’t even aware that the “97 per cent” consensus figure is a much-debunked fabrication. Like the Dimock water trial – this case is a spectacular own goal for the alarmists. It reminds us of something I’ve often remarked on before: the cabal of activists, scientists, academics, shyster politicians and hacks promoting the global warming agenda are quite astonishingly low grade. They’re low grade morally – which you’d expect – but they’re also so low-grade in terms of competence, credibility and intellect that it’s quite amazing how they manage to hold down their jobs. (Probably because they mostly work in the public sector, would be my guess). What’s really going to do for the Climate Alarmists in the end, I think, though, is not so much their stupidity or their venality but their arrogance and their complacency. They’re so spoilt by being part of a protected, padded, taxpayer-funded Establishment, so used to dismissing their opponents with appeals to authority, ad hominems and bully boy tactics that they’ve completely lost sight of how weak their position is. I noticed this in a recent debate with Buzzfeed science editor Tom Chivers. It became apparent that, in common with so many of the journalists who have been toeing the Warmist party line, he still thinks that we so-called “deniers” are just a bunch of science-denying kooks touting a bunch of wacko conspiracy theories. He clearly hadn’t grasped, for example, the significance of the NOAA scandal. (And similar ones at NASA). When your guys have been caught out cheating and making stuff up and getting their predictions wrong, it’s not enough to go “well the expert consensus is…”. Sooner or later you’re going to have to address the charges being made against you – or surrender the field. As for the case the alarmists are trying to bring against Exxon – my view is that this too will backfire, given that the evidence just doesn’t stack up. That said, knowing the way big corporations tend to cave to all manner of greenmail, it wouldn’t at all surprise me if Exxon were to try to settle such a piece of vexatious litigation out of court rather than force the alarmists actually to prove their nonsense case. But it’s never going to work with skeptical  scientists. Fred Singer, Richard Lindzen, Willie Soon, John Christy, Roy Spencer, Pat Michaels and the rest – these guys are never going to cave, first because they’ve been toughened by years of harassment and vilification, and secondly because they’ve got the science on their side. The fundamental problem faced by the “prosecute the deniers” camp is very simple: the real denialism of science and hard evidence is all on the Alarmist side – and demonstrably so in a court of law.\n",
      "Top campaign aides for Hillary Clinton gossiped over email last year after former Vice President Al Gore signaled that he wasn’t ready to endorse a candidate for president.[In November 2015, Clinton aide Cheryl Mills forwarded a People magazine article to John Podesta and Huma Abedin where Gore declined to endorse Hillary Clinton in the interview. advertisement, “Yes he warned us,” Abedin replied. When Podesta queried as to why, Abedin explained that Gore had told them when the campaign began that he wouldn’t endorse Clinton. “Curiuos (sic) – why?” asked Mills, “As he clearly expected her to endorse him as vp when he ran.”, “Well that was 16 years ago,” she wrote. “Hard to put on email but there is no love lost in this relationship. Reminder that he also refused to endorse in 2008!!!”, Mills signaled that she hoped that it would be “different” in 2016. “No. It’s bad,” Abedin replied cryptically. The emailed conversation was included in John Podesta’s private emails that were publicly released by WikiLeaks. Although the relationship was bad, the Clinton campaign successfully wooed Gore back into the fold earlier this month, nearly a year after the first interview. On October 11, Gore appeared with Clinton in Florida for a campaign event, where they both preached global warming alarmism to voters on the coast.\n",
      "After winning his first Oscar at the 88th Academy Awards in Los Angeles on Sunday, actor Leonardo DiCaprio immediately launched into a politically charged speech about climate change.[“Making The Revenant was about man’s relationship to the natural world, a world that we collectively felt in 2015 as the hottest year in recorded history,” the frequent flyer and environmental activist told the audience. “Our production needed to move to the southern tip of this planet just to be able to find snow.”, advertisement, “Climate change is real. It is happening right now,” said DiCaprio. “It is the most urgent threat facing our entire species, and we need to work collectively together and stop procrastinating.” He added:, We need to support leaders around the world who do not speak for the big polluters or the big corporations, but who speak for all of humanity, for the indigenous people of the world, for the billions and billions of underprivileged people who will be most affected by this, for our children’s children, and for those people out there whose voices have been drowned out by the politics of greed.

      "The Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) has issued a religious decree (fatwa) prohibiting the use of Christmas-themed attire or accessories that recall a tradition foreign to Islam.[The fatwa 56/2016 harshly criticized the Christmas atmosphere invading public areas of the country, calling it “a foreign culture with which we must not mingle.”, advertisement, “Religious images and accessories are used intentionally to show the identity of a certain religion, and represent its tradition and rituals,” said Hasanuddin, the head of the Council that drafted the fatwa. “For this reason, the use of non-Islamic accessories is against the law, as it is asking Muslims to wear them.”, The Islamic leader added that the fatwa had been issued in response to the Christmassy atmosphere spreading all over Indonesia, noting that such an overtly Christian environment “hurts people’s faith very much.”, The ban on Christmas apparel and adornments extends beyond Christian religious symbols such as crèche scenes or depictions of Mary, Joseph and Jesus. According to the new ruling, it is also “haram” (forbidden) to dress up as Santa Claus or to expose other external signs traditionally associated with Christmas. According to International Christian Concern, an anti-persecution advocacy group, Indonesia is presently suffering from an “increasingly emboldened radical Islamic sub-group that is applying public pressure to adhere to conservative Islamic law.” The group warned that fatwas like this may be used as a reason to attack or discriminate against non-Muslims during Christmas. On December 15th, a group from the radical Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) stormed a car dealership whose employees had been asked to wear Christmas-themed outfits, threatening the owner. The FPI instigates for the imposition of sharia law in the country. Last month, a mob of 150,000 Muslim protesters staged a major march in the capital city of Jakarta, calling for the death penalty for the capital’s Christian governor. Along with the Jakarta rally, which resulted in at least one death and multiple injuries, the FPI organized similar large demonstrations in a number of other Indonesian cities on the same day. The government has mobilized some 155,000 security personnel throughout the country to help protect Christians during the Christmas season. The MUI has asked the Muslim community not to “mix” foreign, Christian traditions with the Islamic faith. They have barred the faithful from selling or buying Christmas items, or wearing any sort of Christmas apparel. Follow Thomas D. Williams on Twitter Follow @tdwilliamsrome\n",
      "Californians reject the new gas tax and vehicle registration fee increases passed by Gov. Jerry Brown and the Democrat-dominated California legislature.[Moreover, according to the director of a new study from UC Berkley’s Institute of Governmental Studies, the backlash against the gas tax could cost Democrats seats in the legislature come election time. advertisement, SB 1 passed through both houses of the California legislature in April. The new UC Berkley study found that even in deep blue California, 58 percent of voters oppose the bill, and39 percent strongly oppose it, according to the Sacramento Bee. The only region of the state not to oppose the bill was the left-heavy Bay Area. Only strongly liberal voters supported the law. All racial and ethnic sub-groups surveyed opposed it, as did every respondent 30 or older. The 18-29 group was evenly divided between favor and opposition. Only 35 percent of voters were for the tax increase. Poll director Mark DiCamillo predicted that hitting people’s pocketbooks could alarm them and result in political backlash in “competitive” legislative districts, according to the report. The law starts going into effect on November 1, when drivers will see a 12-cent-per-gallon tax increase included in their gas prices, and 50% of a 20-cent-per-gallon increase in the diesel excise tax. The new law also allows for an inflation adjustment on both gas and diesel. Next January 1, those registering their cars in the state can expect registration fee increases between $25 and $175 dollars. The fee increase is based on vehicle value and will also adjust for inflation. Zero-emission vehicle owners will not escape the hit from the new law, either. Starting July 1, 2020, zero-emission vehicle models 2020 and later will see a new $100 annual vehicle registration fee. That fee is is also adjustable for inflation. The California Senate Appropriations Committee estimated in its bill analysis that the law would raise $52.4 billion in transportation revenues over 10 years. The money would be divided up almost equally between local and state purposes. The only Senate Democrat to vote against the bill was Steve Glazer of Orinda. Following his vote, he said he opposed the tax because his constituents were 2-to-1 against the bill, according to the San Jose Mercury News. The Bee pointed to Fullerton Democrat Sen. Josh Newman’s district as a potential early indicator of how the tax and fee increase could affect legislative races in 2018. Newman’s opponents have launched a recall effort and are using his support for the fee increases as an argument against him. He won his current seat by fewer than 2,500 votes in 2016. Republican Assemblyman Travis Allen (R-Huntington Beach) has spearheaded his own effort to put a gas tax repeal on the 2018 ballot. Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana \n",
      " The article below was contributed by Istvan Marko, J. Scott Armstrong, William M. Briggs, Kesten Green, Hermann Harde, David R. Legates, Christopher Monckton of Brenchley, and Willie Soon.[On June 2, 2017, in a Letter regarding US withdrawal from Paris climate agreement addressed to the MIT community, Professor Rafael Reif, president of MIT, criticized President Trump’s decision to exit the Paris Climate Accords. In this refutation, we propose to clarify the scientific understanding of the Earth’s climate and to dispel the expensively fostered popular delusion that man-made global warming will be dangerous and that, therefore, the Paris Agreement would be beneficial. advertisement, Professor Reif wrote, “Yesterday, the White House took the position that the Paris climate agreement – a landmark effort to combat global warming by reducing greenhouse gas emissions – was a bad deal for America.”, There is no science unambiguously establishing that CO2 is the chief cause of the warming observed since the end of the Little Ice Age. The opposite has been repeatedly demonstrated. Ice cores have revealed that changes in CO2 concentration follow, rather than precede, changes in temperature. During the last deglaciation, the latest high-resolution records show atmospheric CO2 lagging temperature by 50 to 500 years. Our enterprises and industries return to the air some of the CO2 that was formerly present there, and some warming may be expected. That warming will be small and beneficial. Professor Humlum and colleagues have demonstrated that changes in CO2 concentration follow changes in temperature after about 8-11 months. The time-lag between changes in temperature and consequent changes in CO2 concentration are caused by outgassing of CO2 from the oceans when they warm and uptake by the oceans as they cool. In addition, the growth rate of the atmospheric CO2 has been slowing recently, linked to an enhanced terrestrial biosphere uptake. Our contribution to atmospheric CO2 adds to the effect of these fluctuations, but it does not add much. One of us (Harde 2017) has reached similar conclusions. Professor Reif’s assertion that global temperatures can be regulated by an international agreement to atone for our sins of emission is, therefore, at odds with scientific knowledge regarding cause and effect. King Canute’s warning to his English courtiers in 1032 A.D. that even the divinely anointed monarch could not command sea level should be heeded by bombastic intergovernmental agencies a millennium later. The professor’s assertion is, moreover, logically invalid, since the Paris agreement permits China and India to industrialize without limit on their emissions. Besides, the Paris agreement is not binding. Under its terms, no nation is compelled to sin no more, and many – even including Germany and Denmark, the leaders in renewable energies – now appear unlikely to meet the agreement’s targets. The Paris agreement is, in practice, a political tool for suppressing growth and redistributing wealth. Dr. Rajendra Pachauri, former chairman of the IPCC, said, in resigning in 2015, that the environment was his “religion,” and Ms. Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change until last year, openly stated in 2015 that the goal was to overturn capitalism — in her words, “to change the economic development model that has been reigning for at least 150 years, since the industrial revolution.”, Professor Reif writes, “The scientific consensus is overwhelming.”, The late author Michael Crichton, in his Caltech Michelin Lecture 2003, said, “In science consensus is irrelevant. … There is no such thing as consensus science. If it’s consensus, it isn’t science. If it’s science, it isn’t consensus. Period.” Doubt is the seedcorn of science. Consensus is a political notion which, when pleaded, indicates that the pleader is totalitarian. As Abu Ali ibn al-Haytham said in the eleventh century:, The seeker after truth [his splendid definition of the scientist] does not place his faith in any mere consensus, however venerable or widespread. Instead, he subjects what he has learned of it to his hard-won scientific knowledge, and to investigation, inspection, inquiry, checking, checking and checking again. The road to the truth is long and hard, but that is the road we must follow. The alleged “consensus” is nothing more than an agreement that the weather has warmed in the past 300 years. Yet the quantum and attribution of warming are hotly debated among climatologists. Even today, measuring global temperature is subject to errors, biases, missing data, and subjective adjustments. The estimation of global average temperature from satellite data is relatively new and employs a completely different temperature measurement method from the older methods. Nevertheless, the satellite data and balloon data have provided essentially identical estimates. Neither displays a worrying trend. Both are increasingly at odds not only with the surface temperature records, all of which have been adjusted ex post facto so as to show more warming than the original raw data showed, but also with the alarming projections of the serially unreliable computer models of climate on which the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change profitably but misguidedly relies. Scientists agree that climate changes. It has done so since the first wisps of the Earth’s atmosphere formed, but they disagree on the causes of climate changes, including the mild warming since the Little Ice Age. Legates et al. (2015), for example, found that only 0.3 percent of 11,944 peer-reviewed articles on climate and related topics, published during the 21 years of 1991 to 2011, had explicitly stated that recent warming was mostly man-made. Professor Reif wrote, “As human activities emit more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, the global average surface temperature will continue to rise, driving rising sea levels and extreme weather.”, In the last 20 years, we have released more than a third of all the CO2 produced since the beginning of the industrial period. Yet global mean surface temperature has remained essentially constant for 20 years, a fact that has been acknowledged by the IPCC, whose models failed to predict it. NOAA’s State of the Climate report for 2008 said that periods of 15 years or more without warming would indicate a discrepancy between prediction and observation – i.e. that the models were wrong. Just before the recent naturally occurring el Niño event raised global temperature, there had been 18 years and 9 months without any global warming at all. The climate models relied upon by the IPCC and the politicians they advise have predicted warming at about twice the rate observed during the past 27 years, during which the Earth has warmed at 0.4 °C, about half of the 0.75 °C 27-year warming rate implicit in IPCC’s explicit 1990 prediction that there would be 1.0 °C warming from 1990-2025.  , Green and Armstrong (2014) conducted longer-term validation tests of the models and found that their forecasts were much less accurate than assuming there had been no global warming at all. The relative inaccuracy of the IPCC projections increased with longer (multi-decadal) horizons. Even forecasts of natural global cooling at a rate of 1 ºC per century were much more accurate over long periods than the IPCC’s projections of dangerous man-made global warming. Ten years ago, Al Gore asserted that global temperatures had reached a dangerous “tipping point,” with extreme warming imminent and unavoidable. Professor Scott Armstrong challenged Mr. Gore to a ten-year bet based on the Green-Armstrong-Soon (2009)) scientific no-change forecast of global mean temperatures. Mr. Gore declined the bet, but theclimatebet.com website keeps track of how the bet would have turned out. With the ten-year life of the bet due to end at the end of this year, the cumulative monthly error in the IPCC’s business-as-usual 0.3 ºC per decade prediction is 22 percent larger than the error from the benchmark prediction of no warming at all. Why does Professor Reif continue to champion the notion of dangerous manmade global warming when it is so greatly at odds with observation?, Professor Reif wrote, As human activities emit more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, the global average surface temperature will continue to rise, driving rising sea levels and extreme weather.”, The average sea level rise since 1870 has been 1.3-1.5 mm (about a twentieth of an inch) per year. Professor Nils-Axel Mörner, a renowned sea-level researcher who has published more than 500 peer-reviewed articles on this topic, has been unable to find observational evidence that supports the models’ predictions of dramatically accelerating sea level rise. Professor Reif wrote, “As human activities emit more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, the global average surface temperature will continue to rise, driving rising sea levels and extreme weather.”, Observations during the last few decades indicate that extreme events, including tornadoes and hurricanes, have been decreasing, rather than increasing, both in number and in intensity. Moreover, the total accumulated cyclonic energy has also been declining. As MIT Emeritus Professor Richard Lindzen has explained, the decline in storminess is a consequence of reduced temperature differentials between the tropics and exo-tropics that arise when global average temperatures are warmer. Professor Reif wrote, “As the Pentagon describes it, climate change is a “threat multiplier” because its direct effects intensify other challenges, including mass migrations and zero-sum conflicts over existential resources like water and food.”, Milder temperatures and increased CO2 levels green the planet, instead of browning it. Deserts are retreating, and vegetation cover has increased throughout recent decades. The production of maize, wheat, rice, and soybeans is at a record high. More CO2 in the air helps plants by CO2 fertilization. Our planet has seen more than 20 percent greening during the past three decades, half of which is due to the action of CO2. Forecasts of droughts are also not borne out by experience. For example, since the now-former Australian Chief Climate Commissioner Professor Tim Flannery warned that dams would no longer fill owing to lack of rain, Australia has been subjected to a series of dramatic floods and overflowing dams. Governments’ naïve belief in Professor Flannery’s warnings appear to have led to policy actions and omissions that exacerbated flooding and failed to take full advantage of the rainfall when it came. The most comprehensive recent study of the worldwide extent of droughts (Hao et al. 2014) found that for 30 years the percentage of the Earth’s land mass under drought or severe drought has been declining. Though the U.N. Environment Program had published in 2005 a document predicting 50 million climate refugees by 2010, to date there have been no bona fide climate refugees. Nor has mass migration owing to global warming been observed. The one person recognized as a climate refugee had his demand rejected by the Supreme Court of New Zealand. He has returned to his island home, where he remains safe from inundation. Professor Reif wrote, “The carbon dioxide our cars and power plants emit today will linger in the atmosphere for a thousand years.”, The average residence time of a CO2 molecule in the Earth’s atmosphere is about four to seven years. Taking into account multiple exchanges leads to an estimate of a mean lifespan of 40 years (Harde 2017). Rather than a problem, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is the prime nutrient for plants. Indeed, plants grow more strongly when CO2 concentrations are much higher than they currently are, which is why commercial greenhouses add CO2 to the air. The current CO2 concentration is higher than for 800,000 years, but it is far lower than at almost any time in the previous history of our planet. Nor is CO2 a pollutant. It is a colorless, odorless gas that is not toxic to humans and other animals even at concentrations much higher than we are currently experiencing. It is also one of the most important fuels for phytoplankton, which use carbon dioxide for energy and that release oxygen. Up to 75 percent of the oxygen present in the air originates in the phytoplankton photosynthetic water-splitting process. Moreover, during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras, there were long periods during which the levels of CO2 were much higher than today, but the temperatures were far colder. We are not aware of any explanation that squares the man-made global warming theory with that fact. Professor Reif wrote, “In 2016 alone, solar industry employment grew by 25 percent, while wind jobs grew 32 percent.”, Growing jobs by subsidy is easy, provided that one cares nothing for the far greater number of jobs destroyed by the additional taxation, energy price hikes, or public borrowing necessary to pay for the subsidy. Several studies have shown that the creation of one “green” job results in the loss of two jobs elsewhere in the economy. Despite all those subsidies, solar power accounts for 0.9 percent and wind generation for 5.6 percent of total U.S. electricity production. Electricity itself is a small fraction of total energy consumption, including transportation, industrial processes, and heating. The so-called alternative energy companies survive through heavy subsidies and supportive regulations. For example, SunEdison received $1.5 billion in subsidies and loan guarantees, and yet it was compelled to file for bankruptcy. Solyndra is another example. So-called “renewable” energy is cripplingly expensive to the customer but is often unprofitable even after massive subsidies from taxpayers. Europe is suffering from political rejection of fossil fuels: energy prices have soared, millions of poor people are unable to pay their energy bills, and energy-intensive businesses are relocating to where energy is cheaper. Theirs is not an example the U.S. should wish to follow. By withdrawing from the Paris agreement, President Trump did a wonderful thing for America and the world. He showed that advocacy masquerading as science should not be the basis for political decisions. He showed that to put America first is to put the planet first. And, by rejecting the non-problem of man-made global warming, he began the long and necessary process of waking up the likes of Professor Reif to the fact that the diversion of time, effort, and trillions of dollars away from real environmental problems and towards the bogus but (to MIT) profitable non-problem of supposedly catastrophic global warming is as bad for the planet as it is for true science.\n",
      "Over the next few days and weeks you will hear lots and lots of stories about how 2015 was the “Hottest Year Evah”.[Every time you do so, reach for your Browning. Whoever makes this claim will be an idiot, a liar, a charlatan – or, in the case of many establishment climate scientists, most likely all three. advertisement, I’ll explain why in a moment. But first, meet the morons:, Peter Hannam, Environment Editor of the Sydney Morning Herald, At some point, you would think most climate change deniers would throw in the towel. Fifteen of the 16 hottest years on record have happened this century and the other year wasn’t much earlier, in 1998. And 2015 was a breakaway year. Joe Rottweiler, George Soros’s pet Romm, We just lived in the hottest year on record, Some guy in the National Journal, Glob­al tem­per­at­ures in 2015 were the warmest since re­cord-keep­ing began—and it wasn’t even close. This other guy in the New York Times, From the publicly available data, Ewert made an unbelievable discovery: Between the years 2010 and 2012 the data measured since 1881 were altered so that they showed a significant warming, especially after 1950. […] A comparison of the data from 2010 with the data of 2012 shows that NASA-GISS had altered its own datasets so that especially after WWII a clear warming appears – although it never existed. 3. NOAA is just as bad, Whether this represents mere incompetence or calculated fraud by NOAA is for future courts to decide. What we do know is that the problem dates back at least to the 1990s when, for some unexplained reason, NOAA decided to halve the number of weather stations used for its official records. Even more mysteriously, the ones it chose to keep tended to show more global warming while the ones it rejected tended to show much less. 4. According to the satellites it was only the third warmest year (since 1979), , , As you can see 1998 was hotter so was 2010. And that’s just in the years since satellite records began in 1979. The planet has been hotter than this many times before, most recently during the Medieval Warming Period. 5. The claim is meaningless anyway, Here’s how Dr. Richard Lindzen, an emeritus Alfred P. Sloan Professor of Meteorology at the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences at MIT, puts it:, “I urge you when looking at a graph, check the scales! The uncertainty here is tenths of a degree.”, “When someone points to this and says this is the warmest temperature on record. What are they talking about? It’s just nonsense. This is a very tiny change period. And they are arguing over hundredths of a degree when it is uncertain in tenths of a degree.”, “And the proof that the uncertainty is tenths of a degree are the adjustments that are being made. If you can adjust temperatures to 2/10ths of a degree, it means it wasn’t certain to 2/10ths of a degree.”,  \n",

      "The evidence for man-made climate change is so flimsy that you might just as well believe in magic, says one of the world’s top physicists.[Richard Lindzen, Alfred P Sloan Professor of Atmospheric Sciences, Emeritus at Massachussetts Institute of Technology, has long expressed doubts about the “science” behind anthropogenic global warming theory. (h/t Paul Homewood), advertisement, Now, in probably his most comprehensive and devastating assault yet on the Climate Industrial Complex, Lindzen shreds every one of the fake-science arguments used by the environmentalists to justify their hugely expensive “global warming” scare story. The 97% meme, This is a fabrication designed to make idiots feel like experts. As Lindzen puts it:, The [’97 per cent of scientists believe in global warming’] claim is meant to satisfy the non-expert that he or she has no need to understand the science. Mere agreement with the 97% will indicate that one is a supporter of science and superior to anyone denying disaster. This actually satisfies a psychological need for many people. But, he explains, it’s just a trick created by pretending that all the scientists who agree that humans make a contribution to global warming (ie almost everyone) also agree with the alarmist theory that global warming is catastrophic, unprecedented and within man’s control. Which simply isn’t the case. The ‘warmest years on record’ meme, Alarmists have been shrieking a lot recently that most of the hottest years on record – 14 out of 15, according to the UN – have happened since 2000. This is silly for a number of reasons, Lindzen explains. First, warmth is not necessarily bad or worrying thing:, It begins with the ridiculous presumption that any warming whatsoever (and, for that matter, any increase in CO2) is bad, and proof of worse to come. We know that neither of these presumptions is true. People retire to the Sun Belt rather than to the arctic. CO2 is pumped into greenhouses to enhance plant growth. Second, it doesn’t – as some idiots believe – mean that global warming hasn’t paused for the last twenty years. Of course, if 1998 was the hottest year on record, all the subsequent years will also be among the hottest years on record. None of this contradicts the fact that the warming (ie, the increase of temperature) has ceased. Third, the differences in temperature are so small as to be almost unmeasurable and are open to all manner of fraudulent adjustments by politically motivated climate gatekeepers. The extreme weather meme, The idea that we are experiencing more “extreme weather” events because of “climate change” is plain dishonest. Roger Pielke, Jr. actually wrote a book detailing the fact that there is no trend in virtually any extreme event (including tornados, hurricanes, droughts, floods, etc.) with some actually decreasing. Even the UN’s IPCC acknowledges that there is no basis for attributing such events to anthropogenic climate change. In fact, its pure propaganda designed to scare the ignorant:, The claims of extreme weather transcend the usual use of misleading claims. They often amount to claims for the exact opposite of what is actually occurring. The object of the claims is simply to be as scary as possible, and if that requires claiming the opposite of the true situation, so be it. Sea level rise, Not a problem:, Globally averaged sea level appears to have been rising at the rate of about 6 inches a century for thousands of years. Arctic sea ice, After decreasing in the Arctic for a period and increasing in the Antarctic it now appears to be stabilizing. But so what?, All one can say, at this point, is that the behavior of arctic sea ice represents one of the numerous interesting phenomena that the earth presents us with, and for which neither the understanding nor the needed records exist. It probably pays to note that melting sea ice does not contribute to sea level rise. Moreover, man has long dreamt of the opening of this Northwest Passage. It is curious that it is now viewed with alarm. Polar bear meme, I suspect that Al Gore undertook considerable focus-group research to determine the remarkable effectiveness of the notion that climate change would endanger polar bears. His use of an obviously photo shopped picture of a pathetic polar bear on an ice float suggests this. Ocean acidification, This is again one of those obscure claims that sounds scary but doesn’t stand up to scrutiny. Ever since the acid rain scare, it has been realized that the public responds with alarm to anything with the word ‘acid’ in it. […], […] As usual, there is so much wrong with this claim that it takes a fairly long article to go over it all. I recommend the following source. Death of coral reefs, Somewhat exaggerated…, The reasoned response to this [alarmist Nature] paper is provided here. As Steele, the author of the above, points out, bleaching has common causes other than warming and is far from a death sentence for corals whose capacity to recover is substantial. This article is a bit polemical, but essentially correct. Global warming as the cause of everything, Hardly anyone has the time and energy to deal with the huge number of claims. Fortunately, most are self-evidently absurd. Nation magazine recently came up with what is a bit of a champion is this regard. CO2, it should be noted, is hardly poisonous. On the contrary, it is essential for life on our planet and levels as high as 5000 ppm are considered safe on our submarines and on the space station (current atmospheric levels are around 400 ppm, while, due to our breathing, indoor levels can be much higher). The Nation article is typical in that it makes many bizarre claims in a brief space. It argues that a runaway greenhouse effect on Venus led to temperatures hot enough to melt lead. Of course, no one can claim that the earth is subject to such a runaway, but even on Venus, the hot surface depends primarily on the closeness of Venus to the sun and the existence of a dense sulfuric acid cloud covering the planet. Relatedly, Mars, which also has much more CO2 than the earth, is much further from the sun and very cold. As we have seen many times already, such matters are mere details when one is in the business of scaring the public. Lindzen’s article is well worth reading in full, not only for the usefulness of its scientific rebuttals but also simply to enjoy the loftiness of the author’s magisterial contempt for the entire field of climate “science.”, It is the exasperated sigh of a hugely intelligent and well informed scientist absolutely sick to the back teeth of trying to explain the truth about climate change to audiences which have been brainwashed into drooling idiocy. For over 30 years, I have been giving talks on the science of climate change. When, however, I speak to a non-expert audience, and attempt to explain such matters as climate sensitivity, the relation of global mean temperature anomaly to extreme weather, that warming has decreased profoundly for the past 18 years, etc. it is obvious that the audience’s eyes are glazing over. Although I have presented evidence as to why the issue is not a catastrophe and may likely be beneficial, the response is puzzlement. I am typically asked how this is possible. After all, 97% of scientists agree, several of the hottest years on record have occurred during the past 18 years, all sorts of extremes have become more common, polar bears are disappearing, as is arctic ice, etc. In brief, there is overwhelming evidence of warming, etc. I tended to be surprised that anyone could get away with such sophistry or even downright dishonesty, but it is, unfortunately, the case that this was not evident to many of my listeners. Lindzen does not even pretend there’s a credible scientific case for the man-made global warming scare theory – because basically there just isn’t one. Believing in this theory, he concludes, is as stupid as believing in magic. I haven’t spent much time on the details of the science, but there is one thing that should spark skepticism in any intelligent reader. The system we are looking at consists in two turbulent fluids interacting with each other. They are on a rotating planet that is differentially heated by the sun. A vital constituent of the atmospheric component is water in the liquid, solid and vapor phases, and the changes in phase have vast energetic ramifications. The energy budget of this system involves the absorption and reemission of about 200 watts per square meter. Doubling CO2involves a 2% perturbation to this budget. So do minor changes in clouds and other features, and such changes are common. In this complex multifactor system, what is the likelihood of the climate (which, itself, consists in many variables and not just globally averaged temperature anomaly) is controlled by this 2% perturbation in a single variable? Believing this is pretty close to believing in magic. Instead, you are told that it is believing in ‘science.’ Such a claim should be a tip-off that something is amiss. After all, science is a mode of inquiry rather than a belief structure.\n",
      "At least 9,000 companies have left California from 2008 to 2015, according to the 378 page study by Spectrum Location Solutions titled, California’s Forty Year Legacy of Hostility to Business.[Joseph Vranich, president of site selection consultants Spectrum Location Solutions (VLS) in Irvine, found that roughly 9,000 California companies moved their headquarters or diverted projects to out-of-state locations in the last seven years due to the Golden State’s “hostile” business environment. , advertisement, Vranich reports that the bitter negative perceptions of California for business began during Jerry Brown’s first chaotic two terms as California Governor from 1975 to 1983. Things got so bad that the Governor instructed his aides in 1977 to begin wearing “California Means Business” buttons. According to the Wall Street Journal, Brown tried to convince reporters on a late 1970s junket to Japan that “Our economic climate is very good.” He added, “I think this is dissipating a good deal of the political rhetoric surrounding the business-climate talk.”, VLS points out that despite the growing anti-business environment, California’s economy grew for the next three decades due to wonderful scenery and climate, a workforce with technical expertise, and trade access to Asian nations. But since the start of the Great Recession and accelerating after Brown’s election as governor in 2009, a mass exodus of businesses from the not-so-Golden State to more “friendly” locations like Texas and Nevada occurred. Vranich told the Dallas Business Journal that companies that are leaving California to escape escalating costs and regulations can move to Texas or Nevada that have no income tax and high relative purchasing power. According to Vranich, “I even wonder if some kind of ‘business migration history’ has been made.”, VLS estimates that many former California companies that moved to more business friendly locals have experienced “astonishing” operating cost savings of 20 up to 35 percent. The top 10 states that California businesses have relocated to over the last seven years are in the following order: (1) Texas (2) Nevada (3) Arizona (4) Colorado (5) Washington (6) Oregon (7) North Carolina (8) Florida (9) Georgia and (10) Virginia. Los Angeles was at the top of the list of the 10 California counties that suffered the highest number of disinvestment events. L.A. was followed by: (2) Orange, (3) Santa Clara, (4) San Francisco, (5) San Diego, (6) Alameda, (7) San Mateo, (8) Ventura, (9) Sacramento, and (10) Riverside counties. The Tax Foundation using data from The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimated the difference in purchasing power for $100 in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Only Washington D.C. New York, and New Jersey got less purchasing power than California’s $88.97. That compares to $103.73 for neighboring Arizona and a national high of $115.34 in Alabama. VLS has found that on a national basis, Democrat-leaning northeast and west coast areas get less purchasing power for their dollars, compared to the Republican-leaning southeast and mid-west. The Tax Foundation established a direct inverse correlation between purchasing power and the percentage level of state tax rate. California, with a 13.3 percent top state tax bracket, leads the nation. Democrat-leaning and high-state-tax northeast and west coast areas have the least purchasing power and the Republican-leaning low-tax southeast and mid-west have the highest purchasing power. California had almost the lowest poverty rate in the nation in 1977 at about 11.8 percent. But after the mass migration of 9,000 businesses, California’s 16.4 percent poverty rate is substantially higher than the 14.5 percent national average and near the top overall.\n",

And I, more than any other time, we talked about Trump not telling the truth a lot over the last year. But that global warming speech to me set new standards of just being irrelevant to the facts.”, He added,”We have had a lot of presidents with a lot of disagreements but there has been an attachment to some sort of basic research, some basic contact with reality, which it seems there is a failure of intellectual virtue here and because there is some underlying physiological issues he is working out, and whatever he needs to do that, the facts have to fit that lower reality.”, Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN\n",

      "Students and faculty at Columbia University have formed a coalition called “Columbia Against Trump,” which “seeks to take action against the Trump presidency.”[Last week, over 45 students and faculty members gathered at the first meeting of the “Columbia Against Trump” group. They discussed their future activism efforts, such as their plans to send 500 students to protest at Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20th. advertisement, The Columbia Against Trump coalition is the combined effort of a number of student activist groups on campus. At the meeting, representatives from each activist group addressed the students who showed up for the inaugural meeting. The group is a combined effort of various student activist groups on campus, such as Columbia Divest for Climate Justice, and Graduate Workers of Columbia. Five representatives from these groups, including Sonam Singh, a faculty member in Barnard’s English department and member of the Barnard Contingent Faculty union, spoke on behalf of different issues and values they felt were in jeopardy. These issues included ones of hate crimes, workers’ rights, climate change, and protection of undocumented students. With these topics on the table, the speakers and the audience began to draft possible strategies that could help address these pressing issues. One of the major solutions was pressuring the administrators to take on a bigger role by mobilizing students and faculty. Students made it clear that they intend for the Columbia Against Trump coalition to be focused on activism efforts rather than as a solidarity or a group for students distressed over Trump’s presidency to come together for support. “We’re a group that is all about action we are action-oriented. It is a solidarity network, but we’re really based on action,” Sumaya Awad, a visiting student from Williams College at Columbia College, said.

Style to promote the show. advertisement, “Like, if I could snap my fingers? Trump would not be elected. That’s all,” Meester told the outlet. The actress noted that she may have opted to change an altogether different historic event had Trump not won the presidency in November. “As of right now, I feel that way,” she said. “Before Trump, I would have said that Hitler was never born. Humans are so f*cked up.”, Meester wasn’t particularly politically outspoken during the 2016 presidential campaign. But in a recent interview with beauty outlet Byrdie, the actress described the atmosphere in post-election America as “crazy” and said she found it “challenging” to constantly tune in to the news. The actress added that issues of sexism and climate change continue to plague the country. “I’m not saying we should take these issues for granted. But I think what can’t be as easily defended is the environment, and people are doing irreparable damage,” she said. “It’s pretty unbelievable that there are people out there who don’t think so. They just ignore the facts, and that’s pretty scary. Four years: Maybe we don’t have that long.”, The actress — who played socialite Blair Waldorf in the popular Gossip Girl television series — is hardly the only star to compare Trump to Nazi leader Hitler. Numerous celebrities, including John Legend, Bill Maher, Louis C.K. Eva Longoria and Cher, to name just a few, have all made the comparison. So have news outlets like the Washington Post. Adolf Hitler oversaw the slaughter of six million Jews, as well as the murders of millions of others, including Polish, Serbian, and Russian political prisoners the mentally and physically handicapped (who often underwent forced sterilization) gypsies, and gay people in concentration camps across Europe during World War II. The Nazi Holocaust of Europe’s Jews — who were singled out for destruction — is considered the most infamous genocide in modern history. Hitler’s victims were gassed to death, forced on so-called “death marches,” lined up to be shot in firing lines, and had their remains burned in crematoriums. Others starved to death or died from illnesses and diseases spread throughout the camps. Trump was elected president on November 8, 2016, and it was not immediately clear which of his policies could be reasonably compared to the death and destruction wrought by Hitler.  , Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum\n",

      "A daughter can make a man do almost anything. I know: I’ve got one and I am putty in her hands.[If she wants a pony and bats her eyelashes at me, I’ll be off in a trice to buy her a herd. Baby unicorn ponies, if that’s what she prefers. With jewels inlaid in their spiral horns and maybe some magical attachment that plays the collected works of Taylor Swift while she rides. advertisement, So I totally get where President Trump is coming from when I read reports that, under the influence of Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner, he has toned the phrasing of an Executive Order so that it no longer includes derogatory comments about the utterly useless and pointless climate deal signed in Paris in 2015 by Barack Obama. Kushner and Ivanka “intervened to strike language about the climate deal from an earlier draft of the executive order,” sources familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal. Ivanka and her husband “have been considered a moderating influence on the White House’s position on climate change and environmental issues,” WSJ reports. Now, the executive order will have no mention of the so-called Paris agreement. If it’s just a case of casual daughter-pleasing, fine. But if he actually means it than we should all start to worry. I’ve said it before but it’s worth saying again: if President Trump proves to be as radical on energy and climate as he promised to be on the campaign trail, then this, even if he achieves nothing else, will more than qualify him for a place next to the greats on Mt Rushmore. He will go down in history as the hero who slew ManBearPig: the president who, unlike his pusillanimous, career-safe, Establishment predecessors from Clinton and the Bushes to the ultimate horror that was Obama, finally had the courage, integrity and honesty to point out that the Climate Emperor is wearing no clothes the guy who brought to the end the greatest scientific scandal ever who saved Western Industrial Civilisation from the Watermelons. But it’s all very well having good instincts and good intentions. The hard part will be dealing with all the obstacles thrown in his way by the monstrously large group of special interests sometimes known as the Green Blob and sometimes as the Climate Industrial Complex. Ivanka and Jared Kushner are part of that Green Blob. So is Hollywood. So is most of the mainstream media. So are most of the colleges, corporations, law firms, NGOs, local governments, schoolteachers, and even significant elements of the Republican party, like the GOP grandees currently agitating to introduce a Carbon Tax. To get an idea of how big the problem is you should have been there at CPAC at the weekend, as I was, when Scott Pruitt – the new head of the Environmental Protection Agency, was asked what he thought about man-made climate change. He just didn’t dare say. Here he was, in the seductive and friendly company of conservative interviewer Dr Gina Loudon, in front of a 100 per cent sympathetic audience of GOP faithful, and still he fudged the question with a waffling, awkward, embarrassed, fence-sitting, evasive, non-answer. And Scott Pruitt is one of the good guys – as we know from the fact that one of the main things he was known for doing when he was Oklahoma attorney general was suing the Agency of which he is now the head. I’ve little doubt that he will do sterling work reining in the EPA’s excesses and unravelling the environmentalists’ anti-business, anti-property-rights, anti-liberty agenda. But judging on his public appearances in the fortnight since he was confirmed in the post, I’d say he’s sounding too much the cautious, career-safe politician and not enough the fearless and refreshing Trump-style radical. His first speech as administrator was all about what a thorough and competent technocrat he’s going to be. “Regulations ought to make things regular,” said Mr. Pruitt, repeating a line he used at his confirmation hearing in January. “Those that we regulate ought to know what they can expect from us.”, At CPAC, his main theme was the importance of restoring federalism and states’ rights. All sensible stuff. But if this Administration is really serious about slaying the Green Blob it’s going to have to do better than merely hiding behind the Constitution and due process. It’s going to need make a convincing case as to why all this stuff needs doing. Otherwise, the Trump Administration’s best efforts are going to be swamped by green propaganda aimed at making it look uncaring and anti-environment and unscientific. What’s so stupid is that making this case is really, really easy. I know because I did it at my three speaker events at CPAC. And if I can do it, anyone can. First, was this brilliant panel, expertly moderated by John Fund, in which blogger Tony Heller (aka Steven Goddard) and lawyer, blogger and EPA scourge Steve Milloy dealt with the basics: the climate data has been rigged by a corrupt, untrustworthy scientific establishment there has been little global warming and what there has been is entirely within natural boundaries the reason that this global scam appeals to so many different interest groups – politicians, activists, (mostly second-rate) scientists, rent-seekers etc – is that it caters to such a variety of motivations (political religious follow-the-money). Second was a talk on energy economics with the fascinating Mark Mills of the Manhattan Institute who explained why renewables are such an inadequate and unnecessarily expensive response to the massively increasing global demand for energy and why fossil fuels – especially shale gas and oil – are by far the most effective solution for at least the next few hundred years. Third was an equally enlightening talk with Dr Craig Idso of the Energy &amp Environment Legal Institute on how increased atmospheric CO2 is greening the planet – thus more than counteracting all the disasters the greenies have been predicting as CO2 levels rise. So to recap:, Man-made global warming is evidently and demonstrably not a problem. The people who pretend otherwise are crooks, liars, idiots or shills. CO2 does far more good than harm. Fossil fuels aren’t running out – especially not now we’ve discovered the game-changing technology of hydraulic fracturing – and are the ideal solution to our energy needs. Renewables are a waste of everyone’s time – and always will be. There is copious evidence to support all these statements and it’s really about time those of us on the winning side of the argument stopped pussyfooting around and apologising for being 100 per cent right. That should include everyone in the Trump administration.  No more cautious speeches equivocating as to whether carbon dioxide is a problem or not, and whether we ought to have more renewables in the mix.  This is a revolution we’ve got truth and justice on our side we owe the enemy nothing – and we really shouldn’t count our job done till we’ve crushed them, seen them driven before us and heard the lamentations of their women.\n",

      "Boston University alumni are threatening to withhold donations until the institution divests from companies that are exploring fossil fuel reserves.[A student activist group at Boston University calling themselves “DivestBU” is demanding that alumni withhold donations, according to a recent series of posts on social media. According to the students, frustrated with their lack of progress in swaying administrators and trustees into divesting their interests in the fossil fuel industry, students are now turning to alumni and asking them to pause their contributions to the university until such a change is made. advertisement, “DivestBU asks alumni to withhold donations to Boston University until it divests from companies continuing to explore for fossil fuel reserves. We expect hits to the university’s rankings, reputation, and financial reserves to force the administration to pay attention to student voices, but are dismayed that this is what it takes,” the group wrote in a Facebook post. The students are trying to obtain 2,000 alumni signatures on a petition designed to force the university’s hand into divesting their interest in fossil fuels. The students cite a report that claims that a large portion of the university’s operating budget comes from alumni donations. They believe that if they are successful in obtaining alumni support, the university will have no other option but to comply. “Considering the leadership role of the university, I find it contradictory that BU invests its endowment—and therefore my donation—in the fossil fuel industry. The extraction and consumption of fossil fuels harms the environment, public health, and exacerbates the already negative consequences of climate change,” the alumni pledge reads. “Given this injustice and the urgency of acting on climate change, I pledge to withhold all monetary donations to BU, starting in September 2017, until the university publicly commits, within a transparent and measurable framework, to the complete ACSRI recommendation of full divestment of all direct investments in fossil fuel companies that continue to explore for new reserves,” it continues. It is unclear how many alumni have signed onto the pledge thus far, but the students behind it claim that they feel that 2,000 signatures “is a large enough number to afford legitimacy to [his] petition.”, Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about economics and higher education for Breitbart News.

Bob Menendez (D-NY) and Sen.

      "New York Times readers are deserting in droves in protest that its new columnist, Bret Stephens, thinks incorrect thoughts about man-made global warming.[In his first column Stephens committed the cardinal sin of suggesting that maybe climate change isn’t quite the major existential threat that liberals have cracked up to be and that maybe the environmentalists’ rabid zealotry is doing their cause more harm than good. advertisement, Mighty has been the progressives’ wrath. According to Soros attack dog Joe Romm, it could scarcely have been worse if the New York Times had given the column to the former Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, David Duke. According to the Guardian‘s Dana Nucitelli, the most charitable thing you could say about Stephens’s piece is that it’s “ignorant and wrong.”, Professor Ken Caldeira, of the Carnegie Institute for Science, has publicly cancelled his NYT subscription. So too has German climate professor Stefan Rahmsdorf, who wrote to complain:, My heroes are Copernicus, Galilei and Kepler, who sought the scientific truth based on observational evidence and defended it against the powerful authority of the church in Rome, at great personal cost. Had the New York Times existed then – would you have seen it as part of your mission to insult and denigrate these scientists, as Stephens has done with climate scientists?, Twitter has been outraged:, A New Yorker fact checker who understands what journalism is supposed to do pic.twitter.com/ZEIglfxd5x, — David Klion (@DavidKlion) April 29, 2017, , Meanwhile, a petition demanding that the New York Times “rescind” its job offer to Bret Stephens has attracted more than 28,000 signatures. Truly you’d need a heart of stone not to laugh at the cruel irony of it all. One of the reasons Stephens left his old home the Wall Street Journal to join David Brooks in the special padded cell the NYT retains for its house “conservatives” was to escape all the hate he was getting for his anti-Trump articles. Surely, he no doubt imagined, his gentle brand of centrist squishery – “the nambiest and the pambiest” as Dinesh D’Souza once referred to it – would find a more welcoming home among the impeccably reasonable, caring and sensitive liberal readership for which Pravda is famed. It didn’t take long for Stephens to be disabused of this notion:, After 20 months of being harangued by bullying Trump supporters, I’m reminded that the nasty left is no different. Perhaps worse. https://t.co/uQ2L5lox6e, — Bret Stephens (@BretStephensNYT) April 28, 2017, , What, though, had Stephens actually said wrong to deserve all this hate? (Read the comment thread below his tweet. The Times’s Red Guard shows no mercy). In short: nothing. Such facts as there were in his comment piece – it was opinion, not a science report – were pretty unimpeachable, not to say uncontroversial. He quoted the IPCC – generally used by liberals as the gold standard of climate science. He quoted another (more acceptably green/left-wing) New York Times columnist Andrew Revkin:, “I saw a widening gap between what scientists had been learning about global warming and what advocates were claiming as they pushed ever harder to pass climate legislation.”, But there was really nothing in the piece that was shockingly contentious or factually dubious. Why then this brutal monstering?, Because climate change is a religion where heretics must burn. At least that’s how progressives think – and it’s the progressives who still dictate the terms of the debate: they’ve hijacked the seats of learning, the newspapers, the TV, the schools, the political arena, the corporations, Wall Street…, Any form of dissent from the Green Religion, however trivial, has to be punished with fire and brimstone as a dread warning to anyone else tempted to diverge from the True Path. This is not the first time this has happened. Stephens’s experiences are strikingly similar to that of another very moderate skeptic, Roger Pielke Jr, who was recruited as a columnist for Nate Silver’s website 538 but was then ditched when readers objected to his non-alarmist views and his unhelpful references to data, truth and real-world evidence. Facts are very important to progressive journalists and readers. But only when they are the right sort of facts. Otherwise they’re WrongThink.\n",

      "President Trump is edging closer to taking the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Agreement.[The clincher, according to insider reports, is that he has been warned by lawyers that if he doesn’t pull out it may seriously affect his plans to revive the U.S. economy with cheap, abundant fossil fuel and a reduction in environmentalist red tape. advertisement, Up until now Trump has been torn between two factions within the White House: the Steve Bannon/Scott Pruitt faction who think he should honor his campaign promise to quit and the Ivanka/Jared Kushner/Rex Tillerson faction which would prefer the U.S. stay and keep a “seat at the table.”, But as Trump hinted at a Saturday rally – when he described the agreement as ‘one-sided’ and an example of the kind of deal where ‘the United States pays the costs and bears the burdens while other countries get the benefit and pay nothing’ – he is now inclined towards exit. The agreement states that a country “may at any time adjust its existing nationally determined contribution with a view to enhancing its level of ambition,” which sources say concerns White House Counsel Don McGahn and his staff. If Trump wanted to ratchet down former President Barack Obama’s promise of a 26 percent to 28 percent emissions cut by 2025, the agreement may prevent it. The administration is also worried that staying in the accord would give environmentalists a legal argument to prevent Trump from repealing climate regulations like the Clean Power Plan. If and when Trump does pull out the worldwide repercussions will be enormous. “Climate change” is so embedded in the consciousness of the political, corporate and financial elite that even this random guy from NATO is asking us, straightfaced, to believe that it represents some kind of major global security threat. General Denis Mercier – who glories in the title of “Nato’s supreme allied commander for transformation” – says:, “If one nation, especially the biggest nation… if they do not recognise a problem, then we will have trouble dealing with the causes of climate change.”, And I don’t think he means China. Nor, you can be sure, will the withdrawal be greeted with much applause by the mainstream media. To give you an idea, here’s how CNN dealt with the possibility that Trump might pull out of Paris. “What happens if the U.S. pulls out?” Jake Tapper asks CNN’s in-house expert Rene Marsh. Marsh tells it as only a CNN environmental reporter can: “Essentially this agreement is, many would argue, to save the planet. They want to rid the planet of this carbon pollution in this century.”, And now evil President Trump wants to stop saving the planet and keep all that carbon pollution. Oh the humanity! Oh the polar bears….\n",
      "MOST POPULAR[During an interview on Friday’s broadcast of HBO’s “Real Time,” President Obama stated that “the label Socialism doesn’t make that much sense in a context where there’s no economy that doesn’t have some Socialist elements,” and “if we have a big chunk of the country that just discounts what 99% of scientists say completely” on climate change, “it’s hard to figure out how we move the democracy forward.”, advertisement, Obama said, in response to host Bill Maher asking what the president thinks about the idea that some things shouldn’t be for the profit motive, “[F]irst of all, in some ways the label Socialism doesn’t make that much sense in a context where there’s no economy that doesn’t have some Socialist elements, meaning that there’s some common goods that we all agree everybody should have. That’s what Social Security is. That’s what Medicare is, to some extent, what public schools are. We all chip in to make sure that everybody, no matter the circumstances of your birth, have these baseline goods. And, as you know, I felt pretty strongly that healthcare should be one of those goods. I’ve also said in the past that if I were designing a system from scratch, I would have probably looked at a single-payer system, but we do have legacy systems, and that’s the only thing that, sometimes when I’ve had conversations with [Senator] Bernie [Sanders] (I-VT), I’ve said to him, we don’t start from scratch.”, He added, “[T]he criminal justice system should not be infected by the profit motive. This is the awesome power of the state, saying we can take somebody’s freedom away. We can lock them up, because they’ve breached some part of the social contract, the notion that you want to — you might incentivize people to lock more people in, or keep them there longer, or not provide the kind of rehabilitation services so that they can get out of there. I think that’s a problem.”, Obama further stated, “When it comes to the media, that’s a tougher call because, look, state-run media, that’s what they’ve got in –.”, After Maher cut in that he was referring to networks not needing to make a profit off of the news Obama responded, “Partly because they had a monopoly, though, to some degree, right? So, they were fat and happy. In this kind of environment, it’s hard to figure out how you would do that, but I think the question I’d have when it comes to the media is, how do we create a space where truth gets eyeballs and is entertaining, and we can build a common conversation? What is true, when I leave here, one of the things I’m most concerned about, is the Balkanization of the media, where you’ve got 800 stations, you’ve got all these web sites. People have difficulty now just sorting out what’s true and what’s not. And if you don’t have some common baseline about facts we can have a disagreement about how to deal with climate change, but if we have a big chunk of the country that just discounts what 99% of scientists say completely, it’s hard to figure out how we move the democracy forward.”, Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett\n",
      "Am I too late to suggest a symbol for tonight’s Rio Olympics opening ceremony?[I do hope not because it’s an absolute cracker which I’m sure will grab attention across the world and capture the mood and spirit of the host city quite perfectly. advertisement, Ready?, OK – so it’s a severed arm floating in a sea of brown, with five dead fish (a red, blue, black, yellow and green one) arranged in the shape of the Olympic rings. Yes, it may sound like a sick joke. But I fear it’s a horribly accurate one for the various water sports competitors. I gather that the British teams, for example, have spent the last three years ingesting a Mithridatium of increasingly deadly microbes in order to prepare their immune systems for the horrors awaiting them in places like Rio’s Guanabara Bay where the sailing events are due to take place. “Foreign athletes will literally be swimming in human crap, and they risk getting sick from all those microorganisms,” said Dr. Daniel Becker, a local pediatrician who works in poor neighborhoods. “It’s sad but also worrisome.”, An AP investigation last year found that Brazil’s waterways had microbe levels up to 1.7 million times what would be considered hazardous on a Southern Californian beach. Copacabana beach, meanwhile – though still an excellent place to pick up a ladyboy while humming your favourite Barry Manilow classic – is perfectly useless if you want to cool off. Only locals have immune systems capable of dealing with seas into which Rio continues to pump its raw sewage. Wouldn’t this all be embarrassing if Rio De Janeiro were in some way related to the city which hosted the near-legendary 1990 Rio Earth Summit – the event which pretty much launched the entire modern green movement and set the world on the path towards “sustainability” with its Agenda 21?, No, wait. It is. Brazil has had over six years to prepare itself for these Olympics during which time it appears to have done precisely zilch to bring itself up to vaguely first world standards. It’s what it promised it would do when it applied to become the first South American city to host the games. In its 2009 bid for these Games, Brazil pledged to spend $4 billion to clean up 80 percent of the sewage that flows untreated into the bay. In the end, the state government spent just $170 million, citing a budget crisis, officials said. $170 million out of a promised $4 billion? Even by Sochi Winter Olympics or South American banana republic standards, that represents a pretty impressive degree of corruption, wastage and mismanagement. But the bigger take-home message, for me, is what this tells us about the utter absurdity of the global environment industry and the vast gulf that exists between its stated ambitions and pathetic real achievements. It’s not often I find myself in agreement with a George-Soros-funded green propaganda sheet. But Think Progress is absolutely right to be disgusted by what has been allowed to happen in Rio. In its analysis, it blames Rio’s flamboyant, handsome mayor Eduardo Paes for promising so much and delivering so little:, As Paes’ accepts awards, chairs networks, and gives TED talks about sustainability, he oversees a city where, for decades, raw waste has polluted public water and gridlocked traffic has spewed pollution into the air. The 2016 Olympics were billed as “Green Games for a Blue Planet” during the bidding process, aimed at catalyzing the city’s transition into a 21st-century haven of sustainability both environmental and social. Instead, the leadup to the games has become somewhat of a nightmare for organizers, as venues are contaminated with garbage, transit projects remain unfinished, and the state of Rio is in the midst of a financial crisis. What Think Progress doesn’t understand – how could it? – is that glib shysters like Eduardo Paes are in fact just a symptom of the corruption and hypocrisy inherent in the global environmental scam: all grand gestures and airy promises whose sole purpose is to tell gullible eco-loons in the West what they want to hear while doing nothing to address any real problems. Here’s a perfect example:, .@ma_werneck #Sport4Climate champion: “ride the good wave” &amp don’t break the #1o5C target https://t.co/uRodYO2A4i pic.twitter.com/k05EBiZgZN, — Connect4Climate (@Connect4Climate) July 28, 2016, Yep. The Olympic athletes may be swimming in shit. But the important thing is that a cute athlete has put on a t-shirt endorsing a pointless campaign to stop the world’s temperature rising by more than 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels – even though there’s no evidence that this is a desirable aim, still less any evidence that it is humanly possible. Meanwhile, tourists suffering from the Zika virus and athletes nursing their antibiotic-resistant forms of disgusting lurgey may be encouraged to know that despite Rio’s local environmental problems, its mayor is totally at the forefront of the much more important global struggle to combat climate change. Paes is head of the C40 Cities initiative – “a network of the world’s megacities committed to addressing climate change. C40 supports cities to collaborate effectively, share knowledge and drive meaningful, measurable and sustainable action on climate change.”, You want to know more about this fascinating initiative? Here’s more. Cities are where the future happens first. The C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group connects more than 80 of the world’s greatest cities, representing 600 million people and one quarter of the global economy. Created and led by cities, C40 is focused on tackling climate change and driving urban action that reduces greenhouse gas emissions and climate risks, while increasing the health, wellbeing and economic opportunities of urban citizens. Working across multiple sectors and initiative areas, C40 convenes networks of cities providing a suite of services in support of their efforts, including: direct technical assistance facilitation of peer-to-peer exchange and research, knowledge management &amp communications. C40 is also positioning cities as a leading force for climate action around the world, defining and amplifying their call to national governments for greater support and autonomy in creating a sustainable future. Now do you understand why Rio is mired in raw sewage, swarming with deadly mosquitos and stuck with a third world infrastructure?, Because it’s far, far too busy doing the really, really important stuff. Like facilitating peer-to-peer exchange. And demanding greater support and autonomy in creating a sustainable future. And tackling climate change. Get it?\n",

Totally about UN socialist wealth redistribution.#IPCC pic.twitter.com/NRuyUHmLzq, — Brad Rush (@OtagoGrad) June 7, 2017, , This, of course, is the real reason for the widespread global outrage at Trump’s climate decision. The pigs have had their enormous trough – stamped “$$$$ courtesy of Uncle Sam” – pulled from beneath their snouts and their instinctive response is to go “Sooooooeeeeee! Soooooeeeeee!”, My two favorite deranged responses so far. This one from The Nation explaining that Trump is Hitler because he sorta, kinda used a phrase vaguely like Hitler once did in one of his speeches.  On September 30, 1942, shortly after the death camps began gassing Jews, Hitler declared, “In Germany too the Jews once laughed at my prophecies. I don’t know whether they are still laughing, or whether they have already lost the inclination to laugh, but I can assure you that everywhere they will stop laughing. With these prophecies I shall prove to be right.”, On June 1, 2017, Donald Trump announced that he was pulling America out of the Paris climate accord. “At what point does America get demeaned? At what point do they start laughing at us as a country? We want fair treatment for its citizens and we want fair treatment for our taxpayers. We don’t want other leaders and other countries laughing at us anymore, and they won’t be. They won’t be.”, See the similarity? Me neither. Presumably that’s why author Sasha Abramsky has to editorialize desperately:, “It’s not a direct quote from Hitler, but it’s perilously close.”, But I forget. When you’re a liberal, everyone who disagrees with you is Hitler. So I suppose to Nation-readers this article is only stating the obvious. Even better though, I think, is the announcement by the United Nations that it intends to reject Trump’s offer to renegotiate Paris. Here is the Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) spelling it out:, #ParisAgreement, a historic treaty signed by 194 &amp ratified by 147 countries, cannot be renegotiated based on the request of a single Party. https://t.co/FEz1JsVmk0, — Patricia Espinosa C.

Well it’s a bit like the Camp Commandant at Colditz Castle announcing sternly to the prisoners who have daringly escaped that under no circumstances will they ever be allowed inside the wire and back to their lumpy beds and freezing cells. President Trump has just made what successful escaping prisoners in World War II used to call a Home Run. I doubt he has many regrets about the camp guards he has left behind.  \n",

      "MOST POPULAR[This morning’s key headlines from GenerationalDynamics.com, advertisement, John Kerry and his granddaughter sign the climate change agreement, 175 countries on Friday signed the climate change agreement that was produced at a climate change conference in December. The climate change agreement is a total farce for many reasons, including the fact that it is not binding on anyone. The “historic” signing ceremony will be forgotten in a few days, just as December’s “historic” climate change conference was forgotten in a few days. There are other things to worry about: the war in Syria, China’s militarization of the South China Sea, Russia’s annexation of Crimea, and so forth. The climate change agreement is more entertainment than anything else. In fact, the main speaker at the signing ceremony: Movie star and entertainer Leonardo DiCaprio. He entertained everyone by making a truly idiotic speech comparing climate change to slavery:, [Lincoln] was speaking before the U.S. Congress to confront the defining issue of his time: slavery. Remarkably, his words ring as true today when applied to the defining crisis of our time: climate change. …, After 21 years of debates and conferences, it is time to declare: no more talk, no more excuses, no more 10-year studies, no more allowing the fossil fuel companies to manipulate and dictate the science and policies that affect our future. Blah, blah, blah, on and on. Entertainment Weekly and VOA and Guardian, Just to make things clear, here are some other things wrong with the climate change hysteria:, In his speech, DiCaprio said he was “absolutely terrified” of climate change, but said nothing about being terrified of the far more likely world war. Daily Caller and From Horse Power to Horsepower and The Great Horse Manure Crisis of 1894 and Great Moments in Failed Predictions, President Obama has moved on to Britain, having completed his task in Saudi Arabia of lecturing the Saudi King that he needs to learn to “share the neighborhood” with Iran. ( “21-Apr-16 World View — Saudi King Salman snubs Obama – again – as he arrives for Saudi Arabia summit”), In Britain, he discussed the June 23 “Brexit” referendum on whether Britain should leave the European Union. President Obama made it clear that he wants Brexit to be rejected, and he threatened the government with regard to the question of a possible US-UK trade agreement if Brexit occurs. According to Obama, referring to the pro-Brexit politicians in Britain:, They are voicing an opinion about what the United States is going to do, I figured you might want to hear from the president of the United States what I think the United States is going to do. And on that matter, for example, I think it’s fair to say that maybe some point down the line there might be a UK-US trade agreement, but it’s not going to happen any time soon because our focus is in negotiating with a big bloc, the European Union, to get a trade agreement done. The UK is going to be in the back of the queue. Analysts are undecided as to whether President Obama’s threat helps the pro-Brexit side or the anti-Brexit side. Guardian (London), According to Chinese media, the China Shipbuilding Industry Corp is “pushing forward the work” to build floating nuclear power plants in the South China Sea. China is annexing the entire South China Sea through military means, including regions that have historically belonged to other countries. China has built artificial islands, and is rapidly turning them into large military bases. However, they need to burn oil or coal for power, and these large military bases are far from home, making transportation costs exorbitant, especially in bad weather. The nuclear power plants would solve the military problem. Liberal environmentalists rarely criticize China, and are not expected to provide more than perfunctory criticism of this plan, even though an accident could be extremely damaging to the sea life. A spokesman for China’s Foreign Ministry could not comment on the report, since he said that he hadn’t read it. Reuters and Gizmodo, S&ampP 500 Price/Earnings ratio at 24.11 on April 22, indicating a huge and rapidly growing stock market bubble (WSJ), As regular readers know, Generational Dynamics predicts that we are headed for a global financial panic and crisis. According to Friday’s Wall Street Journal, the S&ampP 500 Price/Earnings index (stock valuations index) on Friday morning (April 22) was at an astronomically high 24.11. This is far above the historical average of 14, indicating that the stock market is growing quickly, and could burst at any time. Generational Dynamics predicts that the P/E ratio will fall to the 5-6 range or lower, which is where it was as recently as 1982, resulting in a Dow Jones Industrial Average of 3000 or lower. The rapidly rising P/E ratio is a sure sign of trouble. The last time that the P/E ratio rose above 24 was in April 2008. For the year following, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 50% to the 6000s level in May 2009. As the stock market was falling, the Federal Reserve began its massive quantitative easing program in December 2008, “printing” new money and pumping it into the banking system, from which it went into the stock market. The P/E ratio fell below 24 again in December 2009. Since then, the Fed has lowered interest rates almost to zero, and there is talk of negative interest rates, which are already the policy in several other countries, with little effect. ( “11-Mar-16 World View — In desperation move, European Central Bank further lowers negative interest rates”), If you listen to CNBC or Bloomberg TV, as I do for as long as I can stand it, all they talk about is interest rates set by the Fed and other central banks. No one seriously believes any more that the stock market has any relation to the real economy. As long as the Fed pumps money into the stock market, it will go up if the Fed stops, then it will go down. The reason that stock valuations are surging is because earnings (the denominator of the P/E ratio) are plummeting. During the first quarter, earnings have declined 8.9%, with the result that the P/E ratio is pushed up. The stock market bubble is getting larger and larger, and there’s going to be a lot of political pressure for the Fed to pump it even larger, especially from the Obama administration in an election year. But there is no bubble in history that hasn’t burst, and this one is no exception. The amount of pain that it will cause will be enormous.

      "The international “March for Science” appears to have re-branded Earth Day, casting “social justice” as “science.”[The Earth Day Network that owns the international rights to the annual hippie-fest — and celebration of Vladimir Lenin’s birth — artfully sought to rebrand its messaging by having protestors in 610 locations around the planet swap their tie-dyed shirts for the patina of scientific truth associated with white lab coats. advertisement, The festivities began in the wee hours of April 22 in New Zealand, then followed the sun to circumnavigate the globe. The event’s blog reported 50 celebrants showed up at Antarctic research stations, and 2 very intrepid souls showed up in minus-40 degree weather at the North Pole. Although it seemed that the media in many locations outnumbered the demonstrators, San Francisco and Washinton, D.C. both produced about 5,000 marchers. The March for Science website in January trumpeted, under “Diversity and Inclusion Principles“: “Colonization, racism, native rights, sexism, ableism, queer-, trans-, intersex-phobia, &amp econ justice are scientific rights.”, But as the event neared, the scientific communism of Marx and Engle’s Das Capital morphed into Principals and Goals: “Our wealth of personal experiences and perspectives is our greatest strength. In putting the people who do science at the forefront of this discussion, we can show that scientists come from all cultural backgrounds, belief systems, orientations, genders, and abilities.”, Honorary Co-Chairman Bill Nye the Science Guy said, “We march forward to ensure a better world for people all over the world.” But he and Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) made it clear in their February Facebook Live “Conversation on Climate Change” that they believe all skeptics of climate change are suffering from cognitive dissonance. The most interesting coverage of the event came from Science magazine, which live-blogged the events with about 60 posts over 24 hours. Demonstrating the tenuous connection between the “March for Science” and actual scientists, the first April 22 speaker at the New Zealand event was leftist Green Party co-leader James Shaw, who is a former accountant with no science background. Shaw said, “When politicians use their belief systems to override the facts, the scientific facts, we are all in for a whole world of hurt.” Shaw then droned on about his social justice belief system that New Zealanders needed to stand up against the U.S. political discourse questioning climate change.\n",
      "Official: Britain no longer has “the greenest government ever.”[Incoming Prime Minister Theresa May has driven a stake through the heart of her predecessor David Cameron’s fluffy, faux-Conservative project by scrapping the Department of Energy And Climate Change (DECC). advertisement, Established in 2008, DECC was a hangover from the Gordon Brown era of woeful misgovernance. Its first Secretary of State was future failed Labour leader candidate Ed Miliband whose only significant political achievement also happened to be one of the most expensive and pointless in British parliamentary history: the drafting of the truly disastrous Climate Change Act. Under the terms of the Climate Change Act – written by a green activist from Friends of the Earth called Bryony Worthington endorsed by Cameron’s Conservative opposition and rejected by only five MPs – Britain is legally committed to more stringent “decarbonisation” targets than any other country in the world, at an annual cost of around £19 billion a year. Miliband’s successors, under the awful Conservative/Lib Dem Coalition government were even worse. For some bizarre reason probably not unconnected with utter fecklessness, green delusion and a fatuous desire to virtue signal, Prime Minister Cameron decided to hand over the keys to DECC to his Lib Dem Coalition partners. So began probably the worst appointments since some bright spark said: “I know. Let’s make Gaius Verres Governor of Sicily.”, Sure, DECC might have seemed on the face of it a nothing department which could safely be handed over to the losers, perverts and half wits the Liberal Democrat party tends to attract. What appeared to have escaped the Prime Minister’s notice is that any department with the word “Energy” in the title – effectively puts the people who run it in charge of a goodly part of the economy. First, the job was given to Chris Huhne, an automaton-like, Westminster-educated, millionaire Europhile ex-City boy with at least five houses to his name and a zealous urge to carpet the British countryside with wind farms and solar arrays. Then, when Huhne had to leave the job for a spell in prison – after being found guilty of perjuring himself in court while trying to evade responsibility for a speeding ticket – it was handed over to someone even more frighteningly useless. Ed Davey’s only known point of interest is that he resembles the footballer Wayne Rooney. Oh, that and the fact that while in post he managed negotiate a deal described by one observer as “the worst I have ever seen” committing the British taxpayer to spend around three times the going rate for right to allow the French and Chinese to rip Britain off royally in order to build a nuclear power station using out-of-date technology at Hinkley Point. Such is the way of British politics that this potato-headed oaf is now Sir Ed Davey. DECC’s final incumbent as Secretary of State was Amber Rudd – now promoted to Home Secretary. She seems to be a fervent believer in ManBearPig. But this does not appear to be a view shared by her boss Prime Minister Theresa May. Nor, perhaps even more importantly, by May’s right-hand man Nick Timothy who is an implacable opponent of the Climate Change Act. It’s not yet clear how much of DECC’s £5.7 billion budget will be saved now that it is being absorbed into the Business department BIS. Here is what the Global Warming Policy Forum‘s Benny Peiser suggested it might save when he campaigned for its closure last year:, Furthermore, many unnecessary green expenditure items could be phased out altogether. Spending in areas such as Renewable Heat, Carbon Capture and Storage and on the Committee on Climate Change should all be scrapped. Merging DECC into other government departments would bring the UK in line with other developed nations too. Australia recently abolished its Climate Commission, transferring its essential functions to the Environment Department. Were the UK to introduce similar efficiencies along with the removal of wasteful spending, the Exchequer could save £380m by 2020-21, according to analysis by the Taxpayers’ Alliance. It’s true that the most significant benefit its closure will bring lies not so much in saved costs as in the likelihood of reduced regulation. In Britain, as in the rest of the world, green taxes and regulations have added a significant burden to economic growth, as well as having a distorting effect on energy markets. This is good news. Very good news. The agonised screeching of all the usual suspects in the Environmental movement will be enough to sustain many of us in lols for weeks and months to come.  \n",
      "News of the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was only minutes old when global warming alarmism advocates began cheering.[New York magazine writer Jonathan Chait notably tweeted in the wake of the news: “The most immediate political consequence of Scalia’s death: Obama’s climate plan will not be struck down.” And that was only the first of many tweets from alarmists looking to the “upside” of Justice Scalia’s death. advertisement, Only a few days earlier, Justice Scalia had voted to stop the EPA’s global warming rules (aka the Obama Clean Power Plan) pending completion of ongoing litigation. More than just a mere procedural determination, the 5-4 order was based on the fact that the states and industry suing to stop the EPA rules were likely to win on the merits of the case. But then the unexpected and unfortunate death of Justice Scalia was announced. As expressed in Chait’s tweet, alarmists are hoping, if not assuming, that Justice Scalia’s death changes everything in their favor. Well, not so fast. Despite Justice Scalia’s death, the Supreme Court order halting the EPA rules stands pending the ongoing litigation. The next major step in that litigation is argument before a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. That will not occur until June. It will take months after oral arguments for the Court of Appeals to render a decision which could then either be appealed to the full Court of Appeals or then be reviewed by the Supreme Court. No one anticipates this process will be completed until sometime in 2017, after President Obama leaves office. Given that Senate Republicans have committed to not confirming a replacement for Justice Scalia until after the election, the fifth vote of a likely 5-4 Supreme Court ruling on the EPA rules will be whomever the next President selects. That in all likelihood makes the November election the likely arbiter of the EPA rules. What if the EPA case comes before the Supreme Court in 2017 without Justice Scalia’s replacement having been confirmed? In the event of a 4-4 tie at the Supreme Court, the decision of the Court of Appeals would stand. What is that decision likely to be?, All bets are off on that. History has shown that the D.C. Court of Appeals tends to support the government as it tends to be stacked with Democrat appointees. Worse, recent history has also shown that Republican appointees are toss-ups when it comes to EPA cases. Aside from the law and facts on the side of the state and industry plaintiffs against the EPA, the plaintiffs had the advantage of knowing they had a preliminary 5-4 Supreme Court ruling on the merits. So the Court of Appeals judges would essentially have been ruling with Justice Scalia and the other four justices looking over their shoulder. But now that Justice Scalia is dead, that pressure has been at least somewhat relieved. So is the future rosier for Obama global warming rules following Scalia’s death? Not really. In the end, the fate of the rules lies in the hands of the next president. The EPA is not required by any law to regulate carbon dioxide emissions. In the 2007 case of Massachusetts v. EPA, the Supreme Court ruled that EPA “may” not “must” regulate greenhouse gases from automobiles. The extension of this optional authority to power plants is discretionary – and the next president will have the full discretion to roll back or change them. So it’s the election that is all important for the future of the rules. Maintaining the fiction that Scalia’s death helps secure the rules’ future is a myth that alarmists must propagate to keep alive their precious Paris climate agreement. The future of that agreement, scheduled to be open for signing on Earth Day at the United Nations, is now murkier because of the Supreme Court’s overturning of the EPA rules. China and India, for example, have cited the Court’s decision as a wavering in the U.S. commitment to cutting CO2 emissions – and both countries would love to take the nearest exit from the Paris agreement if possible. The halting of the EPA rules is the core of President Obama’s commitment and if the U.S. doesn’t live up to its commitment, why should anyone else?, Steve Milloy publishes JunkScience.com (@JunkScience)\n",

      "President Barack Obama campaigned with the pledge he would fundamentally transform the energy sector of the United States when he took office, and to a large extent, he succeeded. [Most of this legacy was strong-armed into law using executive orders and administrative overreach, and, as a result, the survival of his agenda depended upon a presidential administration succeeding him with similar goals and a desire to cement his executive orders into place for years to come. advertisement, Unfortunately for Obama, the surprise election of Donald Trump likely means the new president-elect will soon get to use a familiar phrase on Obama’s executive overreaches: “You’re fired.”, Obama’s efforts to transform the nation’s energy system began in 2009 with his attempt to kill the coal industry by passing a tax on carbon-dioxide emissions. Despite having huge majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate early in his first term, Obama was unable to pass his so-called “Cap and Trade” legislation through Congress. Having been rebuked by many in his own party, Obama instead sought to use the Environmental Protection Agency as a blunt instrument to circumvent Congress to achieve his goal of fundamentally restructuring the U.S. energy system. The result was the Clean Power Plan (CPP). The Clean Power Plan is a set of regulations on new and existing power plants. It’s designed to reduce U.S. carbon-dioxide emissions by 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. The initial draft of these regulations was straightforward. The drafters argued that when burned, natural gas emits half as much carbon dioxide compared to coal. Because natural gas was and still is abundant—thanks to hydraulic fracturing—the Obama administration reasoned replacing coal with natural gas as the United States’ primary fuel for electricity generation would reduce CO2 emissions while promoting Obama’s “All of the Above” energy plan. , However, the draft version turned out to be a bait-and-switch. In the final version of the rules, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) greatly expanded the role of renewable energy sources at the expense of natural gas. Thankfully, CPP has been put on hold by the Supreme Court, but if the rules are implemented, they are expected to cost more than $8 billion per year to implement, and analysts say they will likely raise the cost of electricity for businesses and families. Despite its high cost, CPP will have no measurable environmental benefits, as EPA-sponsored climate models show these regulations will only reduce potential future warming by 0.01 degrees Celsius by 2100, an amount too small to notice. Obama’s shift from an “All of the Above” energy policy to an extreme “Keep It in the Ground” philosophy has tied up key infrastructure energy projects, many of which used to be uncontroversial. For instance, the United States currently has more than 72,000 miles of pipelines safely transporting oil throughout the country, yet the Obama administration has actively worked to stop pipeline development since taking office. Obama single-handedly killed the Keystone XL Pipeline, which would have carried about 830,000 barrels of oil per day from Canada to refineries in the Gulf Coast, even though a multi-year analysis by the State Department stated the pipeline would have been safe for the environment. The pipeline would have also benefitted public safety, because transporting crude oil by pipeline is safer than transporting it by rail. Work on the Dakota Access Pipeline was also slowed by Obama he is now considering asking Energy Transfer Partners, the company building the pipeline, to reroute the pipeline to avoid disrupting Native American historical sites, even though the state archaeologist of North Dakota found no evidence the pipeline’s construction has destroyed historic tribal artifacts. President-elect Trump has pledged to cancel the Paris Climate Accords and pull back on Obama’s signature Clean Power Plan. He has also promised in his first 100 days in office to lift the Obama administration’s roadblocks preventing the development of energy infrastructure projects such as the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines. President Obama has lived by executive orders, and now it appears his legacy will die by them. On the bright side, maybe Obama can get a job hosting Celebrity Apprentice. , Isaac Orr (IOrr@heartland.org) is a research fellow specializing in hydraulic fracturing at The Heartland Institute.

      "Reacting to the coordinated deadly attack on police officers in Dallas during a Black Lives Matter protest, a national police spokesman condemned President Barack Obama as an appeaser, while a legal expert calls for a federal terrorism investigation.[William Johnson is a spokesman for the National Association of Police Organizations. Speaking to Fox News this morning, Johnson blamed Obama in part for this attack, declaring, “It’s a War on Cops, and the Obama administration is the Neville Chamberlain in this War.”, advertisement, Johnson went on to condemn what he calls Obama’s “appeasement” of the current anti-police movement, saying that Obama’s policies and rhetoric, “Led directly to the climate that has made Dallas possible.”, That climate was decried during a national press conference this morning by Dallas Police Chief David Brown, who said of his fellow police officers, “We don’t feel much support most days. Let’s not make today ‘most days.’”, Johnson also went on to call upon Congress to supersede Barack Obama’s executive order that stripped defense equipment from police officers, to restore local police access to equipment that would better protect them from attacks of this nature. Obama issued Executive Order 13688 on January 16, 2015, barring local police from receiving various types of military surplus weapons, equipment, and supplies that had previously been available to them. Mark Smith is a leading national expert on Second Amendment and firearms issues. Later in the day, Smith voiced a similar criticism of the current president and his team, lamenting, “Unfortunately this administration, with Barack Obama, I think is in some ways helping to create this culture that is really anti-police with this narrative that every police officer is racist, wants to bully people, wants to be a mean guy, and doesn’t want to just do their job.”, With liberal politicians already calling for gun control, Smith responded, “Last night showed why gun control doesn’t work.” To the contrary, “The best way for an ordinary American to protect themselves is with a firearm, which allows little people to defend themselves against big people who want to kill them,” Smith added. Noting that Attorney General Loretta Lynch was about to speak, Smith said that instead of calling for gun control, she should announce that she will deploy agents from the U.S. Department of Justice’s anti-terrorism unit to investigate this atrocity in the same manner as the department would respond to an act of domestic terrorism.

The 41-year-old Oscar-winner is producing climate change documentary The Turning Point, set to premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 9. The “Conversation with Hillary” event will continue as scheduled Tuesday afternoon at Timberlake’s home. Event co-hosts are said to include Jennifer Aniston, Tobey Maguire, Shonda Rhimes, ICM chief Chris Silbermann and Justin Bieber manager Scooter Braun. While in Los Angeles, Clinton is also set to attend a dinner fundraiser at the Beverly Hills home of billionaire entertainment mogul and Democratic Party mega-donor Haim Saban. The guest list for the August 22 event reportedly includes Disney CEO Bob Iger, outgoing DreamWorks Animation chief Jeffrey Katzenberg, L.A.

      "With the explosive growth of the “sharing economy,” entrepreneurial start-ups are mining businesses opportunities within the expanding “ethospheres” created Airbnb and Uber.[The Airbnb home-sharing empire has become so massive and geographically dispersed that it has spawned an entire micro-industry of differentiated start-ups that serve the platform’s users in a myriad of different ways. Many help “hosts” with strategies from pricing their rentals and cleaning homes between guest stays, to handing key deliveries. advertisement, Because the eight-year-old company has welcomed over 60 million guests to 1.5 million rental listings, in 34,000 cities, located in 190 countries, “Airbnb has become more than just a company. It’s become an ecosystem,” Nathan Tobin, head of sales for “Guesty,” told SiliconValley.com. For three percent of the rental fees, Tel Aviv-based Guesty provides 24-hour-per-day interface with rental customers for 4,000 Airbnb “hosts” from around the world that have full-time jobs. Tobin told SiliconValley.com that Guesty books reservations, coordinates the guest’s arrival, and fields questions during rental stays. Other are following in its wake: “Beyond Pricing” promises to increase host revenue by up to 40 percent by helping hosts adjust their prices according to market demand ‘Keycafe’ provides secure renter key deliveries and pick-ups in major U.S. cities and ‘Properly’ coordinates cleaning services to maximize the use of rentals. Over time, Airbnb has become so supportive of entrepreneurial companies helping its “hosts” be successful that the company has set up a free bulletin board on a section of its website called “Host Assist” to provide lists of community-rated partner companies. Founded just seven months after Airbnb, Uber ride-sharing provides over one million rides per day to its eight million users through over 400,000 drivers, in about 300 cities, located in 60 countries. Likewise, SiliconValley.com reports that Uber has created an “ethosphere” of supporting startups. Temple University law professor Brishen Rogers told the outlet that given what “Apple has done with all the third-party apps created for its iPhone, it’s no surprise that Uber is creating an ecosystem of smaller companies surrounding it.”, In much the same way, the presidential election has inspired the creation of political and media startups. In 2012, Barack Obama’s vaunted data-mining operation considered itself a startup within the broader campaign.\n",
      "It’ll be Christmas in May this week for members of the global warming cult.[Exxon stockholders will gather in Dallas for their annual meeting, and a large contingent of environmental groups and their not-quite-housetrained followers will be on hand to protest. advertisement, If the flyer from 350.org advertising the event is to be believed, things could get interesting. “Exxon knew about climate change half a century ago,” the release reads. “They robbed us of a generation’s worth of time to prevent the worst impacts from hitting people across Texas and the world.”, It goes on to accuse Exxon of dipping into Big Tobacco’s playbook by lying about the risks and “making hundreds of billions at the cost of people’s lives …” and, for good measure, of perpetrating “what could be the worst case of fraud in history.”, Oddly, the protest will get a funding boost this year from the self-hating wing of the Rockefeller family. In fact, for the first time in the history of the company, there will be Rockefellers on the outside of the meeting looking in because they have divested from the company or are in the process of doing so. The Rockefeller Family Foundation announced recently it would divest its $45 million in fossil fuel investments “as quickly as possible,” following a decision last year from the Rockefeller Brothers Fund to do the same. The Rockefeller Foundation, whose endowment tops $4 billion, continues to oppose divestment, which has created friction in the family that founded the company in 1870. The Rockefellers don’t, as a family, eschew the filthy lucre that comes from having owned the eighth largest company in the world and the second most profitable. But they do bang on quite a bit about how unpleasant it all is. “We would be remiss if we failed to focus on what we believe to be the morally reprehensible conduct on the part of ExxonMobil,” said a press release from the RFF, which is controlled by Martha, John, Laurance, Nelson and David Rockefeller. “There is no sane rationale for companies to continue to explore for new sources of hydrocarbons.”, They also use various media organs they fund, such as 350.org, the Sierra Club and their web newsletter InsideClimate News, to rip the company that made them wildly rich. Hmmm … energy policy media funded by the Rockefellers. Where have I heard that before?, InsideClimate News recently “broke” a multipart series that was supposed to look like cutting-edge investigative journalism but instead read like a political flyer for a low-level state legislative race. “Collaborating with the Bush-Cheney White House, Exxon turned ordinary scientific uncertainties into weapons of mass confusion,” howled one story. “More Exxon Documents Show How Much It Knew About Climate 35 Years Ago,” blared another. They keep Bill McKibben, an off-the-hook climate agitator, in business. “Why Bill McKibben is so mad at Exxon,” read a recent headline on InsideClimate News. Perhaps because he is paid to be?, There’s also Rockefeller funding of “Democracy Now,” a notoriously lefty radio news program, and DeSmog Blog, which gets its funding through a Rockefeller offshoot called the Sustainable Markets Foundation. The conflict among family members only adds to the problems likely to come out during the meeting. Exxon is under fire from attorneys general around the country, led by Eric Schneiderman, the AG of New York, for supposedly quashing information it developed in the 1970s and 1980s on the supposed dangers of global warming and misleadingly downplaying that threat to the public. The attorneys general are working to subpoena thousands of documents to try to establish that the company committed fraud by failing to warn Americans of the danger they face from global warming, which the AGs say postponed for decades work necessary to address the problem. They do this with an eye toward charging the firm and its executives under racketeering statutes intended for drug kingpins and other top criminals. Let’s suppose it’s true – a big supposition since Exxon actually acknowledges the risk of climate change and has done a lot more than most of these activists to develop cleaner sources of energy to meet dramatically increasing demand. Let’s suppose the company was talking about the dangers carbon buildup might pose to the environment years ago. And let’s suppose the company also talked about the limits of the scientific understanding when it comes to informing the policy debate. What exactly would be the crime there? And isn’t that pretty much precisely the speech the First Amendment is designed to protect?, To activists descending on Dallas, the answers to these questions really don’t matter. What they want is a government-preferred science with criminal penalties meted out to those who disagree. Is this the kind of government, let alone scientific community, we want?, But enough with hypotheticals. The activists descending on Dallas would do well to remember that the efforts of companies like Exxon have actually already translated into a cleaner planet. All you need to do is consider the fact that fracking has enabled countries around the world, particularly the U.S. to get decades ahead in meeting emissions reduction goals. But for activists and the Rockefeller faction that funds them driving hysteria is the goal, not finding genuine solutions.\n",
      "Left-wing activists reacted immediately to Donald Trump’s choice of Judge Neil Gorsuch to fill the vacant Supreme Court seat.[“He represents an existential threat to legal abortion in the United States and must never wear the robes of a Supreme Court justice,” an online statement from NARAL read. advertisement, Other pro-abortion organizations agreed. “Donald Trump’s nominee, Neil Gorsuch, has an alarming history of interfering with reproductive rights and health. He ruled that bosses should be able to deny women access to birth control coverage,” wrote Planned Parenthood CEO Cecile Richards in a fundraising letter calling for supporters to donate. The pro-abortion organization also debuted a hashtag #NoRoeNoGo for activists to share. Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune, described Gorsuch as “more extreme than Justice Scalia.”, “Gorsuch has proven himself hostile to environmental protection, women’s rights, and the rights of workers and cannot be trusted to protect our air, our water, or our communities,” he said in a statement. Climate change alarmist group NextGen also opposed Gorsuch’s nomination in a statement from billionaire funder Tom Steyer. “In light of Trump’s despotic tendencies and Russia’s role in his election, the Senate must reject any nominee whose allegiance to our Constitution and our most fundamental rights is in doubt,” he wrote in a statement.\n",

He’s a great fighter, and he’s going to be okay, we hope.”, advertisement, The president said he visited Scalise at the hospital and told the family that the entire country was praying for him. He commented that Scalise’s tragedy may have brought some unity to the partisan climate in the country. “Steve, in his own way, may have brought some unity to our long-divided country,” Trump said. “I have a feeling that Steve has made a great sacrifice, but there could be some unity being brought to our great country.”, Trump made his comments before signing an executive order to spark more skill training for jobs and apprenticeships in the economy. He also praised the two Capitol Police officers who returned fire and were wounded after the shooter began shooting. “They ran right into the fire,” he said. “They ran right into those guns and the bullets, and they saved a lot of lives.”, As the event concluded, Trump shared a spirit of unity with the media. “[E]verybody in this room, including the reporters, God bless you,” he said as the people in the room laughed. , “God bless America,” he concluded.  \n",
      "Metallica lead singer James Hetfield says he moved from San Francisco to the Colorado Rockies in part because “showing up with a deer on the bumper” is frowned upon in Marin County.[During an interview with talk radio host Joe Rogan, Hetfield says he got tired of the “elitist” attitudes in the Bay Area. advertisement, The Daily Mail quoted Hetfield saying, “I kind of got sick of the Bay Area, the attitudes of the people there, a little bit. They talk about how diverse they are, and things like that, and it’s fine if you’re diverse like them. But showing up with a deer on the bumper doesn’t fly in Marin County.”, “My form of eating organic doesn’t vibe with theirs,” he added, a clear reference to his love for hunting. Hetfield summed things up by saying, “There was an elitist attitude there – that if you weren’t their way politically, their way environmentally, all of that, that you were looked down upon.” So he and his wife relocated to Vail, Colorado the area in which his wife grew up and a place where opportunities to enjoy nature and to hunt abound. He said he loved the ocean in the Bay Area and even loved the area itself, but said the attitude of the people made him “feel like [he] was just fighting all the time” and he had to escape. It is interesting to note that Hetfield stressed that he and his fellow members are not about making political statements, and that he was not trying to make one by explaining his reasons for leaving the Bay Area.

      "Large groups of left-wing protesters will try to sabotage Donald Trump’s inauguration by creating blockades and destroying public property, according to recent reports.[On the day of the inauguration, which will take place Friday, 20th January, protesters are planning to create a series of human blockades across Washington D.C. where participants will protest against a variety of Trump’s proposed policies, from immigration reform to climate change. advertisement, The principal organiser of the protests is a group known as #DisruptJ20, who are already advertising for people to join them in a “bold mobilization against the inauguration of Donald Trump.”, “We call on all people of good conscience to join in disrupting the ceremonies. If Trump is to be inaugurated at all, let it happen behind closed doors, showing the true face of the security state Trump will preside over. It must be made clear to the whole world that the vast majority of people in the United States do not support his presidency or consent to his rule,” the group states on the website. Some of the #DisruptJ20’s planned “events” for the inauguration day include an Anti-Capitalist and Anti-Fascist Bloc, Quockblockade Parade Queer Resistance, Climate Convergence, as well as an Occupy Inauguration. One event will even involve a “gay dance parade” outside vice-president elect Mike Pence’s home, whilst an anti-capitalist protest starting from Logan Circle is likely to involve property damage, according to sources from The Daily Caller. A report from FOX News on Friday also unveiled audio of a member of #DisruptJ20 pledging to “do everything we can to try and stop people from being able to access the inauguration.”, Over 10,000 civil servants are expected to be deployed on the day of the inauguration, including local police and members of the military.

John Kasich, who have recently suggested that Donald Trump should be blamed for violent protesters at his own campaign rallies.[“For the three elected Republicans to blame Trump for violence committed by liberal Chicago thugs is like Barack Obama blaming U.S. exceptionalism for radical Islamic terrorism,” Cramer wrote in a new op-ed. advertisement, After Trump’s Chicago campaign rally on Friday was canceled because of large protests, fellow GOP candidates criticized Trump rather than the left wing protesters. “I think a campaign bears responsibility for creating an environment, when the candidate urges supporters to engage in physical violence — to punch people in the face. The predictable consequence of that is that it escalates and today is unlikely to be the last such instance. We [saw] earlier today in St. Louis over thirty arrested. That’s not how our politics should occur,” Cruz stated in response to the protests. Rubio simply said, “Words have consequences.”, Kasich also cast some blame on Trump’s “gloomy” tone, according to The Hill. “You can walk into a room of 100 people, and you can put them in a really bad mood or you can make them hopeful,” Kasich said. “I talk about how we can fix things. The hopefulness of things, I think, works.”\n",

Around the same time, Tesla also struck deals with the California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority that made the company exempt from up to $320 million in California State sales and U.S. taxes. Musk has been a vocal supporter of carbon taxes, saying, “All we are doing [with a carbon tax] is trying to match the inherent subsidy for fossil fuels… on the sustainable energy side.

      "All over Britain people have woken this morning to find themselves living in a magical winter wonderland.[Just to be clear, however: all that white stuff you can see outside your window is not actually real.

      "Most people don’t realize this yet, but if a Democrat gets the keys to the White House next year it’s game over for the US economy.[This isn’t just for the obvious reason that liberals like Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton don’t understand free markets or small government. advertisement, It’s because the left has got its hands on the magic formula that enables it to do at both federal and local level all the things that lefties love to do – the meddling, the nannying, the taxing, the regulating, the confiscating, the cronyism – virtually unopposed by the people who should be opposing them. The formula is: “We’re saving the planet.”, And who wants to be seen not saving the planet?, No one and that’s why the issue has become such a massive problem for conservatives across the world. It explains, for example, the suicidal desire a few years back by the notionally conservative UK prime minister David Cameron to lead “the greenest government ever.”, This has caused untold damage to the British landscape (all those bat-chomping, bird-slicing eco-crucifixes, like the ones that rake in £1000 a day for Cameron’s father-in-law, Sir Reginald Sheffield Bt), to the British economy (which now has the most expensive electricity in Europe and is legally committed to spending £18 billion a year on pointless ‘decarbonisation’) and to the political debate. When a senior Conservative minister says – as Climate Change and Energy Secretary Andrea Leadsom did in parliament recently – that Britain is committed to producing “100 percent” of its energy from renewables, then you know that the ravens have left the Tower and the lunatics taken over the asylum. America has a similar problem. It’s not so bad, as yet, as in Europe. But it’s definitely getting there – and for the same reason. Most Republican politicians are uncomfortable talking about climate change because they know it makes them look bad, and because they’re wary of being branded – the left’s usual tactic – “anti-science”. And perhaps, also, because they don’t want to offend any of those donors who (as so many rich people do) have caught the green stupidity bug and want to alleviate their consciences by – you got it – “saving the planet”. (‘“I told him, ‘For me to have any interest in Ted, I need him to accept that the earth has warmed, and that we can solve the problem and create plenty of jobs,’ ” Mr. Sabin recalled.), Both the two Republican frontrunners, admittedly, are fully out global warming sceptics. Ted Cruz hosted his Data or Dogma hearing at the Senate last year and Donald Trump enjoys few things better than trolling greenies with tweets like:, The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 6 November 2012, , But the right is missing a trick. Across the world conservatives are losing the war on climate change and will continue to lose unless they ever learn this most basic of tactical rules: never fight your battle on terrain of the enemy’s choosing. Scientifically, politically, emotionally the climate change debate has been framed by the left in such a way that it can never really lose. The left is cunning. Like the Taliban – “you have the watches, we have the time” – it plays a very long game. The tactics it has been using in the environmental wars date at least back to Saul Alinsky and probably as far back as the Cultural Marxists of the 1930s Frankfurt School. What’s certain is for several decades now – and most especially since the Fall of the Berlin Wall supposedly won the capitalist argument – the left has been using environmentalism as a cloak to disguise its usual controlling, misanthropic, puritanical, big government agenda with a kindly aura of bunny-hugging caringness. My book Watermelons: How The Environmentalists Are Killing The Planet, Destroying The Economy And Stealing Your Children’s Future describes the historical background to this. That’s “Watermelons” as in “green on the outside, red on the inside.”, But what it doesn’t do is provide a solution to the problem which I’d argue, after militant Islam, probably represents the biggest political and economic threat to the world today because its tentacles spread so far and because its influence is so insidious. Environmentalism – the “climate change” scare, especially – is the hard left’s Trojan Horse: unlike the Soviets, unlike the Nazis, it intends to destroy Western liberal civilisation not from without but from within. So where are conservatives going wrong? How is it that they are constantly allowing themselves to be outflanked by the enemy? Can they ever win the argument?, Well, to answer the last question first, yes, absolutely they can but first they need to read this brilliant essay by Alex Epstein in Forbes. Republicans – and this applies just as much to Conservatives in Britain and Europe, and Liberals in Australia – whenever the environment comes up they are always arguing at a disadvantage. They are, as Epstein puts it, reactive and overwhelmed whereas their left-wing opponents are proactive and overwhelming. Is this because right wing people are ignorant of science, don’t care about the environment and only want to rape the planet? Well, that, of course is what the green propaganda machine would like you to believe. But actually it’s much simpler than that. The current debate about the environment is constructed round an entirely dishonest core premise: “that we need to get off fossil fuels and onto green energy.”, So long as this remains the debate’s core premise, the right will always lose because the best it can ever hope for is to do what Epstein calls “arguing to zero” – effectively conceding the enemy the field on every issue. Here’s how he explains it:, Here is an X-axis from -100 to 100, with 0 as the midpoint. The axis refers to our moral evaluation of a policy, product, or technology. -100 means the lowest evil, 0 means neutral, and 100 means our highest ideal. In today’s debate, -100 is the ever-growing use of fossil fuels (“dirty energy”) and 100 is a society completely powered by “green” energy, usually solar and wind. A good policy, on this scale, is one that helps us get off fossil fuels and onto green energy. With each proposal, Democrats are “arguing to 100”—arguing that a given policy is bringing us closer to the ideal and away from the evil. If anyone ever stands up for fossil fuels, Democrats will “argue to -100”—argue that the person is bringing us toward evil. This positioning is incredibly powerful—because the ideal frames the debate. And he who frames the debate, wins the debate. Take the debate about fracking. Rarely if ever do you hear the right arguing confidently that it is a good thing which will make everyone’s lives’ better by bringing down the cost of energy and enriching the economy. That’s because conservatives are far too busy defending it against the terms set by the left: that it pollutes the environment, uses up too much water, poisons wells and causes earthquakes. Even though the right wing argument is closer to the truth here than the left wing argument, the right wing argument is failing to prevail because doesn’t suit the current environmental narrative which has been dictated almost entirely by a hard core of misanthropic greenies who loathe Western industrial civilisation and probably much prefer animals to people. But Republicans – and other conservatives and, even more so, libertarians – can very easily win this debate simply by reframing its terms of reference. To reach the right conclusion on what to do about energy, we need to be clear on our moral goal, our standard of value—and that the right standard of value is maximizing human well-being rather than the environmentalist standard of minimizing human impact. If we look at the big picture, both positives and negatives, of fossil fuels by the standard of maximizing human well-being, we find that short-term and long-term they improve every aspect of life by increasing mankind’s ability to use machines—including our capacity to make a naturally dirty environment far cleaner and our capacity to make a naturally dangerous climate far safer. Epstein is right. What the environmental movement is doing to the economy, to the lives of ordinary people (the poor especially), to liberty and to nature is ignorant, dangerous and often evil but saying this – as some of us like to do quite often – is never going to win over the unpersuaded, who continue to delude themselves that greens are kindly, thoughtful types who really care about the planet. No. To win the environmental argument, conservatives must reframe the debate. Here’s how Epstein thinks we should do it:, Whenever I discuss any energy and environmental issue with anyone, near the very beginning I make sure to ask: “Would you agree that our goal here is to find the policy that will maximize human well-being? Would you agree that we need to look carefully at all the costs and all the benefits to get to the right answer?” It’s often necessary to bring up the non-impact issue explicitly: “Would you agree that to maximize our well-being we need to impact the world in all kinds of ways and that impact is not a bad thing but often a good thing? That we just want to minimize impacts that harm us?”, That reframing may seem simple or go unnoticed, but the resulting framework changes everything. There is a lot at stake here. Conservatives, for far too long, have seen environmentalism as a fringe issue, of little concern to them because it doesn’t impact too obviously on their key area of concern, the economy. They couldn’t be more wrong, as the American example shows:, Consider the following ongoing policy battles: the Clean Power Plan, methane regulations, fracking bans, ozone regulations, pipeline blocking, new pipeline regulations, new train regulations, renewable fuel standards, wind production tax credit, solar subsidies, CAFE standards, green building standards, energy efficiency mandates, “green jobs” schemes.All of these policy initiatives were initiated by Democrats, and Democrats are winning on most of them. Even when they “lose,” it doesn’t change the trajectory Democrats have an unlimited supply of new anti-development, anti-freedom initiatives to propose if the old ones fail. Witness the short-lived “victory” of blocking a particular anti-fossil fuel proposal (cap-and-trade) being followed by a host of Executive Orders and international agreements to accomplish the same goal. Since the Democrats make all the proposals and the Republicans react, Democrats control the direction of energy policy—against development and freedom, particularly the development of our most important form of energy, fossil fuels. Science is not going to win the global warming debate because it’s not about science climate is not going to win the global warming debate because it’s not about observed reality. If conservatives want to stop the global warming problem in its tracks the solution is within their grasp: refuse any more to indulge the left’s fantasy games start talking about the interests of real, living people.  \n",
      "Kill The Greenies. That’s the title of my new play which I hope to be touring later this summer round all the usual arts festivals. There’s just one problem: I can’t seem to get the grant funding.[It really wouldn’t take much. I’ve calculated, roughly, the amount I need to motivate me to get out of bed and spend the afternoon I reckon it would take me to dash off the outline of the script would be around $15,000. (Obviously I’ll leave the boring actual writing part to my team of faceless minions, like all the best people do.), advertisement, But the weird thing is, none of the various public funding arts bodies I’ve applied to seem interested in helping out. This is very odd. Perhaps I should take advice from the playwright David Finnigan who seems to have had better luck with a similar venture in Australia. Late in 2014, the ACT (that’s the government of the Australian Capital Territory in Canberra), paid $18,000 to fund the development of his play Kill The Deniers. One word – that’s the only difference between his title and mine. Yet he got the taxpayer dosh and I didn’t. What can I be doing wrong?, Well I’ve been looking at David Finnigan’s life (when he’s not working as writer, theatre-maker and festival producer, he works as a “pharmacy assistant”, apparently) and collected wisdom and I’ve realised, unlike David, that I’m just not good enough at bullshitting. Finnigan describes his play as “a really fun, really action-packed, really over the top hostage drama, and action film genre piece and hanging from that are some really important questions about the climate debate.”, Gosh, sounds really fun. But what’s it about?, Well, apparently, it’s, “An action movie-style drama in which Parliament House is invaded by gun-toting eco-terrorists. With the Government held hostage, and facing the threat of imminent execution unless she ends global warming immediately, the embattled Environment Minister has no choice but to defend her ideals – one bullet at a time.”, Hmm. Still a bit vague. But let me hazard a guess: the climate ‘deniers’ don’t come out of this story smelling of violets. Or, indeed, alive. In fact, it sounds to me like masturbatory fantasy of a climate activist so convinced of the rightness of his cause that he genuinely would kinda, sorta not mind too much if ‘deniers’ were put against the wall and shot for all the damage they’ve done to the climate debate. If he does think this way, though, Finnigan is careful not to show it in interview. Instead he deploys the bravura bullshit skills I mentioned earlier, as here:, ‘If someone uses the title “kill” in an art work I think we should question that. If someone uses an inflammatory title, which Kill Climate Deniers certainly is, then they should be taken to task … Because as an artist, as much as I have a right to provoke this conversation and use the language that I’ve used in the title, I think it’s important that that doesn’t come without cost,’ he said. ‘I think it’s life and death, the situation that we’re talking about with climate change. I look at my younger relatives who are going to have to grow up in a world where we’re right now facing already the beginnings of the escalating crises that are going to be confronting us over this century, and rather than doing anything we’ve got elected officials who are actively putting roadblocks in the way of dealing with it. ‘So for me there’s no question this is a really vital conversation to be starting and I will start it with as much urgency and hyperbole as I can muster. But that doesn’t mean that I’m above criticism and it doesn’t mean that I don‘t deserve to be questioned.’, See the genius of it? It’s obvious how this guy got that $18,000 grant. Note the way that he distances himself from the brutal malevolence of his title by waffling on about art, pretending it’s just about opening up debate (“vital conversation” as he calls it) and then turning it on its head by hinting that if anyone’s doing any killing in real life it’s those pesky deniers. Let’s think of the children, he urges us (“My younger relatives”). And let’s not have any sympathy for the people standing in the way of solving the greatest problem the world has ever known (“elected officials who are actively putting roadblocks in the way.”), Meanwhile, here’s a sneak preview of my play so far. Act One Scene i, A Torture Chamber. A group of bearded men in white lab coats, wearing the ribbon of the Nobel Prize to which they are not actually entitled, are stretching the latest temperature data on a giant rack. GAVIN SCHMIDT: Warm, damn you, warm!, RAW TEMPERATURE DATA: No! Please, no! I can’t help it if I was warmer in the 1930s. MICHAEL MANN: Fear not, Brother Gavin.

      "President Trump’s attempts to drain the swamp are being undermined by one of his key administrators.[Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, is more interested in building his political career than he is taking on the Green Blob, insiders report. advertisement, Pruitt is also said to be behind attempts to remove at least one of the key phrases from the president’s long-awaited Executive Order on the environment. It concerns a proposal to repeal the EPA’s Endangerment Finding on CO2 (the disastrous, unscientific, job-killing ruling introduced during the Obama Administration, which rebranded the harmless trace gas Carbon Dioxide as a dangerous substance). If Pruitt is successful and this clause is removed from the Executive Order it will represent a major setback for President Trump’s war with the Climate Industrial Complex. It may also put into jeopardy the promises Trump made on the campaign trail to scrap “any regulation that is outdated, unnecessary, bad for workers, or contrary to the national interest.”, “This is the president’s one shot at winning this battle,” an ally in the EPA camp warns. “It’s like the French heavy cavalry at Agincourt: lose momentum and he’s going to get stuck in the mud being shot to pieces by the English longbows.”, To understand the background to this story, you need to know who Scott Pruitt is and how he landed such a key job. The dismantling of the EPA, after all, is a core part of Trump’s swamp-draining program — so clearly it mattered greatly that the Administrator’s position should go to a capable, determined figure. Pruitt, a Republican lawyer, the Attorney General of Oklahoma seemed ideally qualified. One of his biographies describes him as a “leading advocate against the EPA’s activist agenda.” It was because of his combative track record — challenging his state’s rights against the federal bureaucracy of the EPA — that he landed the post of EPA Administrator. Since taking on the position, though, his appetite for doing what he was appointed to do appears to have diminished somewhat. True, his credentials as a climate sceptic are not much in doubt. Yes, he might even agree with President Trump that there’s a swamp out there that sorely needs draining. The problem is, insiders explain, is that the future of the EPA is of far less interest to Pruitt than his prospects of becoming either one of Oklahoma’s next senators or its next governor. “Pruitt wants to keep himself in the middle of the road so he can get himself elected,” one of my sources explains. “He’s not interested in managing the agency he’s interested in running for the senate and though of course he’s committed to the conservative cause, he’s more committed to himself.”, Of a piece with this was his recent spat with Mick Mulvaney, director of the White House’s Office of Management and Budget, over the EPA’s budget allowance. Pruitt — supposed to be a hawk — protested that he couldn’t accept the proposed 24 percent cut in the EPA’s $8.2 billion budget. A furious Mulvaney responded by increasing the cut to 31 percent. Incurring Mulvaney’s wrath, my sources tell me, was all part of the plan. “It made Pruitt look like the guy who sticks up for his people. A good look for someone running for senator of Oklahoma.”, Meanwhile, most of the actual running of the EPA has been deputed to Pruitt’s Chief of Staff Ryan Jackson. Like Pruitt, like many in the upper circles of the EPA, Jackson is a member of the Oklahoma political set. He cut his teeth as an aide to Oklahoma Senator James Inhofe who, as Chair of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, has long been a scourge of the Climate Industrial Complex. Jackson often tried to warn off Sen. Inhofe from becoming too outspoken on climate change — not out of reasons of principle but purely as a matter of realpolitik. Sen. Inhofe, however, never gave much of a damn about caution: now 82, he has no reason to make friends and influence people by making out nicey-nice on green issues. Pruitt, on the other hand, has been much more alive to Jackson’s cautions. He got his fingers quite badly burnt after he recently said on  CNBC that he did not consider carbon dioxide to be a major cause of global warming. At the time, I applauded Pruitt for saying what needed to be said. It was certainly an improvement on his disappointing performance at CPAC a few weeks before when he’d bounded around Tiggerishly repeating his favourite meaningless catchphrase “the future ain’t what it used to be” but proved himself quite incapable of answering a straightforward question about whether he believed in man-made climate change. But I gather from my sources that there was blowback from the White House (why, it is not clear). This has made Pruitt more determined than ever not to stick his head above the parapet by doing anything that would make him even more unpopular than he is already with the Green Blob and its many fellow travellers in the squish branch of the GOP. Pruitt’s lip-wobbling could scarcely come at a worse moment for Donald Trump. With his attempt to repeal Obamacare in temporary disarray, he badly needs a clear victory on one of his other battlefronts — not company commanders abandoning their positions at the very moment his flanks are most in danger. Already, the president has enough trouble on the environment front from other members of his inner circle. Both his daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner are true believers in the green faith and, like his Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, have argued for the tone of the President’s Executive Order on the environment to be softened. If the clause on the Endangerment Finding is removed from the Executive Order, attempts will be made by Pruitt and others to pretend that this isn’t a problem. What matters is all the stuff President Trump is definitely going to do, like cancel Obama’s Clean Power Plan and putting the Paris climate agreement to the Senate so they can overturn it. But this is disingenuous and misleading. The Endangerment Finding isn’t some negligible, easily circumnavigable piece of legislation. It was deliberately introduced by environmentalist zealots at the height of the Obama administration as the poison pill which would cripple U.S. industry by rebranding “greenhouse gases,” including CO2, as a pollutant. This gives environmental lawyers carte blanche to sue any U.S. administration that fails properly to combat this alleged menace. Yet as Cato’s Pat Michaels explained in his lunchtime presentation at the Heartland Institute Climate Conference last week, the Endangerment Finding is based on an entirely flawed premise. It presupposes that the various computer models used to predict dangerous climate change as a result of rising man-made CO2 levels are reliable and accurate. They are not. With time, the divergence between projected warming and observed warming has grown bigger, not smaller. This means, effectively, that the EPA’s Endangerment Finding declaration has no credible scientific basis whatsoever. In other words, the environmental movement has strayed so far beyond the realms of science that it has created several barn-door-sized targets for any administration brave enough to take it on. This is an argument that can be won many times over: on the science on the economics even on the environment itself — which is being caused untold damage by misguided policies supposedly designed to save it. But what President Trump needs now more than ever are administrators with the political will to do the right thing — which is, after all, the reason so many Americans voted for him. If Scott Pruitt is not up to that task, then maybe it’s about time he did the decent thing and handed over the reins to someone who is.\n",
      "Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump calls President Barack Obama’s appearance on the campaign trail with presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton “a carnival act.”[“We have a person in the White House that’s having a lot of fun. I watched him today, it’s like a carnival act,” Trump stated during his campaign rally in North Carolina on Tuesday night. “He should be home working on ISIS, where the threat is getting worse and worse, he should be working on trade, he should be working on the borders.”, advertisement, Trump also mocked Obama’s concern over climate change and carbon emissions, as the president so frequently uses Air Force One. “This guy — he gets on this plane. Flies to Hawaii. He’s there for a long time. Golf, golf, golf, golf. More, more. Learning how to chip, learning how to hit the drive, learning how to putt,” Trump jabbed. “ISIS is laughing at us, they’re chopping off heads, they’re drowning us in steel cages, and he’s out there playing golf.”, Trump’s comments came after Obama criticized the Republican in North Carolina. “This isn’t a reality show. This is reality. And being president of the United States means you have to deal with reality. When a crisis hits, you can’t just walk off the set. You can’t fire the scriptwriter. You can’t be reckless. You don’t have the luxury of just saying what’s in your head. You’ve gotta actually do your homework,” Obama jabbed.\n",
      "University of Michigan’s Energy Institute research professor John DeCicco, Ph.D. believes that rising carbon dioxide emissions cause global warming and, therefore, humans must find a way to reduce its levels in the atmosphere. But ethanol is the wrong solution.[According to his just-released study, political support for biofuels, particularly ethanol, exacerbates the problem instead of curing it. advertisement, DeCicco and his co-authors assert: “Contrary to popular belief, the heat-trapping carbon dioxide gas emitted when biofuels are burned is not fully balanced by the CO2 uptake that occurs as the plants grow.” The presumption that biofuels emit significantly fewer greenhouse gases (GHG) than gasoline does is, according to DeCicco: “misguided.”, His research has upended the conventional wisdom and angered the alternative fuel lobbyists. The headline-grabbing claim is that biofuels prove worse for the environment than gasoline. DeCicco has been focused on this topic for nearly a decade. In 2007, when the Energy Independence and Security Act (also known as the expanded ethanol mandate) was in the works, he told me: “I realized that something seemed horribly amiss with a law that established a sweeping mandate which rested on assumptions, not scientific fact, that were unverified and might be quite wrong, even though they were commonly accepted and politically correct (and politically convenient).” He saw that while biofuels sounded good, no one had checked the math. Previously, based on life cycle analysis, it has been assumed that crop-based biofuels, were not just carbon neutral, but actually offered modest net GHG reductions. This, DeCicco says, is the “premise of most climate related fuel policies promulgated to date, including measures such as the LCFS [California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard] and RFS [the federal Renewable Fuel Standard passed in 2005 and expanded in 2007].”, The DeCicco study, Carbon balance effects of U.S. biofuel production and use, uses Annual Basis Carbon (ABC) accounting—which does not treat biofuels as inherently carbon neutral. Instead, it treats biofuels as “part of a dynamic stock-and-flow system.” Its methodology “tallies CO2 emissions based on the chemistry in the specific locations where they occur.” In May, on my radio program, DeCicco explained: “Life Cycle Analysis is wrong because it fails to actually look at what is going on at the farms.”, The concept behind DeCicco’s premise is that the idea of ethanol being carbon neutral assumes that the ground where the corn is grown was barren dirt (without any plants removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere) before the farmer decided to plant corn for ethanol. If that were the case, then, yes, planting corn on that land, converting that corn to ethanol that is then burned as a vehicle fuel, might come close to being carbon neutral. But the reality is that land already had corn, or some other crop, growing on it—so that land’s use was already absorbing CO2. You can’t count it twice. DeCicco explains “Growing the corn that becomes ethanol absorbs no more carbon from the air than the corn that goes into cattle feed or corn flakes. Burning the ethanol releases essentially the same amount of CO2 as burning gasoline. No less CO2 went into the air from the tailpipe no more CO2 was removed from the air at the cornfield. So where’s the climate benefit?”, Much of that farmland was growing corn to feed cattle and chickens—also known as feedstock. The RFS requires an ever-increasing amount of ethanol be blended into the nation’s fuel supply. Since the RFS became law in 2005, the amount of land dedicated to growing corn for ethanol has increased from 12.4 percent of the overall corn crop to 38.6 percent. While the annual supply of corn has increased by 17 percent, the amount going into feedstock has decreased from 57.5 percent to 37.98%. The rub comes from the fact that we are not eating less. Globally, more food is required, not less. The livestock still needs to be fed. So while the percentage of corn going into feedstock in the U.S. has decreased because of the RFS, that corn is now grown somewhere else. One such place is Brazil where previous pasture land, because it is already flat, has been converted to growing corps. Ranchers have been pushed out to what was forest and deforestation is taking place. Adding to the biofuels-are-worse-than-gasoline accounting are the effects from producing ethanol. You have to cook it and ferment it—which requires energy. In the process, CO2 bubbles off. By expanding the quantity of corn grown, prairie land is busted up and stored CO2 is released. DeCicco says: “it is this domino effect that makes ethanol worse.”, How much worse?, The study looks at the period with the highest increase in ethanol production due to the RFS: 2005-2013. The conclusion is that the increased carbon dioxide uptake by the crops was only enough to offset 37 percent of the CO2 emissions due to biofuel combustion. DeCicco’s research finds, that while further work is needed to examine the research and policy implications going forward, “it makes more sense to soak up CO2 through reforestation and redouble efforts to protect forests rather than producing biofuels, which puts carbon rich lands at risk.”, Regardless of differing views on climate change, we can agree that more trees are a good thing and that “using government mandates and subsidies to promote politically favored fuels is a waste of taxpayers’ money.”, The author of Energy Freedom, Marita Noon serves as the executive director for Energy Makes America Great Inc. and the companion educational organization, the Citizens’ Alliance for Responsible Energy (CARE).

      "President Barack Obama joined the liberal chorus of  criticizing “fake news” suggesting that the so-called fact-free journalism spread on social media was part of the reason why Democrats lost in the 2016 election.[“If, generally, we’ve got elections that aren’t focused on issues and are full of fake news and false information and distractions, then the issue is not going to be what’s happening from the outside the issue is going to be what are we doing for ourselves from the inside,” Obama said during a press conference in Peru over the weekend. advertisement, Obama discussed the issue as reporters questioned him about Russia hacking the Democratic National Committee and seemingly releasing emails to swing the election. He said that he was less concerned about propaganda and hacking and more concerned about the way information was promulgated on social media. “As I’ve said before, the concern I have has less to do with any particular misinformation or propaganda that’s being put out by any particular party, and a greater concern about the general misinformation from all kinds of sources — domestic, foreign, on social media — that make it very difficult for voters to figure out what’s true and what’s not,” he said. Obama has spent a greater part of his post-election reflecting on the issue of social media and it’s effect on Democrats losing the election. “Part of ways changed in politics is social media and how people are receiving information,” he said, during a press conference in Germany. “It’s easier to make negative attacks and simplistic slogans than it is to communicate complex policies.”, He added that it was difficult for Americans to “discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda,” asserting that facts were essential to a functioning democracy. Part of Donald Trump’s victory, Obama believes, is his ability to thrive on social media. “Trump understands the new ecosystem, in which facts and truth don’t matter,” Obama said in an interview with the New Yorker. “You attract attention, rouse emotions, and then move on.”, As he grew in power, Obama explained, conservative media made it more difficult for him to attract support. “In southern Illinois, in those counties I won, I was at V.F.W.s and fish fries hearing people’s stories and talking to folks, so that they knew me,” Obama said, referring to his Senate election in 2004. “They weren’t getting me through Fox or Rush Limbaugh or Breitbart or RedState.”\n",

      "Cars and other vehicles “have turned into deadly weapons”, and should be banished from cities to stop attacks like the one in Stockholm from happening in future, according to Aftonbladet editorialist Eva Franchell.[Crackdowns on immigration or extremist ideology are not the way forward when it comes to terror prevention, according to the veteran journalist, writing after Friday’s terror attack in Stockholm left four people dead. advertisement, Instead, it is cars — which she calls “effective murder machines” — that Franchell says “must simply be removed from city centres and places where people gather, if people are to be protected in future”. Vehicles are “easy to steal, and so nothing has been able to stop their advance”, writes Ms. Franchell. “It just isn’t reasonable that a big truck can be driven right into one of Stockholm’s busiest streets on a Friday afternoon right before Easter.”, Noting how it is a popular destination for tourists, Franchell says the city centre must be a “safe environment” for visitors to enjoy. She described it as “remarkable” that it is possible to drive around the Swedish capital’s medieval old town. Outlining her vision for a car-free Stockholm, she argues: “Most problems with regards to mobility and public transport can be solved, and deliveries to shops and restaurants could take place at times when people aren’t out on the streets.”, “Vehicles have been allowed to dominate our cities for decades and it’s the people who need space. It’s vital now that cars be regulated,” the piece concludes. The idea of reducing the number of cars in Swedish cities was backed last month by Sweden’s environment minister, who argued that driving is a gender equality issue as well as a matter of shrinking the nation’s carbon emissions. “Cars are driven largely by men so by giving a lot of space to cars we’re giving a lot of space to men — at the expense of women,” Karolina Skog explained.\n",

Now it’s time to make a joke of the previous President’s claims that the pipeline would make no “meaningful long-term contribution to our economy.”, Abandoning Keystone was one of countless sacrifices Americans have been forced to make to the Church of Global Warming. It’s interesting to note how the anti-Keystone case was made largely on safety grounds during the previous administration’s long delay of the project, but today climate change is the most widely cited objection to the project in media reports. For example, the New York Times wrote on Tuesday, “Studies showed that the pipeline would not have a momentous impact on jobs or the environment, but both sides made it into a symbolic test case of American willingness to promote energy production or curb its appetites to heal the planet.” , Even a former head of the State Department’s energy bureau under Obama, David Goldwyn, told the Times that Keystone “has never been a significant issue from an environmental point of view in substance, only in symbol.” The rest of us are tired of footing the bill for environmentalist symbolism. Obama’s action was seen at the time as “strengthening his hand” for what proved to be utterly worthless climate talks in Paris. The American people are thoroughly sick and tired of sacrificing their prosperity so left-wing leaders can act like big shots at luxuriously catered climate conferences. They’re also tired of making sacrifices so environmental groups can feel good about themselves, a theme that comes up repeatedly in discussions of Keystone XL over the years. Pipelines are safer than any other means of transporting oil the network Keystone XL will plug into has been running just fine for a long time. The amount of oil it will move is significant, but hardly enough to figure in any credible argument about the fate of the planetary environment. Too often the anti-Keystone argument devolved into: environmentalists need this to keep their spirits up and remain unified. There are still some hurdles for Keystone XL to cross (and the Dakota Access situation is even more convoluted, bringing Indian tribes and the Army Corps of Engineers into the mix) but President Trump seemed eager to strike a blow against duplicitous bureaucratic delays, promising an end to Obama’s habit of strangling projects in red tape to stave off angry backlash from voters. , “It’s out of control, and we’re going to make a very short process, and we’re going to either give you your permits or we’re not going to give you your permits, but you’re going to know very quickly,” Trump promised on Tuesday. , Based on the prior history of Keystone, it’s highly likely to pass the expedited review process Trump ordered. The project’s opponents know that, which is why an expedited process was the last thing they wanted.\n",

      "PARIS (AP) — On a day when the Paris bid committee was supposed to show its best to the world, a knife attack on a solider raised more security questions about the French capital’s capacity to host the 2024 Olympics in a safe atmosphere.[The news of Friday’s attack outside the Louvre Museum broke hours before bid officials hosted a ceremony near the Eiffel Tower to coincide with the final submission of their 110-page dossier to the International Olympic Committee. advertisement, The assault, the latest in a wave of attacks that has left more than 200 people dead in the country over the past two years, again highlighted the threat French officials say hangs over the country.

Speaking outside the Louvre, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, who is set to attend the ceremony alongside Prime Minister Bernard Cazeneuve, athletes and other bid leaders later Friday, said all major cities around the globe are under threat. “In a context of a terror threat hanging over all big cities in the world, we witnessed the efficiency and the relevance of the security measures put in place in Paris,” Hidalgo said. Paris, which has not hosted the Olympics since the 1924 Games, is competing against Budapest and Los Angeles. The International Olympic Committee will choose the host city in September. IOC President Thomas Bach was reassuring during a visit to Paris last year, saying that France showed it can deal with security challenges during the European Championship.\n",
      "At the Republican National Convention last summer, the GOP approved a platform that stated: “We propose to shift responsibility for environmental regulation from the federal bureaucracy to the states and to transform the EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] into an independent bipartisan commission, similar to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, with structural safeguards against politicized science.” It also says “We will likewise forbid the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide, something never envisioned when Congress passed the Clean Air Act.”[The GOP followed the lead of President Donald Trump, who in a March debate said he would abolish EPA, and in a May speech in North Dakota condemned “the Environmental Protection Agency’s use of totalitarian tactics” that has “denied millions of Americans access to the energy wealth sitting under our feet. This is your treasure, and you – the American People – are entitled to share in the riches.”, advertisement, Trump and the GOP are saying, finally, what millions of people have been thinking for a long time: EPA has become the cause of, not the solution to, the nation’s major environmental problems. It’s time to end EPA. A Promising Beginning, In the late 1960s, the United States faced real problems regarding the quality of its air and water, waste disposal, and contamination from mining and agriculture. Pollution crossed borders – the borders between private property as well as between cities, states, and nations – and traditional remedies based on private property rights didn’t seem to be working. The public was overly complacent about the possible threat to their safety. Many scientists, myself included, lobbied the federal government to form a cabinet-level agency to address these problems. [1] In 1971, EPA was born. During the agency’s first 10 years, Congress passed seven legislative acts to protect the environment, including the Water Pollution Control Act (later renamed the Clean Water Act), Safe Drinking Water Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and the Clean Air Act. At first, these laws worked well, protecting the environment and the health of our citizens. Problems were identified, measured, exposed, and major investments were made to reduce dangerous emissions and protect the public from exposure to them. EPA and other government agencies regularly report the subsequent dramatic reduction in all the pollutants we originally targeted. By the 1980s, nothing more needed to be done beyond monitoring our continuing success in cleaning up the environment. It was time to declare victory and go home. EPA Is Now an Obstacle, Beginning around 1981, however, radical Leftists realized they could advance their political agenda by taking over the environmental movement and use it to advocate for ever-more draconian regulations on businesses. Environmentalists allowed this take-over to occur because it brought massive funding from liberal foundations, political power, and prestige. [2], Politicians realized they could win votes by pandering to the environmental movement, repeating their pseudo-scientific claims, and posing as protectors of nature and the public health. The wind, solar, and ethanol industries saw they could use regulations to handicap competitors or help themselves to public subsidies. Today, EPA is a captive of activist and special-interest groups. Its regulations have nothing to do with protecting the environment. Its rules account for nearly half of the $2 trillion annual cost of complying with all national regulations in the United States. In 2008, The Heritage Foundation estimated the costs of EPA’s first proposal to regulate greenhouse gases in the name of fighting global warming were “close to $7 trillion and three million manufacturing jobs lost.” According to Heritage, “the sweep of regulations … could severely affect nearly every major energy-using product from cars to lawnmowers, and a million or more businesses and buildings of all types. And all of this sacrifice is in order to make, at best, a minuscule contribution to an overstated environmental threat.”, President Barack Obama has routinely used EPA to circumvent Congress to impose severe regulations on farmers, ranchers, other private landowners, fisheries, and the energy sector. Just last week, the agency rushed through approval of new fuel efficiency standards for automobiles more than a year ahead of schedule to thwart any attempts by the Trump administration to stop it. Courts and Congress have objected to and tried to limit EPA’s abuses, but without noticeable success. Once a genuine success story, EPA has become the biggest obstacle to further environmental progress. Replacing EPA, The solution is to return this authority to the states, replacing EPA with a Committee of the Whole of the 50 state environmental protection agencies. State EPAs already have primary responsibility for the implementation of the nation’s environmental laws and EPA regulations. With more than 30 years of experience, these state agencies are ready to take over management of the nation’s environment. Accountable to 50 governors and state legislatures, state EPAs are more attuned to real-world needs and trade-offs. Located in 50 state capitols, they are less vulnerable to the Left’s massive beltway lobbying machine. The Committee would be made up of representatives from each state. EPA could be phased out over five years, which could include a one-year preparation period followed by a four-year program in which 25 percent of the agency’s activities would be passed to the Committee each year. Seventy-five percent of EPA’s budget could be eliminated and most of the remainder would pay for national research labs. A small administrative structure would allow the states to refine existing environmental laws in a manner more suitable to protecting our environment without thwarting the development of our natural resources and energy supplies. Benefits of Replacing EPA, The federal budget for environmental protection could be reduced from $8.6 billion to $2 billion or less. Staffing could be reduced from more than 15,000 to 300. The real savings, of course, would be in reduction of the $1 trillion in annual regulatory costs EPA imposes each year. This reform would produce a second huge benefit by ending the government’s war on affordable energy. EPA is the principal funder and advocate of global warming alarmism, the myth that man-made climate change is a crisis. That movement would end on the day EPA’s doors shut, allowing Congress to return to taxpayers and consumers a “peace dividend” amount to some of the $4 billion a day currently spent world-wide on climate change. Dismantling EPA is one part of a comprehensive set of reforms, many of them discussed by Trump and referred to in the GOP platform, to lighten the massive weight of government regulations on the American people. The nation needs a pro-energy, pro-environment, and pro-jobs agenda that recognizes the tremendous value of the natural resources under our feet. While the rest of the world stumbles blindly in the grip of an anti-energy and anti-freedom ideology, the U.S. can march ahead and regain its place as the world’s economic and technological leader. The nation’s environment is in terrific shape, thanks to early efforts by EPA and more recent efforts by state governments and businesses. The nation’s economy and environment will be even better if the federal government gets out of the way. EPA has long outlived its usefulness. Let’s return its powers to the states, where they belong.

      "Hillary Clinton is now losing the Democratic race to Bernie Sanders in both Iowa and New Hampshire.[A stunning new Quinnipiac poll released Tuesday afternoon shows Sanders beating Clinton in Iowa, 49 percent to 44 percent. advertisement, And a separate Monmouth poll released Tuesday shows Sanders ahead of Clinton in New Hampshire, 53 percent to 39 percent. The Sanders Surge comes on the heels of news that the FBI is expanding its investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email scandal to also investigate whether public corruption occurred, and powerful new revelations about Clinton’s health and medication consumption. Sanders is picking up the support of white Democratic voters, whom polls show are fleeing Clinton in favor of more independent-leaning candidates like Donald Trump. In Iowa, Sanders beat Clinton across the board on issues including how best to handle the economy (51 to 39) and climate change (51 to 32), and he’s still beating her overall despite the fact that Clinton is way ahead of him in the poll on the issue of terrorism.

      "President Donald Trump delivered one of his most important campaign speeches at the Williston Basin Petroleum Conference in Bismarck, North Dakota on May 26, 2016. During the headlines-making speech, Trump presented his “America First Energy Plan,” a fundamentally different path for the U.S. fossil-fuel industry.[Trump’s plan called for a significant expansion of the oil, natural gas, and clean-coal industries. In the same speech, the future president pledged to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, which had been signed by President Barack Obama in 2016.  The Paris agreement calls for America to drastically reduce its carbon-dioxide emissions in the name of slowing or preventing human-caused climate change. advertisement, During the eight years of the Obama administration, the federal government put into place a series of regulations designed to reduce and ultimately eliminate fossil fuels as an American energy source, and the Paris agreement was meant to continue Obama’s anti-fossil-fuel legacy in the future. Policies that aim to reverse and disparage CO2 use have always been popular in the media, among ensconced government bureaucrats, and in academic circles, but they are anathema to the men and women who work in industry and agriculture. In my view, Trump is in the White House today largely because of that North Dakota energy speech. And if you doubt it, take a look at an election map showing the results of the 2016 presidential race. You’ll see that 84 percent of the nation is colored red, with huge majorities of Trump voters residing in America’s Heartland. The Heartland and its various industries have for many decades depended on fossil fuels in one form or another, and the people living there know it, which is bad news for anti-energy Democrats, who could remain out of power in the Heartland for a decade or more. Both the Trump speech and his plan were roundly criticized by media elites, academics, and those who make a living regulating people’s lives. Their argument has been and remains today that Trump’s America First Energy Plan is proof the president is ignorant about the supposed benefits of limiting fossil-fuel production and the potential of the alternative-energy market. There is also a lot of anger that’s derived from Trump’s rejection of policies that aim to fight climate change by reducing CO2. But on both scores, it’s the elites that are the ignorant ones. Ramping up fossil-fuel production will spur economic growth, and thus help to balance the budget fund infrastructure projects and allow all Americans to enjoy a higher quality of life. A massive world market is eager to see the United States increase its production and energy exports. Billions of people around the world go without energy every day, and billions more people will soon be living in the same countries where energy poverty is currently endemic. America’s fossil-fuel industries could help these people enjoy the prosperity and comfort of a middle-class lifestyle and all the benefits that come with it, including living longer. Trump understands the potential for fossil fuels better than any American political leader in modern history. He has made the media and the eco-left crazy because he has refused to embrace their vision of apocalyptic global warming. That, in their eyes, is the president’s cardinal sin, but the Heartland sees it as a virtue. The president’s call to withdraw from Paris was as sound as his support for policies that would help the country secure energy dominance. Of course, not everyone agrees. Some Republicans, including people within Trump’s own team, believe America should “stay in Paris.” This would be a massive mistake. Paris is an impediment to human development. Using fossil fuels to power the world is the only realistic way to bring billions of people out of poverty and provide affordable and abundant energy for the billions more that will soon join us on Earth. As I compose this today the news is full of stories that President Trump does indeed intend to keep the campaign pledge to withdraw from Paris.  All praise, Mr. President, and please adhere to this path even as the Swamp, the Europeans and the major media all try to dishonestly shame you into staying in Paris. Stay on the course that recognizes the Paris agreement incorrectly demonizes carbon and CO2 emissions. Stay on the course that recognizes the Paris agreement is deeply flawed as it would put the world on a path to eliminate the use of fossil fuels. Americans and people everywhere would be deeply harmed by staying in Paris. While the lawyers and experts figure out how to the undo the legal and diplomatic labyrinth the Obama team put in place to protect his flawed legacy, the American people, the world community and the natural environment will all benefit as Team Trump manages our energy policy and vast fossil fuel resources to fulfill their America First Energy Plan.

      "“I screwed up the economy, your jobs and your mortgages so – hey – I’m just the guy you can trust to tell you what to do about climate change!”[That was my take home message of a piece Hank Paulson penned for the New York Times a couple of years ago on the urgent need for a carbon tax. advertisement, Two years on – with fellow GOP Establishment stooges James Baker and George Shultz – he’s still harping on the same tedious theme. This copper-bottomed, ocean-going shyster Paulson is the kind of Dubya-period  throwback whose advice the Trump administration should avoid like the plague. As Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson not only failed to predict the 2008 financial crash – the US economy is “very healthy” and “robust” he insisted in 2007 – but it’s quite possible that his encouragement of risky lending while he was at Goldman Sachs helped cause it. But that’s because Paulson is the very embodiment of the liberal elite which both the Brexit vote and the election of Donald Trump were designed to overthrow. Paulson may notionally identify as a Republican. Or, at least, he served with a “Republican” administration. But what’s quite evident from his demands for a carbon tax is that he belongs to that shiftless DC/corporatist/bankster elite which couldn’t give two hoots whether it’s a Democrat or Republican in charge, just so long as the elite get to maintain their power base and their revenue stream. Note how, back in 2014 when he was calling for that carbon tax in the New York Times, he boasted about teaming up with Tom Steyer (arch-liberal hedge funder, creator of the NextGen super PAC) and Michael Bloomberg. These men are not conservatives. What they are is crony capitalists. They are the embodiment of almost everything that America voted against when it voted for Donald Trump. Of course they want to tax “carbon”. By taxing carbon dioxide (the harmless trace gas which makes the planet greener), the US government would be signalling to the world that it still believes in the man-made global warming narrative. This, in turn, would keep alive the crony-capitalist “renewables” industry in which Paulson, Steyer, Bloomberg and their friends are so heavily invested. Even now, Wall Street remains quite hideously exposed to the green boondoggle. When the Green Blob finally explodes, a lot of rent-seekers and crony capitalists and dodgy financiers are going to lose billions. That’s the real reason Donald Trump is being put under such pressure by these people. Not because they consider global warming a real threat but because they’re terrified of all the money they and their friends stand to lose. If you want to understand this in more detail, you should read my Breitbart piece Why Renewables Are Doomed and Fossil Fuels Are The Future. It’s quite long but it does tell it like it is and it also gives you an idea of why I so loathe these Establishment protozoa and why you should too…, I’d call them pondlife, except I’m quite fond of dragonfly larvae and newts. I’d call them reptiles – but snakes are cool and lizards are beautiful. But please, Donald Trump, for the love of all the decent people who put you in the White House, do not listen to these bottom-feeding scumbags, no matter how plausible their manner and how exquisitely handstitched their Brioni suits.

Dashcam video footage released a year later showed that Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke shot McDonald more than a dozen times, eventually killing him as he tried to walk away from the officers, NBC 5 Chicago reported. The officer was charged with first-degree murder, and there was a public outcry that McCarthy resign. McCarthy admitted it was a “bad shooting” and that the officer in that incident should be punished, but also said that this anti-police brutality sentiment is “hamstringing” law enforcement. McCarthy said that he is “hopeful” that President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for attorney general, Sen. Jeff Sessions, will do more for police than the justice department under President Obama. “I think the Trump election quite frankly is a reaction to that,” he said. “I think the people are tired of career politicians who’ve never really had a job telling us how we should think and how we should act.”\n",

      "Calling recent political discourse in the U.S. “lacking in civility,” a Washington bureaucrat is insisting that we stop using the phrase “drain the swamp” to describe change in Washington because, apparently, it is an insult to real swamps everywhere.[Adam Rosenblatt, a science and technology policy fellow at the American Association for the Advancement of Science based at the Department of Energy in Washington, D.C. recently noted in a Washington Post op-ed that using the term “drain the swamp” is a “terrible analogy.”, advertisement, Rosenblatt, an ecologist by training, has decided to take the term literally, instead of metaphorically as it is intended, and is now warning about the dangers of draining real — not just political — swamps. It is, he says, very bad for the ecosystem. In his December 29 piece, the Washington bureaucrat was dismissive of Donald Trump’s use of the metaphor as a slogan to promulgate his desire to eliminate waste and abuse in Washington, and even erroneously said that Newt Gingrich has “disavowed” the phrase. Gingrich recently admitted he was mistaken when he said the incoming Trump administration did not want to use the phrase anymore. But Rosenblatt went on to insist that using the political catchphrase might make people dismissive of the importance of real-life swamps and might tend to make people less mindful of how important swamps are to our ecosystem. “My extensive experience working in and studying swamps allows me to see just how terrible the analogy is,” Rosenblatt insisted. “Given the sea of misinformation we currently find ourselves swimming in, I feel this is as good a time as any to clarify what swamps actually are and why they should be regarded as wonderful and valuable parts of nature rather than objects of derision and hatred.”, Rosenblatt went on to describe the good things real wetlands do for the ecology and detailed the damage done by past efforts to actually drain real swamps. “It is clear, then, that swamps do not deserve their reputation as useless ecosystems, nor do they deserve to be co-opted as a lazy, inept political metaphor,” Rosenblatt complained. “The next time you hear a politician or pundit talk about ‘draining the swamp,’ remember that swamps can be sources of resource abundance and protection from natural disasters, which are exactly some of the functions a responsible government should promote,” the ecologist and Washington bureaucrat sonorously warned.

      "New York magazine’s Jonathan Chait blasts Matt Lauer’s performance as the moderator of NBC’s Commander-in-Chief Forum on Wednesday night between presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.[I had not taken seriously the possibility that Donald Trump could win the presidency until I saw Matt Lauer host an hour-long interview with the two major-party candidates. Lauer’s performance was not merely a failure, it was horrifying and shocking. The shock, for me, was the realization that most Americans inhabit a very different news environment than professional journalists. I not only consume a lot of news, since it’s my job, I also tend to focus on elite print-news sources. Most voters, and all the more so undecided voters, subsist on a news diet supplied by the likes of Matt Lauer. And the reality transmitted to them from Lauer matches the reality of the polls, which is a world in which Clinton and Trump are equivalently flawed. advertisement, Lauer focused a third of his questioning time on Clinton’s private email server.

Jeb Bush (R-FL) said his rival Donald Trump’s popularity is a backlash to President Barack Obama and it will pass. advertisement, Bush said, “Trump clearly banning all Muslims would actually be so counterproductive in our efforts to destroy ISIS that it’s foolhardy. I mean, it’s beyond ridiculous. It’s quite dangerous.”, When asked about voters supporting Trump’s ban on Muslims, Bush continued, “In a month from now they won’t. That’s the point. The point is that we’re living in this reality-TV kind of political environment, where he fills the space by saying outrageous things. People, based on their emotions, will express support for the sentiment, not necessarily the specifics, because there are none, and then he’ll backtrack. And he’ll move on to the next thing, and he fills the space….I think the emotion of the here and now will subside. Are people scared about the national security interests of our country being violated because of a lax immigration system or a visa waiver program that wasn’t designed for people being radicalized? Yes, they’re scared, and the job of a president — or a candidate, for that matter — isn’t to scare them more it’s to give them solutions, and that’s what I’m trying to do.”, He continued, “I would argue that Donald Trump is in fact a creature of Barack Obama.

      "The national anthem protests in the National Football League have gone entirely too far.[The league could have stopped these absurd outbursts if they had delivered Colin Kaepernick a stern rebuke instead of going on about his freedom of expression — a right that he can exercise just as easily from the frigid stands at Levi’s Stadium as from the sidelines. Then other players started joining in then a women’s soccer player and now the Seattle Seahawks (or not?), who practically play in Canada anyway. advertisement, So far, few people have had the guts to stand up to the madness, aside from the military families and veterans who booed and protested Kaepernick at Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego. Denver Broncos linebacker Brandon Marshall lost a military-related sponsor, and USA Hockey coach John Tortorella vowed that any player who sat for the anthem would stay there. It has become impossible to avoid the opinions of these supposedly oppressed, gratuitously overpaid wannabe social justice warriors. The latest insult is that Madden NFL 17 — that’s right, the video game — is going to be incorporating the Kaepernick protest. According to Fox Sports, “On Monday, EA Sports confirmed that in addition to remarking on weekly trends and notable performances from players, [Brandon] Gaudin and [Charles] Davis will address Colin Kaepernick’s decision to sit during the national anthem last week, which drew a mixture of praise and harsh criticism from fellow players and fans.”, That’s it — I’ve had enough.

      "Yesterday I asked of lying liar climate ‘scientist’ Michael Mann: “Does anyone take this guy seriously any more?”[But the question was a purely rhetorical one. I already knew the depressing true answer having just sat, fuming, in my car listening to Mann being given the red carpet treatment on a BBC Radio 4 science programme. advertisement, “Oh Professor Doctor Mann, Sir, may it please your eminence to descend from your radiant cloud for a few precious moments and explain to us mere mortals why your amazing and unquestionably brilliant new paper on global warming demonstrates you to be even more right about climate change than you were even in the days when you won your Nobel prize?” fawned and grovelled the BBC’s interviewer from his prostrate position on the studio floor. Perhaps I exaggerate slightly. But it would be fair to say that the BBC’s interviewer, Adam Rutherford, sought to leave the listener in no doubt that when it came to climate science the “Distinguished Professor of Atmospheric Science” Michael Mann was a respected expert of great insight whose opinions one could totally trust. Mann isn’t though, is he?, Maybe in 2001, when Mann’s Hockey Stick was promoted heavily in the IPCC’s Third Assessment Report, it would have been legitimate enough for the BBC to quote him as a climate scientist of note. But that was 16 years ago, since when the Hockey Stock has been discredited to the point where not even the IPCC quotes it in its reports. And where Mann’s reputation has become so tarnished that Mark Steyn was able to compile and edit a 300-page book called A Disgrace To The Profession, consisting largely of distinguished scientists from around the world explaining in lavish detail how utterly flawed, bankrupt and worthless Michael Mann’s climate science was. “Misleading” “Just bad science” “Very erroneous conclusions” “A crock of shit” “Excuse me while I puke.”, ….just a few of things scientists had to say about Mann and his work. But as we were reminded yet again on the BBC’s Inside Science programme this week, the BBC continues to treat this tainted and controversial figure with uncritical reverence. On the programme, his interviewer Adam Rutherford allowed Mann space to give a version of this week’s Congressional hearing on climate science so ludicrously biased towards the alarmist narrative it might have been scripted by Greenpeace. “We have currently as the chair of the House of Representatives Science Committee an individual – Lamar Smith – whose funding mostly comes from fossil fuel interests who rejects the overwhelming consensus of the world’s scientists that climate change is real and human caused and represents a threat. The hearing was intended to provide cover to Congressional Republicans and the current Trump administration who are trying to cut funding for climate science and who are trying to roll back the policy successes over the last several years in dealing with climate change and dealing with carbon emissions.”, “As the hearing went on every time the topic was about the substance, what the science has to say, my feeling was that the Congressional Republicans realised that they were on the defensive, that they were losing the argument because, after all, they are denying the overwhelming consensus of the world’s scientists. And eventually it got into the gutter where they were trying to discredit me personally and to talk about squabbles between scientists in a sense it was a confirmation that they knew they had lost the actual scientific argument at that hearing.”, “It’s a difficult period right now for anybody who cares about science. We’re about to see an unprecedented event next month here in DC where scientists are going to be marching in the streets….I think it’s a recognition from the typically quite reticent and conservative scientific community that they have to speak out now, that there’s a threat to science and to scientists unlike anything that we have, in my view, faced in the past.”, None of this weapons grade bilge went even slightly challenged by Rutherford, who flagged his own concerns about the Trump administration’s approach to climate science at the beginning of the interview by describing it as “troubling” and “disturbing”. [Says who? Why??], Let’s not forget, also, that there were three other scientists with at least as much knowledge and experience as Mann who were speaking at the same Congressional hearings, only from a sceptical point of view. Might it not have been useful for the purposes of balance to get at least one of them – John Christy, Judith Curry or Roger Pielke Jr – for the BBC to hear from one of them too?, In theory, this is one of the BBC’s statutory obligations. According to the terms of its revised Charter 2006:, ‘The BBC must do all it can to ensure that controversial subjects are treated with due accuracy and impartiality in all relevant output.’, As Christopher Booker detailed in his thorough report for the Global Warming Policy Foundation The BBC And Climate Change: A Triple Betrayal – the BBC has consistently failed to do this in its woefully one-sided treatment of environmental issues. Indeed, the BBC hasn’t just failed to remain impartial on the issue it has actively proselytised on behalf of the climate change scare lobby across a range of programmes from the hysterical reportage of its green-activist-in-chief Roger Harrabin on BBC Radio 4 news, to the doddery laments of its house Malthusian Sir David Attenborough, to the mad-eyed eco-lunacy of Chris Packham, to the rampant global warming alarmism promoted by its entire celebrity science team from Adam Rutherford (see above) to perma-smiley pouty boy physicist Brian Cox and its stupendously-pleased-with-themselves lefty comics Robin Ince and Daragh O’Briaiaiaan. All this would be absolutely totally fine if the BBC were a private subscription channel whose sole purpose was to reinforce the ill-informed prejudices of the liberal elite. But it’s not. It’s supposed to be for everyone. Even deplorables like you and me. In this regard it fails. And always will fail. Scrap the licence fee, I say. That’ll teach it.\n",
      "A new poll by the Institute of Governmental Studies (IGS) at UC Berkeley shows that a majority of registered voters in California want the state’s elected Democrats to work with President Donald Trump rather than to resist his agenda.[The poll reveals that “by a 53% to 47% margin, slightly more voters prefer that when state leaders disagree with the president they should try to work with him even if it means making compromises, rather than opposing him if it risks negative consequences and losses in federal funding.”, advertisement, , Voters prefer that Democrats work with Trump even though 61% disapprove of the job he is doing, according to the poll, which surveyed 1,000 registered voters and has a margin of error of 3.6%. In fact, the poll found that Trump has lower approval ratings than any U.S. president at this point in his presidency since the poll began, with President John F. Kennedy in 1961. In addition, the poll finds that Californians reject “CalExit” and proposals to secede from the Union by more than a two-to-one margin, 68% to 32%. Republicans (85% no, 15% yes) are more opposed than Democrats (56% no, 44% yes) to seceding. The poll also found that California voters approve of Trump’s policies on infrastructure, the economy and jobs — and disapprove of his policies on every other issue. Trump rated lowest on his policies on the environment, and on minority groups. Illegal immigration was a closer call, with 38% of California’s registered voters approving of his policies and 49% disapproving, as the state’s Democrats prepare for a showdown with Trump over the contentious issue of sanctuary cities.

      "…Is because he has a very powerful bullshit detector. We know this thanks to a fascinating and unwittingly revelatory article in the German newspaper Der Spiegel.[, advertisement,  , The paper reveals how, in the days running up to President Trump’s decision to quit the UN Paris accord, he received a series of deputations from EU leaders urging him to change his mind. “For me it’s easier to stay in than step out,” Trump told them. This is perfectly true. Since his momentous Rose Garden speech announcing his plans to pull out of Paris, Trump has taken more flak than a thousand-bomber raid over Berlin in ’44. He has upset his daughter Ivanka, his Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, his financial advisor Gary Cohn. On top of that, he has given the entire liberal half of the planet, plus sundry conservative squishes, the perfect excuse they needed to dismiss him as a science-denying loon in thrall to Big Oil, Big Coal, Big Evil, etc…, If Trump pulls the US out of the #ParisAgreement he will be committing a traitorous act of war against the American people. My statement: pic.twitter.com/Qjgxm4fELp, — Tom Steyer (@TomSteyer) May 29, 2017, , USA to Earth: FUCK YOU, — Michael Moore (@MMFlint) June 1, 2017, , Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 1, 2017, , So what was it that tipped Trump over the edge?, Well sure, as he made clear in his brilliant White House speech, it was about American jobs. But while I’ve no doubt that that fact provided the rational basis for his bold, principled decision, I think we can look elsewhere for the tipping point. And here it is, in black and white, in Der Spiegel‘s account of how the G7 leaders tried to badger Trump at the summit in Taormina, Sicily. Leaders of the world’s seven most powerful economies were gathered around the table and the issues under discussion were the global economy and sustainable development. The newly elected French president, Emmanuel Macron, went first. It makes sense that the Frenchman would defend the international treaty that bears the name of France’s capital: The Paris Agreement. “Climate change is real and it affects the poorest countries,” Macron said. Then, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau reminded the U.S. president how successful the fight against the ozone hole had been and how it had been possible to convince industry leaders to reduce emissions of the harmful gas. Finally, it was Merkel’s turn. Renewable energies, said the chancellor, present significant economic opportunities. “If the world’s largest economic power were to pull out, the field would be left to the Chinese,” she warned. Xi Jinping is clever, she added, and would take advantage of the vacuum it created. Even the Saudis were preparing for the post-oil era, she continued, and saving energy is also a worthwhile goal for the economy for many other reasons, not just because of climate change. At which point, Trump’s bullshit detector must have been bleeping off the scale. Let’s examine those arguments, one by one. First, Mummy’s Boy Macron’s line that “Climate change is real and it affects the poorest countries.”, The first half is trivially true: climate has indeed been changing for the 4.5 billion years of the planet’s existence. But the notion that recent climate change is catastrophic, unprecedented and significantly man-made is a shaky theory, not a proven fact. And in any case it is beside the point. Even supposing that climate change is all those things, it doesn’t alter the fact that Paris is a pointless waste of money, especially for countries like the U.S. which are expected to bear the burden of the cost. As Bjorn Lomborg has calculated, using the alarmists’ own models and data, if every signatory nation sticks to Paris then the effect will be to reduce global warming by 0.17 degrees C by 2100. At a cost in excess of $100 trillion. As for the “affects the poorest countries” part – even if this is true, there are better ways of helping poor countries than bombing the U.S. economy to the dark ages. Like, promoting a flourishing economy which yields more to spend on foreign aid. Next, Canadian Prime Minister Bieber on the Ozone Layer. As Matt Ridley shows in some detail here, the vanishing ‘ozone layer’ is more or less an urban myth trotted out by environmentalists mainly to justify their insatiable advocacy of world-government-style eco-regulation. For reasons I will explain, this news deserves to be taken with a large pinch of salt. You do not have to dig far to find evidence that the ozone hole was never nearly as dangerous as some people said, that it is not necessarily healing yet and that it might not have been caused mainly by CFCs anyway. The timing of the announcement was plainly political: it came on the 25th anniversary of the treaty, and just before a big United Nations climate conference in New York, the aim of which is to push for a climate treaty modelled on the ozone one. See how these memes get repeated, over and over again, as memes are? That piece was from 2014. You can lay money that it won’t be the last time some environmentalist or politician brings it up to “prove” that concerted intergovernmental legislation works because it “healed the ozone layer.”, Finally, the Mutti of all Globalists herself, Mrs Merkel. “Renewable energies, said the chancellor, present significant economic opportunities.” Yes, I suppose they do, if like Elon Musk you’ve got your snout buried deep in the subsidies trough, or like Warren Buffett you like to profit off the tax credits  or like wind and solar developers everywhere you just don’t care about the bats and birds sliced and diced, the countryside spoiled and the people who have their sleep disturbed and their property values trashed. But strip away the subsidies and the green lies and renewables make no economic or environmental sense at all. As for the green Chinese. The green Chinese are laughing at us. As, by the way, are the Indians. And here’s why…, , Now do you see what I mean? President Trump pulled out of Paris for a lot of sensible reasons. But the one that tipped him over the edge was quite simply this: when you’ve got your fellow leaders of the free world insulting you with arguments you know to be bullshit and treating you like you’re some kind of an idiot, well suddenly it all becomes crystal clear what you’ve gotta do…, You call those charlatans’ bluff and remember why it was that people voted you to be President of the U.S.A: because they wanted someone real doing the job, for a change, and not yet another of those charlatans…\n",
      "Jimmy Kimmel is great. Probably the most relaxed, amiable, and funny of all the U.S. talk show hosts, not counting James Corden. But after last night he just lost a fan.[No, I’m sure he doesn’t care about this either. As he made perfectly clear in a segment of his show called “Scientists aren’t ****ing with you”, anyone who disagrees with “the science” on climate change is a complete wing nut – and therefore any criticism he gets from “deniers” like me will be considered a badge of honour. advertisement, Even so, if you’re going to go on TV and use your privileged late night ABC TV slot to tell millions of people about the “science” of climate change, don’t you at least owe it to your fans – especially the kids, like my daughter, who really look up to you – to make sure of your facts first?, Kimmel: “The idea that she [Sarah Palin] knows more than 97 per cent of scientists – it’s dangerous and offensive.”, No, Jimmy. What’s dangerous and offensive is for a prominent, influential celebrity to regurgitate proven lies as if they were facts. That 97 per cent claim has been debunked on numerous occasions. It was based on a skewed poll which involved a great deal of cherry-picking – and tells us nothing meaningful about either the current state of climate science or where scientists now stand on it. Even if it were remotely accurate (which it’s not by the way: it was a stunt cooked up for political reasons by activists), science is not a popularity contest. As Einstein supposedly said in response to a book commissioned by Hitler called ‘100 Authors Against Einstein’: “Why one hundred? If I were wrong, one would have been enough.”, Kimmel: “Climate Change is not a liberal versus conservative thing.”, Actually, Jimmy, it is and we have the stats to prove it. Check out this recent Gallup poll on how many Americans identify as “environmentalist.” In 1991 – 25 years ago – the figure was 78 per cent. Now it has dropped to 42 per cent. But what’s most significant is the way it has now become a partisan issue. That 78 per cent figure from 25 years ago applied to both conservatives and liberals alike – there was no difference between them. But now, in the case of Democrats it has fallen to 56 per cent, but in the case of Republicans to 27 per cent. It wasn’t before but climate change is now very much a left-right issue. Which is a shame. Just as it’s a shame that you had to turn the Jimmy Kimmel Show into a left-right issue. Why couldn’t you have kept politics out of it?, Kimmel: “This isn’t a matter of political opinion. This is a matter of scientific opinion.”, What, exactly, are you saying is a matter of scientific opinion?, That the planet has warmed slightly in the last 150 years or so? Scientists agree on this. That man-made CO2 may have an influence on global warming? Scientists agree on this. But what you’re doing here is the same sneaky trick all environmental propagandists use to advance their agenda: you’re conflating the trivial issues on which scientists do agree with the much more serious ones where they don’t agree and which, anyway, are far too important to be left up to scientists whose narrow specialisms make them ill-equipped to dictate dramatic political and economic policies with impacts far beyond the realm of science. Kimmel: “2014 was the warmest year ever. Until 2015 became the warmest year ever… Since 2001, we’ve had 15 of the 16 hottest years there have ever been. That’s not an opinion. That’s a fact.”, Depends on where you get your ‘facts’. There’s copious evidence that the raw data has been corrupted – “adjusted” – by climate gatekeepers eager to make a political point, with earlier years (like the 1930s – the hottest 20th century decade in the U.S.) being artificially cooled and more recent years being warmed. As for this casual use of the word “ever”: no scientist worth the name believes that. There have been numerous periods in earth’s history when temperatures have been warmer – in the Medieval Warming Period, for example. What you mean by “ever” is “since temperature records began”, which is only a matter of a few hundred years. Kimmel: “97 per cent of climate scientists say the global warming we’re experiencing is very likely due to human activity. That’s NASA.”, Well even if this mythical – see above – 97 per cent are right: so what? Global warming – whether human-caused or otherwise – may very well not be a problem. And even if it is a problem, the dramatic measures these scientists are recommending to deal with it may well be doing more harm than good, so why are we listening to them anyway? As for the recommendation that we go to NASA for our climate science: this is a bit like asking Enron for accounting advice, or Islamic State for women’s sexy beachwear. Kimmel: “Either you believe in science or you don’t. Why believe scientists on molecules and the speed of light and Cialis but not on this?”, Because even when you insert a cheap gag about erection-boosting pharmaceuticals, Jimmy, it doesn’t alter the fact that you are stunningly ignorant about what ‘science’ actually is. It is not a fixed body of knowledge, immune to criticism or scepticism. Still less – that word “believe” is a dead giveaway – is it about religious faith. Science is a continual process of discovery. Kimmel: “This is not what I know. This what scientists know.”, And there’s the problem. For liberals “Science” has become the new God, with “scientists” talked of reverently like priests – as though, somehow, they were guardians of a special knowledge beyond the ken of mortal man. If we think of scientists this way – rather than as guys like the rest of us who want to pay the rent – then we impose on them a burden of expectation that they cannot possibly fulfil. When Matt Damon in The Martian says he’s going to “science the shit out of” his predicament – that’s not reality. That’s a liberal fantasy. Scientists can be pretty good in their specialist fields (though not always see e.g. the Climategate emails) but beyond that are about as useless as the rest of us, if not more so. We certainly shouldn’t entrust to them the economic and political future of the world. That way madness lies. Kimmel: “These scientists are not part of some imaginary conspiracy.”, Actually, Jimmy… they are.\n",

      "The Vatican has invited the most notorious population alarmist in recent history to speak at an upcoming Vatican-run conference titled ‘Biological Extinction.”[The conference, sponsored jointly by the Pontifical Academy of Science and the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, will address issues of biodiversity, “great extinctions” of history, population and demographics. advertisement, Dr. Paul R. Ehrlich—who has defended mass sterilization, sex-selective abortion and infanticide—will speak on “Causes and Pathways of Biodiversity Losses: Consumption Preferences, Population Numbers, Technology, Ecosystem Productivity.”, To allow women to have as many children as they want, Ehrlich has said, is like letting people “throw as much of their garbage into their neighbor’s backyard as they want.”, Ehrlich became famous through the publication of his 1968 doomsday bestseller, The Population Bomb, which generated mass hysteria over the future of the world and the earth’s ability to sustain human life. In the book, Ehrlich launched a series of frightening predictions that turned out to be spectacularly wrong, creating the myth of unsustainable population growth. He prophesied that hundreds of millions would starve to death in the 1970s (and that 65 million of them would be Americans), that already-overpopulated India was doomed, and that odds were fair that “England will not exist in the year 2000.”, Ehrlich concluded that “sometime in the next 15 years, the end will come,” meaning “an utter breakdown of the capacity of the planet to support humanity.”, Mankind stood on the brink of Armageddon, the book proposed, because there was no way to feed the exponentially increasing world population. The opening line set the tone for the whole work: “The battle to feed all of humanity is over.”, Despite Ehrlich’s utter failure to predict humanity’s ability to feed itself, his theories will be dusted off and re-proposed in the Vatican in late February. In its brochure for the upcoming workshop, the Vatican asserts in Ehrlichian doomspeak that “Earth cannot sustain” our desire for “enhanced consumption.”, Humanity is presently using about 156 percent of “the Earth’s sustainable capacity” every year, the text contends, and it is therefore essential to address “the question whether the Earth system is able to support the demands that humanity has been making on it” and “how global inequality and poverty relate to that.”, The conference will also feature a speaker from an environmental advocacy group called the Global Footprint Network (GFN), which each year calculates the day when the year’s available resources supposedly run out and mankind begins overconsuming nature. “We use more ecological resources and services than nature can regenerate through overfishing, overharvesting forests and emitting more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than forests can sequester,” the group exclaims on its website. “On August 8, 2016, we will have used as much from nature as our planet can renew in the whole year,” GFN announced last summer. In their brochure, the Pontifical Academies make the counterintuitive claim that biodiversity means “everything” for the human race, but then proceed to acknowledge that only 103 species of plants out of an estimated 425,000 species produce about 90 percent of our food worldwide. Moreover, just three kinds of grain, maize, rice, and wheat, produce about 60 percent of the total, the text notes. Since none of these species are under any danger of extinction, one wonders how biodiversity can mean “everything” for humanity. Just why the Vatican would wish to showcase the purveyor of debunked, apocalyptic theories is anybody’s guess, but it certainly cannot bode well for the relationship between faith and science.

      "Jerry Seinfeld, Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Jordan, and Leonardo DiCaprio are among the many celebrities who have issued an emotional farewell video for President Barack Obama.[“Yes We Can: Your Most Memorable Moments from the Obama Presidency” features American entertainers and people from around the world sharing stories of their most meaningful moments of Obama’s presidency and celebrating his legislative achievements, from healthcare to climate change to Cuba. advertisement, Actor Samuel L. Jackson named the passage of the Affordable Care Act as the most memorable moment of Obama’s presidency: “Because I have relatives that can’t afford health insurance, so it was really a great thing to know that if something happened to them, they could get cared for.”, , “When I was at the UN and I heard our president say that climate change is the most important issue facing, not only this generation but also future generations, it was inspiring,” said Academy Award-winning actor and environmental activist Leonardo DiCaprio. Actor Tom Hanks added: “When he just changed all the rules on the table in regards to Cuba with the most succinct motivation imaginable, which is ‘What we’ve been doing hasn’t worked’ — which made all the sense in the world.”, Comedian Jerry Seinfeld said knocking on the Oval Office window while Obama was working was “probably the peak of my entire existence.”, Offering more emotional memories, ABC super-producer Shonda Rhimes recalled Obama’s 2008 campaign victory speech in Grant Park in Illinois. “Just the magic of that moment of that man, who we’ve all been on this journey with, take that stage with his family. I was sitting at home in my living room and I felt like I was a part of that crowd in that park,” Rhimes said. Scandal star Kerry Washington shared a simular sentiment. “You really felt those first three words of the Constitution, ‘We the People.’ It was one of the first times in my life that I felt like I was really part of that ‘We,'” Washington said. Chicago-based artist Chance the Rapper praised the President for granting clemency to those convicted of drug crimes, while Ellen DeGeneres praised Obama’s dance skills. Basketball legend Michael Jordan said Obama’s legacy will never be forgotten. “How often do we remember Jackie Robinson — everybody knows him,” Jordan said. “To me, he will be the Jackie Robinson of politics.”, The “Yes We Can” tribute video was posted to the White House YouTube channel one day before President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama hosted a star-studded farewell party at the White House.  , Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson\n",
      "The FrackNation page temporarily suspended by Facebook is back up and running.[This means that — thanks to the Streisand Effect — the anti-fracking activists who put pressure on Facebook to close it down have shot themselves in their sandalled feet. Suddenly the whole world knows about the Dimock water trial — and what a huge setback it has been for the cause of anti-capitalist, enviro-Nazi lunacy. advertisement, Indeed, it’s possible that this once obscure trial may yet come to be recognised as the case that cost Hillary Clinton the presidential election. To understand why you first need to appreciate what a hot-button issue fracking is with the liberal base. Bernie Sanders is flat against it. So — she suddenly decided at Flint, Michigan at the weekend — is Hillary. Hillary Clinton, though, needed more time to outline three conditions in a more nuanced answer on fracking. She’s against it “when any locality or any state is against it,” “when the release of methane or contamination of water is present,” and “unless we can require that anybody who fracks has to tell us exactly what chemicals they are using.”, Until those conditions are met, “we’ve got to regulate everything that is currently underway, and we have to have a system in place that prevents further fracking.”, While this tough anti-fracking line might have played well with liberal activists, it’s unlikely to win widespread popular support when Clinton goes to the country. First, it is increasingly obvious to anyone with half a brain that fracking has been good for the US. It has taken petroleum production to its highest level since 1972 and not just reduced America’s dependence on Middle-Eastern Islamo-petro-tyrannies but actually turned her into a net exporter of crude oil and natural gas. Also — despite the best efforts of President Obama, who in 2009 said he wanted electricity rates to “skyrocket” — it has provided the US with perhaps the most important of all ingredients for industrial growth and raised standards of living: cheap, abundant energy. Secondly, it is also increasingly obvious that the claims made against fracking by activists like Josh Fox (of Gasland and Gasland 2 infamy), Mark Ruffalo and Yoko Ono just don’t stand up. Especially they won’t after this Dimock water trial which filmmaker Phelim McAleer has been covering on Facebook. No one likes being lied to by a politician, even when in Hillary Clinton’s case the practise is so frequent it more or less coincides with every single moment her lips move. If Hillary Clinton is going to campaign to close down America’s fracking industry on the basis of propagandistic nonsense from Josh Fox movies — faucets spouting methane (which has nothing to do with fracking), water whose contamination turns out to exist entirely in the greedy imaginations of vexatious litigants trying to make easy money out of a blameless oil and gas company — then it’s unlikely to impress fair-minded voters. Especially not voters in blue-collar states which have tried fracking and come to enjoy its benefits. Hence Grover Norquist’s suggestion earlier this week that Hillary’s attack on the fracking industry may be her undoing. “Under her new rules, fracking would exist almost nowhere,” the president and founder of Americans for Tax Reform told CNBC’s ” Squawk on the Street .” “Democrats used to be able to insult the energy industry because they lived in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Alaska [and] they don’t vote Democrat. But she declared war on Pennsylvania and Ohio with that statement. That’s not the way to win the election.”, Maybe Hillary should check out that FrackNation Facebook page and keep herself abreast of the collapse in the anti-frackers’ case. It probably won’t put her off her cunning plan to wipe out the US economy by promoting expensive, inefficient “clean” energy at the expense of cheap, abundant fossil fuels. But at least it might stop her sounding slightly less out of date and ill-informed next time she mouths off about “release of methane” and “contamination of water.”,  \n",

I have stood up and I have represented my constituents to the best of my abilities, and I’m very proud of that. So I think it’s time to end the artful smear that you and your campaign have been carrying out in recent weeks and let’s talk about the issues that divide us.”, As the audience  booed over the candidates cross talk Sander said, “Let’s talk about issues. Let’s talk about issues. Let’s talk about why in the 1990s Wall Street got deregulated. Did it have anything to do with the fact that Wall Street provided — spent billions of dollars on lobbying and campaign contributions? Well, some people might think that had some influence. Let’s ask why it is that we pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs and your medicine can with doubled tomorrow and there’s nothing the government can do to stop it. You think it has anything to do with the huge amount of campaign contributions and lobbying for the fossil fuel industry. Let’s talk about climate change. Do you think there’s a reason why not one Republican has the guts to recognize that climate change is real, and we need to transform our energy system? Do you think it has anything to do with the Koch brothers and Exxon mobile pouring huge amounts of money into the political system?

      "The ongoing controversy involving the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation’s alleged ties to an international embezzlement scandal has intensified after the Bruno Manser Fund, a Swiss-based foundation, challenged the troubled charity to return questionable donations.[Earlier this month, DiCaprio’s environmental-focused charitable organization was the subject of news reports linking it to a $3 billion Malaysian embezzlement scheme. The Oscar winner’s foundation, which focuses on climate change initiatives, allegedly received major donations tied to money misappropriated from Malaysian sovereign wealth fund 1MDB that had been earmarked for development in the Southeast Asian country. advertisement, Now, The Bruno Manser Funds, an environmental organization that focuses on Malaysian rainforest protection, is demanding the actor’s charity return what it claims is tainted money. “We were appalled to see that a foundation that basically champions very similar causes to ours would accept corrupt funds,” Bruno Manser Funds’ executive director Lukas Straumann told The Hollywood Reporter. “It’s double standards. It really damages his credibility and the credibility of the foundation. If he wants to be a role model, a U.N. ambassador for peace and for climate change, then he should also be an example in how he handles his role.”, A Justice Department complaint claims that Red Granite Pictures — the production company co-founded by the Prime Minister of Malaysia’s stepson, Riza Aziz — used $238 million of 1MDB money to produce The Wolf of Wall Street, for which DiCaprio won a Golden Globe. Straumann is also demanding that the actor return the estimated $25 million he was paid to star in 2013 Martin Scorsese-directed movie. “Money was stolen from the treasury and went straight into Leo’s pocket,” Straumann said. “That is dirty money, and he should pay it back.”, To date, no evidence has emerged linking DiCaprio or his charity to funds from 1MDB. Straumann, attempting to explain how a so-called environmentalist like DiCaprio justifies his alleged role in the 1MDB scandal, suggested the star has a “bipolar personality.”, “We hear he has a genuine commitment to nature and championing indigenous rights, and I think it’s extremely important for someone in Hollywood to do that, but if it comes to accepting stolen money, that’s a simple no go,” Straumann said. “Maybe he has a bipolar personality.”,  , Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudson\n",
      "For one of his last acts in 2015, Barack Obama signed a bill that bans what advocates say is an environmentally harmful ingredient included in many personal cleansing products and cosmetics.[The ingredient is so common that nearly every American has it in products in their homes. advertisement, Congress passed the Microbead-Free Waters Act of 2015, a bipartisan bill that President Obama signed it into law on December 28. The law puts a ban on an ingredient used in the cosmetics and personal care products industry called “microbeads.” These beads are contained in many bodywashes, toothpastes and soaps and supposedly serve as skin exfoliants. But there is a problem with these little devices. Activists say they never breakdown as they wash down the drain and the devices end up polluting our waterways. Scientists say the tiny beads, usually of less than 5 microns in size, flow through our sewer systems but are so small that they aren’t screened out and collected before being dumped into our water ways. Once in our lakes, streams and rivers, scientists say these microbeads get eaten by fish and animals. But since the beads cannot be digested it often ends up killing them. “In New York state alone, 19 tons of microbeads are washed down the drain each year,” Business Insider recently reported. “Microbeads are highly damaging to the natural environment and the wildlife that live there,” a press release from the Wildlife Conservation Society says. “Because natural alternatives already exist, a ban on their use in personal care products makes perfect sense.”, According to CNN, “a study published in Environmental Science &amp Technology reported that more than 8 trillion microbeads were entering the country’s aquatic habitats daily. The volume was enough to coat the surface of 300 tennis courts every day.”, Another recent study claimed that there are 1.7 million microbeads per square kilometer at the bottom of Lake Erie. Consumers can find out which products likely use the tiny devices by visiting the International Campaign Against Microbeads in Cosmetics website to check out their list of products that likely contain microbeads.

      "MOST POPULAR[Friday, on MSNBC, while discussing a sniper targeting Dallas police officers in an attack that killed five and wounding seven, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said the “very divisive and hateful rhetoric,” in the presidential campaign has helped to create an environment that allowed the murders to happen. advertisement, Partial Transcript as Follows:, LESTER HOLT: Madam Secretary, it seems we have been stuck on this conversation about race in this country in a perpetual loop, and we’re not getting very far. Some would argue, we’ve slipped backwards.             President Obama has spent eight years on this, and hasn’t been able to move the needle. How will you move the needle on race relations? Is there a moonshot type strategy?, HILLARY CLINTON: Well, Lester, I think everyone understands that we have some very deep divides in our country, and if we don’t start addressing them, — and that’s a matter of urgency, and it’s not just for some people to do it, but it’s for all of us to do it. Then, I believe that we will find ourselves in an even worse downward spiral. So, here’s what I believe, I believe we need a national conversation, and we start showing respect toward one another, seeing each other, walking in each other’s shoes. I think we have to show our support for our police, under very difficult circumstances, particularly, as we have seen in the last day, the bravery of police officers running toward danger, and being shot down. At the same time, we’ve got to do criminal justice reform, and we need national guidelines about the use of force, particularly lethal force, so, routine traffic stops don’t escalate into killings. We also have to be honest, all of us, in facing implicit bias, that all of us, unfortunately, I think, may still have. HOLT: Let me talk about the climate in this country, in this campaign specifically. It’s been very heated. Mayor Rawlings, here in Dallas, talked about asking people to stop fighting each other in this country, from the pulpit, from the political spectrum, to choose words carefully. Do you think the environment, the heated campaign, the rhetoric, has at all contributed to the climate that allowed this to happen?, CLINTON: I think the mayor is right, Lester. I think that something has been unleashed in our nation where people are saying cruel and hateful things about one another, from all kinds of vantage points. In many ways, the Internet has turned into a terrible example of how people anonymously say the worst possible things about their neighbor down the street, the girl in school, or political officials. Yes. We are, unfortunately, in the grip of some very divisive and hateful rhetoric. And I think that that’s a broadly shared view. HOLT: Will you change your campaign tone at all?, CLINTON: Well, I think our tone has been very careful. You know, we have gone to criticize people for what they have done. We’ve tried to stay away from name-calling. But I will certainly take a hard look about what more we can do, because what I’m interested in is bringing our country together, not deepening the divides. And I want white people to understand how African-Americans feel every day. The anxiety and fear, particularly sending off their children, particularly young men, not knowing what’s going to happen to them. I want people to put themselves in the shoes of police officers and their families, who get up every day, and go off and do a very dangerous job. We need to start looking at each other as fellow Americans, and we need to be listening and working together to try to stem the violence, the hatred, the divisive rhetoric. And, yes, I’m going to do my best to try to bring that about in my campaign, and then in the White House, working on specific ways to try to create, you know, more understanding between us.\n",

      "The Conservative Party manifesto, ‘Forward, Together’ unveiled Thursday represents a clear pitch to the centre-left of British politics, with its emphasis on a strong government shepherding the country forward.[Peppered with sentences such as: “We know that our responsibility to one another is greater than the rights we hold as individuals,” (page 9), the manifesto is sure to raise eyebrows amongst ardent Thatcherites. advertisement, But as well as being a clear and decisive departure from Lady Thatcher’s legacy, the manifesto is also a barometer of how the Tories intend to manage Brexit. Here, we run through the pledges most likely to worry Brexiteers. 1. That ECHR pledge, As home secretary, Theresa May made much of her opposition to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) having seen how it hampered her ability to extradite extremists. In April 2016, just months before the Brexit referendum, she even went so far as to say: “The ECHR can bind the hands of parliament, adds nothing to our prosperity, makes us less secure by preventing the deportation of dangerous foreign nationals – and does nothing to change the attitudes of governments like Russia’s when it comes to human rights. “So regardless of the EU referendum, my view is this: if we want to reform human rights laws in this country, it isn’t the EU we should leave but the ECHR and the jurisdiction of its court.”, That position has been entirely reversed in the manifesto, which promises not to bring the European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights into UK law, but adds: “We will not repeal or replace the Human Rights Act while the process of Brexit is underway.”, And, of course, it adds: “We will remain signatories to the European Convention on Human Rights for the duration of the next parliament.” (Page 37), 2. Immigration, The manifesto states the current annual net migration rate of 273,000 “is still too high”, and pledges to reduce immigration both from without the EU and within – “while still allowing us to attract the skilled workers our economy needs”. (page 55). In February, Brexit minister David Davis admitted, however, there was little Government appetite to reduce low-skilled immigration. “In the hospitality sector, hotels and restaurants, in the social care sector, working in agriculture, it will take time [to set limits] – it will be years and years before we get British citizens to do those jobs,” he said. 3. Picking winners, One of the major objections to the EU’s interference in the commerce is its tendency to pick winners, propping up fashionable yet unsustainable industries such as green energy. If British voters thought that would come to an end outside the EU, they will be sorely disappointed. “Our modern industrial strategy […] is not about picking winners, propping up failing industries, or bringing back old companies from the dead. It is about identifying the industries that are of strategic value to our economy and supporting and promoting them through policies on trade, tax, infrastructure, skills, training, and research and development,” the manifesto states. (page 19), In other words, it’s not about picking winners, it’s about… picking winners. “So we have launched a new £23 billion National Productivity Investment Fund. The government will target this spending at areas that are critical for productivity.” (page 20), 4. Government funded research and development. One of the key cries from Remainers during the referendum was “what will we do without EU spending on research and development?”, Well don’t worry – the Conservatives plan to step in and fill the breach. “We will spend more on research and development, to turn brilliant discoveries into practical products and transform the world’s industries – such as the batteries that will power a new generation of clean, efficient, electric vehicles.” (page 19), “Our ambition is for Britain to lead the world in electric vehicle technology and use. We want almost every car and van to be zero-emission by 2050 – and will invest £600 million by 2020 to help achieve it. We will invest in more low-emission buses, as well as supporting audio-visual displays for bus passengers and community minibuses for rural areas poorly served by public transport.” (page 24), 5. Environ-mentalists, Speaking of electric vehicles, a central plank of EU ideology is environmentalism, particularly the sort that likes to tackle climate change through high taxes. Good news for Remainers – the Conservatives are fully signed up on that front too:, “The United Kingdom will lead the world in environmental protection. As Conservatives, we are committed to leaving the environment in better condition than we inherited it. That is why we will continue to take a lead in global action against climate change, as the government demonstrated by ratifying the Paris Agreement. We were the first country to introduce a Climate Change Act, which Conservatives helped to frame, and we are halfway towards meeting our 2050 goal of reducing emissions by eighty per cent from 1990 levels. “We will champion greater conservation co-operation within international bodies, protecting rare species, the polar regions and international waters. We will work with our Overseas Territory governments to create a Blue Belt of marine protection in their precious waters, establishing the largest marine sanctuaries anywhere in the world.” (page 40), 6. Progressive politics in the workplace…, In 2015, the Conservative Government under David Cameron fought off a Commission proposal to force FTSE companies to make 40 per cent of their boards female. But the Conservatives propose to carry forward the EU tradition of meddling in the workplace, adopting EU workers’ rights legislation wholesale, and setting quotas on pay. “We believe people should be rewarded for their talents and efforts but the public is rightly affronted by the remuneration of some corporate leaders. “The next Conservative government will legislate to make executive pay packages subject to strict annual votes by shareholders and listed companies will have to publish the ratio of executive pay to broader UK workforce pay. Companies will have to explain their pay policies, particularly complex incentive schemes, better.” (page 18), 7. …and beyond. “We will push forward with our plan for tackling hate crime committed on the basis of religion, disability, sexual orientation or transgender identity.” (page 40)\n",

It’s bloody annoying when you’re a seasoned hack breaking stories like Climategate showing alarmists to be a bunch of lying charlatans and you’ve got some dogged progressive fresh out of ‘uni’ in the neighbouring pages, brandishing his science degree like it automatically trumps your Oxford arts degree, explaining patiently, goodnaturedly, passively aggressively that there’s this thing called the “science” and that what the “science” shows is that global warming is real, regardless of what some batshit crazy conspiracy theorist from the bad old days when the Telegraph was conservative might say. advertisement, So I thought I’d goad Tom, partly for the pure mischievous hell of it but partly because I’m genuinely interested in seeing what coping strategies professional climate alarmists are going to adopt as their bankrupt theory crashes about their ears. Are they going to make a clean breast of things – admit they got the whole man-made-global-warming thing wrong and hope that we sceptics don’t shoot all our prisoners? Or are they going to go down with the sinking ship?, Well, this morning I had my answer from Mark Lynas. @blancmarc20 @JamesDelingpole Don’t worry – I like being trolled by climate deniers! Burnishes my green credentials, tarnished by GMO work. — Mark Lynas (@mark_lynas) February 29, 2016, , Interesting. Such, even now, is his contempt for what he calls “climate deniers” that he feels under no obligation to defend himself against the perfectly valid criticism that he called “the Pause” completely wrong, misled his readers and traduced an honest journalist. He calls fair comment “trolling.” Clearly, he will  remain loyal to the Emperor on that remote Pacific island many decades after Hiroshima has been nuked. But then, as alarmists go, Lynas is pretty out there: you need to be quite committed to do what Lynas once did to Bjorn Lomborg and assault someone with a custard pie at a book signing. Surely, I thought to myself, there might be at least a little repositioning from the less dogmatic or at least more diplomatic Chivers. So I asked him whether he’d ever doubted the Pause and whether he’d since changed his position on it. Here was his response:, , I think we can draw some helpful conclusions from this, don’t you? Let’s assume, for a moment, that Tom Chivers is fairly representative of where moderate progressive types are on the climate change debate. Here is what his response suggests to me. I am currently reading Mary Renault’s novels about one of my early role models, Alexander The Great. Before capturing another enemy city, Alexander would offer them an ultimatum. If they surrendered gracefully, he would show mercy and magnanimity. But if they were foolish enough to carry on the futile fight then he would slaughter them without mercy. My view is that if you have lost the argument you should show your victor respect rather than mock him and scorn him with your ugly little cheap shots and wholly unmerited arrogance. I’m sorry, Tom Chivers, that you don’t get this.\n",
      "On Friday, California Governor Jerry Brown sought federal help from President Trump by asking the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to declare “a major disaster” in California in light of the damage done by recent storms.[The East Bay Times reports: “Brown formally requested the declaration for the series of storms striking the state between Jan. 3 and Jan. 12.” He noted that “heavy rains, winds and snow, particularly in Northern California, left eight people dead and knocked out power to an estimated 1 million Californian homes and businesses.”, advertisement, Brown’s request comes as Gov. Brown has challenged the Trump administration on climate change, immigration, Obamacare, and other issues. Other Democrat officials in California have been open about their refusal to comply with Trump administration orders regarding illegal immigration. San Francisco’s police chief, sheriff, and mayor all made clear they would not enforce Trump’s immigration order, long before the order was taken to court. The San Francisco Police Department went so far as to cut ties with an FBI counter-terrorism task force in order to prevent officers from being involved in action that targeted illegals. And California’s highest law enforcement agent, Attorney General Xavier Becerra, has been very open about his determination to fight Trump’s policies as part of the larger effort to retain sanctuary policies that harbor illegal aliens in the state. But Gov. Brown would like some federal funds to help out in the short term, so he is asking the Trump administration for help. Notably, Gov. Brown also used his “State of the State” address earlier this year to welcome Trump’s commitment to infrastructure spending.

      "The number of companies announcing a ramping up of investment in the U.S. and the corresponding rush to create jobs for Americans, have jumped to a quicker pace since the election of Donald J. Trump to the White House.[A look at announcements from various large companies shows that the private sector is becoming excited by the idea of a Trump presidency. advertisement, Carrier Air Conditioner Manufacturing: 1,000 Jobs, First out of the block came the Carrier air conditioner manufacturing company. Late in November, Carrier announced it had reached an agreement with the President-elect to keep up to 1,000 jobs in Indiana, pulling back on plans to ship all manufacturing jobs to Mexico. SoftBank Telecommunications: 50,000 Jobs, On the heels of the Carrier announcement, Trump met with SoftBank Group Corp. founder and Chief Executive Officer Masayoshi Son at Tump Tower in New York City. As a result of the meeting, Trump announced that the Sprint cell network owner was pledging to invest $50 billion in the U.S. and planned to create as many as 50,000 new jobs. U.S. Steel: 10,000 Jobs, Next, during a December 7 broadcast of CNBC’s Power Lunch, the CEO of U.S. Steel Mario Longhi said that after the election of Donald Trump, he has “felt an environment of positive optimism where forces are converging to provide for a better environment,” which he hopes means he can rehire up to 10,000 employees who had been laid off. IBM: 25,000 Jobs, A week after U.S. Steel noted its bullish outlook on the U.S. economy, computing giant IBM also found its outlook had brightened and reported that it expects to create up to 25,000 new jobs in the U.S. Small Businesses Suddenly Optimistic, Added to the companies listed above is the positive feeling for the immediate future expressed by the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), which recently said the small business climate has already improved since the November 8 election. “What a difference a day makes,” said Juanita Duggan, president and CEO of NFIB. “Before Election Day small business owners’ optimism was flat, and after Election Day it soared.”, The NFIB pinned its hope for the continued optimism by small business owners on a Trump presidency.

      "Resident Evil 7, one of the first triple-A titles to support VR, is a major success for the platform.[At the time of this writing, more than 84,000 people have walked the dark and rotting hallways of Resident Evil 7’s haunted estate in virtual reality, around 10% of the active player base. The numbers continue to climb just three days ago, that number was 62,000. advertisement, The total player numbers include both Xbox and PC players — there isn’t a separate tally of players for the PS4 edition. Resident Evil 7 only supports the PSVR headset, which means only people who have opted for Sony’s budget-priced gear even have the option to use the feature at all. It indicates Sony’s cost-efficient approach to VR has been successful at an absolute minimum, 84,000 people have bought and are actively using their device. Needless to say, that makes Resident Evil 7 a major VR success story. Despite prohibitive pricing and limited options, this is a good indicator that even this first generation of VR hardware not only works, but has a growing potential in the market. The official Breitbart Tech review of Resident Evil 7 is on the way, wherein I’ll tell you just how much I enjoyed the experience of the game itself. One thing I will say: if the experience in VR manages to genuinely amplify the atmosphere already dripping from this game, it’s bound to be a harrowing experience.

      "Serial Nobel Peace Prize hoaxer Michael Mann is maintaining his fake claim to have won the prestigious award in a new HBO documentary — four years after he was exposed for lying to a Washington, D.C. court.[The Penn State professor and leading global warming activist is featured prominently in a new Josh Fox directed HBO documentary How to Let Go of the World and Love All the Things Climate Can’t Change, where he is clearly and dramatically described as a co-winner of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize. advertisement, However, Mann has had to withdraw this inaccurate claim on numerous occasions since 2007 — most dramatically, in 2012, he was forced to admit that a sworn affidavit he submitted to a D.C. court contained the lie about being a Nobel Peace Prize winner. Four years later, the claim is again repeated in the HBO documentary which has just had a theatrical release in New York. The fake prize claim is given particular prominence because in a break with documentary convention the caption has its own stand-alone card. Normally in documentaries, a descriptive caption appears in the lower corner of a screen whilst the subject is talking. However, Mann’s caption in the How to Let Go documentary is a stand-alone card with large, dramatic, white writing against a black background and which describes him as a CO-WINNER 2007 NOBEL PEACE PRIZE. We have reached out to HBO and Michael Mann for comment. It’s possible this was an HBO error however, standard procedure for captions in documentaries is that the interviewee submits the information to the production team.. This is particularly true for academics who may be professors or visiting professors at a number of institutions, and may have won numerous prizes in their career. The academics would know which prize or position is more prestigious or relevant and would generally be allowed and trusted to write their own caption. Mann’s repeated exaggeration of his qualifications is significant: He stands accused of exaggerating and manipulating data in his academic work. Mann was the author of the famous “hockey stick” graph which purported to show that world temperatures had been stable and flat until a violent upswing caused by industrialization. The”hockey stick” was taken to be proof that man has influenced climate, and global warming is real. However, the “hockey stick” has since been criticized by other scientists amid allegations that Mann manipulated data and used unscientific methods to bolster his claim. These claims prompted Mann’s 2012 legal complaint against the Washington-based think-tank, the Competitive Enterprise Institute and author Mark Steyn. In a sworn affidavit, Mann described himself as a Nobel Prize Winner, and said the fact that he was the recipient of such a prestigious prize compounded the libel. “It is one thing to engage in discussion about debatable topics. It is quite another to attempt to discredit consistently validated scientific research through the professional and personal defamation of a Nobel prize recipient,” the affidavit stated. However, the Nobel Prize committee said that Mann was not a winner of the prize, and that working part-time for the IPCC which won the prize does not entitle people to claim they are a winner. In a statement to National Review, a committee spokesperson stated emphatically: “Mann has never won the Nobel Prize.”, Mann was forced to resubmit his sworn statement removing the Peace Prize claim, and he had to scrub the claim from numerous university and professional websites. The re-occurance of his fake claim to be a Nobel laureate is likely to weaken his legal case against the CEI and Steyn given that they are basing their defense on allegations that he has fabricated scientific findings and statistics. HBO, Michael Mann and Josh Fox did not respond to requests for a comment. \n",
      "Fewer than 1 percent of papers published in scientific journals follow the scientific method, according to research by Wharton School professor and forecasting expert J. Scott Armstrong.[Professor Armstrong, who co-founded the peer-reviewed Journal of Forecasting in 1982 and the International Journal of Forecasting in 1985, made the claim in a presentation about what he considers to be “alarmism” from forecasters over man-made climate change. advertisement, “We also go through journals and rate how well they conform to the scientific method. I used to think that maybe 10 percent of papers in my field … were maybe useful. Now it looks like maybe, one tenth of one percent follow the scientific method” said Armstrong in his presentation, which can be watched in full below. “People just don’t do it.”, , Armstrong defined eight criteria for compliance with the scientific method, including full disclosure of methods, data, and other reliable information, conclusions that are consistent with the evidence, valid and simple methods, and valid and reliable data. , According to Armstrong, very little of the forecasting in climate change debate adheres to these criteria. “For example, for disclosure, we were working on polar bear [population] forecasts, and we were asked to review the government’s polar bear forecast. We asked, ‘could you send us the data’ and they said ‘No’… So we had to do it without knowing what the data were.”, According to Armstrong, forecasts from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) violate all eight criteria. “Why is this all happening? Nobody asks them!” said Armstrong, who says that people who submit papers to journals are not required to follow the scientific method. “You send something to a journal and they don’t tell you what you have to do. They don’t say ‘here’s what science is, here’s how to do it.'”, , Digging deeper into their motivations, Armstrong pointed to the wealth of incentives for publishing papers with politically convenient rather than scientific conclusions. “They’re rewarded for doing non-scientific research. One of my favourite examples is testing statistical significance – that’s invalid. It’s been over 100 years we’ve been fighting the fight against that. Even its inventor thought it wasn’t going to amount to anything. You can be rewarded then, for following an invalid [method].”, “They cheat. If you don’t get statistically significant results, then you throw out variables, add variables, [and] eventually you get what you want.”, “My big thing is advocacy. People are asked to come up with certain answers, and in our whole field that’s been a general movement ever since I’ve been here, and it just gets worse every year. And the reason is funded research.”, “I’ve [gone through] my whole career, with lots of publications, and I’ve never gotten a research grant. And I’m proud of that now.”, Armstrong concluded his talk by arguing that scientific evidence should be required for all climate regulations.

      "Despite the complete financial failure of the boycott against the state, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) is once again warning the State of North Carolina that if it doesn’t repeal its year-old bathroom law, the league will cancel all tournament games. And this time the NCAA says it will boycott the Tar Heel State until the year 2022.[In a statement released this week, the NCAA renewed its warning against North Carolina’s HB2 bathroom law that maintains that people only use bathrooms in government-operated facilities that correspond to their birth gender. advertisement, Because of the bill, which was signed into law early in 2016, the NCAA announced a boycott of the state for the 2016/2017 season. With the end of that season and looking forward, the NCAA has now reaffirmed its boycott. The league released an updated statement on March 23:, Last year, the NCAA Board of Governors relocated NCAA championships scheduled in North Carolina because of the cumulative impact HB2 had on local communities’ ability to assure a safe, healthy, discrimination free atmosphere for all those watching and participating in our events. Absent any change in the law, our position remains the same regarding hosting current or future events in the state. As the state knows, next week our various sports committees will begin making championships site selections for 2018-2022 based upon bids received from across the country. Once the sites are selected by the committee, those decisions are final and an announcement of all sites will be made on April 18. The renewed threat from the college sports association comes on the heels of news that the various attempts to boycott North Carolina have turned out to be a massive failure that has had little financial impact on the state’s economy. The economic statistics for 2016 are in, and it appears that hotel revenue for the Tar Heel State saw no major dip. Indeed, “the state’s economy didn’t miss a beat,” according to the Washington Times. Also, as 2016 ended with various boycotts by sports leagues and liberal groups in the offing, North Carolina ended up coming in fourth in the nation for attracting and expanding businesses. It was the exact same result seen in 2015, so the boycott clearly had no impact on the business climate. North Carolina’s unemployment rate also saw no increases, proving that businesses were not firing employees in droves because of any boycott. Finally, North Carolina’s Lieutenant Governor, Dan Forest, recently noted that if it had any impact at all, the boycott only affected the economy at “one-tenth of 1 percent of our annual GDP.”, Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.\n",

      "California Gov. Jerry Brown cited the disaster relief and infrastructure needs of his state as he told reporters on Monday in Washington, D.C. that there are areas where he is seeking to work with the Trump Administration.[“I find complexity and contradiction very congenial to my bent of mind,” Brown said, in response to questions of whether he felt “conflicted and torn” under pressures to oppose or cooperate with the Trump administration. advertisement, Brown met with Federal Emergency Management (FEMA) Agency acting Administrator Bob Fenton on Monday, according to the Sacramento Bee which posted video of Brown’s comments to reporters. Brown has estimated storm damage at over $500 million dollars. On Sunday Brown, sought a fourth federal disaster declaration from President Donald Trump according to KTLA.

While Brown expressed a positive response to Trump’s words, he did not relent in his criticism of the administration’s choice to review greenhouse gas standards, according to the report. California is still dealing with the damaged Oroville Dam spillway. Storms have brought welcome water to the drought-stricken state, while at the same time further stressing critical infrastructure. Brown has continued to slam GOP and Trump administration aims, including the repeal and replacement of Obamacare.

Asked again about pressure to be the “voice of the resistance,” Brown replied, “I will pursue my own rhetorical paths.”, He continued:, I will do so in the spirit of advancing the interest of California and recognizing that we’re a part of the union and there’s a lot to be, that we’re not going our totally separate way. we are distinct. we have a sovereignty. we will pursue that. but we also have a commonality with other states and with the national government…, Brown said he is seeking to “find common ground” and that he “wouldn’t rule anything out or anything in.”, Brown faces the heavy needs of his state as well as the left’s strong calls to “resist” the Trump administration.

      "MOST POPULAR[Everything wrong with Jeb Bush can be summed up in his approach to border security and American sovereignty. As we all now know, the former Florida governor considers illegal immigration an “act of love” on the part of the illegal immigrant sneaking into America illegally. Wednesday morning on “Morning Joe,” after barely getting out of New Hampshire alive, Bush repeatedly described frontrunner Donald Trump’s proposed temporary ban on foreign Muslims as “horrific.”, advertisement, You don’t have to agree with the idea of Trump’s temporary ban to see the benefits of such a thing, or why two-thirds of Republican voters in a moderate state like New Hampshire would agree with it. To describe such a thing as “horrific” is not just hyperbole on Bush’s part, it is pandering to the DC Media. The worst terror attack on domestic soil hit us just a few months ago in San Bernardino, California, and one of the two jihadists snuck into our country using a fiancée visa. She was not properly vetted by the federal government. ISIS is promising to seed Syrian refugees with their fighters, and did so successfully in last year’s  tragically effective Paris terror attack. We’ve been told by no less than the F.B.I. that our government cannot properly vet refugees from war-torn areas like Syria, a country from which Obama is importing tens of thousands of Muslim refugees. We’ve also been told that there are ISIS investigations in all 50 states. We don’t know how many of those being investigated are refugees or immigrants, but it’s safe guess too many are. As far as Jeb’s condescending, sanctimonious “act of love” nonsense, he sounds no different than Obama or Hillary someone pandering to identity politics, to lawbreakers who cost law-abiding taxpayers a $100 billion per year, and the jobs of working class citizens and legal immigrants who do play the rules. Jeb sounds proud of the fact that he is not on the side of Americans. Rather than protect and look out for Americans, he’s making foreigners a priority. He also sounds like a rape denier. Meanwhile, Donald Trump  not only promises to back his fellow citizens, when it comes to illegal immigration and a temporary Muslim ban, he proves he’s willing to withstand all kinds of media hell to keep that promise. Jeb might actually believe this un-American garbage. Or he might be a puppet of the mega-corporations who save gajillions exploiting illegals at the expense of Americans and legal immigrants. Either way, his priorities are a suicide pact for America and the Republican Party.  , Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC                ,  \n",

Obama argued that Republicans knew better than to allow such theories to continue, but they were silent because it would help them stay in power. “They just stood by and said nothing, even though they knew better, while their base actually started believing some of this stuff,” Obama said. Trump, Obama suggested, only took advantage of the current political climate to win the Republican primary. “Donald Trump didn’t start all this. Like he usually does, he just slapped his name on it, took credit for it, and promoted the heck out of it,” Obama said. The president has spent a great deal of his time in office complaining about conservative media, particularly Fox News and talk radio hosts like Rush Limbaugh. Earlier this month, Obama floated the idea for “truthiness tests” for media outlets on the internet. “There has to be, I think, some sort of way in which we can sort through information that passes some basic truthiness tests and those that we have to discard because they just don’t have any basis in anything that’s actually happening in the world,” he said.\n",

      "TEL AVIV – With people killing in the name of Allah, Islam is the problem, Mosab Yousef, a former spy for Israel and the son of one of Hamas’ founders said on Sunday, adding that President Barack Obama’s failure to call out Islam for what it is only creates more terrorism.[Speaking at the Jerusalem Post’s annual conference in New York, Yosef, who is also known by the code name the Green Prince used by his Shin Bet security agency handlers, expounded on his respect and admiration for the Jewish people. advertisement, “The Jewish nation is dear to me and when I see nations fighting against the Jewish people it hurts me,” he said. The son of West Bank Hamas leader Sheikh Hassan Yousef, Mosab Yousef became an informant in 1997 and spent the next decade helping the Shin Bet foil terror attacks. During the height of the Second Intifada, Yousef was the agency’s most valuable asset. Yousef notes that at one stage he was on the payrolls of Israel, the U.S. the Palestinian Authority, and Hamas all at the same time. Yousef told the audience that he was raised to believe that Jews are the enemies of all humanity. He, too, bought into that worldview “until I came to experience what the Jewish nation really is … through witnessing the true democratic model in an ocean of darkness.”, “I came from hell,” he said. “I love what Israel stands for.”, He recounts how as a boy he had witnessed a Palestinian mother bless all her five children before sending them out to carry out suicide attacks, a diabolical move he said would earn her respect within Palestinian society. He then spoke of Islam as the scourge of modern society, a state of consciousness that is stuck in the 6th and 7th centuries in a tribal lust for power. “We cannot fool ourselves,” he said. “There is an Islamic problem.”, He listed off Islamic terrorist groups including Hamas, Hezbollah, Boko Haram, and Islamic State. “All of them are killing by the name of Allah,” he said. “The Muslim people have a problem, and their problem is in their belief system.”, , “There is an Islamic problem and I think humanity needs to stand against this danger,” he added. He chastised the West for taking political correctness to the point of absurdity, saying that the world must face facts and unify against Islam’s corrupt belief system, as it did with Nazism. “The truth is that we are afraid and we are trying not to provoke them more, we are trying not to create a religious war. But there has been a religious war whether you like it or not,” the former spy said. “To tell them no, ‘Islam is a religion of peace,’ we just create the perfect climate for terrorists to keep on growing,” he said. The Son of Hamas also implicated Obama for playing a role in global terror. “When the president of the free world stands and says ‘Islam is a religion of peace,’ he creates the climate, he provides the climate, the perfect climate to create more terrorism,” asserted Yousef. Yousef also slammed the boycott Israel movement, calling BDS activists a “bunch of hypocrites.”, Yousef is known for his outspoken views on the religion of his childhood, with some pundits warning that the former informant is risking his life with his provocative comments. But that hasn’t stopped him. In an interview with this reporter, he even took on the Prophet Muhummad himself, saying that devout followers of Islam who wish to follow in their prophet’s footsteps will necessarily swing towards violence and extremism because that is how the prophet lived his own life. Watch the video here:, , In 1999, Yousef converted to Christianity and later fled to the U.S. where he was granted political asylum before writing his autobiography, The Son of Hamas.\n",

Barbara Boxer‘s (D-CA) successful Senate campaigns. Steyer, who threw his support behind Hillary Clinton for president, is also reportedly fielding a survey that tests his strengths and weaknesses against presumed front-runner Lieutenant Gov. Gavin Newsom. In addition to Newsom, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and state Treasurer John Chiang have officially entered the race. Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de León (D-Los Angeles), is also considering throwing his hat into the race. De León will reportedly term out of the state Senate in 2018. Steyer reportedly spent $87 million on the 2016 elections, and will likely spend big on his gubernatorial bid, should he enter the race. In January, Steyer said, “the world did not play out on November 8 the way I expected it to” with President Donald Trump’s victory, which dealt a devastating blow to the Democrats. At the time, he signaled backing away from the idea of running for higher office and suggested he would instead stay involved by working on climate change policy through his NextGen Climate Action group. However, new reports indicate Steyer may have had a change of heart. Depending on the field survey’s results, he could soon become the fourth Democrat candidate for the governor’s race. This weekend, the California Democratic Convention will take reportedly place in Sacramento, where all major announced and potential candidates will address over 3,300 delegates from across the Golden State. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti is also scheduled to speak at this weekend’s convention. On Thursday, he reportedly sidestepped questions about a possible run for governor, but didn’t dismiss the idea. “I have a truly amazing job that I love,” Garcetti said at the California Newspaper Publishers Association meeting in Santa Monica on Thursday, according to the Los Angeles Times. He added that he’s not going to “close anything off.”, Republican John Cox has also declared his candidacy.

The debate Tuesday in Geneva marked the first time that the country’s recent record was reviewed by the world human rights forum. All U.N. members face such periodic reviews. The U.S. representative at the session, Sheila Leonard, said her country was concerned about the developments in Poland. “We remain deeply concerned about judicial independence,” Leonard said. “We are also concerned about the continued discrimination and incidents targeting minorities in Poland, including homophobic, xenophobic and anti-Semitic speech and acts.”, Polish officials defended their record, saying the changes Law and Justice introduced were in line with European norms. The leading Polish representative, Renata Szczech, an undersecretary of state at Poland’s Foreign Ministry, reported that the government has reduced childhood poverty levels dramatically with new cash bonuses for families. Several delegates said they recognized the reduction in childhood poverty and urged Warsaw to show improvements in the other areas. Turkey’s delegate expressed concerns over an anti-Muslim mood in Poland, while Russia’s delegate criticized a recent spate of vandal attacks on memorials to Soviet soldier who died in World War II.\n",

      "“Trump now believes that man-made climate change is real” claims a headline in Mother Jones. (Top trolling, guys. Almost worthy of the Master, DJT himself.)[“In shift, Donald Trump says humans may be causing global warming,” says PBS. advertisement, According to The Washington Post, meanwhile:, President-elect Donald Trump appears to be softening his tone on whether climate change is real and on his stated plans to scrap the recent multinational agreement to limit carbon emissions. The name for this nonsense is “fake news” – as becomes clear when you read the transcripts of what President-Elect Trump actually said at his meeting with The New York Times. THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, opinion columnist: But it’s really important to me, and I think to a lot of our readers, to know where you’re going to go with this. I don’t think anyone objects to, you know, doing all forms of energy. But are you going to take America out of the world’s lead of confronting climate change?, TRUMP: I’m looking at it very closely, Tom. I’ll tell you what. I have an open mind to it. We’re going to look very carefully. It’s one issue that’s interesting because there are few things where there’s more division than climate change. You don’t tend to hear this, but there are people on the other side of that issue who are, think, don’t even …, ARTHUR SULZBERGER Jr. publisher of The New York Times: We do hear it. So at this point, Trump is gently introducing the NYT‘s liberals to the concept that not everyone thinks the same way on climate change as they do. Let’s carry on, shall we?, FRIEDMAN: I was on ‘Squawk Box’ with Joe Kernen this morning, so I got an earful of it. [laughter], TRUMP: Joe is one of them. But a lot of smart people disagree with you. I have a very open mind. And I’m going to study a lot of the things that happened on it and we’re going to look at it very carefully. But I have an open mind. SULZBERGER: Well, since we’re living on an island, sir, I want to thank you for having an open mind. We saw what these storms are now doing, right? We’ve seen it personally. Straight up. FRIEDMAN: But you have an open mind on this?, TRUMP: I do have an open mind. And we’ve had storms always, Arthur. SULZBERGER: Not like this. TRUMP: You know the hottest day ever was in 1890-something, 98. You know, you can make lots of cases for different views. I have a totally open mind. My uncle was for 35 years a professor at M.I.T. He was a great engineer, scientist. He was a great guy. And he was … a long time ago, he had feelings — this was a long time ago — he had feelings on this subject. It’s a very complex subject. I’m not sure anybody is ever going to really know. I know we have, they say they have science on one side but then they also have those horrible emails that were sent between the scientists. Where was that, in Geneva or wherever five years ago? Terrible. Where they got caught, you know, so you see that and you say, what’s this all about. I absolutely have an open mind. I will tell you this: Clean air is vitally important. Clean water, crystal clean water is vitally important. Safety is vitally important. And you know, you mentioned a lot of the courses. I have some great, great, very successful golf courses. I’ve received so many environmental awards for the way I’ve done, you know. I’ve done a tremendous amount of work where I’ve received tremendous numbers. Sometimes I’ll say I’m actually an environmentalist and people will smile in some cases and other people that know me understand that’s true. Open mind. Trump, it is obvious to anyone with half a brain, is taking the piss. He is telling the NYT‘s liberal assembly “I hear what you say” and then, ever so nicely, indicating that he doesn’t give a toss. The way he repeats that phrase “open mind”. He’s trolling them, basically. (Especially where he tells them he’s an “environmentalist”: classic Trump.), JAMES BENNET, editorial page editor: When you say an open mind, you mean you’re just not sure whether human activity causes climate change? Do you think human activity is or isn’t connected?, TRUMP: I think right now … well, I think there is some connectivity. There is some, something. It depends on how much. It also depends on how much it’s going to cost our companies. You have to understand, our companies are noncompetitive right now. They’re really largely noncompetitive. About four weeks ago, I started adding a certain little sentence into a lot of my speeches, that we’ve lost 70,000 factories since W. Bush. 70,000. When I first looked at the number, I said: ‘That must be a typo. It can’t be 70, you can’t have 70,000, you wouldn’t think you have 70,000 factories here.’ And it wasn’t a typo, it’s right. We’ve lost 70,000 factories. We’re not a competitive nation with other nations anymore. We have to make ourselves competitive. We’re not competitive for a lot of reasons. That’s becoming more and more of the reason. Because a lot of these countries that we do business with, they make deals with our president, or whoever, and then they don’t adhere to the deals, you know that. And it’s much less expensive for their companies to produce products. So I’m going to be studying that very hard, and I think I have a very big voice in it. And I think my voice is listened to, especially by people that don’t believe in it. And we’ll let you know. “We’ll let you know.” In other words: “I’ll get back to you.” In other words: “Sorry. Not interested in your business. Got better things to do.”\n",
      "Pittsburgh (AFP) – President Barack Obama on Thursday decried America’s “wild, wild west” media environment for allowing conspiracy theorists a broad platform and destroying a common basis for debate.[Recalling past days when three television channels delivered fact-based news that most people trusted, Obama said democracy require citizens to be able to sift through lies and distortions. advertisement, “We are going to have to rebuild within this wild-wild-west-of-information flow some sort of curating function that people agree to,” Obama said at an innovation conference in Pittsburgh. “There has to be, I think, some sort of way in which we can sort through information that passes some basic truthiness tests and those that we have to discard, because they just don’t have any basis in anything that’s actually happening in the world,” Obama added. His remarks came amid an election campaign that has seen Republican candidate Donald Trump repeat ideas and take on key staff from right-wing media outlets. They also come at the end of an eight-year presidency in which Obama has been plagued by false scandals over his place of birth that have forced him to play media-critic-in-chief. For much of that time, Republicans and Democrats — which their own media sources — could rarely agree on even the most basic facts to build a debate. “That is hard to do, but I think it’s going to be necessary, it’s going to be possible,” he added. “The answer is obviously not censorship, but it’s creating places where people can say ‘this is reliable’ and I’m still able to argue safely about facts and what we should do about it.”\n",

      "Today is Earth Hour and as usual I shall be lighting a candle – several, actually plus turning my Rayburn up to eleven plus turning on all the house lights plus lighting the patio heaters plus starting my Landrover and leaving its diesel engine to idle outside in the drive plus switching on the immersion heater plus running several hot baths – in tribute to the world’s climate heroes.[I refer, of course, to the tiny, elite fellowship of scientists, economists, politicians, journalists and bloggers who have bravely taken the right side of the climate argument and spoken up for truth, integrity and the scientific method in defiance of the vast and terrifying propaganda behemoth they call the Green Blob. advertisement, Many of them were present at the annual Heartland Institute Climate Conference in Washington DC this week. I was sorry not to have been able to make it there myself this year because these people have become my friends. Shared adversity does that for you: everyone from our elder statesman Fred Singer downwards has been brutally vilified, traduced, mocked and monstered by the Servants of the Green Blob over the years – because when the evidence isn’t on your side (as it hasn’t been for a long time where the alarmist cause is concerned), blustering appeals to authority, affectedly high-minded ridicule and below-the-belt cheap shots are pretty much the only weapons left to you. My sceptical filmmaking friends Phelim McAleer and Anne McElhinney once made a movie exposing the nonsense of the greenies. It was called Not Evil Just Wrong. In my view this was a misnomer. It should have been called: Wrong – And Totally Bloody Evil Too. There many reasons why the alarmist establishment – the Climate Industrial Complex as Myron Ebell calls it – is so totally loathsomely evil. If I had to list them all this would be longer than War &amp Peace. One is that they’re such hypocrites: if you really cared about the environment in the way these fascistic loons claim they do, then you’d be vigorously opposing renewable energy (such as the bat-chomping, bird-slicing eco-crucifixes defacing our landscape and slicing and dicing our avian fauna) and instead going all out for fossil fuels. This was a point often made in the Heartland panel discussions – which you can catch up with here . In the one on Sustainability – Panel 5A – independent scientist Indur Goklany pointed out that without fossil fuels we wouldn’t have the fertilizer we need to make our agricultural land so productive. This in turn would mean we wouldn’t be able to leave nearly so much space free as fallow land, as nature reserves or as wilderness. You’d think the Greenies would get this fairly basic scientific point – given how much they’re always banging on about “the science” – but they never do because, as I argued in my book Watermelons, their commitment to environmentalism owes much more to quasi-religious ideology, to straightforward greed and to anti-free-market control-freakery than it does to a genuine love of nature. Then there’s the hatred. Pretty much everyone speaking at the Heartland Institute will have suffered personally for speaking out against the Great Global Warming Scare. Willie Soon‘s travails are typical. It’s why only the brave – or the elderly, who have nothing to lose – who speak out. The same applies, of course, to all the other professions which dare to confront the climate “consensus”. I wrote in my book, for example, about how popular British TV presenters David Bellamy and Johnny Ball both effectively had their careers destroyed when they took the “wrong side” on global warming. Journalists get it in the neck too, of course. Let me close by treating you to some examples of the kind of hate I got recently simply for pointing out that Australia’s Great Barrier Reef isn’t actually being wiped out by man-made global warming. Sure, it has experienced some serious bleaching in some parts – probably the result of the recent El Nino – but not nearly on the scale that has been claimed by politically- and financially-motivated climate alarmists. And it will recover, just like reefs always do and have done for millennia, sometimes in warming far more extreme than anything we have experienced today. Here’s how the Guardian responded. The best bit are the comments. It gives you a flavour of what we climate sceptics have to put up with all the time from the eco loons, purely for telling the truth. Enjoy! Happy Earth Hour!, Delingpole is clearly a stooge for the oil industry but his denial of the Great Barrier Reef’s damage over the last two Australian summers is lowdown and dispicable even for him. The guy is actually , properly mentally unwell and should quite clearly be sectioned before he becomes a danger to himself and others. I mean what other explanation is there for peddling a belief so comprehensively wrong. Isn’t James Delingpole in fact an algorithm, probably Kremlin-designed, randomly trying to create environmental disinformation?, Boycott America until they smarten up. It’s the only thing they understand!, Like Katie Hopkins, Delingpole is a one-note hack who has to knock out 1000 words in time for a deadline day after day, week after week. It’s how he stays afloat, and it’s much easier to crank out instant yah-boo-sucks pieces like this one than devote any serious thought to anything. He’s not worth wasting time on. Adolf Hitler always said that when lying to tell the most outrageous ones possible because they are far more likely to be believed. Fake news eh,Delingpole or whatever?Well come up to QLD central where I live and I will take you out in the boat to have a look.Careful of the tiger sharks they have been pretty cranky lately.I think they are hungry. That snivelling little toady? A waste of a bullet. “Enemy of the people, James Delingpole, lies again ” would be a good headline for most articles that include him.An article titled “The lies of James Deilingpole” would be a useful in depth review of the genre of denials of fact and a fairly cost effective way to produce a full size article on the subject. Who actually reads this brightfart or whatever its called?, How much funding comes the way of these jokers from the fossil fuel industry? Or is that a fake question?, James Delingpole is another extreme far right brainless dingbat who should be ignored by sane people everywhere. This is unbearable. How did such complete morons come to have such power and influence?, Why do the police force and the government spend so much money stalking and intimidating environmental activists who are just fighting a bloody hard fight to defend the earth we ALL depend on from arse-scum like this guy?, Line ’em up and blow their fucking peanut brains out of their heads, they don’t use them anyway. Why are we allowing this sub moronic scum to promote this flat earth bullshit because it’ll get us all killed, and quite possibly within ten years?, Gosh. Was it something I wrote?,  \n",
      "Former Secretary of State John Kerry defended the Iran nuclear deal on Monday evening at a gala dinner in San Francisco for the Ploughshares Fund, a George Soros-backed group that was part of President Barack Obama’s “echo chamber” to sell the agreement to the public.[Kerry called the Iran deal’s monitoring processes a “system that’s working,” according to the San Francisco Chronicle, and criticized President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress for pushing for new sanctions against the Iranian regime. advertisement, “It doesn’t make sense, folks, to risk a step that gets us nothing,” Kerry said of proposed new sanctions on Iran’s ballistic missile program, according to the Chronicle. Kerry also blasted the Trump administration for withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accords, the Obama administration’s other major foreign policy legacy. He reportedly defended his 2014 remark that climate change was a “weapon of mass destruction” and a threat to national security. “Scientists, people whose life is invested in this are telling you, ‘This is growing in instability, and the threat is that whole parts of the ice sheet will break off.’,” Kerry said, according to the Chronicle. As Breitbart News’ Aaron Klein reported a year ago, the Ploughshares Fund has been sponsoring national security coverage at National Public Radio (NPR) since 2005, as well as several think tanks that supported the Iran deal. It is also, Klein reported, funded in turn by George Soros’s Open Society Foundations.

      "Rajendra Pachauri, the disgraced former head of the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC), has produced an ingenious defence against the sexual harassment charges he is now facing in an Indian court.[It turns out that, no he didn’t pester, bombard with emails, and grope the attractive female employee at his TERI climate research institute. advertisement, Rather, the whole thing is the result of an evil conspiracy by climate change sceptics and right-wing think tanks, funded by Big Oil. Apparently they hacked into all his computer accounts and, without his knowledge, sent a series of flirtatious emails and love poems to his unnamed accuser. Pachauri was given generous space to make these extravagant claims by John Vidal, one of the numerous environment editors who works at the Guardian – in this case its Sunday edition the Observer – and who for years has uncritically championed the world-saving, Nobel-prize-winning work down by the IPCC. He says: “I have repeatedly received death threats anonymously over the years. In recent months I have received these threats over the telephone from numbers that were valid when East Germany was a nation. I am not sure how these people have numbers pertaining to that defunct international code.”, He says he suspects strongly, but cannot prove, that there has been a coordinated attempt to destroy him professionally and personally and that money may also be involved. Ever since he was elected to lead the IPCC in 2002, he says the IPCC has been vilified by climate sceptics and rightwing free-market thinktanks, often known to have been funded by powerful fossil-fuel interests. For sceptics to force the resignation of the head of the UN’s climate panel would be a coup, undermining its scientific credibility and possibly derailing global agreement, he says. If – as Pachauri claims – this really was a hack, then his persecutors certainly have a twisted sense of humour. One of the emails he supposedly sent reads:, “I will go on a fast after a cricket match … I will break the fast only when you believe I love you with sincerity and unfathomable depth.”, another says:, I have never felt so overwhelmingly in love as I have been with you, and even though you gave me so much pain, I will always be your well-wisher and carry beautiful memories of the joyous moments between us, limited as they might have been. Whoever wrote them has captured perfectly the clumsiness and absurdity of the cricket-loving, ice-shunning, vegetarian, yogic guru, as best displayed in the erotic novel Pachauri published a few years ago, Return To Almeira. Here is a sample from that classic work:, Afterwards she held him close. ‘Sanjay I’ve learned something for the first time today. You are absolutely superb after meditation. Why don’t we make love every time immediately after you have meditated?’, If Pachauri’s allegations are correct it certainly wouldn’t be the first time that the evil agents of Big Oil have been caught out harassing – and worse – the innocent, blameless, heroic and noble climate science community. Last year, you may recall, one of the world’s leading polar ice experts – Peter Wadhams, professor of ocean physics at Cambridge University – revealed that three of his colleagues had died in mysterious circumstances. , Was it because they knew too much about global warming? Professor Wadhams certainly suspected so and blamed the dark forces of Big Oil. But his theory received short shrift from the widow of one of the victims:, Fiona Strawbridge, Professor Laxon’s partner, said that she had seen similar claims by “ridiculous conspiracy theorists” on the internet but she was certain his death was an accident. She said that she knew Dr Giles and it was clear that her death was also an accident. Perhaps Rajendra Pachauri will have better luck with his Indian court case. If the judge and jury are as credulous as the Guardian‘s John Vidal, then he may stand a chance. Sadly, though, it would appear that the Guardian article is already the subject of much ridicule in the Indian media. First, Pachauri’s claims of hacking have already been rejected by the police investigators, who found no evidence of it. Also, the offending messages came not only from Pachauri’s computers but also in form of text messages from his phone. Furthermore, the complainant has vigorously denied – through her lawyers – that she was paid to make these allegations against her employer. “The complainant has informed me that Mr. Pachauri can be rest assured, she has not been approached by anyone at any point of time and it is just his acts which have cause immense pain and suffering to her for her to initiate cases against him.”, Finally, as this article in India’s HuffPo points out – it’s not just climate sceptics who find Pachauri rather disgusting. Lots and lots of people do…, It is important to mention here that Pachauri has not only come under attack from people who are unconnected with the debate on climate change. Prominent human and women’s rights activists Indira Jaising and Vrinda Grover have spoken out against his continued charge of TERI. Others who demanded his resignation and action against him include former Planning Commission member Syeda Hameed, All India Progressive Women’s Association secretary Kavita Krishnan, Jagori director Suneeta Dhar, senior journalist Pamela Philipose, PUCL national secretary Kavita Srivastava, and JNU professor Nivedita Menon, as reported here. Still, at least this affair won’t remotely damage the credibility of the IPCC which stubbornly kept Pachauri on as its boss for years and years after he’d been subject to allegations about incompetence, corruption and malfeasance and despite the fact that as a railway engineer by training he has special knowledge of climate change. No wait…\n",
      "Mainstream left wing publications have continued to illustrate John Kasich as a man who is morally superior to his “far-right” Republican opponents, glorifying the Ohio Governor as a man of reason because he is willing to capitulate to the left on social welfare projects such as Medicaid and staple democrat issues like climate change.[After recent endorsements and nonstop positive coverage from the New York Times and Boston Globe, other outlets, such as the Washington Post, have joined in on the act, portraying Kasich as someone who is deeply in touch with his emotions and a man who has an independent mindset, unlike his supposed hardline radical opponents. advertisement, The Boston Globe rallied behind Kasich on Thursday, reminding readers that the Ohio Governor is no “hard-line” Republican, and he even “acknowledges that carbon emissions have contributed to climate change,” which is a staple issue for the left. The Washington Post reported that the one-of-a-kind Kasich “sells GOP something different.”, The New York Times noted that Kasich, who is reportedly calling himself a “happy warrior” nowadays, “comports himself at campaign events with a mellowness that he hopes will allow him to rise above the fray of a bitter campaign.” The Times report also says Kasich’s supporters have found his “adult” manner to be “refreshing.”, Kasich has not only embraced the positive coverage from the left wing outlets, he literally cried after hearing word that the New York Times editorial board endorsed him. On Friday in an interview with MSNBC, the Ohio Governor said, “I think there’s too much greed on Wall Street,” in response to a question about Bernie Sander’s anti-Wall Street comments in Thursday’s Democratic debate. “I saw it.”, “These big institutions need to reserve their own assets for the risk they take on, but everyone there isn’t a crook and everybody isn’t doing horrible things. Its just that whenever value becomes less and greed becomes more, we get out of bounds,” he added. , “I think it’s possible to push these regulations that we need. We can’t de-regulate all of Wall Street. But here’s a problem: You regulate all the banks and you kill the little guy,” Kasich said, playing the middle ground over regulation. The Ohio governor was in Atkinson, New Hampshire on Friday for a town hall meeting, where he displayed the national debt clock and addressed a crowd of several dozen people. Two New Hampshire Republican primary polls published Friday had Gov. Kasich projected to finish in fourth place, with eight and ten percent of the vote there, behind Donald Trump, Sen.

He posted a link to the video on Twitter:, advertisement, Wake up, Neo.@CloudGateStudio just figured out how to give you a full-body presence in VR. pic.twitter.com/UlgmRZknSC, — Steve Bowler (@gameism) January 19, 2017, , Bowler first showed off the function of virtual hands in the game, but said that it’s something “everyone’s [doing].” Then he displayed unfinished virtual arms, saying “we’re not going to ship this yet,” but “it’s getting there.” But CloudGate wanted to “do more than just this … like, a lot more.” So with the aid of four total motion controllers in addition to an HTC Vive headset, Bowler showed what he called “a pretty good facsimile of a human body in VR.”, He then demonstrated the ability to look down at his virtual body and make contact with it in a way that mirrored the contact he was making with his own real-world form. He touched his toes, then his head and shoulders. The shadow of his form mimicked his real-life motions, even to the point of dancing and crouching, despite a lack of hip tracking. Bowler said that while right now the simulation is effectively guessing at the position of his hips, with a dedicated hip tracker it would look even better. He concluded the video by demonstrating interactivity in the environment, able to “kick all the things.” He proceeded to do just that, showing how objects in the environment reacted to his motions because he “had a body” in VR. But according to Steve himself, this was just a “hack,” with a better realization of the concept being adapted to the new HTC Vive trackers announced at CES 2017. @nuclearfossil it's a \"hack\" using two Vives so we could get 4 wireless controllers. Now that it's proven will move to Vive Trackers later. — Steve Bowler (@gameism) January 20, 2017, , The possibilities for this development are thrilling. Full-body tracking in VR could provide endless application in entertainment and social spaces alike. We’ll definitely be keeping an eye on further developments from CloudGate Studio and other virtual reality pioneers, as the emerging technology finds its place in the global market.

      "The Associated Press reported Monday that former President Barack Obama released $221 million in U.S. funding for the Palestinian Authority on the morning of Friday, January 20 — just hours before he was to leave office.[The AP details:, advertisement, A State Department official and several congressional aides say the outgoing administration formally notified Congress it would spend the money Friday morning, just before Donald Trump became president. More than $227 million in foreign affairs funding was released at the time, including $4 million for climate change programs and $1.25 million for U.N. organizations. At least two GOP lawmakers had placed holds on the Palestinian funds. Congressional holds are generally respected by the executive branch but are not legally binding. This was not the first time Obama had granted funding to the Palestinian Authority despite Congress’s wishes. In 2012, for example, he unblocked nearly $200 million that had been frozen in response to Palestinians’ unilateral actions at the United Nations, using a legal waiver included in the Palestinian Accountability Act. Republicans have increasingly called for blocking or canceling funding to the Palestinian Authority, not only because of unilateral diplomatic moves toward statehood, but also because of increasing evidence that funds are used to incite violence and provide financial rewards to terrorists. The Palestinian Authority reportedly provides compensation to the families of terrorist prisoners incarcerated in Israeli prisons, as well as to those who have killed themselves in attacks on Israeli civilians. The total amount allocated by the Palestinian Authority budget for “the Care for the Families of the Martyrs” was reportedly about $175 million in 2016, and an additional $140 million was reportedly allocated for payments to prisoners and former prisoners. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas was also among the first world leaders that President Obama called after taking office in January 2009. Joel B.

      "Leonardo DiCaprio has handed over to the federal government an Oscar originally won by Marlon Brando that he was gifted by Red Granite Pictures for his work on The Wolf of Wall Street, as the Department of Justice closes in on the production company’s alleged involvement in a massive Malaysian embezzlement scheme.[According to Deadline, the DOJ filed an asset seizure request Thursday in a California court against Red Granite, the film production company that has been accused of using millions of dollars stolen from a fund intended to benefit the people of Malaysia to pay for its productions. advertisement, In the filing, the government reportedly argued it should be entitled to seize the Red Granite films Dumb and Dumber To and Daddy’s Home as well as precious artwork purchased by the production company with what DOJ claims is stolen money. The filing reportedly includes a request to seize real estate, valuable artwork by Van Gogh and Picasso and an original poster for the 1927 Fritz Lang film Metropolis, said to be worth $1.3 million, that reportedly hangs on the wall at Red Granite’s office. An August exposé in the Hollywood Reporter detailed the link between DiCaprio, his eponymous environmental foundation and 1MDB, the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund at the center of the scandal. The DOJ alleges that Malaysian businessman and 1MDB advisor Jho Low funneled millions of dollars stolen from the fund into the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, including for the purchase of artwork that was later auctioned off at the actor’s annual environmental charity gala in St. Tropez, France. The DOJ also alleges that hundreds of millions of dollars (of the more than $3 billion reported to have been misappropriated from the fund, in what could be the world’ largest-ever embezzlement scheme) went to Red Granite Pictures to fund its productions, including The Wolf of Wall Street, the 2013 financial crime dramedy for which DiCaprio won a Golden Globe in the starring role. Red Granite — co-founded by the prime minister of Malaysia’s step-son, Riza Aziz, himself a central figure in the DOJ investigation — was reported to have given DiCaprio the Oscar won by Marlon Brando for his role in the 1954 classic On the Waterfront as a gift for his work on Wolf of Wall Street. In a statement to Deadline Thursday, representatives for DiCaprio — who finally won his own acting Oscar for The Revenant in 2015 — said the actor reached out to the DOJ last summer to help cooperate with the investigation and to see if he needed to return any potentially ill-gotten gifts or donations. The actor was reported to have earned around $25 million for his role as unscrupulous 90s Wall Street investor Jordan Belfort in the Martin Scorsese-directed film. “Prior to the government’s filing of the civil pleading today, Mr. DiCaprio initiated return of these items, which were received and accepted by him for the purpose of being included in an annual charity auction to benefit his eponymous foundation,” the actor’s reps said. “He has also returned an Oscar originally won by Marlon Brando, which was given to Mr. DiCaprio as a set gift by Red Granite to thank him for his work on The Wolf Of Wall Street.”, “In keeping the ill-gotten money, the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation is acting in complete contradiction to its mission statement, which is to be ‘dedicated to the long-term health and wellbeing of all Earth’s inhabitants… while restoring balance to threatened ecosystems and communities,” Peter Kallang of the environmental group Save Rivers said in a statement in September. “The money should thus be returned to the people of Malaysia to stop the massive destruction to the environment and ecosystem from land developments and pollution,” he added. In October, rainforest preservation charity The Bruno Manser Funds called on the actor to resign his post as a U.N. Messenger of Peace for climate change as a result of the scandal.  , Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum\n",
      "British Prime Minister Theresa May used her speech in Philadelphia to needle the new Trump administration on a number of issues ranging from globalism to climate change, Islam, and even to defending the European Union.[Mrs. May began her speech at the Republican Retreat in Philadelphia with a brief history of Anglo-American relations, invoking the spirit of the Founding Fathers of the U.S. as well as expressing gratitude towards America’s involvement in the World Wars of the 20th century. advertisement, But her speech was also littered with politically correct terms, as well as left and centre-left talking points regarding international institutions, Islam, and radical Islamic terrorism, the latter of which she called “Islamist extremism”. The British premier compared “open, liberal and democratic” societies in the West versus “closed, coercive” ones. She hailed the United Nations, praised the World Bank, and called NATO “the cornerstone” of Western defence. And Mrs. May also spoke of the necessity for multilateralism in stark contrast with the line pushed by the White House — which prefers bilateralism — over recent days. She cited the need to tackle “climate change” as one of the reasons to back globalist institutions. She called for the two nations to be “internationalist” and “global”, though noted “Some of these organisations are in need of reform and renewal”. And while committing to the destruction of the Islamic State, she failed to mention the name of the group, choosing instead the term “Daesh” — a word preferred by politically correct types and most notably popularised by former Secretary of State John Kerry and President Barack Obama. She went on to describe “radical Islamists”, stopping short of echoing the phrases used by the new U.S. administration including “radical Islamic terrorism”. The British PM stated: “Of course we should always be careful to distinguish between this extreme and hateful ideology and the peaceful religion of Islam, and the hundreds of millions of its adherents, including millions of our own citizens, and those further afield who are so often the first victims of this ideology’s terror”. And while Mrs. May hailed the founding principle of “liberty” and claimed the title of “conservative” to draw parallels between her beliefs and those of Republican attendees, she is perhaps best known in the United Kingdom for an unprecedented expansion of the surveillance state and indeed mass migration at historic levels. Mrs. May was a Remain campaigner during the Brexit referendum, and also used her speech in Philadelphia to underscore her commitment to Britain’s foreign aid spending. And while the British government voted against the State of Israel in the now infamous UN Security Council vote in December, she stated that democratic allies like the Jewish state must be protected. Mrs. May spoke of verification and “policing” of the Iranian nuclear deal and spoke of the trading relationship between the United Kingdom and United States. Curiously, despite Britain’s Brexit vote, Mrs. May said of the European Union: “We will build a new partnership with our friends in Europe. We are not turning our back on them, or on the interests and the values that we share. It remains overwhelmingly in our interests – and in those of the wider world – that the EU should succeed”.\n",
      "Frank Gaffney, founder of the Center for Security Policy, appeared on Breitbart News Daily with host Stephen K. Bannon on Wednesday to discuss the need for tighter border security, and how it conflicts with Pope Francis’ support for mass migration from the Third World into Western countries.[Gaffney used the Zika virus as a metaphor for how mass migration brings security pathologies from regions with serious security issues into the United States, much as Zika has flourished in countries with less stringent disease and mosquito control protocols. advertisement, “We’ve now got these cartels operating with gangs all over the United States,” said Gaffney, referring to South American drug cartels. “Literally, every state in the Union is now a border state.”, “That’s partly because we have been neglecting the border,” he continued, “and not preventing people who have been operating on one side of it from operating on both.”, Gaffney warned that the drug cartels are not alone in establishing operations on both sides of the porous border. “They are being now, increasingly, accompanied by – and collaborating with – jihadists that the Pope is ignoring in Europe, where he’s residing at the moment, and a lot of other places besides, of course,” he said.  , Noting that the big cartels have been compared to the Islamic State in their organizational methods and violence, Gaffney said, “You also have the Islamic State in Latin America. You also have Hamas. You also have Hezbollah. You also have the Iranians… and, by the way, the Chinese and others. That side of the border is now a fertile environment for jihadists to operate from, with impunity – and to bring their violence, and other kinds of predations, here as well.”, , Breitbart News Daily airs from 6AM-9AM EST on Sirius XM Patriot channel 125.\n",
      "Rosie O’Donnell is set to lead a rally in protest of Donald Trump in front of the White House Tuesday, just hours before the president delivers his first address to a joint session of Congress.[“Following the first disastrous month of his administration, Trump is expected to articulate a discriminatory agenda that continues to put people in harm’s way, undermines equality and our shared values, and damages our environment,” the group Advocates Resisting Trump Agenda said in a statement announcing the rally. advertisement, “The rally will feature speakers from diverse organizations and groups of people who have been impacted and harmed by the Trump administration’s policies, including women, people of color and members of the LGBTQ community, as well as environmental and immigrants’ rights groups,” the statement read. The rally — dubbed “A Resistance Address: Defending American Values in a Time of Moral Crisis” — is set to begin Tuesday at 6 p.m. Eastern.

      "“If he were standing here, he would tell you that he feels much more knowledgable on the topic today,” said Trump’s economic advisor Gary Cohn, referring to the president’s position on climate change and the Paris agreement.[Well if that’s the case, it’s certainly no thanks to Cohn – whose advice on these matters is about as sound, reliable and unbiased as that provided by Grima Wormtongue – slippery henchman of the evil wizard Saruman – to King Theoden in Lord of the Rings. advertisement, Cohn wants Trump to keep the U.S. in the Paris climate agreement. Of course, he does. As an ex-Goldman Sachs man Cohn is a fully paid up member of the $1.5 trillion-a-year Climate Industrial Complex. It was Goldman Sachs – along with Enron – which pioneered the carbon trading schemes that helped enrich enviro-troughers like Al Gore. If the global warming Ponzi scheme ever collapses – and it will – then many of Cohn’s friends and former clients stand to lose millions in crony-capitalist “investments” currently propped up by Obama-era regulation which Cohn and his cronies are desperate to keep in place. This also explains Cohn’s extraordinary recent attack on the coal industry – “coal doesn’t even make that much sense anymore as a feedstock” – and his risibly dishonest claim that solar and wind power can help the U.S. become “a manufacturing powerhouse.”, It’s extraordinary firstly because it is in direct and explicit contradiction of Trump’s election trail promises to bring back jobs in the coal industry. And it’s extraordinary secondly because it is in direct contradiction of observable reality, viz: there is no economic case for wind (or solar) – inefficient, expensive energy which is heavily reliant on taxpayer subsidy. For Trump’s Economic Advisor (!) to claim otherwise is at best irresponsibly misleading, at worst a flat-out lie. Of a piece with this are Cohn’s claims about the Paris Agreement – which he has been trying to spin as a harmless, largely cosmetic diplomatic accord in which the U.S. is pretty much free to do as it chooses – either increasing or reducing its carbon reduction commitments, according to whim. Here is how Bloomberg reported Cohn’s take on Paris. Cohn stressed that Trump’s decision will ultimately be based on”what’s best for the United States.” He cast the agreement as flexible enough to accommodate reductions in the U.S. commitment that would keep the deal from hindering the American economy. The original U.S. pledge to pare emissions at least 26 percent by 2025 “would be constraining to our economic growth,” Cohn told reporters. “But then you get into the whole discussion on Paris: Is it non-binding, is it not non-binding, can you change your levels, how easy is it to change your levels?”, If this is what Cohn has been telling Trump then he has been misleading him. The Paris agreement was ALWAYS intended by its negotiators to be a one-way ticket. That is, there was never supposed to be a get-out enabling the U.S to reduce its commitments in order to ‘keep the deal from hindering the American economy.’, Here is the evidence. Exhibit A. A talk given to the Brookings Institute by the chief U.S, climate negotiator Todd Stern, in which he says the following about the Paris Agreement, which he describes as a “universal, lasting climate regime.” (Emphasis added in bold):, “Second of all, really important with respect to ambition. We started with the completely extraordinary fact that here were 186 countries that had put forward their targets, their so-called INDCs in the lingo, during the course of 2015. And then there was an architecture built around that in the agreement of five-year cycles to ratchet those up. And countries either put in new targets or, if they’re in the middle of a longer target period, they have to either revise it upward or reconfirm it every five years. And the five-year cycle follows a global stock-take to see where we are in the aggregate vis-à-vis our long-term goals, vis-à-vis what science is telling us. So you’ve got an every-five-year stock-take and then about a year after the every-five-year stock-take countries have to either reconfirm and say, yes, I’m going to hold where I am or I’m going to increase where I am or if they’re in the period of time where they have to put in a target anyway, obviously they do. So that was really important.”, “So in the first set of these INDCs which are going to keep ratcheting up, again we hope every five years, that there’s already been this big, big move.”, “… the structure that you have these five-year review periods and the ratcheting up cycle of what countries are supposed to do built into the agreement“, Note: this ratchet – as ratchets do – only goes one way, which is up. Exhibit B: a briefing note to the U.S. State Department from Michael Jacobs – a high level eco advisor, formerly Climate Advisor to Prime Minister Gordon Brown – of the Global Commission on Economy and Climate, submitted in 2014 in the run-up to Paris. , Paris – as it was clearly understood by those who wrote and negotiated it – was always a one-way ticket. Otherwise – as this document acknowledges – it would have no meaning: “Otherwise we have not real agreement in Paris at all.”, The Obama-era State Department knew this perfectly well. The lawyers and negotiators understood this perfectly well. Gary Cohn too, no doubt, understands this perfectly well. Which is yet another reason we all have cause to pray and hope that the rumors are true – and that President Trump really is going to quit the Paris climate agreement. If he does otherwise, he won’t be draining the swamp: he’ll be feeding the crocodiles and leeches.\n",
      "The West Antarctic has become yet another victim of global cooling.[According to the latest study, in Nature, it has experienced, advertisement, “an absence of regional warming since the late 1990s”, while, “The annual mean temperature has decreased at a statistically significant rate, with the most rapid cooling during the Austral summer. Temperatures have decreased as a consequence of a greater frequency of cold, east-to-southeasterly winds, resulting from more cyclonic conditions in the northern Weddell Sea associated with a strengthening mid-latitude jet. These circulation changes have also increased the advection of sea ice towards the east coast of the peninsula, amplifying their effects.”, What all this means, in plain English, is that the climate alarmists have just gone and lost one of their most cherished poster children. For over a decade, the rapidly rising temperatures in the Western Antarctic (aka the Antarctic Pensinsula) have featured very heavily in the litany of man-made climate doom stories unquestioningly swallowed by a compliant media. Here’s NBC in 2013, The Antarctic Peninsula is one of the fastest-warming places on Earth…, Here is the BBC in 2012, US researchers say they found the first evidence of warming during the southern hemisphere’s summer months. They are worried that the increased melting of ice as a result of warmer temperatures could contribute to sea-level rise. And here they were again in 2001, UK scientists say parts of Antarctica have recently been warming much faster than most of the rest of the Earth. They believe the warming is probably without parallel for nearly two thousand years. This “fastest-warming place on earth” narrative has become so important to the activists who work in climate “science” that, even now, they can’t quite bring themselves to admit the devastating significance of this latest study. And that includes the people who actually wrote it. That’s why – rather amusingly – they actually begin the abstract of their Nature study by pretending it’s business as usual. Since the 1950s, research stations on the Antarctic Peninsula have recorded some of the largest increases in near-surface air temperature in the Southern Hemisphere1. This warming has contributed to the regional retreat of glaciers2, disintegration of floating ice shelves3 and a ‘greening’ through the expansion in range of various flora4. Several interlinked processes have been suggested as contributing to the warming, including stratospheric ozone depletion5, local sea-ice loss6, an increase in westerly winds5, 7, and changes in the strength and location of low–high-latitude atmospheric teleconnections. You’d never guess from that intro, would you that this wasn’t yet another study demonstrating the impact of “global warming” in Antarctica? Still less would you guess that in fact what it was about to say was the precise opposite: that the supposedly fastest-warming place on the planet has in fact been cooling for at least the last 18 years. As Jo Nova reports, the mainstream media has been driven to all manner of contortions to try to explain away the significance of this story. Here’s a classic headline from Chris Mooney in the Washington Post. The Antarctic Peninsula has been cooling, but that doesn’t disprove global warming, Phew. So that’s OK then…\n",
      "MOST POPULAR[Friday on CNN’s “The Lead,” Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton said Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump “set a very bad example”  and “created an environment” of violence that influenced the anti-Trump mob that attacked Trump supporters leaving a rally last night in California. advertisement, Partial transcript as follows:, TAPPER: “There were some really ugly images on the TV screens yesterday, some really reprehensible attacks by anti-Trump protesters against people who support Donald Trump. Do you condemn the violence? What is your message to people who are protesting Donald Trump?”, CLINTON: “I condemn all violence in our political arena. I condemned it when Donald Trump was inciting it and congratulating people who were engaging it. I condemn it by those who are taking violent protests to physical assault against Donald Trump. This has to end. He set a very bad example. He created an environment in which it seemed to be acceptable for someone running for president to be inciting violence, to be encouraging his supporters. Now we’re seeing people who were against him responding in kind. It should all stop. It is not acceptable.”, TAPPER: “At the end of the day, do you think that those violent anti-Trump protesters actually might be helping him in a way by showing his opposition in such a horrendous light?”, CLINTON: “I don’t think any of this — people who were peacefully protesting against Trump, help Trump and I don’t think that people who are protesting and using physical violence against people is helping anybody. I don’t want to talk about the political implications. I want it to end. The police have a hard enough time to make sure that we’re able to gather and talk about the issues facing our country.

      "The second presidential debate of the 2016 election will be held at Washington University in St. Louis on Sunday at 9 p.m. Eastern, and may be the most decisive of the three debates.[Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was widely seen as the winner of the first debate, and could hurt her opponent’s chances if she goads him into a serious error or gaffe. But Republican nominee Donald Trump has bounced back in the polls, and is riding the momentum of his running mate’s strong performance in the vice presidential debate. If Trump turns in a solid performance on Sunday, he could sprint to catch Clinton at the finish. advertisement, The moderators of the town hall-style debate will be Martha Raddatz of ABC News and Anderson Cooper of CNN. Both lean left, and both can be expected to be tougher on Trump than on Clinton. Here are five questions that both Trump and Clinton should expect to face, either from the moderators or — in some form — from the participants in the town hall, whose questions will be pre-screened. 1. With Hurricane Matthew battering the Atlantic coast, what will you do about climate change? The question makes no scientific sense, because Hurricane Matthew has nothing to do with climate change. In fact, until this year, no hurricanes had hit the U.S. in more than ten years, confounding the predictions of climate alarmists. But the question will be asked, and is designed to test Trump against the liberal climate orthodoxy. (Clinton’s answer will be the usual boilerplate, coupled with a charge of “denialism” against Trump). Trump will have to thread the needle carefully. Without denying climate change as a whole, he will have to note that shutting down the coal industry, as Clinton wants to do, cannot be the answer. He should also note that he personally visited Louisiana this summer to visit flood victims, while Clinton hobnobbed on Martha’s Vineyard. 2. Both of you have high disapproval ratings. How will you be a role model for America’s children? That question, or something like it, will be another veiled attack on Trump, since Clinton is a role model by default for being the first female nominee for president from a major party, no matter how poor a candidate she may be. Expect Clinton to bring out the same attack lines that feature in her campaign commercials, and which her running mate pounded at the vice presidential debate. The question gives Trump an opportunity to score points off Clinton for her many scandals. But the best response is for Trump for to point to his own children — especially his daughter Ivanka — who are successful, poised, and his best character witnesses. 3. Hundreds of thousands may die in Aleppo, the latest in a brutal civil war. What should we do about Syria? Expect this question to come from Anderson Cooper, who likes to show his foreign policy chops. It is the question neither candidate wants to answer, since the problem cannot really be solved short of war with Iran and confrontation with Russia. Clinton has a standard answer, which is to talk about continuing the Obama administration’s fight against ISIS (such as it is). She may try to claim she wanted to do more about Syria as Secretary of State but was overruled. If she does, Trump should not let her off the hook: if she really cared about Syria, she ought to have resigned. As for his own policy, his strongest point is his criticism of Arab countries for doing everything to stoke the fighting and nothing to help the refugees. He should pledge to stop that. 4. The economy continues to create jobs, and household incomes rose last year. How will you improve on that? In the first debate, the moderator painted a rosy picture of Obama’s economic record. Clinton, who proposes to continue Obama’s policies, but with an even greater focus on inequality (if that is even possible), will rattle off her talking points about raising the minimum wage and taxing the rich. Trump, who pushed back in the first debate by noting that the stock market is in a bubble and that Clinton has never created a real job in her life, should offer a better response this time, with three parts. First, he should talk about the Americans whom he has met on the campaign trail who are suffering in the Obama-Clinton economy and who are uncertain about the future. Second, he should bring up Obamacare, which has helped make this recovery the slowest since World War II, and which Clinton supports completely. And third, he should note that Clinton’s policies — higher taxes, higher fuel prices, more unskilled illegal aliens, and more needless regulations — will make the economy even worse. 5. I’m a veteran who lost friends in war. How can I trust either of you to be commander-in-chief? At least one question will — and probably should — go to a soldier, or a soldier’s family, to present the “commander-in-chief” test. In this case, the question will also allow CNN and ABC to revive the Khizr Khan controversy, which marked the low point for Trump in the general election. Clinton will emphasize her experience in office, however dubious. She may even recycle her running mate’s line that when she took office as Secretary of State, Osama bin Laden was still alive — to which Trump should answer: yes, and so were Ambassador Chris Stevens, Sean Smith, Glen Doherty, and Tyrone Woods. In addition to hammering her over Benghazi, and her lies to the bereaved families, Trump should borrow his own running mate’s tactics and remind Clinton of the failed Russian “reset,” the disaster in Iraq, and the awful Iran deal. He must also make a promise: though he may not have served in the military, he will never sleep when there are Americans in danger, and Americans risking their lives to save them. Joel B.

      "Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Scott Pruitt and Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Joel Pollak discussed President Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accords on Monday’s show.[“I think that what’s lost in the debate and discussion at times is the tools in the toolbox, if you will, that the EPA actually possesses or doesn’t possess to respond to the CO2 issue,” said Pruitt. , advertisement, He looked back to the legal battle between the state of Massachusetts and the EPA in 2007, which ended at the Supreme Court. He noted the outcome did not force the EPA to regulate CO2 but “simply said it had to make a decision on whether CO2 actually poses a risk to human health and the environment.”, “Following that was the endangerment finding in 2009, which eventually led to the Paris discussion and clean power plan, all the rulemaking and the climate action agenda of the previous administration,” he recalled. “What’s not discussed at all is, has Congress ever responded or acted upon this matter, this issue of CO2 with respect to power generation? I will tell you, they clearly have not.”, “If you go back to the clean air amendments from 1990, many of the folks, including Congressman Dingell, – a Democrat as you know – said that it would be a ‘glorious mess’ to endeavor to use the current framework to regulate CO2. The framework that we have is a framework that’s supposed to address local and regional air pollutants, not in my estimation, based upon those who amended the Clean Air Act in 1990, this phenomenon that people describe as the greenhouse gas effect,” he said. , “The only power that agencies have, executive agencies have, is the power given to them by Congress,” he stressed. “We can’t reimagine authority. We can’t make up authority. This Supreme Court has been very, very consistent at sending that message through court decisions over the last several years.”, Pollak built on Pruitt’s point to argue there is a profound difference between the Environmental Protection Agency’s original mandate to combat pollution and “what it’s being asked to do by the left, which is to regulate fossil fuel use, and energy use, and energy efficiency around CO2.”, Pruitt agreed it was important to emphasize the distinction between pollutants and carbon dioxide, a naturally occurring component of the earth’s atmosphere. “The American people deserve this debate. They deserve this discussion because it is an orthodoxy,” he declared. “It’s been an orthodoxy for the last several years, and you have rightly stated it.”, He criticized those, such as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who imply that withdrawal from the Paris climate accord will strip the EPA of its authority to regulate genuine pollutants, with disastrous health consequences. “What they’re referring to is pollutants that we regulate under the National Ambient Air Quality Standards Program, criteria pollutants: SOx and NOx, and particulate matter, and ozone, and other types of things that they then commingle the CO2 discussion with, and that’s where they come up with these types of statements – which is not very transparent for the American people,” Pruitt explained. “What the American people deserve is a true, legitimate, peer-reviewed, objective, transparent discussion about CO2,” he said. “There was a great article that was in the Wall Street Journal about a month or so ago called ‘Red Team, Blue Team’ by Steve Koonin, a scientist, I believe, at NYU. He talked about the importance of having a Red Team of scientists and a Blue Team of scientists, and those scientists get into a room and ask, ‘What do we know? What don’t we know? What risk does it pose to health in the United States and the world, with respect to this issue of CO2?’”, “The American people need to have that type of honest, open discussion, and it’s something that we hope to help provide as part of our leadership,” said Pruitt. Pollak praised Pruitt for explaining in a press conference that allegedly harmless, non-binding, non-ratified agreements like the Paris accord can be used by activists to trigger provisions in American laws such as the Clean Air Act that would force the EPA to issue new regulations – in effect, creating a foreign legal regime with power beyond the U.S. Constitution. Pruitt added that another often-overlooked point in the argument about the Paris accord is that President Obama did not submit it to the Senate for ratification as a treaty, an inexcusable omission given its far-reaching effects and the fact that Congress had duly ratified other international agreements Obama submitted. “It was discussed at the time that the ‘agreement’ was signed by the previous administration as an executive agreement. As you know, the previous administration walked up to the precipice, if you will, what they perceived as the precipice with respect to agreeing to certain types of targets and obligations of reporting and the rest – and trying to stop at the precipice and say, ‘Well, we didn’t go far enough to trigger treaty obligations,’” he said. Pruitt denounced that approach as “really unfair to the American people.”, “If you’re going to agree to targets in Paris – if you’re going to say, ‘We’re going to reduce our GHG, greenhouse gas emissions, by 26 to 28 percent’ – the people of America deserve a voice in that process,” he insisted. , “They need to make sure that if it’s going to contract the economy, it’s going to raise electricity rates – as is already happening, by the way, if you compare our price per kilowatt versus Europe largely or Germany particularly I think we’re at seven or so cents per kilowatt, far better than those in Europe and Germany particularly,” he noted. , “The American people deserve a voice in that process, which is what the Founders put into the construct of the Constitution. If it’s going to have an enforceable, obligatory type of response, the citizen’s voice needs to be heard through ratification of these international agreements,” Pruitt said. “What also is not talked about is the exposure domestically, through Section 115 of the Clean Air Act, because Section 115 of the Clean Air Act actually talks about international agreements,” he continued. “The precursor to enforceability around those international agreements under Section 115 is reciprocity with other nations across the globe. At Paris, that’s what we agreed to with China and India and all of those 190-plus nations. We agreed to reporting requirements. We agreed to take certain steps to engage in reciprocal types of obligations.” , “As such, that reciprocity is evident and could trigger lawsuits by environmental groups here, the environmental left suing the EPA and the United States government and saying, ‘Hey, we agreed to 26 percent and 28 percent targets in this international agreement. Why aren’t you taking steps to meet those targets?’ and then to compel action,” he cautioned. Pruitt said this is where “most of the rulemaking has occurred at the EPA over the last several years – not through general due-course administrative procedure act types of rulemaking, but consent decrees and third parties suing the EPA to compel certain action.” , “Regulation through litigation, if you will, which, I think, is an abuse of executive authority, an abuse of the rulemaking process,” he said. “That’s something that was absolutely key to this decision, is to mitigate and eliminate the exposure to those targets that were set by the previous administration.”, Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern. \n",
      "A Freedom of Information Act request from Judicial Watch revealed that in April 2015, soldiers of the 67th Signal Battalion based in Fort Gordon, Georgia, were forced to attend a “white privilege” briefing, designed to coach them on how they have systemic privilege for being straight, white men.[In the PowerPoint presentation, the troops were instructed that “race privilege gives whites little reason to pay a lot of attention to African Americans,” primarily because of the invisible “powerful forces” that conspire to keep hard working black Americans down and stop them from being valued by the rest of society. According to the presentation, it is in fact white privilege alone that creates a “yawning divide” in income and general prosperity. advertisement, The presentation was structured around a hypothetical African woman who comes to America and discovers that the US is full of “white racism,” along with the fact that people are “organised according to race.” The presentation goes on to discuss how those who are apparently privileged by this racial system have to “make the problem of privilege their problem and do something about it.” The only thing missing from the presentation was a plea for donations and a Patreon link to end white privilege. This is not the first step that the Department of Defense have made into the realm of political indoctrination. Previously obtained training materials decry conservative organisations to be “hate groups” and warn troops not to be drawn into “extremist” talk of “individual liberties, states’ rights, and how to make the world a better place.” Only last month, the Pentagon ordered military commanders to prioritise climate change and “incorporate climate change impacts into plans and operations.”, Other government departments have been affected as well. Taking a page from SJW-filled college campuses, the State Department has begun a crack-down on “microagressions” in the workplace. Employees who commit one may risk violating harassment laws. John Robinson, the chief diversity officer of the department, explained that microagressions “are much harder to spot than overt discrimination” and “can be detrimental to employee morale and engagement.”, It is sad to see the inner workings of the government infected by the latest brand of liberal brainwashing, although not surprising. The culture of trigger warnings, white privilege, and microagressions that have started online have moved off Tumblr and college campuses and into the real world recently. Only two months ago, the Canadian government set up an entire hotline for people who were triggered whilst reading their website.

      "In a meeting with Amber Rudd, the British Home Secretary, tech companies including Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Microsoft promised to crack down on terrorist content being accessible on the internet after the Westminster attacker, Khalid Massood, reportedly found tips as to how to orchestrate such an attack online.[Rudd called the meeting between the tech giants, along with a group of smaller companies who the government refused to name. In an email statement, Rudd said that “we focused on the issue of access to terrorist propaganda online and the very real and evolving threat it poses.” After the, advertisement, After the meeting, the companies set out a range of ideas as to how to tackle terrorist threats. They promised to create new “technical tools to identify and remove terrorist propaganda,” along with looking at “all options for structuring a forum to accelerate and strengthen” their work to tackle online extremism.” In regards to the smaller companies that were at the meeting, the bigger corporations assured the government that they would “enhance and broaden the current informal collaboration sessions that companies already conduct,” sharing “expertise and experiences of more established” internet companies with younger internet businesses. “Working against terrorism is not a competitive issue within the industry,” the statement highlighted. “We pledge to engage the wider ecosystem of companies that face these challenges.”, In regards to the smaller companies that were at the meeting, the bigger corporations assured the government that they would “enhance and broaden the current informal collaboration sessions that companies already conduct,” sharing “expertise and experiences of more established” internet companies with younger internet businesses. “Working against terrorism is not a competitive issue within the industry,” the statement highlighted. “We pledge to engage the wider ecosystem of companies that face these challenges.”, It’s not just tech companies that would be involved in the fight, however. The statement pointed out that the groups together would “support the efforts of civil society organisations to promote alternative and counter-narratives” against extremism online:, Our companies are committed to making our platforms a hostile space for those who seek to do harm, and we have been working on this issue for several years. We share the government’s commitment to ensuring terrorists do not have a voice online. The Home Secretary seemed rather pleased with the progress that they had made in the meeting but highlighted that there was still work to be done:, I said I wanted to see this tackled head-on and I welcome the commitment from the key players to set up a cross-industry forum that will help to do this… My starting point is pretty straightforward. I don’t think that people who want to do us harm should be able to use the internet or social media to do so. I want to make sure we are doing everything we can to stop this. In taking forward this work I’d like to see the industry to go further and faster in not only removing online terrorist content but stopping it going up in the first place… I’d also like to see more support for smaller and emerging platforms to do this as well, so they can no longer be seen as an alternative shop floor by those who want to do us harm. It was revealed that the Home Secretary brought up the matter of encryption during the meeting, claiming that there would be no “safe spaces” for terrorists. This came after information came out that showed that Massood reportedly used Whatsapp only minutes before the attack commenced. Currently, the Facebook-owned messaging company has not handed over the information, despite claiming they would “co-operate fully” with the police. Rudd said in a statement, “I am clear that Government and industry need to work more closely together on this issue so that law enforcement and the intelligence agencies can get access to the data they need to keep us safe.” Her office said that the matter will be discussed more in separate talks.  , Jack Hadfield is a student at the University of Warwick and a regular contributor to Breitbart Tech.

As reported by Breitbart’s Katie McHugh, this statement angered many Cruz supporters:, “I think a campaign bears responsibility for creating an environment, when the candidate urges supporters to engage in physical violence — to punch people in the face.

You guys had it better here than you will over there.”, Superintendent Chris Funk learned of the incident after it was reported by the students, which prompted the district to place the unnamed teacher on administrative leave. “No question that some of our students who are undocumented are concerned about deportation and what’s going to happen to their families,” Funk said, according to the San Jose Mercury News. The Mercury News also notes that “[in] the aftermath of the election, the district has posted a letter on its homepage, saying that students deserve a secure environment to process the election results, and asking teachers to remain neutral, share information, listen to both sides of any issue and create a safe space in class and school for discussion.”, Breitbart Senior Editor-at-Large Joel B.

      "Donald Trump’s next head of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) could be his most inspired and devastatingly effective pick yet. The name of this dark horse candidate is Don van der Vaart and if reports that he is being considered are true, then he may go down in history as the first EPA administrator who actually has a clue what he is doing.[No, really. advertisement, Since Richard Nixon founded the EPA in 1970 – presumably as a cynical bid to greenwash his tarnished image at the height of the last eco-craze – the organisation has been run by a string of useless placemen and placewomen, who’ve done little that actually helps the environment, but plenty to burden the economy, consumers and business alike with more pointless regulation. Typical of these was its first Administrator William Ruckelshaus. A lawyer, by training, not a scientist, Ruckelshaus was the man responsible for instituting the America-wide ban on DDT. He did this on no scientific basis whatsoever. In fact, Judge Edmund Sweeney had presided over a seven-month EPA hearing, examining more than 9,000 pages of expert testimony, and concluded:, DDT is not a carcinogenic hazard to man…DDT is not a mutagenic or teratogenic hazard to man…The use of DDT under the regulations involved here do not have a deleterious effect on freshwater fish, estuarine organisms, wild birds or other wildlife. Ruckelshaus, who had not attended the hearings or read the report, overruled him. Which probably made not much difference in the United States. But the knock-on effects of the near worldwide ban that followed meant that DDT could no longer be used to control mosquito populations, which in turn led to an explosion in malaria, causing the death of millions. Subsequently Ruckelshaus has distinguished himself by endorsing Barack Obama for U.S. president in 2008 and most recently, by heading the Washington Blue Ribbon Panel on Ocean Acidification. [Ocean Acidification, of course, being yet another scientifically dubious scare story designed mainly to prop up the lucrative global anti-carbon-dioxide industry], Mind you, compared to some of the idiots who’ve taken the job of EPA Administrator since, Ruckelshaus must rate as a veritable Einstein. Probably the worst were Obama’s appointments. First, was Lisa Jackson who had previously had a disastrous stint as commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. Here is what former colleagues had to say in a report on her performance:, “DEP employees describe Ms Jackson as employing a highly politicized approach to decision-making that resulted in suppression of scientific information, issuance of gag orders and threats against professional staff members who dared to voice concerns.”, An ideal choice, then, by Obama to run the most powerful environmental regulatory agency in the U.S. with 17,000 employees under her. Jackson’s reign of terror at the EPA – in which she lived up to her early promise by helping to cripple the U.S. coal industry, delay Keystone Pipeline and have a harmless trace gas (carbon dioxide) re-branded an environmental hazard – only came to an end after it scandal in which she was found to have been using an illegal separate email account – Richard Windsor – in order to elude Freedom of Information regulations. After Jackson, came Gina McCarthy another green zealot – chosen for her political correctness and passionate belief in climate change rather than her scientific expertise. On her watch, the water at Flint, Michigan was contaminated with lead, an EPA senior official (whom McCarthy had supervised) was charged with stealing nearly $900,000 of government funds, and the disastrous, expensive, ineffective, pointless Clean Power Plan. As should be obvious by now, President-elect Donald Trump sorely needs a new broom capable of sweeping away the Augean mess at this misbegotten institution, which is funded by the US taxpayer to the tune of $8.2 billion a year, but has been estimated to cost the US economy another $350 billion a year in terms of regulatory burden. Don van der Vaart, currently Secretary of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, is just the man to do it. For a start he has an actual science PhD (in chemical engineering) – something, astonishingly, none of previous incumbents at the EPA have ever earned. Another plus is that the Watermelons – green on the outside, red on the inside – of Big Eco absolutely loathe him. Van der Vaart’s outspoken skepticism about the potential of wind energy and solar power troubles many environmental leaders in the state. They say the secretary is anything but balanced when it comes to weighing the risks and rewards of alternative energy sources. “The comments sound as if they had been prepared by a right-wing think tank,” said Molly Diggins, director of the Sierra Club’s North Carolina operations. “It’s remarkable that the comments have nothing but praise not only for natural gas but for fracking itself, with no stated downside.”, “What it really is protecting the environment while we keep energy affordable,” van der Vaart said during a recent interview. “Because energy prices are absolutely fundamental for developing good paying jobs and as a weapon against poverty. “Too often that’s lost in the shuffle. There’s obviously a lot of excitement about these new energy sources. But ultimately, it’s absolutely imperative that especially our lower-income folks don’t continue to lose so much of their expendable income on their energy costs.”\n",

      "An internal email released by Berkeley to its faculty asked for help in support of Berkeley’s undocumented student community in the face of “a tense campus climate” and “a dramatic rise in students needing emergency counselling” as a result of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.[The email, sent in October by the Undocumented Students Task Force, falsely accused the Berkeley College Republicans of executing a Project Veritas stunt on campus, and calls the conservative group “mean-spirited”, asserting that they had clearly intended to “psychologically harm and frighten undocumented members of our campus community” by chanting “Build a wall!”, advertisement, The College Republicans corrected the record quickly following the stunt, releasing a statement reading, “The Berkeley College Republicans had no involvement whatsoever in this demonstration and yet are suffering undue blame… [the press] has given our club members an unjustified characterization.”, Project Veritas has engaged in activism over the past few months designed to draw attention to the coddled state of American higher education. They recently introduced “Emotional First Aid Kits” on campuses, successfully tricking a number of social justice warriors into endorsing the packs, which include “genderless comfort blankets” and earplugs to avoid politically incorrect speech. However, despite the public knowledge that the incident was not associated with the College Republicans, the email uses falsely alleged College Republican involvement as the premise to establish a need for Berkeley staff and administrators to understand the “many structural obstacles our undocumented students have had to overcome” and to combat anti-undocumented immigrant rhetoric by giving undocumented students additional support and attention. “It is already hard enough for [undocumented students] to figure out how to pay for their tuition without any significant access to financial aid,” the email reads, but as Troy Worden of the Berkeley College Republicans points out, “the professors of the University of California do not understand the struggles middle-class Americans such as myself have in securing financial aid they only want to see us as hateful anti-immigrant agitators.”, The email urges faculty members to follow outlined strategies for communicating with undocumented students that include but are not limited to posting a message of support for undocumented students on social media, affirming an undocumented student’s sense of frustration, and to smile at undocumented students because “a smile goes a long way.”, The email was only secured by Berkeley College Republicans in November, as it was distributed by the Berkeley administration to its faculty privately in an effort, the College Republicans say, to create a more negative atmosphere for conservatives on campus behind closed doors. “Over the course of this election year the Berkeley College Republicans have received neither sympathy nor protection from the administration and faculty of our university. Our members have been physically assaulted and our private property has been destroyed, but Berkeley has never once issued a statement calling for the toleration of our political views,” says Worden, in reference to an incident in September in which angry protesters ripped up a Trump cut out and assaulted a College Republican while recruiting members on campus.

Rai also states that Trump’s engagement on social media this year has overtaken that of Barack Obama’s in 2008 by 25%. “Granularity of data will determine progressively lesser bias despite the weightage of negative or positive conversations,” explained Rai, adding, “While most algorithms suffer from programmers/developer’s biases, MogIA aims at learning from her environment, developing her own rules at the policy layer and develop expert systems without discarding any data.”, Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

It’s the only way.”, Duterte has been threatening to cozy up to communist Chinese President Xi Jinping and the rogue Putin regime in Russia for some time now. Relations between longtime allies, the Philippines and the United States, have been deteriorating since Duterte began carrying out extrajudicial killings of thousands of drug suspects, a move that the administration of President Barack Obama and other Western governments have denounced. The Philippine leader has profanely reacted to President Obama’s criticism of his war on drugs, calling his American counterpart a “son of a whore” on multiple occasions. “Duterte said he has intentionally used foul language — including calling Obama a ‘son of a bitch’ — because Mr. Obama has trivialized the Philippines’ drug problem when there are already around 4 million Filipinos addicted to drugs,” notes the Associated Press (AP). “The country has a population of more than 103 million.”, In his recent statement, Duterte noted that he may follow in Russia’s footsteps and withdraw from the International Criminal Court (ICC), where he could be charged for the extrajudicial executions by his administration. He also denounced the UN as inutile in stopping wars. Like Russia, Duterte said he might withdraw from the ICC “because we the small ones are the only ones being beaten up,” but nothing has been done for the thousands of children and women dying in bombings in Iraq and Syria. Moreover, the Filipino leader blasted the global agreement against climate change, noting that there are no repercussions for violations and it is still not clear which industrialized nations will contribute money to support developing countries’ efforts against global warming. “Human rights advocates have criticized Duterte’s anti-drug campaign that has left more than 4,000 suspected addicts and pushers dead since July,” notes AP. “They said the killings can be a basis to charge him for crimes against humanity before the Netherlands-based court.”\n",

However, King pointed at anger and demonstrations against Trump, according to the Post:, King, in his remarks at the shooting scene, said it was impossible to separate the hyperpartisan climate in Washington — especially people protesting Trump — with Republican members of Congress being fired upon at a baseball practice. “The divisions within the country, people that can’t accept the results of the election that are determined to try to take this country down, take this organization down,” he said. “This city was filled up with demonstrations the day after the inauguration, where you couldn’t drive down the streets.

The shooting occurred early Wednesday morning at a park where Republican congressmen and their aides were practicing for an annual baseball charity game played against Democratic colleagues. Democrats were also practicing at the time, but in D.C. An FBI official told reporters at the scene that it was “too early to tell” if the GOP congressmen were targeted or not.

      "Climate change is the biggest scam in the history of the world – a $1.5 trillion-a-year conspiracy against the taxpayer, every cent, penny and centime of which ends in the pockets of the wrong kind of people, none of which goes towards a cause remotely worth funding, all of it a complete and utter waste.[Here is an edited version of a speech on this subject I gave last week to the World Taxpayers’ Associations in Berlin. Good evening ladies and gentlemen Guten Abend meine Damen und Herren. May I say how grateful I am to Staffan Wennberg and the World Taxpayers Associations for inviting me to speak in Berlin. This is my first time here since 1978. I was a schoolboy then. I learned my first German: “Was trinken wir? Schultheiss Bier.” Now I’m grown up and married with children even older than I was then. Yesterday I went on a tour and I couldn’t help noticing there seem to have been one or two changes. When I last came I have to confess that the Wall was the highlight of my trip. So echt Cold War. So Spy Who Came In From The Cold!, I remember taking the U-bahn underneath the wall, passing through the East German side, and seeing empty grey platforms where the train never stopped, and lurking in the shadows grim looking guards with machine guns. And you know how they say: “If you’re not a communist by the time you’re 18 then you’re heartless and if you’re not a capitalist by the time you’re 40 then you’re brainless.”?, Well I’m afraid I skipped that first stage and went straight to the second. All it took was that little glimpse of East Germany – a place so horrible that if you tried to escape they would shoot you with machine guns – to give me an abiding preference for free markets. Small Government. And low taxes. Low taxes. To many of us here, I suspect, it seems so obvious why low taxes are a desirable thing. We know, as Bastiat says: “The State is that great fiction by which everyone tries to live at the expense of everyone else.”, We’ve seen the performance of low-tax economies like Singapore and Hong Kong and compared it to the performance over the years of high-tax economies like Cuba, North Korea or France. And drawn the obvious conclusions. It’s obvious to us. The evidence supports it. Why isn’t it obvious to the rest of the world?, Well one of the big problems I think is that over the years taxation has acquired a moral dimension it never had originally. When bad King John sent his tax collectors round 13th century England, everyone knew it was to fund his unpopular wars with France. No one said as they handed over their hard-earned groats:”Well at least it’s going to make a better society.”, But today you hear it a lot. You hear people say things like “I don’t mind paying a bit extra in tax if it gives us a better health service.”, Celebrities who try to reduce their taxes in complicated offshore schemes are pilloried in the newspaper. Companies like Google, Starbucks and Amazon which avoid paying taxes find themselves boycotted and the subject of angry campaigns on Twitter. There’s an idea abroad that if you don’t pay your taxes you’re not being clever and canny – as you would have been considered in John’s day. Rather you’re shirking your moral duty to create a better world. Well I disagree with this. I couldn’t disagree with it more strongly. I believe that far from being a moral force for good, taxes are – almost invariably – a force for greed, corruption, profligacy and waste. As PJ O’Rourke once noted:, “Giving money and power to government is like giving whiskey and car keys to teenage boys.”, Nowhere is this truer in the field of the environment which, I sincerely believe – and I’ve been doing a lot of research into this – must count among the biggest wastes of tax money in the history of the world. Last year Climate Change Business Journal – calculated that the total annual spend on the climate change industry is $1.5 trillion a year. All those carbon traders, climate researchers, renewables and biofuels experts, environment correspondents, professors of climate science at the University of East Anglia and the Potsdam Institute, sustainability officers on local councils, and so on, add up the cost of their grants and salaries – and $1.5 trillion per year is the ballpark figure you reach. So what does $1.5 trillion look like in a global economic context?, Well, it’s roughly the amount we spend every year on the online shopping industry. $1.5 trillion on the global warming industry $1.5 trillion on the online shopping industry. But there’s a key difference between these two industries. One exists to provide buyers and sellers what they want – to their mutual benefit the other is a sham. Buying stuff on the internet: it’s really useful, isn’t it? It has had a dramatically transforming effect on our quality of life, the way you can order a book at 11 o’clock on a Sunday night and have it appear on your doorstep the very next day. But how did this marvellous industry spring up? Was it because of all the special incentives and tax breaks granted by wise governments? Nope of course not. They weren’t necessary. The online shopping industry sprung up and grew and grew because it was what people wanted, where they chose – of their own volition – to spend their money. Now compare and contrast the global warming industry – which I call a Potemkin industry – because that’s what it is: a fraud a sham a conspiracy against the taxpayer. Do you want to have a guess how much that industry would be worth if it weren’t for all the money funnelled into it via government grants and taxpayer levies and subsidies and regulatory capture?, Pretty close to zero, I’d say. Take wind farms – my hobby horse. The cost of intermittent, unreliable wind energy is roughly twice the market rate for onshore wind three times the market rate for onshore. Nobody’s going to pay that kind of money in the open market. The only way it’s going to happen if people are mandated by the government to do so: which is what of course has happened across Europe and in the US. Warren Buffett has said it: “wind farms don’t make sense without the tax credit.”, They’re inefficient they kill birds and bats they spoil views they’re environmentally unfriendly – rare earth minerals from China they’re hazardous they’re expensive they’re ugly (well I think they are….), And in few countries is the damage these monstrosities have done more obvious than in Germany, home of the hateful Energiewende. Energiewende means Energy Transition. It has been a disaster, as Rupert Darwall noted in a recent Telegraph article. In 2004, the Green energy minister, Jürgen Trittin, claimed that the extra cost of renewable energy on monthly bills was equivalent to the cost of a scoop of ice cream. Nine years later, CDU minister Peter Altmaier said Energiewende could cost around €1 trillion by the end of the 2030s. The cost of feed-in tariffs and other subsidies is currently €21.8bn a year €20bn is being spent on a new north-south high voltage line and investment in other grid infrastructure is likely to double that number. They cause real people real misery. In 2013, 345,000 German households could not pay their electricity bills because Energiewende had made them so expensive. That’s the financial damage they’ve caused. What about the environmental damage? Here we are in Germany, the Greenest nation on earth. Aren’t Greens supposed to care about animals? Well they don’t about bats, clearly. Bats are special. The reason they’re so heavily protected by so many laws is that they are a K-selected species. That is, they reproduce very slowly, live a long time and are easy to wipe out. Having evolved with few predators – flying at night helps – bats did very well with this strategy until the modern world. But now we have all those eco-friendly wind turbines. Or as I call them bird-slicing, bat-chomping eco-crucifixes. A recent study in Germany by the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research showed that bats killed by German turbines may have come from places 1000 or more miles away. This would suggest that German turbines – which one study claims kill more than 200,000 bats a year – may be depressing populations across the entire northeastern portion of Europe. Why would anyone put up such things. One reason and one reason only: follow the money. Where does the money come from? Us!, Who made the decision to spend that money? Not us. Oh definitely not us. Had it been us we might have done a bit of basic due diligence. Like, OK, so these wind turbines are necessary you say to save the planet from the threat of catastrophic and unprecedented man-made global warming?, Correct. So has the planet ever been as warm in human history as it is today?, Well, only in the Minoan warming period and the Roman warming period and the Medieval warming period. Just those. Right. And presumably back then all that CO2 heavy industry was burning was a real problem? No just kidding…Out of interest how much has the planet warmed in the last few years?, About 0.8 degrees C since 1850. Right so since the end of the Little Ice Age (so called because it was characterised by unpleasant cold) and years like the infamous Year Without A Summer (1816), the planet has heated by less than the temperature increase you’d get on a spring day between say breakfast and mid-morning coffee time?, Ah yes but the computer models…, Indeed the computer models. Those amazing models which have been predicting catastrophic, runaway warming, when there has been no significant warming since 1998 – so for eighteen years there has been no global warming?, Ah yes but the temperatures of February 2016…. Look I could go on like this forever. I’ve been listening to these increasingly desperate excuses for decades. Perhaps some of you here believe them – if so, there’s a bridge I’d like to sell you…, But it really doesn’t matter whether you believe in global warming or not because here’s the reality:, All that money we’re being to spend on the global warming industry – that $1.5 trillion I mentioned earlier siphoned straight out of taxpayers’ pockets – it isn’t going to make the blindest bit of difference. No, I exaggerate. It will make a teeny weeny bit of difference. Bjorn Lomborg has done the calculations. You’re going to love this, if you haven’t heard this before. These figures are just amazing. So recently you’ll recall there was a big UN climate conference in Paris COP 21 and all the leaders of the world flew in to save the planet from global warming. But before they turned up, each delegate nation made a voluntary agreement as to how much it was going to cut its carbon emissions. Not compulsory, note. So these countries are free at any stage to abandon their carbon reduction targets – as funnily enough South Korea did last week. This is how much – best case scenario – that various countries are prepared to do to combat climate change. So Lomborg added up all the countries INDCs – that stands for Intended Nationally Determined Contributions – and worked out, using the climate alarmists’ own models, what effect all this would have on global temperature. Do you want to know how much? (Oh this is the optimistic scenario by the way, not the pessimistic one). If all the countries do their bit then the total reduction in global warming – by the year 2100 will be 0.170 degrees Centigrade. As a climate sceptic friend of mine pointed out at the time, you’d experience a bigger temperature increase than that just walking down from the top to the bottom of the Eiffel tower. So there’s your deal folks: you – and taxpayers like you – are paying $1.5 trillion a year to reduce the world’s temperatures by the end of this century by 0.170. It’s so perfectly ridiculous it’s almost funny. And I suppose on a personal level I shouldn’t complain. I call climate change “the gift that goes on giving” because day in day out I get an endless stream of stories to write about the corruption, incompetence, skullduggery of the climate alarmism industry. But, putting my career aside for the moment, is this really a world we’d like to live in? Can it be right that people who have worked hard for their money should have it taken from them and then wasted in so spectacular fashion?, And it’s not just the waste that’s so bad it’s worse than that. If it were simply a form of taxpayer-funded welfare scheme for otherwise unemployable environmental sciences graduates that would be one thing. But this is causing real, lasting harm in any number of ways. The corrupting effects on science – and the scientific method – which at times are almost redolent of Lysenkoism of the Stalin era. The brainwashing of schoolchildren such as you might have found with the Young Pioneers. The economic damage caused by the misallocation of resources, as so frequently happens in Communist countries, The pollution caused by diesel (introduced, on EU recommendation, because it’s supposedly more CO2-friendly) which calls to mind Chernobyl or the poisoning of the Aral Sea. The human suffering of those 345,000 German households I mentioned who can’t pay their electricity bills. Does this authoritarianism and corruption and incompetence remind you of anything?, Well it has often been said – and there is much anecdotal evidence to support this – that after the Berlin Wall came down the left had a bit of a problem. Capitalism had won the economic argument. Where could the left go next?, But the solution was there waiting them – the green movement. In the guise of saving the world’s environment they could advance all their usual obsessions – control, regulation, state intervention, puritanism, compulsory immiseration – though this time with a smiling, fluffy face. Watermelons they call them: green on the outside, red on the inside. So the Berlin Wall came down but it never really went away. And sometimes I look at the world and what has been happening with the rise and rise of green lunacy and I ask myself: did the right side really win the Cold War or is it just an illusion?,  \n",
      "TEL AVIV – During a radio interview broadcast on Sunday, comic legend Jackie Mason, who refers to himself as the “Ultimate Jew,” slammed Sen. Bernie Sanders as a “schmuck” for repeatedly criticizing the Jewish state.[Mason contended that Sanders’ numerous attacks on Israel stem from what Mason claimed was the politician’s self-consciousness at being Jewish. advertisement, Mason was speaking during his regular segment on “Aaron Klein Investigative Radio,” the popular weekend talk radio program broadcast on New York’s AM 970 The Answer and NewsTalk 990 AM in Philadelphia. Klein doubles as Breitbart’s senior investigative reporter and Jerusalem bureau chief. Sanders has repeatedly stated that Israel’s actions during the 2014 Israel-Gaza War were “disproportionate.”  He also vastly inflated the numbers of civilian deaths during the conflict, surpassing even Hamas’s fraudulent nubers, and wrongly claimed that Israel bombed “hospitals” during the war. “This is the phoniest, lowest kind of a thing anybody ever said,” Mason told Klein in response. Continued Mason:, Here’s a Jew from Brooklyn who never even saw a gentile till he was 28. Obviously, this man has a very, very big sickness. There’s something about being Jewish that makes him self-conscious and nervous. And he has to prove to himself and to the country that he doesn’t favor Israel in any way. He’s so determined that he’ll tell any lie about Israel that he can think of to say to you: ‘Do you see that? This is proof that I don’t pay for Israel. The fact that I want every Israeli to drop dead for me to prove a point doesn’t matter. If they all get wiped out, it’s not my business.  The main thing is that I’m not favoring Israel.’, Mason labeled Sanders a “schmuck,” and jested that the politician would love Israel if only the country ceased to exist while fighting climate change. A schmuck like Bernie Sanders pops out who doesn’t even know what’s going on and doesn’t care. Because to him Israel getting wiped out is no problem. Climate change is the only problem. To him, the most important thing in the world is climate change. If Israel gave up their country but they fought for climate change, he would love Israel. In ten minutes, they would be his favourite country. Responding specifically to Sanders’ statements about the “disproportionate” use of force in Gaza, Mason stated:,  If they were bombing his house every day, would he say, ‘Don’t do anything to them? Don’t disturb them. …So what if they are bombing my house? That doesn’t mean that I should start hurting them’…, Could you picture him saying don’t disturb them if their only purpose is to keep bombing your house until they destroy you and your whole family?  And they never stop. Does that mean that you should do anything about it? Try to control yourself. Don’t be disproportionate. Don’t bomb them back. Call them names. Make an announcement that you resent it. Klein himself previously responded to Sanders’ “disproportionate” criticism against Israel. Klein wrote at Breitbart:, First, let’s not forget why the Gaza War was launched in the first place. Hamas repeatedly violated a truce by firing scores of rockets from Gaza into Israeli civilian population zones. In one day alone, July 8, Hamas launched 40 rockets into Israel, prompting Israeli retaliation and the start of the conflict. What nation on earth would allow a terrorist army to amass a rocket infrastructure in a neighboring territory and use that land – which Israel evacuated in hope of peace – as a staging ground for constant terrorist rocket attacks?, And by calling Israel’s self-defense “disproportionate,” what exactly is Sanders advocating? That instead of acting to minimize the terrorist threat against its civilians, Israel should respond to every act of Palestinian terrorism with an equivalent act? So if Hamas fires a rocket into a Jewish city, Israel should therefore respond by indiscriminately launching a terror rocket into a Palestinian city with the intent of killing civilians? That the next time a Palestinian stabs an Israeli, the Jewish state should send one of its own into Ramallah to stab a Palestinian civilian?, Sanders’s statement is preposterous, nonsensical, and negates Israel’s ability to defend itself and degrade Hamas’s terrorist infrastructure.\n",
      "The Department of Defense is searching for biodegradable ammunition in an effort to clean up the hundreds of thousands of training rounds that are discarded by the US military. [A huge number of rounds are expended at military training fields across the country, ranging from “low velocity 40mm grenades 60mm, 81mm, and 120mm mortars shoulder launched munitions 120mm tank rounds and 155mm artillery rounds.” These rounds can take up to hundreds of years to biodegrade and collecting them from training sites has proven to be a labour intensive task. However, leaving them where they fall can lead to pollution of the soil and contamination of water supplies. , advertisement, The Department of Defense is calling for proposals through the Small Business Innovation Research program to find a more environmentally friendly alternative to current ammunition. The DoD believes that the best option would be a casing made of a naturally biodegradable substance that could potentially carry seeds inside that would replenish the land damaged by military training. , The seeds will be designed not to germinate until several months after being discharged from empty rounds. Plants will then sprout from the ammunition that will actively remove soil contaminants and break down other biodegradable components. The DoD also stated that the ability for the plants to be edible by local wildlife was extremely important. , Applications to pitch solutions for the issue are open until February 8th, with the ability to replace currently existing 40mm to 120mm rounds with biodegradable rounds that meet the performance requirements of existing rounds being the first task at hand. The contractor chosen to undertake the project is also expected to explore ways that biodegradable materials with integrated seeds can be utilised for purposes aside from defense.

      "MOST POPULAR[From Michael Auslin writing for the American Enterprise Institute:, advertisement, Just over a quarter of a century ago, the liberal West celebrated triumph in the Cold War. Its victory was underpinned by an evolving strategy of containment, détente, proxy battles and rollback that defeated the Communist bloc without unleashing nuclear war. After unimaginable bloodshed during the 20th century, the fall of the Berlin Wall signalled a triumphal note for the beginning of the next one. Today, less than a generation after the “end of history”, such hopes are all but forgotten, as the global order cracks under a combination of strains either long ignored or wilfully dismissed. The eight years of the Obama administration have seen only worsening risk and intensification of conflict around the globe. The pace of aggression continues to increase. Yet unlike the still familiar period of great power struggle against totalitarian ideologies during the 20th century, today’s threat to the liberal world comes from two different fronts: the seemingly permanent scourge of Islamist terrorism, and the rise of revanchist and revisionist major powers, such as Russia and China. The United States and its liberal partners have been challenged and found wanting, failing to eliminate or contain the threats. The next US president must do better, or run the risk that the next generation will be one of permanent global disorder. Superpowers have faced great trials before. But in this particularly complex environment, America and its next leader will have to accept the uncomfortable fact that they face a challenge not unlike that which plagued the Roman Empire for centuries.

Well, you — you know, you know as well as I do, it has to do with emails. But what is more important is that our campaign is generating an enormous amount of excitement and enthusiasm all over this country. We are bringing large numbers of people into the political process. Democrats win elections when large numbers of people come out and vote. That’s what Obama did in 2008. That’s what we can do right now. Republicans win elections when people are demoralized and voter turnout is low. So I think there is no question but that we have the excitement. Second of all, George, just look at some of the polls that are out there. Look at polls that come from battleground states in terms of Wisconsin, New Hampshire, Iowa.

      "The head of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Scott Pruitt, has called for America to “exit” the Paris Climate Agreement signed by Barack Obama last November.[In an interview with FOX and Friends, Pruitt said that “Paris [agreement] is something that we need to really look at closely. It’s something we need to exit in my opinion.”, advertisement, “It’s a bad deal for America,” he continued. “It was an America second, third, or fourth kind of approach. China and India had no obligations under the agreement until 2030. We front-loaded all of our costs.”, Pruitt’s comments increase the likelihood the U.S. will pull out of the agreement, which requires governments to present national plans to reduce emissions to limit global temperature rise, as well as regularly report on their progress. Pruitt has previously referred to the agreement as a “bad deal,” but has never openly called for America to quit. During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump was a prominent critic of the deal, promising to “cancel” it, and this week he refused to sign a statement endorsing the agreement. Although Trump could not instantly pull America out, he could initiate the process for the country’s exit. Since taking office, Trump has revoked a range of environmental legislation—including Barack Obama’s climate orders—with a plan to focus on energy independence and revitalize the coal industry. In his first White House budget, Trump also proposed a 31 percent cut to the EPA’s overall budget. However, reports in March suggested that members of Trump’s senior team were divided over pulling out of the deal, with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and his own daughter Ivanka advising him not to pull the plug over concerns it would upset major allies.

The group, however, is allegedly linked to the Hamas terror group, has supported Islamists funded by Iran’s Khomenist regime, and openly publishes the work of Paul Eisen, described as a Holocaust denier by left-wing papers such as The Guardian. The group’s founder and chair, Ismail Patel, was a supporter of the late French Holocaust denier Roger Garaudy has been pictured with Hamas leaders. At a 2009 rally, Mr Patel told the crowd: “Hamas is no terrorist organisation. The reason they hate Hamas is because they refuse to be subjugated, occupied by the Israeli state, and we salute Hamas for standing up to Israel […] to the state of Israel: you no longer represent the Jewish people.”, Hamas is a fundamentalist, anti-Semitic militant group widely classed as a terror organisation, most notably by Israel, the U.S. and the European Union (EU). There are also widely published claims that FOA has further links to Hamas via Patel’s work with the British Muslim Initiative (BMI), links to Khomenist Iran due to support for the Islamic Human Rights Commission, and links to the pro-Caliphate Islamists of the Muslim Brotherhood due to support for the charity Interpal. According to UK Media Watch:, “‘Friends of Al Aqsa’ is one of the more extremist Islamist organizations at work in Britain today. It supports the Muslim Brotherhood-linked charity “Interpal” (proscribed by the US Treasury) and advertises it on its website. “It collaborates with the Khomenist Iranian-funded faux human rights organization known as the Islamic Human Rights Commission in organizing events such as Al Quds day at which public support is expressed for the Iranian proxy militia Hizbollah.”, In line with these concerns, Jewish Human Rights Watch has written to the Queen Elizabeth II Centre, calling on them to “cancel the Jew hate event”, which they also say is linked to Hamas and claim could be in breach of the Equalities Act. .@QEIICentre CANCEL @FriendsofAlAqsa @PSCupdates #JewHateFestival @PalestineExpo https://t.co/ctS3UEFJGZ pic.twitter.com/5zwwkYUHwJ, — Jewish HR Watch (@jhrwatch) May 3, 2017, , The event is playing host to Tariq Ramadan, a famous Egyptian-Swiss Islamist philosopher who is the grandson of the Muslim Brotherhood founder Hasan al-Banna.

      "The month of April at Portland Community College will be dedicated to “Whiteness History Month,” which the school says is an “educational project” focusing on how the “construct of whiteness” promotes racial inequality.[“‘Whiteness History Month: Context, Consequences, and Change’ is a multidisciplinary, district-wide, educational project examining race and racism through an exploration of the construction of whiteness, its origins, and heritage,” Portland Community College said in an online statement that has since been scrubbed from the web. advertisement, “Scheduled for the month of April 2016, the project seeks to inspire innovative and practical solutions to community issues and social problems that stem from racism,” the online statement said, according to watch dog group Campus Reform. The month-long event was initiated by a Portland Community College subcommittee for Cascade Campus Diversity Council. The council found “evidence from hiring data, student-­led research, surveys, focus groups, college-wide emails, and other sources have illuminated the underlying reality of whiteness embedded in the overall college climate.”, The school will host lectures from guest speakers, panels, short films that promote diversity, art exhibits, and discussions. This is not the first time “whiteness” has caused controversy on a college campus. Last November, Arizona State University professor Lee Bebout announced that he would be teaching a course called U.S. Race Theory &amp the Problem of Whiteness.

      "Much to the chagrin of LBGTQ groups, the National Collegiate Athletic Association removed its boycott of North Carolina as a venue for hosting championship games.[Until Tuesday the NCAA remained quiet about whether or not it would allow NC to regain permission to host the games. , advertisement, The Tar Heel state lost its privilege as a destination for games in 2016 when it decreed under the law HB2 that all people, including transgenders, have to use bathrooms corresponding to their biological gender as indicated on their birth certificate. Many advocates for transgender rights believe the repeal of HB2, and replacing it with HB142, does not go far enough to protect the rights of transexuals. The new law essentially restores the status quo prior to HB2. However,  HB-142 prohibits government entities from creating laws that pertain to multiple-occupancy bathrooms, showers, and changing rooms unless it’s “in accordance with an act of the General Assembly.” The new law only applies until December 1, 2020. According to The Washington Times, the NCAA called HB142 “far from perfect,” but “meets the minimal NCAA requirements,” therefore allowing them to lift the boycott of championship games. “We are actively determining site selections, and this new law has minimally achieved a situation where we believe NCAA championships may be conducted in a nondiscriminatory environment,” the NCAA said in a statement. “If we find that our expectations of a discrimination-free environment are not met, we will not hesitate to take necessary action at any time.”, Pro-LGBT advocacy groups were not happy with the NCAA’s decision. “What a sell-out,” Lambda Legal tweeted, after hearing the news. “The NCAA’s decision to backtrack on their vow to protect LGBTQ players, employees and fans is deeply disappointing and puts people at risk.” , Chad Griffin, president of Human Rights Campaign responded, “After drawing a line in the sand and calling for repeal of HB2, the NCAA simply let North Carolina lawmakers off the hook.”, So far the NBA has not stated whether HB142 meets their minimum standards for holding all-star games in NC in the future. In February, the NBA relocated its All-Star Weekend, which was scheduled for Charlotte, and moved it to New Orleans as a protest to HB2.\n",
      "The media elites are somewhat right that the Brexit victory was about the UK voters’ disdain for globalization, immigration, and lost pride, but the real cause of the British asking for an EU divorce was the $46.6 billion in hard costs for intangible benefits.[Open Europe is a non-partisan think tank with offices in London and Brussels that produces an annual report measuring the cost burden of 40,000 EU-derived legal acts, 15,000 Court verdicts and 62,000 international standards on the United Kingdom. advertisement, Their 2015 report for the “Top 100” regulations estimated the financial burden on the UK economy at $46.6 billion. To put that drain on the economy in perspective, the top 100 EU regulations cost more than the $37.8 billion in local property taxes, called “Council Tax,” paid by British citizens to the UK Treasury last year. The top five costliest EU-derived regulations in force in the UK were:, 1) UK Renewable Energy Strategy cost: 6.6 billion a year2) Capital Requirement Directive IV on financial institutions: $5.9 billion a year3) Working Time Directive on labor standards: $5.9 billion a year4) EU Climate and Energy Package mandates: $4.8 billion a year and5) Temporary Agency Workers Directive on welfare: $3.0 billion a year, EU bureaucrats cleverly claim that the annual economic benefits to British citizens as members of the EU are $82 billion. But $65.2 billion of the so-called benefits stem from three unmeasurable and vastly over-stated items. As an example, the EU bureaucracy claims that the UK receives $29 billion in “value” for participating in a global pact to reduce carbon emissions. But that falsely assumes that the Paris United Nations Framework on Climate Control treaty was fully implemented by all 196 participating countries with immediate mandated curbs on emissions, increases in renewable energy, and/or reductions in deforestation that will achieve a global warming temperature reduction of 2.7 to 3.5 degrees centigrade. The final Paris agreement is only “voluntary” and exempts China and India, the worst polluters, for decades. The UK Parliament’s non-partisan “Impact Assessments” (IA) analysis of the EU’s regulations revealed that Prime Minister David Cameron’s Administration signed off on at least 26 of the top 100 EU-derived regulations, despite the IA explicitly stating that the financial costs outweighed the estimated benefits. According to Open Europe: “Another 31 of the most costly EU-derived regulations have still not been quantified. Between the over-stated benefits, the regulations that come with a net cost and the ones with quantified benefits, it remains unclear how many of these EU-derived rules actually come with a net benefit in reality.”, Although Open Europe’s analysis found the cost of membership in the EU far outdistanced the tangible benefits, the organization does believe there is substantial value in free trade between Britain and the other 27 EU members. Open Europe suggests that with the approval of the Brexit, the UK should work to negotiate a type of trading and cooperation relationship called the “Norway Option.”, After the Nordic country voted down a 1972 and a 1994 referendum to join the EU, Norway negotiated a semi-detached relationship with the EU through its membership of the European Economic Area. The EEA agreement allows free movement of persons, goods, services and capital within the internal market of the European Union. The only supposed “cost” if the UK negotiates a similar relationship is that British will not be able to vote on the onerous Rules written by EU bureaucrats and hated by a vast majority of the UK public.\n",

In a post election interview, Harris promised to “fight” Trump on issues such as immigration, health care, the environment and crime. Illinois – Tammy Duckworth (D) , Tammy Duckworth’s victory over the incumbent Republican senator Mark Kirk was one of the few pieces of good news for Democrats on November 8th. A double amputee and veteran of the Iraq war, Duckworth previously served as the Director of the Illinois Department of Veterans as well as the Assistant Secretary for Public and Intergovernmental Affairs in the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. Indiana – Todd Young (R), Former congressman Todd Young, who also served a decorated career in the Marine Corps, will replace the retired Dan Coats in Indiana. He has previously sponsored legislation such as the ‘Fairness for Families Act,’ which delayed the introduction of mandatory individual healthcare coverage, as well as the ‘Save American Workers Act,’ which sought to define a full time worker as someone working 40 hours a week, in order to prevent companies from reducing contract hours in order to avoid the healthcare mandate. New Hampshire – Maggie Hassan (D) , The former governor of New Hampshire, Maggie Hassan also defeated the incumbent Republican Kelly Ayotte by a narrow 1,067 votes. A staunch supporter of Planned Parenthood, Hassan has said her top priorities in the Senate will be protecting abortion law and tackling climate change. Maryland – Chris Van Hollen (D) , A former congressman and chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), Chris Van Hollen will now serve as Chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) for the 2018 election cycle, as well as now representing Maryland in the Senate.

Louisiana – John Neely Kennedy (R) , The incumbent state treasurer of Louisiana, John Neely Kennedy will vacate his role in order to serve Louisiana in the Senate. A former Democrat, his career has involved managing Louisiana’s economic policy and focusing on how the state can effectively save money. A supporter of Donald Trump, Kennedy received campaign support from the President-elect a day before his run off Senate race with Foster Campbell. Nevada – Catherine Cortez Masto (D) , Replacing former House Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid, former Nevada Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto will become the first Latina woman ever to serve in the Senate. Her campaign was vociferously supported by environmental and pro-choice groups, given her support for Planned Parenthood and investment in renewal energies.

      "GQ journalist Nathaniel Friedman, who goes by the pen name of Bethlehem Shoals, has apologized after tweeting that he would like to beat Pat Smith, the mother of Benghazi victim Sean Smith, to death.[“I don’t care how many children Pat Smith lost I would like to beat her to death,” he tweeted on Monday, eventually deleting the post after tremendous backlash. advertisement, “I’ve been advised to delete that tweet lest my account be suspended,” posted Shoals shortly after. “Done.”, Predictably, Shoals was not sanctioned by Twitter for the blatant violation of their terms of service, despite the company’s decision to permanently suspend Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos last night for offending Ghostbusters star Leslie Jones. “Last night, when Pat Smith was speaking onstage at the Republication National Convention, I tweeted that ‘no matter how many children she’s lost, I’d like to beat her to death.’ That’s what I said, and I accept full responsibility for my actions and their consequences,” said Shoals in an apology on Medium. Why did I do it? It certainly wasn’t intended as a literal threat on a woman’s life. If anything, it was an extremely ill-advised attempt at satirizing the overall climate of the RNC. But with that kind of hateful language, an explanation just turns into rationalization. I certainly didn’t help the situation by getting defensive and suggesting that Twitter, vile as it can be, is already a hotbed for this kind of discourse, or by arguing that my track record and reputation as a writer could provide any exculpatory context. Because what matters is that I said it. And I wish I could take it back. Under no circumstances is it okay to invoke violence against women. As outraged as I was by parts of Pat Smith’s speech, to use this kind of language as a means of expressing that feeling was completely out of bounds. I also completely understand how, regardless of my intent, it was extremely triggering for a lot of people. And for that I am genuinely sorry. I’ve also heard a lot this morning from people on the other side of the political spectrum. While I may disagree with these people on a number of matters, I know that what I wrote is utterly indefensible. The last thing this country needs is statements that make the climate even more toxic and divisive. I generally believe the world to be a messy, confusing place. But in this case, there’s no ambiguity about it: I fucked up and should have just owned that. I’ve learned my lesson and at this point all I can do is reiterate that I’m sorry and promise to do better in the future. Shoals has since locked his account, making his tweets “protected” from the public eye, and Twitter has apparently decided not to push any sanctions against him for his behavior.

      "East Hampton High has used the word “white” in its game cheers for decades, especially given the school’s blue and white colors. But now, the school’s principal has banned the word “white” from games, calling the word racist.[The manufactured controversy began over a week ago when a letter written by Principal John Fidler and circulated among students cited the “social climate” as his reason for considering the ban. advertisement, The absurd ban outraged students at the Connecticut school. One student noted on a recent Facebook post, “this stuff has me outraged they are trying to take a simple chant that our school has done for years and years. They are trying to make it about race.”, One of the chants in question, based on the school’s colors, goes: “We say blue, you say white! Blue! White! Blue! White!” and the senior class has shortened its portion to “White! White! White!”, Principal Fidler, though, said he felt the chant is all about race. “Given the current social climate across our country,” Fidler wrote, “our use of the ‘White’ cheer is under suspension. Please show your pride in our town and in our school through other means when cheering on our teams.”, School Superintendent Paul Smith rushed to defend Fidler’s decree, saying, “It’s kind of outgrown just being done in our gym and at pep rallies and there’s a time and a place where the cheer is appropriate and a time when it may appear insensitive.”, Many didn’t understand why the school colors chant all of a sudden became all about race, when it has nothing to do with race. East Hampton student Kylie O’Brien wondered, “It’s not really that big of a deal to me or to any of our sophomore class. I don’t understand why it’s a problem now.”, Local citizens weighed in as well. “Why should you change a chant or cheer that has been around for years and has no racial connotation just because a few people are too stupid to understand such simple context?” Blake Friel posted. “Why should the vast majority of people change the chants they know and love because of a few racist retards who can’t see anything past skin color? Those are the questions you should be asking.”, “When one or two people can change the course of thousands, that is what will doom this great country of ours,” Friel concluded.

      "Peter Hitchens explains the dangers of relying on scientific consensus on issues such as low fat diets in his Mail on Sunday column:[Whenever I see a ‘low-fat muffin’ in a coffee shop, I have to control an urge to pick it up, jump on it and shout rude words. I am myself an expert in getting fat, and know that this evil blob of sugar and starch is a rapid route to a bigger waistband. Fat doesn’t make you fat. Butter is good for you. So is cream. Skimmed milk is a futile punitive measure, not a foodstuff, a way of making ourselves needlessly miserable which has taken over the world on the basis of an illusion. This is because almost everything most people think about food, and almost everything shops tell them, is completely wrong. In an unending struggle to get this across, the National Obesity Forum last week made a renewed attack on these mistaken attitudes. Sugar, not fat, is the menace to our lives. And this has been known since 1972 when a brave scientist, John Yudkin, wrote a book – Pure, White And Deadly – showing it was so. He and his unfashionable message were buried in abuse. It may be that some in the sugar industry might have been involved. These days he would have been called a ‘fat-threat denier’, or something of the kind. He died in 1995, too soon to see his ideas rescued and taken seriously again. Even now, people are getting needlessly fat and dying of horrible diseases because the anti-fat (and pro-sugar) lobby still hasn’t been completely routed. It will be, but these things take time. I mention this not just because it’s true, but because it’s an example of how thoughtless worship of scientists gets us repeatedly into trouble. Doubters like me are told not to dare criticise the sacred men in white coats. But scientists disagree among themselves and are often wrong. In fact, science progresses by exploding dud theories of the past. And laymen are perfectly entitled to apply facts and logic to what these people say. The obvious argument against the skimmed-milk fanatics is that decades of this policy have left us with more fat people than ever. But we should not have had to wait so long. There is powerful evidence against many other things now accepted as true, and often very weak evidence for them. I’d name ‘antidepressant’ pills, ‘dyslexia’, ‘ADHD’ and ‘man-made climate change’. Those who criticise these things are angrily hushed, with righteous cries of ‘How dare you!’, and if they won’t shut up, they are punished – as was John Yudkin. Yet I believe in all these cases the critics will be proved right, as Professor Yudkin was. The miserable thing is that so much damage will be done while we wait for the truth to get the upper hand. Be less trusting of all fashionable ideas, is my advice. Gullibility and conformism never advanced civilisation by a single step. Read the rest of Peter Hitchens’ column here.\n",
      "The only Democrat to vote to confirm Attorney General Jeff Sessions told Breitbart News Thursday calls by Senate Minority Leaders Sen. Charles Schumer (D.-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi D.-Calif.) for Sessions to resign are premature.[“From my end, until I see the facts, anything and everything is premature until you see the facts–and that is what I am looking for,” said Sen.Joe Manchin (D.-W.V.), who said he had not spoken to Schumer about this issue. advertisement, The Washington Post and other media outlets reported that Sessions met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak twice during the 2016 election cycle, when the former Alabama senator was a senior adviser to candidate Donald Trump and his campaign. Manchin said as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, like Sessions at the time of his meetings, he met with Kislyak, but never by himself. “I met with the Russian ambassador with other senators with the Armed Services Committee,” he said. “As I recall, a lot of that was about NSAS and space and improving the working environment, because we are using Russian rock bets, so there are a lot of conversations with a lot of ambassadors–we all do.”, Because the Department of Justice should be above reproach, for the good of the country, the Attorney General should resign. — Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) March 2, 2017, , The senator said he told Sessions he has to play things straight. “I told Jeff, first of all you should recuse yourself because of the investigation into Mike Flynn and basically, it’s pretty clear that if you all have a relationship, you all worked on the campaign, just put some distance, OK?,” he said. Manchin said he does not sit on the House Judiciary Committee, so he did not hear all of Session’s full testimony. “You have to go where the facts go, if the facts go and Jeff intentionally misled–and that’s proven–or he intentionally lied?

      "The Trump administration will delay the implementation of a major Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) air pollution rule from the Obama administration.[The EPA announced the delay on the ozone pollution rule, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt notified governors this week. advertisement, “States have made tremendous progress and significant investment cleaning up the air. We will continue to work with states to ensure they are on a path to compliance,” Pruitt said in a statement. “We are committed to working with states and local officials to effectively implement the ozone standard in a manner that is supportive of air quality improvement efforts without interfering with local decisions or impeding economic growth,” he added. The EPA’s statement cited “increased regulatory burdens, restrictions on infrastructure investment, and increased cost to businesses.”, Pruitt stated that his decision to delay the air pollution rule relies on a stipulation in the Clean Air Act that would allow the agency to suspend rules up to a year if the agency has “insufficient information” to make compliance decisions. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, one of the leaders in the lawsuit challenging the rule, cheered Pruitt’s decision. Paxton said, “I am grateful for the leadership of EPA Administrator Pruitt in courageously pausing the costly and ineffective ozone rule, and I’m hopeful that the one year delay will provide time for the EPA to review the detrimental effects the ozone rule will have on the Texas economy.”, The 2015 Obama regulation set the allowable ozone level of pollution in the atmosphere to 70 parts per billion, down from the 75 parts per billion set in 2008. Obama’s EPA predicted that the rule would result in billions of dollars in economic benefits through improvements in public health. This attracted significant criticism. Industry officials argue that the rule would cost more than $1 trillion and questioned its potential health benefits. EPA chief Pruitt said that the agency will undertake a review of the rule in response to Republican states and industry suing the Obama-era EPA. Pruitt himself was part of the lawsuit when he was Oklahoma’s attorney general. Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ) applauded the EPA’s rule delay and said that the agency protects the environment, instead of the previous administration’s heavy-handed approach. Flake said, “It’s great to see the EPA working with Arizonans for a change. Nowhere are the flaws of previous administration’s one-size-fits-all approach to regulating ozone more evident than in Arizona, a desert state where naturally-occurring ozone makes it impossible to meet the new federal mandate. While today’s move buys Arizona much-needed time, I remain committed to advancing a solution that will provide permanent relief from this egregious and unworkable rule.”\n",
      "It was 85 degrees in downtown Los Angeles on Saturday, but thousands skipped a trip to the beach or the mountains and instead dragged themselves along a mile-long route to listen to a few celebrity pseudo-scientists and activists drone on about climate change.[The “March for Science” crowd brought along numerous signs, props, and costumes to walk through downtown L.A. toward City Hall and gathered for speeches by celebrity seismologist Lucy Jones and billionaire environmentalist activist Tom Steyer. But to some marchers the agenda for the march wasn’t entirely clear – except for being against President Donald Trump. advertisement, Asked why she was marching, Claudia Kries of San Pedro told the Los Angeles Times, “Why wouldn’t I be? I’ve been at every march since Trump got elected. It’s how I stay sane.”, While some marchers expressed their concern about climate change and how Trump is shifting U.S. policies both domestically and internationally, it’s apparent that many attendees are vehemently anti-Trump, and not just on environmental issues. Jeniffer Hernandez, a professor and immunologist at the Keck Graduate Institute School of Pharmacy in Claremont, said she felt attacked by Trump: because her parents are immigrants from Mexico, because of Trump’s comments about assaulting women and because her research lab is funded in part by federal grants. “I’m outraged. I’m upset,” she told the Times. “We need to be out here.”, She carried a sign, written partially in the colors of the Mexican flag, that read: “I’m a 1st generation Mexican-American scientist not a murderer, rapist or drug dealer.”, The marchers did encounter a small group of Trump supporters along the route, though there was no hint of trouble, in sharp contrast to the violence unleashed by leftist counter-demonstrators that disrupted a number of pro-Trump marches throughout California over the past year. The #MarchForScienceLA folks are largely ignoring the Trump supporters on their way to LA city hall. pic.twitter.com/0r7HY3iFIK, — Javier Panzar (@jpanzar) April 22, 2017, , Though the march was supposed to be “nonpartisan,” it was sponsored by NextGen Climate America, a Steyer-backed nonprofit group. Steyer, rumored to be mulling a run for governor of California in 2018, has financially supported a number of environmental causes in the state, including last November’s Prop. 67 that mandated a plastic bag ban at all grocery stores throughout California. The reality is that this march, and others taking place Saturday around the world, were highly politicized and not at all “nonpartisan.” It’s a process that’s increasingly dividing the scientific community, said Alex Berezow, senior fellow of biomedical science at the American Council on Science and Health. “Yes, science has received broad bipartisan support for decades,” Dr. Berezow told Breitbart News. “However, conservatives have been losing trust in scientists in recent years. This is a direct result of the politicization of science and this march underscores that.”, Dr. Berezow, a microbiologist who objected to the nature of the march, also pointed out that the “March for Science” organizers defended ISIS after Trump ordered the “Mother of All Bombs” dropped on the terrorist group’s hideout in Afghanistan. A tweet critical of the “MOAB” attack was later deleted after it had been widely ridiculed. The speech-making at the end of the march was short on science and overloaded with hyperbole.

Tabatabi-nejad also called for Iran’s morality police to crack down on this “improper veiling” and urged Iran’s parliamentary Hezbollahi forces to “carry out operations to root out vice” in these women. (Iran’s Hezbollahi forces were created at the founding of the Iranian revolution to help the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in his quest to consolidate power. In their current capacity, they act as a sort of morality police force and an extension of the regime.), Nik Kowsar, a writer, cartoonist and geologist who understands Iran’s water system and has also created several cartoons to illustrate the issue, explained to Breitbart News that approximately eight to ten percent of the waters in Iran’s dam reservoir “are being evaporated due to the warm climate in Iran and it’s been getting warmer in the last decade or so.”, He attributed this to an increase in the population and less population control over Iran’s new policies towards that. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah “Khamenei, years ago, announced that Iran needs more people,” Kowsar said. “He believed that Iran should have around 160 million citizens. By that, of course, he means he wants a more powerful country and in a way, yes, more Shiite soldiers.”, Kowsar discounted Imam Tabatabi-nejad’s comments pointing out that “you have enough women around the world who wear bikinis in front of oceans and rivers and they aren’t dried up. … The problem is you have a certain capacity for building dams in each region and when you overdo that and build too many dams, you eventually kill the river which is a live environment in a way.”, Several of his cartoons:, , In 2010, Hojatoleslam Kazem Sedighi, a senior Iranian cleric, said women who wear revealing clothing and behave promiscuously are to be blamed for earthquakes. “Many women who do not dress modestly … lead young men astray, corrupt their chastity and spread adultery in society, which increases earthquakes,” he said.

      "California Governor Jerry Brown has formally requested federal assistance from President Donald Trump to deal with the evacuation of nearly 200,000 people from the area below the Oroville Dam, where a spillway is near structural failure.[The Associated Press, via Bay Area news station KRON 4, reports:, advertisement, OROVILLE, Calif. (AP) — Gov. Jerry Brown is asking the Trump administration for federal assistance in responding to a potential failure of a spillway at the Oroville Dam in Northern California. In a letter to President Donald Trump released Monday, Brown asks for help for the three Northern California counties affected. Brown says aid is needed to assist the 188,000 residents of Butte, Sutter and Yuba counties who were ordered to evacuate Sunday after concerns an emergency spillway could give way, unleashing a gush of water to downstream towns. Though vowing to fight the Trump administration on a variety of issues — Obamacare, immigration, climate change — Brown has been less hostile than the members of the California state legislature and has openly welcomed President Trump’s plans to spend on infrastructure. Brown’s letter reportedly stated: “I have determined this incident is of such severity and magnitude . . . that federal assistance is necessary to save lives and to protect property, public health and safety”, According to the East Bay Times, Brown told a press conference on Monday that he had not been aware until news reports emerged earlier this week that the state and federal government had resisted calls to improve the dam spillway in 2005. Critics charge that Brown has not shown sufficient interest in upgrading the state’s dams or expanding water storage. Officials are racing to lower the level of the lake behind the dam by 50 feet before a week of wet weather arrives Wednesday and Thursday.\n",

Ngo (@MrAndyNgo) April 16, 2016, , The coalition of far-left students and faculty that aggressively disrupted a students for Donald Trump event last week at Oregon’s Portland State University is at it again, planning to shut down millennials who want to discuss Trump’s plan to “make America great again” at a rally planned for 1:30 pm Pacific time. Posters have begun to appear on campus attacking Trump and the students who support him as “racist” and calling for a rally. , Sources tell Breitbart News that Portland police and the university itself have been unwilling to do anything to protect the First Amendment rights of the pro-Trump students, instead telling them to move today’s event outside. Despite the intimidation and openly hostile atmosphere, the freedom-loving students plan to carry on the event. The first attempt by about a dozen pro-Trump students to have a meeting eight days ago ended up with those students having their First Amendment rights trampled on as dozens of radical protestors affiliated with the Black Studies department and other left-wing groups connected to the Portland State University Student Union jumped on furniture, screamed at pro-Trump students and intimidated anyone who disagreed with them. As Portland State University’s student newspaper The Vanguard reported about the first event:, Protesters could also be seen gathered outside the cafeteria window in the Portland State Park Blocks donning banners, international flags and signs of protest. Protesters took over the attempted meeting using the mic check call and response method—mostly instigated by PSU Student Union organizers Olivia Pace and Alyssa Pagan. Pace yelled over the crowd in attempt to garner attention upon Pagan’s arrival at the meeting takeover. “If you don’t let her talk I will fuck shit up,” Pace said. In a bizarre turn of clear journalistic bias, The Vanguard story blames the victim for the anti-free speech attack by the leftists the Vanguard’s headline reads “SUPPORT FOR TRUMP POLARIZES CAMPUS CLIMATE.”, However, even video released by The Vanguard shows how angry, disrespectful, and disruptive the entitled socialists takeover of a peaceful student meeting was. https://youtu.be/Jjr8DiIaNYc It was the latest example of America’s college camp have become even more openly hostile to the free speech rights of far-left views.

      "While President Donald Trump’s proposed budget cuts just $2.6 billion from the budget of the Environmental Protection Agency, the benefits for the American economy will likely be much larger.[The biggest economic benefits from Trump’s EPA budget would come from the complete elimination of funding for implementing the “Clean Power Plan,” the Obama administration’s scheme to cut carbon dioxide emissions from the electricity generating sector. The plan would have cost consumers hundreds of billions of dollars in increased energy costs and inflicted even further damage on America’s coal mining sector. advertisement, Estimates of the costs of the Clean Power Plan vary, with the EPA itself claiming it would cost virtually nothing while industry estimates say it would cost consumers as much as $214 billion in higher energy costs by 2030. Energy Ventures Analysis, a consultant group that receives much of its income from the energy industry, has said that replacing otherwise perfectly good electricity generating capacity with Clean Power Plan compliant capacity would cost as much as $64 billion. But even if the costs are smaller, stopping the Clean Power Plan will mean consumers have more money to spend, save and invest in America’s growing economy. And billions of dollars that would have gone to replace existing power generating facilities, can be invested in expansionary economic activity. Defunding the Clean Power Plan puts into action the idea of “deconstructing the administrative state.” The Clean Power Plan’s demands for a radical reshaping of America’s power industry weren’t included in any legislation passed by Congress or signed by the President. They were the creation of career bureaucrats and Obama administration political appointees. The Supreme Court went so far as to issue a stay of the plan pending judicial review, blocking the EPA from implementing the scheme pending judicial review. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit heard arguments over challenges to the plan in September of 2016. Cutting the EPA staff by 20% may also benefit the American economy if it forces the EPA to backdown from its aggressive regulatory and enforcement agenda. Last year, The American Action Forum, a center-right policy Institute, estimated that EPA now imposes nearly 200 million hours of paperwork to comply with its regulations. It estimated that it would take more than 94,000 employees working full-time to complete one year of EPA paperwork. “The agency’s burden has surged 23 percent since 2009 and 34 percent since 2002,” the American Action Forum reported.\n",
      "Texas Senator Ted Cruz appeared in a western suburb of Chicago only moments after it was confirmed that GOP frontrunner Donald Trump had canceled his downtown Chicago rally due to a threat of mob violence.[Cruz said the “anger and rage” came from the top of the campaign. Without saying Donald Trump’s name, Cruz continued saying Trump’s campaign has “created an environment that only encourages this sort of nasty discord.”, advertisement, Cruz spent a few minutes speaking off the cuff to the press before he took the podium to speak at the annual Northwest Suburban Lincoln Day Dinner held in the western suburbs about 25 miles outside Chicago. “I think a campaign bears responsibility for creating an environment, when the candidate urges supporters to engage in physical violence–to punch people in the face. The predictable consequence of that is that it escalates and today is unlikely to be the last such instance,” Cruz said in a sorrowful tone. “That’s not how our politics should occur,” he added. As Cruz ended his brief comments to the press, the Senator raised the specter of the riots that plagued the 1968 Democrat convention held in Chicago, riots that ripped the city apart. “You know, the City of Chicago in 1968 saw some ugly days when politics descended into hatred and incivility and even violence and it is my hope that in 2016 that we can appeal to our better angels and avoid going down that road once again,” Cruz concluded. The Senator later spoke before the gathered Republicans at the Lincoln Day dinner giving a typical stump speech without mentioning the troubles Trump found in the Windy City. I also want to mention something about the events this evening in Chicago. This is a sad day. Political discourse should occur in this country without a threat of violence without anger and rage and hatred directed at each other. We need to learn to have disagreements without being disagreeable, to have disagreements while being respecting human beings on the other side. Earlier today over thirty people were arrested at one rally. And then tonight as violence broke out the rally was canceled altogether. Now, the responsibility for that lies with protesters who took violence into their own hands. But in any campaign responsibility starts at the top. Any candidate is responsible for the culture of the campaign. And when you have a campaign that disrespects the voters, when you have a campaign that affirmatively encourages violence, when you have a campaign that’s facing allegations of physical violence against members of the press, you create an environment that only encourages this sort of nasty discord. He was asked if Trump should have canceled the rally. I think that the decision should be based on public safety. But I think a campaign bears responsibility for creating an environment, when the candidate urges supporters to engage in physical violence–to punch people in the face. The predictable consequence of that is that it escalates and today is unlikely to be the last such instance. We earlier today in St. Louis over thirty arrested. That’s not how our politics should occur. You know, the City of Chicago in 1968 saw some ugly days when politics descended into hatred and incivility and even violence and it is my hope that in 2016 that we can appeal to our better angels and avoid going down that road once again. , Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com\n",
      "President Mark Kennedy of the University of North Dakota has taken a stand for free expression at the public institution after he rejected calls for a “zero tolerance policy” on offensive speech.[Kennedy argued that because of the University of North Dakota is a public institution, it is required by the U.S. Constitution to adhere to the First Amendment. “While I appreciate the desire for such a [zero tolerance] policy, it is unachievable under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution,” Kennedy wrote. advertisement, According to The Washington Examiner, Kennedy argued that those that value freedom of speech acknowledge that some usages of that freedom will be undesirable or offensive. “The challenge we all face is to find the balance between wanting to eliminate expressions of racism and bigotry and supporting the free speech guaranteed by the First Amendment. If we value freedom of speech, we must acknowledge that some may find the expressions of others unwelcome, painful or even offensive.”, He added: “We can, however, speak out and condemn such expressions, and we can work to create a more welcoming and inclusive environment.”, UND investigated each photo, and found that they did not violate the “UND Code of Student Life,” but could not disclose the details of the investigation or its findings due to federal privacy law. The calls for a “zero tolerance” policy with regards to free speech came after racially-charged campus incidents.

      "Young America’s Foundation (YAF) has pulled out of Ann Coulter’s Thursday event at UC Berkeley, blaming the college for allowing left-wing extremists to terrorize conservatives on campus.[“When Young America’s Foundation confirmed Ann Coulter would speak at UC-Berkeley as part of YAF’s nationwide campus lecture program on April 27, we assumed UC Berkeley would take all steps necessary to ensure the safety of students attending the educational event,” the group declared in a blog post on Tuesday. “In the meantime we discovered that the University of California Police Department at Berkeley has an official ‘stand-down’ policy for any situation that develops on campus as long as the situation doesn’t involve the imminent loss of life, allowing the leftist thugs who have terrorized Berkeley’s campus to do so without consequence.”, advertisement, “As of 4:00 p.m. today, Young America’s Foundation will not be moving forward with an event at Berkeley on April 27 due to the lack of assurances for protections from foreseeable violence from unrestrained leftist agitators,” they continued. “Berkeley should be ashamed for creating this hostile atmosphere.”, YAF added that they are still pushing forward with their lawsuit against the college, and that the group “looks forward to the day when First Amendment freedoms are enjoyed by conservative students.”, “Ms. Coulter may still choose to speak in some form on campus, but Young America’s Foundation will not jeopardize the safety of its staff or students,” they concluded. “For information on Ms. Coulter’s plans, please contact her directly.”, Ron Robinson, the president of Young America’s Foundation, also attacked the college in a quote, describing the campus as a “circus.”, “As a parent and a taxpayer, I want the next generation to learn in an educational environment, not a circus,” said Robinson. “I had the misfortune of being in a leftist riot as a student, and I wouldn’t want to put my children or anyone else’s children into that situation without assurances that law enforcement would protect them.”, The Berkeley College Republicans and YAF are currently in the process of suing UC Berkeley over the Ann Coulter event, which they claim has faced numerous unfair and biased restrictions. The groups, and their attorney Harmeet Dhillon, referenced previous events featuring conservative speakers at the college, which also faced similar scrutiny restrictions, including former Breitbart Senior Editor Milo Yiannopoulos and conservative commentator David Horowitz. During a press conference about the lawsuit on Monday, Dhillon branded UC Berkeley’s policies on “acceptable speech” as “infinitely malleable,” before criticizing the Mayor of Berkeley, Jesse Arreguin, for appearing to sympathize with, be friendly to, and act softly on the far-left rioters who shut down Yiannopoulos’ event earlier this year. “If the Mayor of Berkeley cannot maintain control of his city, the Governor should call the National Guard, because that’s a serious public health issue,” Dhillon proclaimed.

Help them by being a big brother or big sister. Help them by mentoring them…. Teach them the path you were taught to help them become a successful human being…. It grows you as a human being to have empathy and apathy for someone who doesn’t look like you and is culturally not from your background,” he said to thunderous applause. Colbert then turned the conversation to politics. “Bernie Sanders is the only politician who has consistently, for 50 years, taken that social justice platform into politics,” Killer Mike said when asked why he’s supporting Sanders. “And right now, we have an opportunity to elect someone who is directly out of the philosophy of King-ian non-violence,” Mike said. “We can directly elect someone who cares about poor people cares about women, gay, black rights cares about lives that don’t look like his.

      "Earlier in the week, we covered a study from Wharton School professor J. Scott Armstrong and Dr. Kesten Green which claims that only a fraction of 1 percent of the papers published in scientific journals follow the scientific method. Professor Armstrong appeared on Breitbart News Daily today to discuss his research with editor-in-chief Alex Marlow.[“The problem in journals, with government research, and with universities is that nobody asks them to follow [it]. I’ve been publishing for 55 years and can’t ever recall anyone saying ‘you should follow the scientific method.'”, advertisement, Armstrong, along with Dr Kesten Green developed a checklist of eight criteria to assess whether a paper or a study follows the scientific method. According to the checklist, scientific studies must (1) test multiple reasonable hypotheses, (2) provide useful findings, (3) fully disclose methods, data, and other relevant information, (4) conduct a comprehensive review of prior knowledge, (5) use valid and comparable data, (6) use valid and simple methods, (7) provide any experimental evidence, (8) reach conclusions consistent with the evidence. “So, [Dr.] Kesten Green and I got involved with this to develop a simple checklist that would help people to say ‘are you following the scientific method?’ If you’re going to fly a plane, if you’re going to be a doctor and operate, you have to use a checklist, and if you use a checklist you are much more effective. Nothing like that exists right now.”, “There is one exception, and that is PLOS One, Public Library of Science One actually provides a checklist. I think it took them about five years before they became the largest scientific journal in the world, so they’ve really revolutionized things.”, “What’s happening now is, government research, universities — they’re asking for what I call advocacy research. They have something, they want you to prove it, make sure you prove it, you do, you keep getting paid.”, “Advocacy research is the bulk of these 99 percent of non-scientific studies, and they’re not done for scientific development, they’re done to support a political idea. If you want to make money in universities these days, you publish papers that support global warming and you live handsomely.”, Armstrong said that the problem of ideologically-driven research had been a problem since at least the 1920s, but that it has intensified in recent years with the “vast growth of government funding for research.”, “I agree with many of the greats of the past when I say that the government should not be involved in research.”, Armstrong reiterated his argument that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) violates all eight of his checklist for following the scientific method. “If you don’t believe me, you can go and look at their work and you can use that checklist.”, Listen to Professor Armstrong’s full discussion with Alex Marlow below. \n",
      "As a member of the Arctic Council, the United States has signed onto two agreements that include efforts to protect the Arctic from climate change, linking it to human activity and calling on global efforts to reduce its effects, including enforcement of the Paris Agreement.[“The Arctic Council, which recently celebrated its 20th anniversary, has proven to be an indispensable forum in which we can pursue cooperation,” Tillerson said in remarks to the council. “I want to affirm that the United States will continue to be an active member in this council.”, advertisement, “Foreign ministers of the eight Arctic States signed the third binding agreement negotiated under the auspices of the Arctic Council, the ‘Agreement on Enhancing International Arctic Scientific Cooperation,’ which will help to facilitate entry and exit of persons, equipment, and material access to research infrastructure and facilities access to research areas the use of traditional and local knowledge and education, career development, and training opportunities for students and early-career scientists,” the council press release said. The ministers, including Tillerson, also signed the Fairbanks Declaration, which states, in part:, Reaffirming our commitment to the well-being of the inhabitants of the Arctic, to sustainable development and to the protection of the Arctic environment,, Recognizing the rights of Arctic indigenous peoples and the unique role of the Permanent Participants within the Arctic Council, as well as the commitment to consult and cooperate in good faith with Arctic indigenous peoples and to support their meaningful engagement in Arctic Council activities,, Acknowledging the contributions of local authorities, and the interests of all Arctic residents and communities in the work of the Arctic Council,, Further recognizing that activities taking place outside the Arctic region, including activities occurring in Arctic States, are the main contributors to climate change effects and pollution in the Arctic, and underlining the need for action at all levels,, Noting with concern that the Arctic is warming at more than twice the rate of the global average, resulting in widespread social, environmental, and economic impacts in the Arctic and worldwide, and the pressing and increasing need for mitigation and adaptation actions and to strengthen resilience,, Noting the entry into force of the Paris Agreement on climate change and its implementation, and reiterating the need for global action to reduce both long-lived greenhouse gases and short-lived climate pollutants. The White House has not taken an official position yet as to whether it will stick with the Paris Agreement or withdraw, and Tillerson did not comment directly on the matter while in Alaska, the New York Times reported, despite his signing the document in favor of it. “No decision is imminent, and in his remarks on Thursday, Mr. Tillerson presented the delay as necessary to gain the viewpoints of parties outside the White House and even outside the United States, including the other Arctic nations,” The Times reported. “We are taking time to understand your concerns,” Tillerson told the members of the council, which in addition to the U.S. is comprised of Canada, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, and Russia. “But we’re not going to rush,” Tillerson said. “We’re going to work to make the right decision for the United States.”, “The council members approved, with little fuss, an agreement on scientific cooperation in the region,” The Times reported. “But the meeting’s closing statement, known as the Fairbanks Declaration, had been the subject of a flurry of last-minute negotiations on Wednesday.”, “We came here to Fairbanks believing that the declaration language was agreed,” Rene Soderman, the senior Arctic official for Finland, said, noting that the U.S. objected to some language, but that the overall council prevailed in its efforts. “We were able to push the U.S. back as much as possible,” Soderman said. “And they were able to go back as much as possible.”, “It’s a decent declaration and contains all the essential issues for all the eight countries,” Soderman said. Protesters were on hand at the venue chanting anti-Tillerson slogans, The Times reported, noting Tillerson’s previous job as CEO of ExxonMobil. Terry Chapin, a climate scientist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, was one of the protesters who is critical of the council’s need for unanimous decisions on matters. “They’re constrained in the action they can take because they depend on the consensus from participating countries,” Chapin said. “So if the United States is not going to provide consensus on the climate action that’s needed, their hands are tied. “I think we really need to speak to people like Tillerson to say that this is the kind of action that’s needed,” Chapin said. “While the council only has the power to issue advisories, the language in the statement signed by Tillerson comes in stark contrast to statements and promises made by President Trump about climate change,” ABC reported, noting at the same time that Tillerson “endorsed” the Fairbanks Declaration. The Associated Press describes the Arctic Council as “an advisory body that promotes cooperation among member nations and indigenous groups,” and a “focus is sustainable development and environmental protection of the Arctic.”, “It does not make policy or allocate resources, and its decisions must be unanimous,” according to AP. The gathering marked the end of the two-year U.S. chairmanship of the council, which was passed on to Finland.\n",
      "During his confirmation hearing, Congressman Mike Pompeo (R-KS) said he would observe the proper laws forbidding enhanced interrogation of terror suspects and affirmed that he believes Russia is a threat to the United States. He also noted, however, that attempts to undermine President-elect Donald Trump plays right into the hands of Russian President Vladimir Putin.[On Thursday, the U.S. Senate held its first hearing for the confirmation of Rep. Pompeo, President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee to become CIA chief. While the hearing kicked off with a temporary power outage in the room, the congressman fielded a range of questions from metadata, to CIA-sponsored torture, to privacy concerns. One senator, California’s Kamala Harris, even went off on a tangent asking Pompeo about NASA global warming data and Pompeo’s views on gay marriage. advertisement, When it came time to talk about Russia, though, Pompeo had a dual warning. The Kansan said that Russia is not an ally of the United States, but also insisted that attempts to invalidate Donald Trump’s presidency is serving the anti-American policies of Russia’s Vladimir Putin. Agreeing with the U.S. intelligence community’s latest assessment of Russia, Pompeo also said it is “pretty clear” that the Russians tried to influence the U.S. elections. “It’s pretty clear about what took place here, about Russian involvement in efforts to hack information and to have impact on American democracy,” Pompeo said during the Senate Intelligence Committee meeting. “I’m very clear-eyed about what that intelligence report says. This was an aggressive action taken by the senior leadership inside of Russia.”, Pompeo also said he would support an extensive investigation into just what forms that “aggressive action” took during the 2016 campaign saying, “I will continue to pursue foreign intelligence with vigor no matter where the facts lead.”, “The internet,” Pompeo said, “is a borderless, global environment, easily and frequently exploited by sophisticated adversaries like China and Russia, as well as by less sophisticated adversaries like Iran and North Korea, non-state actors, terrorist groups, criminal organizations, and hackers.”, He also warned though that constant speculation that the election was hacked plays into Putin’s hands. During his response on the matter he said he has “no doubt that the discourse that’s been taking place is something Putin would look at and say, ‘That was among the objectives that I have.'”, As for another topic, many liberals have worried about Pompeo’s thoughts on the CIA using enhanced interrogation. The question seemed fairly answered when Senators Feinstein and Heinrich both quizzed him on the topic. Pompeo told Feinstein he would not re-start the enhanced interrogation policy if he were to become head of the CIA and assured Senator Heinrich that he would stick to the Army field manual for interrogation that currently forbids such techniques. As to Iran, Pompeo said that despite his personal opinions and his past claims that he would work to repeal Obama’s “disastrous deal” with Iran, he would abide by whatever his President told him to do on the issue. The congressman also fielded questions about his past comments on gathering metadata. While noting that intelligence is the “lifeblood” of national security, he added that such intel “is more in demand than ever.”, The Supreme Court has ruled that metadata is not private personal information, but nonetheless Pompeo said he would certainly toe the line of the law — whatever that may be — on the collection of data. He was also asked for his thoughts on demanding that tech companies give the U.S. government keys to their encryption of data. Pompeo replied that personal privacy would be an important concern for him and added, “I think we need to acknowledge that encryption is out there, and not all encryption takes place in the United States,” Pompeo replied. But even as Pompeo said he’d toe the law on these matters, Texas Republican Senator John Cornyn asked Pompeo if he will “play to the edge” of the law as CIA director so as not to play too cautious with national security. The Congressman said he would be sure to be mindful of the needs of his operatives and added, “It’s my role to make sure those lines are clear and bright.”, Pompeo also faced questioning from California Democrat Kamala Harris who seemed to feel his stance against gay marriage would hamper his work to secure the nation. She also quizzed him on global warming, asking if he would accept climate change claims made by NASA. Seemingly bemused by the quixotic line of questioning, Pompeo assured Harris that as a small businessman he’s never let anyone’s sexuality interfere in what he expected of them as an employee and that, as an engineer by training, facts and data drive his life – so if he found believable data on climate change it would certainly be an important consideration in his thought process. The hearing was not without humor, either, as Arizona Republican John McCain, a graduate of the Naval Academy, joked that Pompeo’s education was “very poor” because he was a graduate of West Point. , Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.\n",

Not really good.” adding,”It is hard to image it getting lower.”, He explained “You got to go out and create a farm team. In ’06 and ’08 everybody goes, ‘Oh that’s when we took back the House.’ You know I got a lot of crap for recruiting Iraq War vets, football players, sheriffs, business people. I said well they are running in Republican districts. I wanted to take cultural issues off the table and I wanted to present economic issues. We as Democrats like to walk around ideally —  No you got to be ruthless enough. We recruited people who matched the district. If you’re running in a Republican district, you got to get at somebody who can win in a Republican district. Winning is everything. You don’t win, you can’t make the public policy. I say that because it is hard for people in our party to accept that principle. Sometimes you just got to win. Okay? Our party likes to be right even if they lose.”, He continued, “Democrats love doing a fire squad in a circle. Stop that. Don’t attack, they are too moderate. Forget about it. Stop it. This guy and these people are about to do something on the tax code, the regulatory environment and things that are more threatening than what a fellow Democrat might slightly disagree with you on. Stop it. We’re not strong enough to do that.”, He added, “It took us a long time to get this low. It ain’t gonna happen in 2018. Take a chill pill, man. You gotta be in this for the long haul.

      "California Gov. Jerry Brown asked President Donald Trump on Sunday for federal emergency assistance for the fourth time in just two months since the new administration took office, putting the nascent “CalExit” movement in a difficult position.[While advocates of California secession — both on the left and operating from abroad — have hoped to make the case that the Golden State can stand on its own, Brown’s repeated requests for help underline the fact that the world’s sixth-biggest economy is still dependent on the rest of the country. advertisement, The latest request, according to the San Francisco Chronicle, asks for money for flood relief, including for repairing the damaged spillways of the Oroville Dam, which nearly failed last month, resulting in the temporary evacuation of 200,000 residents downstream of the dam. Desperate last-minute engineering maneuvers — including a massive release of water from the dam down an already-damaged main spillway — averted a collapse of the emergency spillway. The Chronicle adds: “The Governor’s Office of Emergency Services has also requested assistance from the U.S. Small Business Administration for individuals in Colusa, Lake, Lassen, Plumas, Santa Clara and Santa Cruz counties, where the flooding from February storms damaged more than 200 homes and businesses.”, All three of Brown’s previous requests for aid have been granted. Brown has vowed to stand up to the Trump administration on left-wing causes such as climate change and illegal immigration. At the same time, he has welcomed the commitment of the Trump administration to invest in infrastructure, although the White House has signaled that such spending would not include California’s controversial and costly high-speed rail project.

But the tool now in development would prevent the posts from ever surfacing in the News Feed at all.”, Several employees have reportedly left the company in protest of the tool’s development, however Facebook has yet to either publicly confirm or deny their expansion into China. “We have long said that we are interested in China, and are spending time understanding and learning more about the country,” said a Facebook spokesperson to The Verge. “However, we have not made any decision on our approach to China.

      "‘The Great Barrier Reef is dying’ claims the Washington Post.[This is classic fake news. advertisement, Like the thriving polar bear, like the recovering ice caps, like the doing-just-fine Pacific islands, the Great Barrier Reef has become a totem for the liberal-left not because it’s in any kind of danger but because it’s big and famous and photogenic and lots and lots of people would be really sad if it disappeared. But it’s not going to disappear. That’s just a #fakefakenews lie designed to promote the climate alarmist agenda. The annoying thing is, though, whenever I write another piece like this one – Shock Study: Australia’s Great Barrier Reef Doing Just Fine – I get besieged by greenies on Twitter telling me what an evil denier I am. Meet, for example, my nemesis Tripp Funderburk. @JamesDelingpole You ignore science and tweet lies. 100’s of miles of GBR died due to excessive heat. Shame on you. https://t.co/TiUY94qoQk, — Tripp Funderburk (@trippfunderburk) December 2, 2016, , Yes, if he didn’t exist you’d have to invent him. Tripp Funderburk describes himself as “a Duke football fan. Lover of coral reefs. Advocate for climate change solutions.”, There’s a big clue to where he’s coming from ideologically in that last sentence. Even so, it would be a mistake to dismiss him as just a random eco-loon with a funny name. As Tripp Funderburk thinks, so does pretty much everyone else in the entire greenie-left-liberal universe. “Is the Great Barrier Reef dying due to climate change caused by man’s selfishness and greed?, I’ll lay money that if you asked this question to your kids’ biology teacher or to Bill Nye the Junk Science Guy or to that nice Richard Osman off Pointless or to Matt Damon or anyone else who would have voted for Hillary Clinton or to any Labour (and a good many Conservative) politicians or anyone who works for the ABC in Australia, the BBC, the Guardian, MSNBC, CNN and the New York Times or comedy Senator Al Franken or  Myles Allen, Professor of Geosystem science at Oxford University or pretty much any other science prof from Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard or Yale or any marine biologist or a lawyer from a big City law firm or anyone who voted Remain in the EU Referendum, you’d get the same answer: “Yes.”, How do they know?, Have they been out there personally – as I have – to check?, No, of course not. The reason all these people believe the Great Barrier Reef is dying is because they all get their fake news from the same green-left-liberal echo chamber. If you want to get the real facts, you have to seek them out at places like Jo Nova. In a nutshell: a governmment funded group finds some bleached coral on the Great Barrier Reef, and repackages the stats to come up with the apocalyptic statistic that only 7% of the reef is not bleached!  The SMH reported that “93% of the corals” are damaged. The reef is 2,000 kilometers long. Did anyone really think about these headlines?, Then in a development that “no one” could see coming, local tourism is damaged, potentially costing a lot of jobs. “And the loss of these tourists could cost our tourism industry a whopping $1 billion a year, a report out today by The Australia Institute warned.”, Or listen to honest experts like Professor Peter Ridd, a marine geophysicist from Australia’s James Cook University, who last year tried to blow the whistle on Great Barrier Reef fake news. Instead of being applauded for his integrity, he was censured in a kangaroo court orchestrated by his alarmist colleagues, and found guilty of “failing to act in a collegial way and in the academic spirit of the institution”. As Ridd told The Bolt Report:, “We have got to the point where a large fraction of the science we see cannot be relied upon.”, I wonder if this applies to the dozens of names attached to the latest Nature study entitled Global Warming And The Recurrent Mass Bleaching of Corals?, They’ve got earn a living somehow. And it always helps when your study summary concludes with the all-important line:, “Consequently, immediate global action to curb future warming is essential to secure a future for coral reefs.”, Yes, of course. However could anyone dare think otherwise?\n",
      "Oscar-winning actress Emma Thompson has been sprayed with manure by an irate farmer after trespassing on his land to protest about fracking.[Once feted as a great actress, director and screenwriter for films including Nanny McPhee, Harry Potter and her Oscar-winning adaptation of Sense and Sensibility, Thompson has since become better known for her environmental activism – famed for such outrageous stunts as her bold decision to name her daughter Gaia (after the Earth Goddess). advertisement, On this occasion, Thompson had gone to a field in Lancashire to stage a protest with her sister Sophie on behalf of Greenpeace. The two women dressed in aprons and baked cakes – one depicting a wind turbine, the other a “solar lemon cake”. Emma Thompson said she was staging the so-called “Frack Free Bake Off” in order to “show the government that we will not allow fracking to scar our countryside and fuel yet more climate change”. In order to make the protest, the Thompson women scaled a fence with a sign clearly showing that they were in breach of an injunction not to trespass on land leased by the fracking company Cuadrilla. , Their antics did not impress the landowner, who objected that the two luvvies were getting in the way of his work and livelihood – and drove at the protesters with his muck-spreader, spraying them with manure. Unfortunately, the Thompson sisters escaped the worst of it. The police arrived but made no arrests.\n",
      "First, the setting. I was in San Francisco to review How to Let Go of the World and Love All The Things Climate Can’t Change, the latest documentary from filmmaker and flaming faucet fraudster Josh Fox. This famously walkable city — and the fact that the film was being shown at a green film festival — put me in a particular mood, so I decided to walk the three miles to the Castro theatre.[These three miles made me realize the inspiration for all those dystopian Hollywood movies, created by liberals, where the monied, beautiful elite live in/above a crazy, ragged underclass who have a hopeless, brutish existence. It was three miles of crazy “homeless” people who were almost parodic in their insanity. It was also three miles of craft breweries and restaurants full of the most beautiful of the beautiful people. And there were galleries, too, where you could buy Picassos and Mondrians with people outside whose faces and teeth looked like a Picasso had a fight with a Mondrian. advertisement, There was a vague threat of violence in the constant panhandling and the screeching and the peeing. It’s no surprise UBER was invented in San Francisco. Standing on the pavement trying to hail a cab is more than an inconvenience in this city. Its a crapshoot with the prizes ranging from discomfort and disease to assault and murder. Honestly, as I turned onto Castro Street, I’ve never been as happy to see dozens of strapping young gay men. Among the clean streets, the tight t-shirts, and the bulging biceps, I felt safe. And so did the other several hundred people who turned out for the film — Fox’s third anti-fossil fuel documentary — a kind of follow up/jumping off from Gasland 1 and 2 which demonized fracking and launched the worldwide anit-fracking movement. Yes, the Let Go and Love screening was a safe space — not just from the crazies outside but from awkward questions inside. The film was a poetic journey by Mr. Fox who has the air of a modern day missionary, spreading his teachings to grateful natives in five continents. Sometimes he even listened to the natives — no matter what nonsense they espoused. Fox listened to various peoples in various locales and their “fascinating” stories, stories that the Brooklyn-based filmmaker would probably mock if they were opined by a southern Christian preacher. One tribe solemnly announced they are descended from jaguars (the animal, not the cars, I presume). Another believed that everything on the planet — every animal, every tree, every leaf — has a spirit. Mr. Fox looked wondrous as he heard this because in his worldview, and in the worldview of the audience in the Castro Theater, no amount of nonsense that comes from a colorfully dressed native should ever, ever be questioned. They are special. This is safe space. No awkward questions, please. Fox claims it was the discovery that a tree he planted as a child was being destroyed by a beetle compelled him to make How To Let Go. He explained it was now running rampant in the northeastern United States because of the mild winters caused by climate change. Except that later in this sprawling documentary Fox solemnly goes through a list of extreme weather caused by climate change including the polar vortex shift which had led to the “extremely cold” record breaking winters in Boston and new York in 2010 and 2011. So climate change is causing both extremely mild and extremely cold winters in the same place. And throughout the film it was case of different continent — same contradictions. We are guided through the rainforest by a local pineapple farmer to showcase the destruction of the forest by other farmers. Fox didn’t feel it was important to ask how this “good farmer” had created his own farm in the rainforest. Every so often, Fox allowed himself a partial white man’s burden, wondering in the film if his lifestyle could be contributing to climate change and, therefore, the destruction of the native villages. But he doesn’t worry too much. In a Q&ampA after the screening, Mr. Fox was asked how he had changed his lifestyle and how we all could change our lifestyle to avert the apparently looming crisis. Mr. Fox chose to interpret the question as meaning what actions could we all take to help him promote his film. This was a safe space, after all. And it’s clear Mr. Fox does not believe in what he quite literally preaches in the documentary. He did the Q&ampA through Skype, not to reduce his carbon emissions, but because he had just recently been in a car accident and was medically prevented from flying. Reducing car use and stopping flying is for other people who must sacrifice to save the planet. And in this safe space, there was no room for introspection or even analysis of how ludicrous it is that a filmmaker flew to five continents to tell the rest of us that we can no longer fly or travel. And by “we” I mean “the little people.” The important people, like Josh Fox, well, they are a bit “more equal” and, thus, have to travel — for the greater good. Fox and the audience in the Castro Theater seemed oblivious to the contradictions and to the harm their ideas would do to the poorest people in the developed and developing world. They need cities, factories and hospitals, but all they got were neo-colonial pats on the head from Fox in a long (very long) meandering piece of docu-poetry. It looks like this is the way the world ends. Not with a bang, but a wimp. Phelim McAleer is a Los Angels based journalist and filmmaker.

      "PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania — A protest against the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade deal broke out on the floor of the Democratic National Convention at the Wells Fargo Arena on Monday afternoon, in the midst of an address by Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD).[Delegates, many of them wearing Bernie Sanders T-shirts, unfurled a large banner reading: “Economic Justice, Climate Justice, Trade Justice.” They began shouting “No TPP!” , advertisement, , Signs opposing TPP began appearing across the arena, as other delegates picked up the chant. , In the run-up to the convention, Cummings was in charge of drafting the party platform, which excluded opposition to TPP at the direct request of President Barack Obama, according to the Washington Post. The Democratic platform merely includes a list of demands that are to apply to all trade agreements, including the TPP. Cummings was in the midst of speaking about the Black Lives Matter movement, but delegates apparently wanted to make sure they interrupted him while they had the opportunity. Opposition to TPP has been a major feature of protests around the convention. Supporters of Bernie Sanders told Breitbart News that it was a major reason they opposed Hillary Clinton’s vice presidential pick, Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA). Some Sanders delegates apparently intend to stage a “mutiny” against the pick. On the Republican side, opposition to TPP has also featured in Donald Trump’s campaign. Trump says he is for free trade, but against deals that benefit other countries at the expense of the United States, and that enshrine special interests. In Philadelphia, protests against TPP both inside and outside the convention hall were accompanied by anti-Hillary Clinton chants and jeers. When House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-MD) told the convention, “We are here to nominate Hillary Clinton,” there were loud boos. Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

      "As investor sentiment plunges across the world, President François Hollande of France has unveiled an economic plan to deal with what he describes as his country’s “state of economic emergency”.[Setting out a new €2 billion (£1.5 billion) job creation plan for France, the socialist leader said the country is facing an “economic and social emergency” as well as an “uncertain economic climate and persistent unemployment”, reports the BBC. advertisement, Recently President Hollande said that the social emergency in France, caused by unemployment, was as every bit as serious as the emergency caused by terrorism. In his annual speech to business leaders he reinforced that idea, prioritising his response to it. “Our country has been faced with structural unemployment for two to three decades,” he said, “and this requires that creating jobs becomes our one and only fight.”, France’s unemployment rate has soared to an 18-year high of 10.6 per cent, against a European Union average of 9.8 per cent and 5.4 per cent in Britain. Facing re-election next year an increasingly desperate President Hollande proposes to pay French employers to hire young unemployed people as a means to restore confidence in his country’s “broken” economic model, one which is marred by low output and stagnant growth. France’s state of economic emergency was declared at the same time as Germany faces its most difficult start to a year in recent memory, reports The Express. With consumer confidence plummeting, industrial production growth in the EU’s biggest economy has slipped to zero per cent. Germany and France are the eurozone’s two biggest economies, and two of the six largest economies in the world. Economists have warned that if the French and German economies collapse the ensuing domino effect would bring down the entire eurozone and severely damage the global economy at a time when it is already under considerable stress. Some are even warning that with the downturn in China a global recession is now more likely than at any time since the 2008 financial crisis.\n",
      "Many, if not all, big environmental organizations have described President-elect Donald Trump’s nomination of Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to head the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in apocalyptic, disastrous terms. I must, for one of the few times in my professional career, agree with the big environmental organizations. When Pruitt is confirmed as EPA administrator, that will indeed be a disaster—for big environmental organizations. The rest of us, along with planet Earth, will get along just fine.[The unalterable trend over the past 40 years, whether a Democrat or Republican is president, is the environment in the United States has become cleaner and will continue to get cleaner. I don’t believe Pruitt wants to alter that trend or will be tasked by the Trump administration to alter that trend, and I don’t think he could possibly encourage or allow environmental damage in 21st-century America. advertisement, My expertise is air, so I’ll stick to that, but the themes that I’m about to explore will apply to water quality, to wetlands, to hazardous waste management and any other environmental issue you care to mention. Here’s what I believe: In January 2021, when Trump’s first term comes to an end, the air in America will be cleaner, as measured by any reasonable metric, than it was when he took the oath of office in 2017. I am so sure that will be true that I offer the following wager to anyone associated with any of the big environmental groups: If the above statement turns out not to be true, I’ll personally donate $1,000 to your organization. If I’m right, than you will donate $1,000 to The Heartland Institute. What follows are what I consider to be the reasonable metrics and the tests that should be applied:, That’s it. Those tests sum up the things that matter to most Americans when they think about the air they breathe. They don’t care about permits, records, reporting, public comment, permit appeals, or any of the countless other features of bureaucracy that environmental groups go on and on about these days. Those tools are a means to an end: establishing reasonable air quality standards and protecting air quality. I believe Pruitt will leave unaltered the features of those tools critical to ensuring American has reasonable air quality standards and to protecting air quality. I believe Pruitt will do his best to discard or redesign the features of those tools that have little or no value in accomplishing what is our common goal: a clean, safe, healthy America. A couple of notes before we move on. You may be wondering why I exempted the SCAQMD in my offer of a wager. The SCAQMD encompasses the Los Angeles area, which is basically the metropolitan area that God Created to Make Ozone. Ozone, aka “smog,” is a criteria air pollutant that is primarily generated in urban areas during hot, relatively windless days. LA exists in a geographical bowl that is uniquely prone to hot, relatively windless days. If there are a lot of such days in a given year, then LA will trip the ozone NAAQS a lot. If Los Angeles doesn’t have many days like that, then it won’t. It’s a crapshoot that depends far more on natural variability than any man-made influences. You should also know Big Environment and their allies in the mainstream media will be zeroing in on issues that don’t have anything to do with actual air quality during the next four years. Paperwork violations will become a bigger deal in their world, but I expect a reduction in enforcement actions and penalty amounts associated with that reduction will be their focus. The Environmental NGOs absolutely hate it when industry pays less in penalties to the government. In their mind, or at least according to their PR professionals, that’s clear evidence of pandering to big business. The possibility that a decrease in enforcement might be attributable to an increase of environmental quality never seems to enter their minds. Pruitt’s EPA is a nightmare scenario for Big Environment. Heretofore, every Republican administration has tried to placate environmental NGOs like the Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense Council, Greenpeace, etc. Presidents Nixon, Ford, Reagan, and both Bushes all went along, hoping to get along. They allowed the EPA to get bigger, to introduce more and more rules, to make approval processes increasingly complex, and to introduce ever more stringent standards based on evidence that grew increasingly dubious at each retelling of a theoretical body-count that the nation would suffer were not the newest theoretical threat confronted. They did all that and were crucified by Big Environment anyway. To remain relevant, Big Environment needs a threat with which to frighten people and keep those massive donations received coming in. In a nation that gets cleaner and cleaner, that threat must become more and more theoretical. Picking on but one of a gazillion examples I could point to, when President George W. Bush followed through on President Bill Clinton’s initiative to reform a part of the EPA air-permitting system, a proposal that had been far-sighted under Clinton became positively Neanderthal under Bush. If Bush’s EPA got away with that, Big Environment assured us, Americans will be collapsing on the street, dead of lung cancer. OK, maybe they didn’t actually say that, but you get the idea. I have longed for an administration that would have the guts to hold the environmental NGOs to a proper standard of conduct and accountability. Look, I don’t have anything against the Sierra Club. I really don’t. But I do have a big problem with the Sierra Club inventing or exaggerating issues that have little or nothing to do with environmental protection. By all means, let’s make sure that we can enjoy the majesty of Yosemite, that we can do so at a ripe old age, and that there are enough polar bears around to devour enough seals before seal populations get out of control. Let’s do all that and much, much more. But, when it comes to the environment, it should be about pollution, not paperwork. Pruitt gets that. I think a Pruitt EPA will be an EPA that will focus on actual results, not on theoretical threats that might somehow get in the way of achieving those results. When you run a business, you are always searching for the most efficient way to achieve your goal. When you’re in charge of a bureaucracy, the traditional model has been to find a way to achieve your goal that: (a) would make everyone happy, and (b) involved not even the slightest, tiniest, most insignificant bit of risk. I think Pruitt will change that way of thinking, at least as far as the EPA is concerned. He’ll get results. He’ll do so without pandering to Big Environment obstructionism. And, like Trump, I believe he’ll do so by focusing on what matters. Would it be invoking too much irony to suggest Pruitt will be a breath of fresh air?, Rich Trzupek (think@heartland.org) is a chemist and environmental consultant who specializes in air quality issue.

      "California Democrats are appealing to the ‘lame duck’ Obama administration to take measures that would protect its left-wing policies even in the face of changes under incoming President Donald Trump.[Bay Area public radio station KQED reports that state leaders and California’s congressional delegation — at least on the Democratic side — are asking President Barack Obama to do whatever he can before he leaves office to protect their priorities on immigration, the environment, and “civil rights.”, advertisement, KQED notes:, In an effort to head off one potential impact, Senate Democrats have sent a letter to President Barack Obama asking him to permanently ban new oil and gas drilling in federal waters off California’s coast. …, Senate leader Kevin de León last month met with House of Representatives Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to discuss how best to protect progressive policies after Obama leaves office. Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon said he’s had meetings with the Obama administration. Rendon said he sought their insights into what the future holds and discussed how to close out some remaining business the state has with the current administration. California Democrats worry that their state will be last in line for federal spending — and perhaps also worry that the state will lose access to federal funds in an anticipated fight over “sanctuary cities.”, However, many California Republicans are looking forward to changes that they expect the Trump administration will bring, including new military spending, more water for Central Valley farmers, and immigration enforcement. California is one of only four states where Democrats control both the governor’s mansion and the state legislature. The others are Hawaii, Oregon, and Rhode Island.

While police report violence in the French suburb of Aulnay-sous-Bois after Theo made a plea from his hospital bed for calm, attacks have spread to other areas. advertisement, North-Eastern Paris suburbs, including Tremblay-en-France, Montfermeil, Clichy-sous-Bois, Villepinte, and Blanc-Mesnil, experienced attacks on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, reports Le Figaro, with police stations attacked, Molotov cocktails thrown, and bins set alight. These suburbs of the heavily migrant-populated Seine-Saint-Denis region of Paris have become well known for violence, drug crime, and religious extremism. Terror raids in the area followed the 2015 Paris Bataclan Attacks. Officers would not give the exact number of cars torched overnight, but gave a figure of “around 20” destroyed over what has come to be known in France as the “Theo Affair”. Police made 17 arrests on Tuesday night, five of which took place in the Aulnay-sous-Bois suburb where Theo lives. The arrests were predominantly for “outrages” against public order, damage by violent means, and violence against a person holding public authority. A number have been hospitalised or injured, including “several” children who suffered carbon dioxide poisoning after a Molotov cocktail was thrown at a nursery school, and a bus driver whose vehicle was attacked. The violence came hours after French President François Hollande, soon to leave office with the coming elections in which he is not seeking reelection, travelled to meet Theo. Speaking to a camera during the visit, the President praised the young man for having been “always known for his exemplary behaviour”. An investigation into what happened to Theo while under arrest continues. Four special police officers were arrested after he claimed a truncheon was forcibly inserted into his buttocks, causing “serious” injury. One has been charged with rape.\n",
      "A new era of space exploration comes with new challenges, chief among them our own sun’s radiation.[Heart disease has become a very real hazard of time spent in deep space outside of the protective shell of Earth’s atmosphere. Exposure to naked solar radiation appears to deal significant damage to the human cardiovascular system — damage that has already proven fatal to three out of the seven Apollo astronauts to have died since taking on a mission outside the relative safety of a near-Earth orbit. advertisement, Florida State University’s Professor Michael Delp, one of the men researching these potentially deadly side effects, explains that we know “very little about the effects of deep space radiation on human health,” and this is but a “first glimpse into its adverse effects on humans.”, But cardiovascular disease and complications in a test bed of seven subjects is hardly conclusive proof, so Delp and his associates have already taken steps to try and duplicate the problem according to the scientific method. Using mice as stand-ins for human test subjects provided results in six months, rather than the roughly 20 year equivalent in humans. The furry participants were exposed to equivalent radiation as actual space explorers, and within that six month window had already begun to show signs of the arterial damage that causes the aforementioned cardiovascular complications. Delp asserts that the “mouse data” is proof that “deep space radiation is harmful to vascular health.”, With the European Space Agency, Russia, and China all planning potential missions to the moon, the data is more pertinent than ever. SpaceX has projected a manned mission to Mars as soon as 2026, as much as a decade before NASA’s own estimates, and an exceptionally brief time period in which to address all of the potential complications.

      "Writing at the Guardian newspaper, global warming advocate Bill McKibben claimed that President Donald Trump and White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon are “counting on” a terrorist “massacre” on American soil to “tilt things their way.”[McKibben, who has contributed numerous opinion pieces to the Guardian, wrote a column titled “Donald Trump and Steve Bannon have turned the White House against America.”, advertisement, In the piece, McKibben claimed the White House, which he argued was acting more like a “Black Tower,” was “sending out its Breitbartian orcs and alt-right winged harpies to poison the politics of a nation.”, He referred to Trump’s temporary halt on refugees while the U.S. revamps its flawed screening process as an “immigration ban,” which McKibben claimed was actually a “calculated assault” on Muslims, morality, and “on simple kindness.”, “It was a probe to find out if Americans would come to the defense of a minority that we’d been told to fear and hate,” he claimed.  “And it failed – not because a federal judge struck down the ban, but because Americans in their millions poured into airport baggage terminals and city squares.”, McKibben went on to charge that Trump and Bannon may be “counting on a real-life Bowling Green massacre to tilt things their way.”, He wrote:, The outpouring was not a show of Muslim strength – there really isn’t much Muslim strength in America. It was a demonstration that, for the moment, our moral commitment to the underdog still holds. But there are no guarantees: morality can bend pretty easily in the face of fear, and you know that Bannon and Trump are counting on a real-life Bowling Green massacre to tilt things their way. And in any event, morality is the not the only pillar they’re after. Next on the list is reason: the attack on climate science is, in fact, an attack on science itself, on the enterprise that undergirds modernity. McKibben’s charge about a “Bowling Green massacre” referred to an error made by Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, who mistakenly said that “President Obama had a six-month ban on the Iraqi refugee program after two Iraqis came here to this country, were radicalized and were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre.”, In actuality, Obama’s State Department in 2011 reportedly imposed a six month freeze on the processing of Iraqi refugees. The halt was the result of the discovery of two al-Qaeda members admitted as refugees from Iraq who were living in Bowling Green, Kentucky and admitted to targeting U.S. troops in Iraq. McKibben is founder of 350.org, which bills itself as a grassroots group building a “global climate movement.”  The group is funded by the George Soros-financed Tides Foundation and a slew of left-wing philanthropies. In a 2010 review of one of his books, Time magazine opined that McKibben “may be the world’s best green journalist.”, Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

      "Two former Troy University students have each been sentenced to ten years in prison for raping a drugged woman in broad daylight on a Florida beach as hundreds of people on spring break partied around them.[Delonte Martistee, 22, and Ryan Austin Calhoun, 23, were arrested and tried for the March 2015 drugging and rape of a woman lying on a Panama City, Florida, beach. The pair was found guilty and this month were sentenced to ten years in prison for the crime, the Daily Mail reports. advertisement, The strongest evidence against the pair were multiple cell phone videos taken from several angles. They show the two suspects physically assaulting the victim, who was obviously lying unresponsive on the sand. During the trial, the victim said she was unaware of what was being done to her and thought someone had drugged her drink before the assault. She also testified that she was unconscious for so long that she was not even sure she was raped therefore, she never reported the incident. Though the victim never reported her own assault, the pair was arrested after Troy University police accidentally discovered the cell phone video while investigating an unrelated case. During the separate investigation, the video was found on a suspect’s cell phone, prompting an investigation into the assault. Eventually, police tracked down cell phone video of the incident from a variety of angles taken by other people present on the scene that day. “This act was encouraged by the crowd and unbelievably by the victim’s boyfriend, but there is no excuse for your actions,” Circuit Judge James Fensom told the convicts. “This incident was reprehensible and, on your part, a big mistake. … It is fortunate we no longer have the Spring Break atmosphere we had in the past.”, Delonte Martistee forfeited a sports scholarship in track and field as a result of his crime, and Ryan Austin Calhoun lost any chance of completing his sports management degree. But prosecutors said the convicted men showed no remorse for their actions. “There was very little remorse coming from that stand — other than remorse that they got caught,” prosecutor Christa Diviney said of the convicted men.

      "I just watched Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, get eaten alive by Fox News Sunday anchor Chris Wallace.[Not only was it an ugly and painful sight but it was also a very dispiriting one. advertisement, Here is the guy who was carefully selected to be in the vanguard of President Trump’s war on the Green Blob which, for decades, has been doing untold damage to liberty, the scientific method, and the economy. And he can’t even answer a few basic and obvious questions about why the job he is doing is necessary, important, and right. Wallace asked him about the UN’s view that it was 95 percent likely that more than half the temperature increase since the mid-20th century is due to human activity. Pruitt sweated, stuttered, and floundered. Wallace asked him about NOAA’s claim that 2015 and 2016 are the hottest years on record. Pruitt had no convincing comeback. Wallace asked him the age-old question beloved by climate alarmists: “What if you’re wrong? What if CO2 is causing dramatic climate change and we as humans are responsible?”, Pruitt just didn’t know how to respond. There should have been nothing complicated or unexpected about these questions. They are the kind of thing any half-way decent interviewer might have asked, be he a hostile one or a semi-friendly Fox News one playing devil’s advocate. And if Scott Pruitt had had even the most cursory briefing and media training in his new role, he should have been prepared for them. Not only should he have known the most effective answers to give but he should have been so confident in the rightness and truth of his cause that he should have been able to seize the moment and make the points that really need to be made about President Trump’s environmental policy: that it is being enacted for the good of science, for the good of the economy and the core mission of Making America Great Again. How could Scott Pruitt not do this?, Any one of us on the skeptical side of the argument could have pointed him to dozens of leading scientists — and hundreds if not thousands of papers and articles — that could easily have enabled Pruitt to say what needed to be said. He could have noted the incompetence, corruption, and mendacity of the heavily politicized IPCC the dishonest manipulation by organizations like NOAA — indeed especially NOAA — of the raw temperature data the utter meaninglessness of the “hottest year evah” claims so often made in the liberal media. And he could easily have batted off the “What if you’re wrong?” question by making perhaps the most important point of all that needs to be made about the “war” on “carbon”: that what it all comes down to is cost benefit analysis. To whit: the trillions of dollars being spent every year on the possibility that there might be a problem, a) could be spent much more usefully elsewhere and b) are doing more harm than good. Pruitt was incapable of doing this though because, trained lawyer though he is, he is simply not on top of his brief. This is disgraceful. It’s an embarrassment and a shambles. Worst of all, it’s an entirely needless concession to the enemy. See how it’s being reported by the Soros-funded propaganda site Think Progress.\n",
      "Google has confirmed that the company’s popular Chrome web browser will feature a native ad-blocker by 2018.[VentureBeat reports that following rumors for the past six weeks relating to the implementation of a native ad-blocker within Google Chrome, the company has finally stepped forward to set the record straight. Google has joined the Coalition for Better Ads, a group that sets specific advertisement standards in order to improve ads for consumers. Chrome will reportedly begin to block all ads that do not meet the Coalition’s guidelines, “starting in early 2018.”, advertisement, In practical terms, Google will use the Chrome browser to cut off advertising revenue to sites that don’t meet their standards. The browser will be taking a hardline stance towards websites — if one of their ads doesn’t meet guidelines then all ads will be blocked, resulting in a total loss of revenue. It seems that Google’s hope with this integrated ad-blocker is to make third party extensions redundant. Many third-party ad blockers block all advertisements outright, while Google’s new blocker will only filter poorly optimized ads that they claim hurt publishers “and threatens the sustainability of the web ecosystem.” Despite the fact that Google actually makes the majority of their revenue from advertisements, the company says that they see this type of selective ad blocker as the future of internet browsing and natural evolution of ad blockers. As well as the development of their own ad blocking software, Google has also launched the Ads Experience Reports which enables users to provide Google with screenshots and videos of annoying advertisement experiences in order to help websites find and fix their faulty advertisements. Once website owners have removed the offending ads, they are eligible to re-submit their website for review which should prevent them being blacklisted by Google in teh future. Google has suggested that website publisher review the new best practices guide to ensure that their website runs smoothly.

      "An alleged “rape joke” that caused an Apple employee to take a leave of absence due to PTSD and spawned a huge investigation by Mic.com appears to have been an employee mentioning an Internet meme.[Gizmodo reports that the interoffice chat that caused an employee referred to as “Danielle” to email Apple CEO Tim Cook directly about what she believed to be a “very toxic atmosphere” was a coworker referencing the internet meme referred to as “Bed Intruder” featuring an interview with Antoine Dodson. The meme became popular in 2010 following an interview with Dodson about a breaking and entering in the area where Dodson lived which went viral. His turns of phrase and animated actions made him an instant hit across the internet. , advertisement, Dodson is best known for saying the lines, “He’s climbin in your windows, he’s snatchin your people up, tryna’ rape em so y’all need to hide your kids, hide your wife, and hide your husband cuz they’re rapin’ everybody out here.” This was apparently the reference that caused Apple employee identified only as “Danielle” to have a PTSD episode and take a month off work. Below you can see the group conversation with Danielle and her team in which this internet meme was reference.  , , , Danielle was so upset by this exchange that she felt it necessary not only to bring it to the attention of her manager but to go directly to Apple CEO Tim Cook, this is the email that she sent to the chief executive. Mr. Cook,, I have been the only woman on the [redacted] Team in the [redacted]organization under [redacted]. [Redacted] is the head of that team, with 30+ people. I have attempted to change this, by trying to alter the recruiting methods, and improve the culture. Except, yesterday, I was greeted with rape jokes in our work chat. [Text of the chatlog], In case you aren’t familiar with the song, the lyrics are like so:, He’s climbin in your windows, He’s snatchin your people up, Tryna rape em so y’all need to, Hide your kids, hide your wife, Hide your kids, hide your wife, Hide your kids, hide your wife, And hide your husband cuz they’re rapin everybody out here, I do not feel safe at a company that tolerates individuals who make rape jokes. [Redacted] I feel *incredibly* unsafe at Apple now. I have tried to escalate to my manager several times that the culture was toxic, yet nothing has appeared to change. Rape jokes in work chat is basically where I completely draw the limit. I would prefer not for folks to make fun of something, which for me personally has caused me *incredible* trauma, having actually been sexually assaulted in the past. Danielle was then given a month’s leave of absence from work. However, she was unsatisfied with the actions taken and forwarded the email once again to the rest of her team and CEO Tim Cook with the added paragraph:, So as far as I can tell , nothing of any serious consequence has happened within the last month. Apparently, I’m supposed to return to work as normal? Nothing changes? I had a month off due to PTSD triggers, and business as usual. Lovely. According to Mic.com, this is just one example of a toxic work environment at Apple. One female worker described a boardroom meeting where she was the only woman and claimed that soon enough the casual conversation in the room turned to the men discussing their wives and “stereotyped women as nags.” Following the meeting, while walking through the hallways, a manager allegedly told her to smile. , Another woman claims that while unhappy in her current position and filing reports with Apple to that effect, the company acknowledged that she was in a “hostile working environment” and offered her another position that was lower ranking and lower paid. Another male worker claimed that he was often referred to as overly emotional and told that he was on his “man period.”, Speaking to Gizmodo, an Apple spokesman said that Cook did not personally give Danielle a month off but that the email could have resulted in an “H.R. process.” Another Apple representative said:, Apple is committed to treating everyone with dignity and respect. When we receive complaints or hear that employees are concerned about their work environment, we take it very seriously and we investigate claims thoroughly. If we find behavior to be at odds with our values, we take action. Out of respect for the privacy of our employees, we do not discuss specific matters or their resolution.

      "In an impassioned address Friday, Pope Francis denied the existence of Islamic terrorism, while simultaneously asserting that “the ecological crisis is real.”[“Christian terrorism does not exist, Jewish terrorism does not exist, and Muslim terrorism does not exist. They do not exist,” Francis said in his speech to a world meeting of populist movements. advertisement, What he apparently meant is that not all Christians are terrorists and not all Muslims are terrorists—a fact evident to all—yet his words also seemed to suggest that no specifically Islamic form of terrorism exists in the world, an assertion that stands in stark contradiction to established fact. “No people is criminal or drug-trafficking or violent,” Francis said, while also suggesting—as he has on other occasions—that terrorism is primarily a result of economic inequalities rather than religious beliefs. “The poor and the poorer peoples are accused of violence yet, without equal opportunities, the different forms of aggression and conflict will find a fertile terrain for growth and will eventually explode.”, The Pope also reiterated his conviction that all religions promote peace and that the danger of violent radicalization exists equally in all religions. “There are fundamentalist and violent individuals in all peoples and religions—and with intolerant generalizations they become stronger because they feed on hate and xenophobia,” he said. While denying the existence of Islamic terrorism, Francis also seemed to condemn the denial of global warming, asserting that “the ecological crisis is real.”, “A very solid scientific consensus indicates that we are presently witnessing a disturbing warming of the climatic system,” he said. We know “what happens when we deny science and disregard the voice of Nature,” the Pope said. “Let us not fall into denial. Time is running out. Let us act. I ask you again—all of you, people of all backgrounds including native people, pastors, political leaders—to defend Creation.”, While acknowledging that science is not “the only form of knowledge,” and that “science is not necessarily ‘neutral’” and often “conceals ideological views or economic interests,” he still insisted that people of good will should not oppose “scientific consensus” regarding global warming. Leftist media like the liberal Guardian in the U.K. immediately politicized the speech, predictably claiming that the Pope was backing “anti-Trump protests,” despite the fact that the Pope himself denied such a claim, explicitly declaring that “I am not speaking of anyone in particular.”, “I am not speaking of anyone in particular, I am speaking of a social and political process that flourishes in many parts of the world and poses a grave danger for humanity,” he said. Moreover, although the Guardian claimed that the Pope was “condemning populism,” in point of fact, he was speaking to populist movements and praised their commitment to democracy. “The direction taken beyond this historic turning-point,” Francis said, “will depend on people’s involvement and participation and, largely, on yourselves, the popular movements.”, Nevertheless, the Vatican’s Secretary of State, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, said Monday that the Holy See is concerned over growing populist and nationalist movements, both in Europe and in the United States. In an interview for the Italian evening news on the state-owned RAI network, the Cardinal was asked whether the Vatican is worried about what the interviewer called “the spread of nationalism and populism not only in Europe but also in the United States with Donald Trump.”, “I think so, I think so,” Parolin said. “Certainly these closings are not a good sign,” since many of them “are born of fear, which is not a good counselor.”, In his address Friday, the Pope denounced “the guise of what is politically correct or ideologically fashionable,” which he described as a “hypocritical attitude,” while urging real solutions to unemployment, corruption, the identity crisis, and “the gutting of democracies.”, “The system’s gangrene cannot be whitewashed forever because sooner or later the stench becomes too strong,” he said.

      "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the Senate will “withhold” consent of President Obama’s Supreme Court nominee.[The Republican leader said on the Senate floor the new president should choose the nominee who replaces Justice Antonin Scalia, who died February 13. advertisement, “Presidents have the right to nominate just as the Senate has its constitutional right to provide or withhold consent,” McConnell said. “In this case, the Senate will withhold it.”, In response to McConnell, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said McConnell’s statement that the Senate “will withhold consent” from an Obama nominee is an example of “Republican obstruction” that is also “an extremist approach propagated by the likes of Donald Trump and Ted Cruz.”, Pointing back to the words of then-Sen. Joe Biden, who was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, McConnell noted Biden urged against appointing a new Supreme Court justice in an election year–in 1992, when George H.W. Bush was running for re-election. Reading from a Washington Post article about the issue at the time, McConnell quoted Biden as saying that an election-year nominee “would become a victim” of a “power struggle” over control of the U.S. Supreme Court. McConnell said Biden also urged that no hearings be held on election-year nominees to the high court. “Can you imagine dropping a nominee after the three or four or five decisions that are about to be made by the Supreme Court into that fight, into the cauldron of the middle of a presidential year?” McConnell quoted Biden. “I believe there would be no bounds of propriety that would be honored by either side. The environment within which such a hearing would be held would be so supercharged and so prone to be able to be distorted.”, McConnell also pointed to the words of Sen. Chuck Schumer who promised in 2007 to block the late-term Supreme Court nominees of President George W. Bush.\n",
      "In a feature on Tuesday, CNBC explained how the Chinese government plans to overtake the US space program, as well as private companies such as SpaceX.[“China’s breakneck economic expansion may be flagging, but the country’s ambitions in space show no signs of slowing down,” wrote CNBC. “Alongside ongoing efforts to rival NASA by placing robotic landers, and eventually astronauts, on the moon and Mars, China’s government is increasingly looking to its burgeoning space sector to rival U.S. companies like Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin and Elon Musk’s SpaceX, which is targeting March 30 for the latest launch of its Falcon 9 rocket.”, advertisement, “The majority of China’s space ambitions remain focused on boosting Chinese prestige at home and abroad. But a push within Xi’s government to triple spending on space science as well as the emergence of a small but growing group of privately backed space start-ups suggest that both Chinese industry and government see long-term economic benefits in their investments in space technologies,” they continued. “That increasing flow of capital toward both China’s state-run and private space-related tech companies could place increased pressure on NASA, and eventually on commercial space companies in the United States and Europe.”, CNBC went on to claim that the climate could change with President Trump’s shift of NASA priorities. “Budget disparities aside, many U.S.-based analysts have expressed concern that NASA is reining in its ambitions as China expands its footprint in orbit and beyond,” CNBC concluded. “But that could change if President Trump decides to reenergize NASA and shift its priorities. Already he has expressed interest in trying to create a ‘Kennedy moment’ again.”, You can read the full article at CNBC.\n",
      "The usual leftard suspects have been fighting a rearguard action in defence of their excuse that China – not insane green energy policy – was responsible for the death of British steel.[But Sanjeev Gupta disagrees. And he should know because he’s the white knight venture capitalist who has looked at the figures and volunteered to come to British steel’s rescue by replacing the outmoded blast furnaces at Port Talbot with more efficient electric arc furnaces. advertisement, No, Gupta doesn’t think protectionism against Chinese dumping would or could have saved the steel industry:, He also said imposing tariffs on imports of Chinese steel is not the way to save Britain’s steel sector. “Protection makes you inefficient, it can sustain uncompetitiveness,” Mr Gupta, added. What he definitely will need, though, he says, if he’s to build a profitable business on the ashes of the old one is “relief from high energy prices.”, This profile in an Indian newspaper draws a similar conclusion:, The United Kingdom was praised across the world for becoming the first country to put in place a legally binding act to counter the climate change, although an attempt to replicate the same at the Copenhagen Climate Summit in 2009 failed. At its home turf, however, it was facing resistance from industrialists who saw the act as a threat to their profits and in some cases, economic sustainability. “What started off as a minor inconvenience has become a major problem for the industries,” said Jeremy Nicholson, the director of energy intensive users group. “The government put in place annually escalating targets for electricity and signed the UK for a target by [the year] 2020 that was extraordinarily expensive.”,  According to World Steel Association, electricity accounts for between 20% and 40% of the manufacturing costs. EUIG suggests that the UK steelmakers pay £80-90/MWh (between Rs 7,500 to 8,500/MWh). About £34/MWh (an equivalent of Rs 3,200/MWh) is owing to the “green taxes”. To make matters worse, the UK doesn’t have a nationalised energy sector and its industries pay among the highest of costs for electricity compared to its European and Chinese counterparts. Mind you, let’s not forget the role the EU played in this disaster too. As the Express reveals, it actually loaned the Chinese millions of pounds to build new steel factories – even as it was running down European industry with its punitive decarbonisation programme and its obsession with expensive renewable energy. As our own Nick Hallett discovered on a trip to Port Talbot the other day, there’s not a person in the town who wants anything other than exit from the European Union. Given what the EU has done to our industry, is it any wonder?\n",
      "Researchers find that some buyers pay for environmentally friendly products because those products act as “status symbols.”[A report in the Atlantic states: “Environmentally-friendly behaviors typically go unseen there’s no public glory in shortened showers or diligent recycling. But when people can use their behavior to broadcast their own goodness, their incentives shift. The people who buy Priuses and solar panels still probably care about the environment—it’s just that researchers have found that a portion of their motivation might come from a place of self-promotion, much like community service does good and fits on a résumé.”, advertisement, With “green” having become a status symbol, the affluent can afford it. Yet, their desire to “broadcast their own goodness” actually results in higher costs to those who can least afford it. Solar power is a great example. On the website for SunRun, a solar panel leasing company, through the story of customer “Pat,” they even encourage the “green status symbol” as a sales feature. While Pat may be happy with her solar panels and “hopes that all her neighbors will go solar, too,” her “green status symbol” costs all the utility’s customers who mostly can’t afford to “go solar.”, As I’ve written on many times, the idea of solar leasing works because of tax incentives and a system called “net metering.” First, those tax incentives are paid for by all taxpayers. Anytime the government gives something away, everyone pays for it. Net metering is a little harder to understand. In short, the utility is required by state laws to purchase the extra electricity generated by rooftop solar panels at the full retail rate—even though they could purchase it at a fraction of the cost from the power plant. As more and more people sign up for these programs, it increases the overall cost of electricity. Remember, however, those with solar panels could have a zero dollar utility bill but they are still using electricity from the utility company when the sun doesn’t shine and generate additional customer service costs such as transmission lines. Ultimately, the cost of electricity goes up on the bills of non-solar customers. Due to this “cost shifting,” many states are changing the net metering policies so solar customers cover the unpaid grid costs. However, as has happened recently in Nevada, the revised programs change the economics and make it unprofitable for companies to operate in the state. This is clear to see in overall rising electric costs—about 3 percent per year according to the Institute for Energy Research—despite the main fuel costs (coal and natural gas) being at all-time lows. Earlier this month, Investors Business Daily (IBD) addressed another interesting angle: “Green energy can’t compete with $30 oil.” The only way for “green” energy to survive, it says, is: “by the government forcing people to buy them and jacking up electricity and heating prices to families and businesses.”, A new study from the University of Chicago, referenced by IBD, concludes that for an electric vehicle to be cheaper to operate than the modern internal combustion engine, “the price of oil would need to exceed $350 a barrel.” The IBD states: “without massive additional taxpayer subsidies to companies such as Tesla, the price of oil would have to not just double or triple, but rocket more than 10-fold before battery-operated cars make financial sense.”, Yet, sales for the Tesla Model S, the International Business Times (IBT), reports: “actually rose 16 percent last year, in part because they serve as status symbols or appeal to the environmental concerns of well-to-do drivers.”, Recycling, a “green” fixture, has taken a toll in the low oil-priced environment. Calling recycling a “$100-billion-a-year business,” National Public Radio reporter Stacy Venek Smith, points out: “Plastic is made from oil, so when oil gets cheap, it gets really cheap to make fresh plastic. When the price of oil gets really low, using recycled plastic can actually be more expensive because it has to be sorted and cleaned.” In Salt Lake City, KUTV reported: “Many businesses are finding it cheaper to manufacture new plastic than to use recycled materials.” In Montana, according to the Philipsburg Mail, plastics are no longer being picked up for recycling “because the price per pound was so low, it didn’t cover the cost of gas and mileage to make the trip.”, Addressing the recycling problem, The Guardian states: “Recycling only works when there’s someone on the other side of the equation, someone who wants to buy the recycled material.”, Fortunately for the recycling industry, but bad for consumers who pay higher prices for plastic products, the Philipsburg Mail concludes: “A lot of Fortune 500 Companies still want to purchase recyclables to meet sustainability goals.”, Despite claims of “green prosperity” that implies such policies can “fight poverty and raise living standards,” the opposite is true. Everyone pays more—even those who can least afford it—so the elites, seeking green status symbols, can feel good and appear to be community leaders.

      "A man has been arrested for allegedly using his cell phone to take video of young girls changing clothes in a Bedford, New Hampshire, Target store, reports say.[Bedford police announced that Zachery Bishop was arrested after Target shoppers complained that they saw him filming little girls in the changing area. advertisement, “Allegedly the young ladies were in the fitting room and they observed a device over the top of the partition between the two rooms,” said Bedford Police Chief John Bryfonski, as reported by WFXT ABC TV. After getting dressed, she confronted the man, who then pushed her aside. “She continued to tussle with him,” CBS Boston reported. One woman who accused the 22-year-old man even physically intervened to detain him for police she followed him out the store and attempted to restrain him after a confrontation with Target employees. Chief Bryfonski noted that it is likely Bishop has engaged in this behavior before, and asked the public if they recognized him and had any run-ins with him in the past. The Bedford Target put out a statement about the incident:, At Target, our guests are at the center of everything we do and our commitment to creating a safe and secure shopping environment in our stores is unwavering. As a part [of] this commitment to safety, we have robust procedures, policies and trainings in place to ensure that our stores are safe places to shop and work.

      "Former President Bill Clinton ridiculed Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump for his slogan “Make America Great Again” suggesting that it was a false promise to American voters and racially motivated.[“That message, I’ll give you America great again — If you’re a white southerner, you know exactly what it means,” Clinton said. advertisement, The former president indicated that Trump’s campaign slogan signaled that he would make white people more culturally dominate over other races in the country. “What it means is I’ll give you the economy you had 50 years ago and I’ll move you back up the social totem pole and other people down,” Clinton said. Clinton insisted that Trump was only hurting blue collar workers, suggesting the Republican candidate was only cynically lying to get their votes. “I get it … that’s my culture,” he said. “And I have watched more working class white people manipulated all my life. People rubbing salt into their wounds instead of bandaging their wounds.”, Clinton also suggested that Trump’s vow to make America great again was a false promise. “Saying I’d like to Make America Great again is like me saying I’d like to be 20 again,” Clinton said. “Actually I would,” he chuckled, “But I wouldn’t vote for anyone promising to make me 20 again.”, However, Clinton failed to mention that in the 2008 Democratic primary, he cut a radio ad for Hillary — promising voters that she would “Make America Great Again.”, , Clinton made his remarks during a political rally for Hillary Clinton in Orlando, Florida, and reminded the audience that he had just turned 70. “I don’t know how I got so old,” he said. “It really bothers me that Hillary’s opponent seems doing best among older people.”, Clinton returned to his criticism of white working voters in West Virginia, describing them as angry people walking around wearing Trump shirts. He explained that coal production had already peaked, and that it was important to change America’s sources of energy to solar panels and windmills to prevent global warming. Blue collar workers from Southern Virginia and East Kentucky, he asserted, were “hurt” and needed more help from the federal government. Clinton also appeared frustrated by Trump’s rhetoric on the campaign trail. “This country is being hurt with all this constant na, na, na, na, na,” he said. “This is about you and your future and you should vote for Hillary because she’s the best change maker I ever knew.”\n",
      "The Obama administration and international community are using “alternate legal pathways” to bring more Syrian refugees to the United States outside of the refugee resettlement program, including encouraging colleges and universities to award scholarships to Syrians refugees.[According to a new report from the Center for Immigration Studies, U.S. colleges have awarded 150 Syrian students scholarships and the number of Syrians on campus is expected to grow to meet international needs. advertisement, “The numbers for 2016 will probably be much higher to meet the hundreds of thousands in need. Granted, a significant number will be admitted to universities in the Middle East, but many others will be joining U.S. campuses,” CIS senior researcher and report author Nayla Rush explained. Spearheading the effort, according to Rush, is the nonprofit Institute of International Education (IIE), which is largely funded by foreign governments, international organizations, and U.S. government agencies. “IIE administers the Fulbright Program, which is sponsored by the U.S. Department of State,” Rush wrote. “The Fulbright Scholar Program takes on ‘two of the biggest challenges facing the world today: climate change and the refugee crisis caused by the Syrian civil war.’ One wonders about such ostensibly private sponsorships, which are largely funded with public money and are fully aligned with this administration’s policies.”, President Obama has pledged to resettle at least 10,000 Syrian refugees in the U.S. by the end of this fiscal year, in spite of concerns voice by top security officials and Republicans that the U.S. lacks the vetting capabilities and information required to suss out terrorist threats from the refugee flow. According to Rush, the administration is also looking for other avenues to bring more Syrian refugees into the U.S. outside of the refugee program. “The Obama administration is working diligently to bring in as many Syrian refugees as possible and has developed ‘alternative legal pathways’ for refugees in order to circumvent the numerical targets of the refugee resettlement program,” Rush said in a statement. “Thousands of additional refugees can enter this country under the indirect routes the administration is encouraging, including student visas, academic scholarships, medical admissions, and employment contracts as well as broader family reunification programs.”\n",
      "Juliet Eilperin, The Washington Post’s White House bureau chief, emailed several people close to Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta, to give him a “heads up” that his name would appear in a pending article about lobbyists, according to Wikileaks.[The Eilperin article was published in March 2015, and was titled, “Obama promised to curb the influence of lobbyists. Has he succeeded?”, advertisement, Throughout the email exchange uncovered by Wikileaks, Eilperin tried to reassure Podesta that his place in the pending story is just “one line” buried late in the story. She also reached out to several people to make sure that it did not catch Podesta “off guard.”, “I just wanted to give you and John a heads up on a story that might run as early as Monday,” Eilperin wrote March 22, 2015,  to Eryn Sepp, who had worked as an assistant to Podesta at the Center for American Progress (CAP). Long story short, it’s about the ethics rules Obama adopted in 2009, and how they’ve been implemented. In that context, I mention that some WH officials have had ties to advocacy groups and activists before entering the WH even if they weren’t formally lobbyists. I mention that John accepted donations from Hansjorg Wyss and Tom Steyer when he headed CAP, and obviously they care about environmental issues. I had asked Frank about this when John was still in the WH, but we never closed the loop on this. Anyway, it is just one line well into the text of a long story, but I didn’t want it to catch you both off guard. Best,Juliet, To make sure that Podesta got the message, Eilperin forwarded her email to Frank Benenati, an administration EPA official. She again tried to minimize the impact on Podesta and reassured that she doesn’t “mention anything specific about the Wyss contract.”, I sent this note to Eryn yesterday, I just wanted to make sure John Podesta had a heads up that his name will be in a story concerning the White House’s ethics policy, which could run on Monday. I don’t mention anything specific about the Wyss contract (since I never got a response from you on it), but I do mention that both Wyss and Steyer were CAP donors while he headed the organization. This is just one line, pretty low down in the piece, but I don’t want him to be surprised since we never discussed it face-to-face. Can you just make sure he gets this note over the weekend?, Podesta asked Benenati to find out “where she is coming from on this?” Benenati replied to Podesta, saying he would reach out and then shortly after, emailed him another message from Eilperin with the exact quote from the story, and her request to “let me know if there are any issues with it”. “And the liberal think tank Center for American Progress–which former White House senior counselor John D. Podesta founded, and helped lead before joining the administration to oversee its climate and public lands agenda–had accepted major donations from environmentally-minded billionaires Tom Steyer and Hansjorg Wyss before he joined Obama’s staff.”, Let me know if there are any issues with it, but the donations from Steyer and Wyss are a matter of public record. I’m not mentioning the contract Podesta had with Wyss because you never got back to me on that, and I didn’t want to mention it without getting some sort of response in advance. Eventually, Podesta decided it was “probably not worth worrying about.”, Dustin Stockton is a political reporter for Breitbart News, a community liaison for Gun Owners of America, and a political strategist.

      "The Los Angeles Times — which did its best, it admits, to ensure that President Donald Trump would not be elected — has printed a strident, and nearly hysterical, editorial in which it calls the Trump presidency a “train wreck.”[Among other things, the Times states:, advertisement, It was no secret during the campaign that Donald Trump was a narcissist and a demagogue who used fear and dishonesty to appeal to the worst in American voters. The Times called him unprepared and unsuited for the job he was seeking, and said his election would be a “catastrophe.”, Still, nothing prepared us for the magnitude of this train wreck. …, In a matter of weeks, President Trump has taken dozens of real-life steps that, if they are not reversed, will rip families apart, foul rivers and pollute the air, intensify the calamitous effects of climate change and profoundly weaken the system of American public education for all. …, What is most worrisome about Trump is Trump himself. He is a man so unpredictable, so reckless, so petulant, so full of blind self-regard, so untethered to reality that it is impossible to know where his presidency will lead or how much damage he will do to our nation. His obsession with his own fame, wealth and success, his determination to vanquish enemies real and imagined, his craving for adulation — these traits were, of course, at the very heart of his scorched-earth outsider campaign indeed, some of them helped get him elected. But in a real presidency in which he wields unimaginable power, they are nothing short of disastrous. The editorial comes just days after Trump’s “unimaginable power” proved unable to force through a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare. There were few, if any, Times editorials criticizing President Barack Obama’s narcissism and expansion of executive powers (after promising to curtail the same). Read the whole editorial here.

      "Elon Musk is threatening to resign from President Donald Trump’s business advisory panel if he extracts Americans from the Paris Climate Agreement which indirectly subsidizes Musk’s multiple billion-dollar business projects.[The Wednesday threat came after news reports announced that Trump has decided to quit the 2016 agreement, which critics say would increase energy costs for U.S. consumers, factories and workplaces. , advertisement, The threat was delivered via a pair of tweets from the entrepreneur, who has skillfully harnessed a variety of federal regulations to subsidize his Tesla electric-car company, his SolarCity energy company, and a Nevada battery factory. Don't know which way Paris will go, but I've done all I can to advise directly to POTUS, through others in WH &amp via councils, that we remain, — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 31, 2017, , Will have no choice but to depart councils in that case, — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 31, 2017, , Trump is under huge pressure from his supporters and many business groups to quit President Barack Obama’s Paris deal, which has not been sent to the Senate for approval. When shaking hands on the deal, Obama promised the United States would reduce “global warming” by cutting U.S. emission of “greenhouses gases” by one-quarter by 2025, chiefly by taxing natural fuels and subsidizing new solar energy. Trump’s decision to quit the Paris deal would help many U.S. manufacturing industries by reducing the cost of energy from burning coal, oil, and natural gas. That cheaper energy would be a big gain for the hard-pressed manufacturing communities in the midwestern states whose voters carried Trump over the Democrats’ “Blue Wall” November 8, 2016. , But if Trump pulls out of the Paris deal, it will damage the political support and government subsidies given by Democrats to the new low-carbon industries concentrated in the Democratic-voting West and Southwest. For example, the Los Angeles Times reported that Musk’s battery factory in Reno, Nevada is reported to have enjoyed roughly $1.3 billion in state subsidies, his SolarCity company has gotten $1.5 billion from federal solar-regulations, In California, the state legislature allowed his Tesla Motors to sell more than $500 million worth of carbon energy credits, said the Los Angeles Times, and the state’s anti-pollution agency allows the owners of battery-operated cars to use low-traffic “high occupancy” lanes in gridlocked Los Angeles. Musk’s solar-energy company in New York state has reportedly gained $1 billion in near-term and short-term investment from Democratic politicians said the newspaper. , Unsurprisingly, Musk is a strong advocate for growing “carbon taxes” on natural fuels. In a January 2017 interview with Gizmodo, Musk declared: , CO2 [carbon diooxide] isn’t exactly pollution, but it does cause warming and slight acidification of water if very large quantities are dug from deep underground and added to the surface cycle. The problem is the age-old tragedy of the commons. The common good being consumed is atmospheric and oceanic carbon capacity, which currently has a price of zero. This results in an error in market signals and far more CO2 is generated than should be. We won’t ever go to zero CO2, but the rate over time should be dropped far below what it is today. Start low and increase it until the desired outcome is achieved. This can be offset by a reduction in other taxes, like sales tax, which is quite regressive. This is analogous to taxing cigarettes and alcohol more than fruits and vegetables, which everybody agrees makes sense. We should have higher taxes on the things that science says are probably bad for us than those that are probably good for us. Under criticism from progressives, Musk also championed his participation in Trump’s advisory council, telling Gizmodo that “the more voices of reason that the President hears, the better. Simply attacking him will achieve nothing. Are you aware of a single case where Trump bowed to protests or media attacks? Better that there are open channels of communication.”, New York investors, including Goldman Sachs, have made big bets on the preservation of the Paris deal, according to The Huffington Post. \n",
      "The Mexican government has begun to circle the wagons as the possibility of a Trump presidency begins to take shape. This week, Mexico changed key members of it’s diplomatic team in order to “remain firm” amid what they are calling a “hostile” environment.[These comments were made Wednesday afternoon by Mexico’s Foreign Relations Minister Claudia Ruiz Massieu during a meeting with various members of that country’s senate, Mexico’s La Jornada reported. During that meeting, Ruiz Massieu spoke about the most significant change, the recent replacement of Mexican Ambassador to the U.S. Miguel Basanez by Carlos Sada Solana. The change was a sudden one since Basanez had only served as ambassador for seven months before he was replaced. , advertisement, In addition to replacing Mexico’s ambassador, the goverment is expected to change various consuls and other members of its diplomatic team in the coming days in what they are calling a “change in strategy.” , Citing an “increase in hostilities” by U.S. Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump, Riuz Massieu said Mexico needed for its foreign policies to be more intense and strategic. Mexico’s reaction comes in an apparent response to a newly revealed strategy by Donald Trump, who as Breitbart News reported,  released his plan to force Mexico to pay for a proposed border wall. The plan calls for Mexico to make a one time payment of $5-10 billion or he would use the U.S. Patriot Act to cut off remittances or money transfers sent to Mexico. , Trump’s hard stance against illegal immigration, drug cartels and transnational crime has earned him increasing popularity and the recent endorsement of the National Border Patrol Council, the union that represents close to 17,000 men and women that make up the U.S. Border Patrol, Breitbart Texas recently reported.  His hard stance on border issues has also made him a target for left of center news outlets. , Ildefonso Ortiz is an award winning journalist with Breitbart Texas you can follow him on Twitter and on Facebook.\n",
      "The Trump administration’s proposed border wall is expected to be as tall as 30 feet and no shorter than 18 feet to deter potential illegal immigrants, Homeland Security officials said Friday.[U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has started the process of requesting bids from various companies that would include design proposals and prototypes of President Trump’s proposed barrier along the U.S.-Mexico border, the Washington Times reported. advertisement, The agency has released two proposals for contractors who want to submit a bid: a solid, concrete wall and a wall with “a see-through component/capability.”, “The wall design shall be physically imposing in height,” CBP officials said in contracting documents. The agency said the goal is to have a 30-foot wall, but it will accept proposals as low as 18 feet. They also said the wall must be at least six feet underground to prevent anyone from tunneling underneath it and high enough that no one can climb the wall without a ladder, NPR reports. It should take at least an hour, and ideally more than four hours, to make a hole in the wall so agents can stop anyone attempting to break it down. The government outlines that the wall must be able to withstand a “sledgehammer, car jack, pick axe, chisel, battery operated impact tools, battery operated cutting tools, Oxy/acetylene torch or other similar hand-held tools.”, In the documents, CBP says that the side facing the U.S. must also be “aesthetically pleasing” in “color, anti-climb texture etc. to be consistent with general surrounding environment.” There was no mention of how the Mexican side should look. About 700 companies have registered as potential vendors for the project since CBP first began weighing interest this month. Contractors have until March 29 to submit their proposals for the first phase of the project.\n",
      "Bloomberg News is reporting that Mark Fields, the CEO of Ford Motor Co. is open to brokering a deal with President-elect Donald Trump to keep jobs in the United States.[Ford’s CEO indicated he’s looking for a turnaround in the sort of overbearing government regulation that Trump campaigned against, including fuel standards put in place by the Obama administration and the EPA in 2012. As Bloomberg reported:, advertisement, “We will be very clear in the things we’d like to see,” Mark Fields said in an exclusive interview at Bloomberg offices in Southfield, Michigan. “We’ll continue to advocate for currency-manipulation rules to promote free and fair trade. One of our priorities is making sure fuel-economy standards reflect market realities, tax reform in general we would be very supportive of, and the safe deployment of autonomous vehicles.”, Just two days ago, the Washington Post reported that the Obama EPA was holding firm on the fuel standard regulations it put in place that Ford’s CEO says don’t “reflect market realities.” WaPo wrote:, The Obama administration says it plans to stick with strict fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks for the model years 2022 to 2025, despite protests from some automakers and concern about how the incoming Trump administration might alter them. Environmental Protection Agency administrator Gina McCarthy on Wednesday proposed leaving the current standards in place, saying an extensive technical analysis had shown that automakers are well positioned to meet the greenhouse gas emissions targets that were established in 2012 with the goal of reducing pollution and nearly doubling fuel economy. The mention of autonomous vehicles by Fields shows the company’s commitment to emerging auto technology. Ford said in August that it is shifting some of its business strategy to focus on driverless cars to operate as taxis, competing with startups such as Google’s Alphabet and Uber. Ford plans to have vehicles with no steering wheel, gas, or brake pedals on the road by 2021. The announcement by a major U.S. auto maker that it would work with Trump to save American jobs comes on the heels of the announcement by air conditioning maker Carrier that it would keep 1,000 jobs in the U.S. that the company was planning to movfe to Mexico. Although the Carrier deal was hailed by Trump supporters as well as workers, who sent messages of thanks to POTUS-elect Trump, it was criticized by some in the media and by a Mexican official who called the deal “worthy of a banana republic.”, Ford CEO Fields told Bloomberg that he felt there were important differences between Ford and Carrier, saying that the regulatory changes he was proposing “would impact the entire industry, as opposed to giving special deals to individual companies.”, Ford currently has about 8,800 workers in Mexico but employees 85,000 in the United States.

      "(AFP) Europe is “close to limits” on its ability to accept new waves of refugees, EU President Donald Tusk said Sunday, urging the broader international community to shoulder its share of the burden.[“The practical capability of Europe to host new waves of refugees, not to mention irregular economic migrants, is close to limits,” he told a press conference on the sidelines of the G20 summit. advertisement, A steady stream of refugees has flowed into Europe over the last year, largely fleeing from the civil war in Syria. The issue has become a political hot potato for leaders in the region as a series of Islamist terror attacks and rising anti-globalisation sentiment have combined to create an increasingly inhospitable environment for refugees from the brutal conflict. The highly publicised drowning of a three-year-old Syrian boy last year temporarily softened hostility to migrants, after pictures of his corpse lying on a Greek beach rapidly became an emblematic image of the suffering involved in their journeys. Germany threw open its borders and volunteers across Europe flocked to train stations and frontier crossings to welcome those fleeing war and poverty. But a major backlash swiftly followed. The EU’s outer borders have since come back down hard, the so-called Balkan migrant route has shut and anti-migrant sentiment has soared. Tusk said there were 65 million displaced people around the world, and “the G20 community should scale up its share of responsibility”. “We have enough space for all parties to discuss these problems including China,” he said, calling for financial assistance and development aid for migrants’ countries of origin. “Only global efforts will be able to bear fruits.”, Recent comments from leaders in Germany and Italy have signalled a hardening of attitudes about how to resolve the migrant crisis reshaping politics across Europe. In March, the EU and Turkey signed a controversial deal aimed at stemming the flow of migrants to Europe.\n",
      "President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel are blaming the internet for disrupting the forces of globalism, suggesting that technology is making it more difficult to unite people behind a common purpose.[“Because of the internet and communications, the clash of cultures is much more direct,” Obama said during a press conference on his trip to Berlin. “People feel, I think, less certain about their identity. Less certain about economic security.”, advertisement, Obama predicted that the rise of technology needed to be managed to give world citizens more control, beyond the simplistic answers found online. His German counterpart agreed. “Digitization is a disruptive force, a disruptive technological force that brings about deep-seated change, transformation of a society,” Merkel added. She compared the internet to the invention of the printing press, citing the consequences it had on industrialized countries. “It took a while until societies learned how to find the right kind of policies to contain this and to manage and steer this,” she said. Obama blamed social media for creating a climate where facts didn’t matter, asserting that facts were the basis of democracy. Social media, he explained, allowed people to get their information “in sound bites” off their phones. “Part of ways changed in politics is social media and how people are receiving information,” he said, “It’s easier to make negative attacks and simplistic slogans than it is to communicate complex policies.”, He warned that “active misinformation” packaged for Facebook was a problem when it’s creators tried to equate an “overzealousness” of a United States government official with a foreign dictator. “If we can’t discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda, then we have problems,” he warned. It’s not the first time that President Obama has griped about media, as he has floated suggestions of some kind of regulation of the internet. In October, he pointed out that it was time to move the internet beyond the “Wild Wild West” stage and proposed “truthiness tests” for media companies online. Merkel has demonstrated a propensity for censorship for social media, specifically to social media posts criticizing a flood of Syrian refugees into the country.\n",

      "As the campaign for president wound down, a survey of coverage by the big three TV networks revealed that the issues were practically ignored as the networks instead focused on the purported controversies and personalities of the candidates.[The survey, conducted by Andrew Tyndall just before the election, found that coverage of issues was sparse, indeed. The review shows that since 1988, issues coverage was rarely less than 114 minutes and was usually over 200 minutes of air time on the three networks combined. But for the 2016 campaign the nets had given the issues a scant 32 minutes of air time two weeks before Election Day. advertisement, Instead of reports on guns, health care policy, terrorism prevention plans, security, economics and the like, the networks centered their reports on fitness for office, honesty, trustworthiness, controversies, stamina, the candidates’ health, and other such issues. “With just two weeks to go,” Tyndall wrote on October 25, “issues coverage this year has been virtually non-existent. Of the 32 minutes total, terrorism (17 mins) and foreign policy (7 mins) towards the Middle East (Israel-ISIS-Syria-Iraq) have attracted some attention. Gay rights, immigration and policing have been mentioned in passing.”, “No trade, no healthcare, no climate change, no drugs, no poverty, no guns, no infrastructure, no deficits,” he added. “To the extent that these issues have been mentioned, it has been on the candidates’ terms, not on the networks’ initiative.”, Tyndall had reviewed the campaign seasons going back to 1988 and found that the issues took a much more prominent place in TV coverage. In 1988 reports on the issues took a combined 117 minutes of air time over ABC, NBC, and CBS, Tyndall found.

You’ve dis-intermediated the ability of the New York Times, the Washington Post. For Sidney Blumenthal to go in there and put pressure on these media organizations and have them play ball. The biggest change is now you’ve got full access and she can have access every day of the week on a massive news site and in a massive radio show. Klein replied:, Now, actually, in spite of the news media, and because of Breitbart and others, now Hillary is being asked about this. Bill is going out in public, and NBC and others are asking him about the interviews you see at Breitbart. It is absolutely amazing. Last week, Clinton was caught on video avoiding reporters’ questions about Juanita Broaddrick, who previously accused Clinton of raping her and spoke out on Klein’s radio show in November. Last week, Broaddrick tweeted about the rape, generating a new flurry of news media activity. This after Hillary Clinton was repeatedly heckled about Broaddrick at a town hall event in Derry, New Hampshire by Katherine Prudhomme O’Brien, a GOP state representative from Rockingham. Donald Trump  helped to skyrocket the issue of Clinton’s sex accusers to front-page status when the GOP frontrunner complained about the former president’s “terrible record of women abuse.” Trump was responding to Hillary’s claim that the billionaire exhibited a “penchant for sexism.”, “If Hillary thinks she can unleash her husband, with his terrible record of women abuse, while playing the women’s card on me, she’s wrong!” tweeted Trump. Breitbart’s Klein has been spotlighted by the news media in recent days for exclusively interviewing Bill Clinton’s famous sex accusers, including Broaddrick, Paula Jones, and Willey. Gennifer Flowers, who had consensual relations with Clinton, also warned about a Hillary presidency on Klein’s show. The interviews helped spark the current debate about Bill’s alleged female victims, a topic that has engulfed Hillary’s frontrunning campaign. The Washington Post on Thursday cited a Breitbart article in which Klein described how his radio program had become “a support center of sorts” for Bill Clinton’s female accusers — “a safe-space for these women to sound off about the way they were allegedly treated by both Bill and Hillary.”\n",
      "A group of technology CEOs have called for the government to protect their interests from China, echoing the protectionist proposals that made Donald Trump so popular during the presidential campaign.[In a report sent to outgoing President Barack Obama “but likely to influence Trump’s future policies” by a range of technology executives, the signatories call for the U.S. government to protect and support American tech companies in the face of Chinese competition. advertisement, Contributors to the report include Google parent company Alphabet’s executive chairman Eric Schmidt, Intel CEO Paul Otellini, and Qualcomm executive chairman Paul Jacobs. The report, which was published by the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, says that a “concerted push by China to reshape the market in its favor, using industrial policies backed by over one hundred billion dollars in government-directed funds, threatens the competitiveness of U.S. industry and the national and global benefits it brings.”, “We strongly recommend a coordinated Federal effort to influence and respond to Chinese industrial policy, strengthen the U.S. business environment for semiconductor investment, and lead partnerships with industry and academia to advance the boundaries of semiconductor innovation,” it continues. The report adds that U.S. authorities must “push back against innovation-inhibiting Chinese industrial policy” by reducing the number of acquisitions from Chinese companies, which they also argue could represent a threat to national security. It also urges the government to implement tax reform to attract investment, although it also calls for investing in talent both at home and abroad, something President-elect Donald Trump is likely to object to under his “America First” plan. Throughout the presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly criticised successive governments for their failure to protect America’s interests from the booming Chinese economy. Although his candidacy was widely opposed by Silicon Valley executives, it appears that the new administration and the technology industry could find some common ground.

      "Uber has hired NASA engineer Mark Moore as Director of Engineering for their flying car project “Uber Elevate,” which seeks to expand the cab service into airborne travel.[Moore worked at NASA “as an advanced aircraft engineer and basically kickstarted the current interest in vertical take-off and landing craft for short-haul urban flight with a 2010 paper on the feasibility of the helicopter-like vehicles.”, advertisement, “The engineer was impressed by Uber’s work on the subject, and saw a chance to make the vision he’d originally articulated years ago into something real, in a reasonable time scale,” according to TechCrunch. “Moore said that key to his decision to join Uber was that the company seemed to have a practical business case for making a flying commuter transit service real – and nothing would ever get done without market motivation behind the vision.”, Uber’s plans for a flying service were first hinted at in September 2016 by Uber’s Chief Product Officer Jeff Holden. In an interview, Holden shared his interest in “vertical takeoff and landing” vehicles (VTOL), claiming, “It could change cities and how we work and live.”, Holden added that he wanted to offer his customers “as many options as possible to move around,” and that passenger drone technology could be a fully functioning norm within a decade. “VTOL is another way to do that,” said Holden, after talking about ways to decrease city traffic. Uber’s Head of Product for Advanced Programs, Nikhil Goel, confirmed in a statement that Moore would be working on VTOL vehicles. “Uber continues to see its role as an catalyst to the growing developing VTOL ecosystem,” said Goel in the statement. “We’re excited to have Mark join us to work with companies and stakeholders as we continue to explore the use case described in our white paper.”, In 2015, rapper Jay-Z and other high-profile individuals, including members of the Saudi Arabian royal family, invested $20 million in JetSmarter, which has been billed as “the Uber for flying,” while an Israeli tech firm is also prepared to launch their passenger-carrying drone service in 2020, following 15 years of development.

      "California Governor Jerry Brown vetoed a bill Wednesday that would have increased financial oversight of the state’s high-speed rail project, which aims to connect San Francisco to Los Angeles but lacks the necessary funds and rights of way.[The bill, AB 2847, would have added to the California High-Speed Rail Authority’s existing requirement to produce an updated business plan every two years, requiring a projection of financial costs for each proposed segment of the route as well. advertisement, The Los Angeles Times reported that the bill incorporated new recommendations from the Legislative Analyst’s Office. “The analyst’s office had recommended that the rail authority provide more information about how a $43-billion gap in funding the construction would be closed,” the Times‘ Ralph Vartabedian reported. Legislators became concerned that the state had begun committing funds to a project that would never be completed without new, significant sources of cash — from somewhere. Assemblyman Jim Patterson, the former mayor of Fresno, introduced the bill — and won the approval of both parties, a rare feat for a Republican in Sacramento. “If this project keeps going forward without the necessary oversight, it will continue to collapse,” he was quoted by the Times as saying. “It is already in the process of collapsing in front of our eyes. It is a make-believe project.”, But Brown, who has seized on the high-speed rail project as a cornerstone of his anti-climate change policy, vetoed the bill, saying that the High-Speed Rail Authority already had sufficient requirements in place. “As with other projects of this magnitude, state law requires strict standards of accountability and transparency, and I have every expectation that the authority will meet these high standards,” Brown said, according to the Times. The bill passed both the Assembly and the Senate without opposition, but it is unclear whether there are enough votes in both houses to override the governor’s veto. Joel B.

      "Dr. Kesten Green, the co-author of a study that revealed just “a fraction of 1 percent” of scientific journal papers follow the scientific method, joined Breitbart News Editor-In-Chief Alex Marlow on Breitbart News Daily to discuss how scientists have betrayed their profession in favor of political advocacy.[“There is a problem,” declared Dr. Green to Marlow, who was hosting the show. “Most of what passes for scientific research these days is either useless, or it’s harmful, because it seems like science, but it’s actually designed to support a predetermined position. And advocacy is the opposite of science.”, advertisement, “These aren’t new phenomena, but probably the sheer volume of useless research and the extent that pseudo-science and advocacy is encouraged… are new,” he continued. “Why is that happening?”, Marlow went on to compare the problem with many journalists, who ignore research discovered during their time writing an article in favor of a predetermined political narrative. “Dr. Green, one parallel that I find in the journalism world, which is where I make my living, is that a lot of reporters you can see they go out to write a story, and they start researching and start investigating, and then they merely write the story they thought they were going to write, where any good, honest reporter will inevitably find surprises,” Marlow explained. “They’ll inevitably have their thinking and world view shaped by their own research, yet a temptation is just to write the piece you thought you were going to write when you set out and began your research. So this seems to be what’s happening in the scientific community, which is they come to the conclusion before they’ve gathered the evidence.”, “That’s a very good parallel,” Dr. Green responded. “We were rather surprised about this initially, going ‘gosh, this is really how scientists are working’… “The global warming alarm for example, and to our surprise, we found alarms, environmentalist alarms, were being raised by scientists about environmental catastrophes which they promised were going to happen and the government needed to do something about it, were actually common phenomenons. So this advocacy thing, with scientists as advocates, is actually a common thing we found.”, Listen to Dr. Green’s full discussion with Alex Marlow below. , You can also listen to Alex Marlow’s discussion with Dr. Green’s co-author, Professor J.

A police spokesman described the atmosphere as “very dynamic” and “fairly aggressive” in places. Footage broadcast by the n-dtv network showed antifa marching under the cover of smoke bombs, throwing lit flares and trying to frighten police horses.

      "TEL AVIV — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Barack Obama set aside their differences on Wednesday and said farewell in a meeting that took place in a “light-hearted atmosphere,” a senior Israeli official said.[The official, who traveled to New York as part of the Israeli delegation to the UN, contradicted reports from a White House official that the meeting was dominated by Obama’s profound “concerns about the corrosive effect that settlement activity, that is continuing when the occupation enters its 50th year, is having on the prospects of the two state solution.”, advertisement, According to the Israel official, who spoke to the Times of Israel, the hitherto acrimonious relationship between the two leaders is “mellowing.”, “There is an interesting change in the relations [between them]. It’s like an on old couple that is just getting to know each other.”, Another senior Israeli official concurred with the assessment of the two leaders as “old,” comparing them to Statler and Waldorf, the two grumpy old men from the Muppet Show. Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said he doubted reports that Obama would use the meeting to discuss the notion of a new peace initiative to be implemented between elections and his final day in office in the new year. Prior to the closed-door meeting, which lasted an hour, the two joked for the cameras and Obama mused about future visits to Israel that will not be for diplomatic purposes, but rather to take his family to see the “sights and sounds of a remarkable country.”, Obama did, however, mention his concerns over Israel’s settlement activity, though he did not expound on the point. The Israeli official contended that the settlement issue was not discussed further at the meeting. “There’s an elephant in the room. But [they] didn’t talk about it,” the official said, adding that settlements “weren’t the essence of the meeting. They didn’t take up much time in the conversation. It was a marginal part of the meeting.”, According to the official, Netanyahu briefly reiterated his view that Israelis living in the West Bank are not an obstacle to peace, while the Palestinian demand for the right of return and the refusal to recognize a Jewish state are impediments. On Tuesday, Obama said Israel could not continue occupying Palestinian land in his speech at the UN General Assembly. The majority of the meeting was comprised of security and intelligence-related discussions regarding the Middle East at large, the official said. Syria was discussed at length, as well as other issues concerning military cooperation between the U.S. and Israel. Iran was mentioned but the official did not comment further on that. “We agree on almost everything. We coordinate on more things than people think,” the senior official said, adding that military and intelligence cooperation is “truly a two-way street.”, The meeting between the two leaders was likely the last face-to-face encounter before Obama leaves office.\n",
      "Every child deserves an equal opportunity to learn. Yet today millions of children across our nation find themselves trapped in failing schools, barring them from the chance to receive the education they need to climb out of poverty and up the economic ladder.[All parents and students who want educational choice should have it. Yet in Texas alone, 105,000 kids are waiting to be admitted to charter schools, and throughout the nation, more than a million children await acceptance into charter schools. advertisement, While there remains an enormous task before us to give every child access to a quality education, I am encouraged by progress that has been made in my home state of Texas. Since 2000, the number of charter schools in Texas has more than tripled. And currently before the Texas Legislature are significant measures that will continue to expand school choice across our state. The facts are unequivocal – school choice improves students’ test scores, keeps them in school longer, saves taxpayer dollars, provides a safer learning environment, and increases competition and quality in traditional public schools. School choice is the civil rights issue of the 21st century – it’s opening doors for children to pursue their talents and ambitions, and it’s providing some of our poorest students a ticket to a better life and more promising future. Now is the time to open the gateway of opportunity to children across the country. We need to expand charters, vouchers, education savings account programs, and educational options for all children, regardless of their race, ethnicity or zip code. Today, Texans are rallying in Austin to raise awareness for the opportunities the Texas Legislature has this session to make meaningful inroads in further expanding school choice across our state. I stand in support of them and proudly stand with our state leaders, like Gov. Greg Abbott, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and many others who are working hard to make the dream of education equality a reality. Together, we can unlock the gates of opportunity, and unleash the potential of every child to become the next success story in our nation’s long history of exceptionalism.\n",
      "Israel is to start collecting value added tax (VAT) and income taxes from foreign companies that do substantial business over the Internet in Israel.[Under new guidelines issued by the Israel Tax Authority on Monday, foreign companies that operate websites and sell various services such as advertising and brokerage will be subject to 17 percent VAT as well as income tax on their activities in Israel. advertisement, Companies expected to be affected include Alphabet’s Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Ebay. These and other companies that do a lot of business in Israel will be required to register with authorities as an approved enterprise so that transactions are liable for VAT. Until now, a foreign company’s income from providing services in Israel was only subject to tax if it was generated in Israel. A company would be liable for tax only if its activity rendered it a “permanent establishment.”, But the Israeli authorities have widened the definition of permanent to include online businesses, where the economic activity of the foreign company is mainly through the Internet. A spokesman for Google in Israel declined to comment. Ebay, Facebook and Amazon were not immediately available for comment. There has been pressure building for some time for foreign companies operating in Israel to pay more tax. The issue has been raised in parliament that foreign firms do not pay the same tax rates as Israeli ones, creating a business environment that favors international companies. Last week, a blimp with “Google must pay tax” written across it floated over the Tel Aviv skyline and near Google’s offices. The tax authority is also seeking to implement a law in which digital services – such as downloading music or books – from a foreign online store would also be subject to VAT.

      "Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Scott Pruitt met with eleven Western Governors at a breakfast on Sunday, honoring a promise he made during his confirmation hearings and at CPAC on Sunday to reach out to state governments to re-establish trust.[“There’s distrust right now that exists between the states and Washington, D.C. as it relates to the environment,” Pruitt told the crowd at CPAC on Saturday. advertisement, “We need to do what we can to restore trust. I’m going to be spending time … with the state governors and the executive branches of [state] government … I’m going to send a message. Let’s join arm-in-arm to do what’s important for the environment,” Pruitt said. Less than twenty-four hours later, Pruitt held the meeting with Western Governors, who appeared to welcome the dialogue. The governors of nineteen western states are members of the Western Governors Association. “The Western Governors Association wants a better state and federal partnership,” Governor Steve Bullock of Montana, current chairman of the group, said in a statement released by the EPA. “I look forward to working together with the Western Governors on issues unique to the Western States and with each of these Governors on issues important to their individual states,” EPA Administrator Pruitt said. “These Governors and their states are great stewards of their natural resources. They want to protect their water and air and grow their economies. The Environmental Protection Agency is going to help them do that,” he added. “In his first week on the job as EPA Administrator, Scott Pruitt has now met with 18 Governors and Lieutenant Governors, putting into action his promise of an open door policy and a new beginning of partnership with the states,” the EPA said in its statement. Last week, the Western Governors Association sent a letter to the EPA’s Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery, “reiterat[ing] concerns” over a propsed rule, Financial Responsbility Requirements under CERCLA for Classes of Facilities in the Hardrock Mining Industry. “Many western states rely on the hardrock mining industry for economic development and employment,” the governors wrote:, These states have staff dedicated to mine permitting and compliance. Such staff are committed to ensuring hardrock mining facilities are designed, constructed and operated in a manner that minimizes risks to the environment and ensures proper site reclamation. “The EPA’s proposed rule … will negatively affect state economies,” they continued. “It may also hamper existing, effective state financial assurance programs,” they added. Pruitt’s meeting with the governors on Sunday is the kind of reaching out he intends to conduct with state governments across the country to address and respond to their concerns. Twelve members of the group met with Pruitt on Sunday. Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper did not participate in the breakfast, but was in attendance in other meetings. Of the twelve members of the Western Governors Association who met with EPA Administrator Pruitt, seven are Republicans ( Governor Doug Burgum (N.D.), Governor Butch Otter (Idaho),  Governor Mary Fallin (Okla.),  Governor Brian Sandoval (Nev.), Governor Gary Herbert (Utah), Governor Dennis Daugaard (S.D.),  Governor Matt Mead (Wyo.) ). Four are Democrats ( Governor John Hickenlooper (Colo.), Governor Kate Brown (Ore.), Governor Steve Bullock (Mont.), and Governor David Ige (Hawaii) ) and one member, Governor Bill Walker (Alaska), is an independent. The seven members of the Western Governors Association who missed the meeting with Pruitt included five Republicans (Governor Doug Ducey (Arizona), Governor Sam Brownback (Kansas), Governor Pete Ricketts (Nebraska), Governor Susanna Martinez (New Mexico), and Governor Greg Abbot (Texas) ) and two Democrats (Governor Jerry Brown (California) and Governor Jay Inslee (Washington).\n",
      "A new “happiness” report organized by a left-wing academic reports that Denmark is the happiest nation on Earth. The least happy country is Burundi, and the US ranks 13th just behind Austria but ahead of Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, the UK, Spain and France.[Based on data developed by the Gallup World Poll, the survey looked at GDP per capita, healthy years of life expectancy, social support, corruption in government or business, personal generosity, and trust. advertisement, The report was organized by Columbia University professor Jeffrey Sachs, who also runs something called the Earth Institute, a program at Columbia University dedicated to advocacy on global warming and “sustainable development.” Sachs has been deeply entrenched at the UN in advocating for abortion as a method of economic development. Very controversially the Vatican has been working with Sachs in recent months on development issues. The big change in this year’s report is that is called happiness inequality. “We have previously argued that happiness, as measured by life evaluations, provides a broader indicator of human welfare than do measures of income, poverty, health, education, and good government viewed separately,” says the report. They “now argue that inequality of well-being provides a better measure of the distribution of welfare than is provided by income and wealth…”, The authors argue, “In the world as whole, in eight of the 10 global regions, and in more than half of the countries surveyed there was a significant increase in the inequality of happiness. In contrast, no global region, and fewer than one in 10 countries showed significant reductions in happiness inequality over that period.”, One of the most alarming aspects of the report, released this week in Rome, Italy, is that people are happiest who have no or fewer children. Children are a negative indicator for happiness all over the world but most especially in richer countries. The report does not explain why this might be so, sleeplessness and the common difficulties of having babies in the house, however, the survey also shows that happiness with children increases in old age and in widowhood. The new anti-child data will no doubt be used for further suppression of fertility. Denmark, a nation of no more than 6 million citizens, has among the lowest fertility rates in the world.\n",

Notably, neither mentioned the accusations against Trump, which Clinton and her surrogates have mentioned at nearly every other opportunity in the past several days. advertisement, They likely avoided the topic for a very good reason: Al Gore has been accused of worse, and has even faced police investigation for sexual assault, though (he has never been charged). As the Business Insider reported in 2010:, Former Vice President Al Gore has been hit by new allegations of sexual assault. This time, it’s two more massage therapists bringing the charges. The former VP is already in hot water, fighting abuse claims in Portland, where another masseuse said Gore groped her in ’06 and asked her to perform a “chakra release” (massage-speak for “hand job”.) He denies everything. The new allegations are said to have taken place at two hotels – one in Beverly Hills in 2007, when Gore was in Hollywood for the Oscars, the other in Tokyo in 2008. A source from the luxury hotel in Beverly Hills told The Enquirer: “The therapist claimed that when they were alone, Gore shrugged off a towel and stood naked in front of her.” He then propositioned her for a sexual act, according to The Enquirer. One accuser called Gore a “crazed sex poodle.”, In their reporting on the joint Clinton-Gore appearance, the media ignored the allegations against Gore, even as he shared the stage with Hillary Clinton.

      "A migrant attempting to cross the border into Texas had to be rescued by Border Patrol agents after succumbing to frigid water in Rio Grande River.[Border Patrol agents assigned to the Eagle Pass Sector in south Texas responded to possible illegal activity along the river. When they arrived, they discovered a man stranded in the frigid water having failed to make a successful crossing. advertisement, An agent who is also an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) and others rescued the man from the river and determined he was suffering from hypothermia — a potentially deadly condition where the person’s core body temperature drops, causing the brain to shut down critical organs. The man was transported to Fort Duncan Regional Medical Center for treatment, information obtained from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials stated. The rescue took place around sunrise on Monday. The man, later identified only as a 21-year-old Honduran national, was released from the hospital following treatment. Agents took custody of the illegal immigrant and transported him to the Eagle Pass South Border Patrol Station where he will be processed in accordance with local policies. Del Rio Sector Border Patrol officials warned that while the climate in south Texas is generally warm, the cold water can act quickly on the body creating a dangerous situation. “The winter months can bring about environmental hazards that all individuals must heed,” CBP officials wrote. “Immersion in water and exposure to cool air will accelerate the progression of hypothermia and possible death.”, “This event highlights the environmental hazards that undocumented immigrants face,” Del Rio Sector Acting Chief Patrol Agent Matthew J.

      "The California High-Speed Rail Authority came up empty when it asked the outgoing administration of President Barack Obama for a $15 billion loan, the Los Angeles Times reports.[State officials feared that with Republican Donald J. Trump taking office — somewhat unexpectedly — in January, and perhaps cutting off funding to the struggling project, which has never had a clear idea of how it would be financed, they would appeal to the Obama administration for a financial break. advertisement, The Times notes:, With the Obama administration on its way out, it seemed like a good time to nail down more long-term federal support on the assumption that Hillary Clinton would be the next president. So the state set up a meeting to ask the U.S. Department of Transportation to publicly announce a federal loan of up to $15 billion that would help build an initial rail segment from San Jose to Shafter, northwest of Bakersfield, which would cement federal support during the transition to a new presidential administration. Such a loan — even the commitment for one — would also show potential private investors that the project was “creditworthy,” according to a briefing document for the meeting. But federal officials did not go along with the state’s suggestion. “At this time, California has not submitted a financing request,” said Clark Pettig, press secretary for the Transportation Department. The failure of the last-ditch effort leaves the project’s future in doubt. Ironically, the Trump transition team has been talking about making large capital investments in infrastructure, to the tune of some $1 trillion nationwide. However, the incoming Trump administration plans to use private capital where possible — something California’s high-speed rail had trouble attracting. And it intends to aim investment where it would actually be economically feasible. For high-speed rail in California, that might mean a train from Los Angeles to Las Vegas — not from the Bay Area to L.A. At any rate, with Trump’s victory, the proposal so beloved by Gov. Jerry Brown — touted as something of an answer to climate change, rather than a giant “green elephant” — looks to be a rail to nowhere. Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

But they also repeatedly acknowledged there are limits to what they can control, and they recognize they face legitimate challenges from cyber intrusions to the myriad adjacent parts that go into an election, including online registration records and publicizing vote tallies. While any manipulation of a state’s official election results is seen as unlikely, there’s little denying that an Internet disruption or hack could cause significant confusion and chaos on Election Day, a dark conclusion to an ugly election plagued by accusations of Russian cyber espionage and evidence-less allegations of vote tampering and rigging. Just last week, hackers temporarily froze a sizable chunk of the internet, a worst-case scenario that would cause serious problems around the country if duplicated on Nov. 8 — the day more than 100 million Americans are going to the polls. …, Federal agencies have also been scrambling since the summer to help state and local officials prepare emergency plans for the 2016 election, including via an added emphasis on cyber risks. Breaches earlier this summer to the voter registration databases in Illinois and Arizona prompted the FBI to issue a nationwide alert to the other states.

Rex Tillerson has the potential to be an excellent Sec of State. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 24, 2017, , advertisement, Musk responded to the January 24 tweet by The Economist that Tillerson, as U.S. Secretary of State would have the “integrity to talk sense to his boss,” by supportively commenting, “This may sound surprising coming from me, but I agree with The Economist. Rex Tillerson has the potential to be an excellent Sec of State.”, The blogosphere exploded as the left’s social justice warriors lashed out at Musk with viciously colorful language that Musk was a fraud and a sellout to Trump and to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Rumors also flew that Musk was angling for a new carbon tax in exchange for his support of Trump. The viral tech blog Gizmodo, in describing Musk as a “tycoon using his influence to innovate towards a techno-utopian future powered by clean energy and complete with human cities on Mars” ran an article about how shocking was that a disruptive tech entrepreneur like Musk could support a 40-year fossil fuel leader like Tillerson, who once described the concept of fully electric vehicles as a daunting pipe dream. Musk is one of the few Silicon Valley tech CEOs who normally avoids commenting on most political issues. That may be due to his masterful ability to amass of $13.2 billion net worth, despite almost never actually making a profit in the companies that he operates. Arguably, Musk’s comparative business advantage over other CEOs has been his unrivaled ability to convince federal, state and local Democrat and Republican elected officials to provide a dizzying array of almost $5 billion in taxpayer subsidies so that Musk can pursue his adventures in space travel, solar panels and electric cars. Musk is fully aware that Tillerson is no neophyte rube in the technological and political controversies swirling around Climate Change. The Rockefeller Family Fund, formerly the dominant ExxonMobil shareholder, announced last year it would divest from fossil fuels and claimed that Exxon was misleading investors about the risks of climate change. Shortly thereafter, the Securities and Exchange Commission ruled that ExxonMobil was required to allow shareholders to vote on a climate change resolution. Silicon Valley, also referred to as the Valley of the Democrats, seemed stunned that Musk would respond positively to Tillerson. But Musk told to Bloomberg Tech’s Dana Hull that “Rex is an exceptionally competent executive, understands geopolitics and knows how to win for his team. His team is now the USA.” Musk added that was a good reason to give Tillerson the “benefit of the doubt unless his actions prove otherwise.”, Musk, who once said Trump was “not the right guy” to be president of the United States, quickly triangulated after Trump’s election triumph to having himself named to the new president’s business advisory team. He was also one of the 13 tech executives — along with Apple CEO Tim Cook, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and Alphabet CEO Larry Page — to attend Trump’s high-tech forum at Trump Tower in mid-December. With the Rasmussen Reports daily Presidential Tracking Poll for January 26 showing that President Trump has caught former President Obama at a 59% approval rating with likely U.S. voters, other Silicon Valley CEOs may find it in their business interest to join Musk in flouting the Silicon Valley political orthodoxy.\n",
      "Harvard Law School has announced the launch of a series of paid fellowships for research on issues of Islamic law during the 2017-2018 academic year, aimed at influencing public discourse and U.S. policy on Sharia.[According to a recent email sent by the director of Harvard’s Islamic Legal Studies Program, Intisar Rabb, the launch of the new program comes “just in time” for the beginning of the Trump administration and has the goal of “building a community of Islamic law scholars in the academy” as well as informing “policy and media discourse about Islamic law.”, advertisement, Fellows will receive a stipend of up to $5,000 per month and are expected to promote the development of policy papers “at the intersection of Islamic law and relevant issues of U.S. policy.” These policy papers will include short commentary on recent cases or other Islamic law sources, longer policy briefs, or op-eds, according to the law school website. Harvard’s SHARIAsource Portal has amassed a digital library of Sharia case law from around the world, with 25 editors from 21 different institutions (6 outside of the U.S.) and 1711 primary sources from 18 different countries. The data includes 902 Sharia court cases, 541 legislative acts and 251 Fatwās. The new Sharia Research Fellowship Program will provide opportunities for scholars to conduct research on “policy-related aspects of Islamic law,” and Harvard will provide them with a workspace and Harvard Law Library privileges, along with their stipend. The school is encouraging applications especially from “women, minorities, and citizens of all countries.”, Harvard’s Islamic Legal Studies Program is inviting visiting fellows to undertake research, writing, and scholarly engagement on Islamic law that furthers the Program’s mission. Among particular areas of interest, the Program is promoting research in migration and refugee studies, environmental law and climate change, minority rights, animal welfare and human rights. In his email to a “select group of users,” the director of the Islamic Legal Studies Program shares the “exciting news” of the launch, while inviting them to share the news widely. Follow Thomas D.

      "On Saturday President Trump engaged in a series of phone calls with five world leaders to discuss diplomatic relations, including Germany’s Angela Merkel, Russia’s Vladimir Putin, and Japan’s Shinzo Abe.[The call with Russian president Vladimir Putin was closely watched on both sides of the Atlantic, as Presidents Trump and Putin discussed such topics as stabilizing relations, restoring trade ties, the threat of radical Islamic terrorism, and situations in Ukraine and the Koreas, CNN reported. advertisement, The call with Putin comes after both presidents recently expressed desires to strengthen relations after a series of sanctions were lowered on Russia during the Obama years. The Russian statement on Trump’s call did not mention if Obama’s sanctions were discussed. President Trump also spoke to Japanese leader Shinzo Abe about the U.S. pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a wide-ranging trade deal that Abe supported. The president reportedly told Abe that he was more interested in bilateral trade deals that were easier to manage and alter as the situation demands, the Washington Times said. The pair arranged a meeting in Washington for next month. In his conversation with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the White House said Trump and Merkel agreed on the “fundamental importance” of NATO and made plans for an in-person visit in the near future, voanews.com noted. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull described his conversation with the U.S. leader as frank, constructive, and practical, Australia’s ABC reported. “We discussed the vital importance of the United States’ continued strong presence in our region,” Turnbull told his nation. “We agreed that presence has been an absolutely essential foundation of the peace and stability that has enabled the remarkable growth and prosperity — the remarkable economic growth we have seen over the last 40 years,” the Australian leader added. President Trump is also set to speak to French President Francois Hollande, a leader who has been sharply critical of the newly elected American leader. In past calls, the pair discussed ISIS, climate change, and the situation in Ukraine, according to Agence France-Presse. But Hollande has made a series of critical statements about Trump since the early November call. For instance, at the end of January, Hollande insisted Europe must oppose Trump with a “firm” response, and only days ago Hollande said Trump would be a “challenge” for Europe’s leaders.

      "Pentagon officials said on Friday that next week will mark the first attempt to shoot down an intercontinental ballistic missile in flight, closely simulating a North Korean attack on the United States.[The Associated Press notes that missile intercept technology has a “spotty track record,” having succeeded in just 9 of 17 attempts since 1999. Previous tests have involved shorter-range missiles, not an intercontinental ballistic missile. ICBMs pass through space en route to their targets. The difficulty of keeping the warhead intact upon reentry to Earth’s atmosphere is one of the hurdles North Korean scientists have not yet been able to overcome. advertisement, “The most recent test, in June 2014, was a success, but that followed three straight failures,” the AP recalls. The system, known as Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD), has been notoriously compared to “hitting a bullet with a bullet.” More precisely, it involves hitting a rocket with a rocket that launches another rocket. , “An interceptor is to be launched from an underground silo at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California and soar toward the target, which will be fired from a test range on Kwajalein Atoll in the Pacific. If all goes as planned, the ‘kill vehicle’ will slam into the ICBM-like target’s mock warhead high over the Pacific Ocean,” the AP writes. Officials said the test target would be moving much faster than targets from previous intercept tests, to better simulate the challenge of hitting an inbound ICBM. However, the target is not meant to precisely simulate any specific model of North Korean missile. Although Reuters quotes recent remarks from U.S. intelligence officials that indicate “mounting concern about Pyongyang’s advancing missile and nuclear weapons programs,” it notes that next week’s intercept test was “planned well in advance and was not in reaction to any specific event.”, The U.S. has a total of 36 interceptor missiles ready to fire, and plans to build 8 more during the coming year, but no such defensive weapon has ever been used in actual combat conditions. Skeptics say even those sporadic test successes involved simulated targets that were much less challenging than an actual enemy missile would be.\n",
      "Many Americans consider California the “land of fruits and nuts” — and lately it’s hard to argue with that.[First, California leftists want to secede from the United States of America, simply because they don’t like the outcome of one election. advertisement, But now — they want to regulate cow flatulence.  Yes, that’s what I said.  Cow farts and burps—now subject to regulation in the most regulated state in the union. Illegal aliens — yes.  California wants more, and creates a dozen new taxpayer-subsidized rewards for them every legislative session. Illegal cow farts — no. It isn’t enough to drive so many businesses and even entire industries out of the state of California to the benefit of states like Nevada, Arizona, Colorado and Texas. The Marxist Progressives who control California (having recently won a  supermajority in both houses), want to penalize those who are left. They’re starting with dairy farmers — but only God knows who’s next on their hit list. This obsession with attempting to control the uncontrollable — the weather, and in particular, the temperature — isn’t new.  When I was in 8th grade, and Jimmy Carter was president, Newsweek had an ominous picture on the cover, warning of the looming ice age. Even though the so-called “science” of global cooling-turned-global-warming has never been able to stand on it’s own — there have been multiple scandals, from manipulation of official temperature data to outright whole-cloth fabrication in the case of the hockey stick graph — that hasn’t stopped California from seizing more and more control over everyday Californians, be they business owners, or in this case, dairy farmers and cows. As if it wasn’t bad enough to be a dairy farmer in a state like California — where the government, not the marketplace, determines the price at which you can sell your product — now you’ve got to take extra steps to capture the methane gas produced when your cow belches or farts. If this sounds like an April fool’s joke, remember — this is California.  They’ve already handicapped California egg producers with a law, Proposition 2, that specifies the size of each chicken’s individual living quarters. The result was higher egg prices—and more greenhouse gas production. In order to comply with the law, egg producers had to build each hen their own little heated “condo” instead of a communal cage.  Dramatically more energy is now being used to produce eggs in California as a result of this law since the hens are no longer able to huddle together and benefit from natural community body heat. So, the question I’m sure on everyone’s minds is—How do you do this?  How do you capture the flatulence which is gas without inadvertently catching the solid waste excreted?, Do you create some kind of “cow hoodie” to capture the errant gases that escape from both ends?  Just imagine trying to do that with your family dog.  Not likely to happen even with the smallest of creatures.  And these animals easily weigh 600-1,000 lbs. And how exactly is the government going to regulate compliance with this new dictate?, Hire more regulators to sneak up on non-compliant dairy farmers, creating more outlaws out of law-abiding citizens?, That’ll just drive more dairy production out of state — and leave more of California’s fertile farmland brown and barren. As the largest agricultural state in the country, there’s a lot at stake.  California’s expansive San Joaquin Valley is home to the most fertile farmland on the planet.  This is the food basket of the nation, if not the world.  Making changes here is not the same as it might be with the Central Valley’s celebrity cousin up north, the Silicon Valley. It’s not just a keystroke. Making a living by producing food with the government-induced water shortage — and the tens of thousands of regulations on everything, from how much dust you kick up while driving a tractor, to how much shade you must provide farmworkers — just became harder. Maybe the Democrat Supermajority will change the Golden State’s motto from “Eureka” (meaning, “I have found it”) to:, “Welcome to California.  Now go home.”, In order for California to secede from the union, 38 states would have to approve.  After bone-headed moves like this latest law regulating cow flatulence, maybe the legislatures of all those states will simply decide to kick crazy California to the curb with a unanimous “Good Riddance” vote.

      "The annual virtue-signalling festival known as ‘Earth Hour’ won’t be celebrated in one Swedish town this year, thanks to a sex-crime epidemic sweeping the municipality.[The small Swedish town of Östersund — population 44,300 — is presently living in a state of fear. Police have instructed women to not go outside alone at night following a spate of sex attacks, and police patrol in search of the perpetrators who have so far avoided capture. advertisement, There have now been 14 separate reports of sex attacks in the town, with victims ranging from grown women to 10-year-old girls. Police have refused to release details of the suspects they are seeking — as is usual in a country where police took the decision last year to combat racism by not discussing the ethnicities of crime suspects — but victims have described “foreign origin” attackers. The danger is considered so great the symbolic act of turning the town’s municipal lights off for one hour is considered too much of a risk, and police have requested the event be cancelled. The final decision was taken in consultation with local officers on Tuesday, with Social Democrat spokesman for the local council Ann-Sofie Andersson remarking:, “Earth Hour is a good and important event, but this year we chose to have the street lights on in view of what has happened. We want everyone to feel safe”.  Sweden Television News reports the comments of Chief Constable Stephen Jerand, who said: “We from the police think it’s a very wise move and that the municipality made a good decision. Keeping the lights on creates security and is in line with our common efforts to increase security under current conditions”. Östersund hit the headlines earlier this month after local police warned women to stay indoors at night after a sudden rash of sex assaults. Police are investigating the attempted rape of two ten year old girls at a bus stop, molestations, beatings, and nearly a dozen other attacks. Aftonbladet reports that groups of volunteers have even joined police out on the streets at night in their patrols. Locals have pointed to the large migrant camp on the outskirts of the town which houses 500. It is not the first time migrants from that camp have made headlines — the first consignment of redistributed migrants were sent from Italy to Östersund by the European Union in 2015. Of the 33 migrants who were to be sent to Östersund from Italy, 14 escaped before they could be put onto the plane, and vanished. The remainder had to be kept under “lock and key” until the relocation ceremony and photo-call at Rome airport could take place, as was reported by Breitbart London at the time. Sweden was one of the first countries to sign up to the WWF ‘Earth Hour’ back in 2008. The event seeks to raise awareness of climate change by turning the lights off worldwide for one hour a year, but the event has been mocked by sceptics as the symbolic use of candles to substitute the electric light is said to be much more polluting. Earth Hour Sweden is calling on the country to become “100% fossil free” and to halve meat consumption. A letter to the left-wing Swedish government from the organisation calls for an “ambitious” climate policy and for the Swedish government to use its influence at the European Union to force other European countries to adopt these policies too.

      "Long-running Fox News personality Bill O’Reilly is out at Fox News after persistent sexual harassment claims, and the evening lineup is set to see a shakeup.[The network has faced ongoing issues with sexual harassment claims and loss of prominent personalities. Such allegations drove Roger Ailes from the company. Fox News has since settled with former network personality Gretchen Carlson, who sued the company, citing harassment from Ailes. Carlson’s settlement was for $20 million, and Fox News issued a public apology to Carlson. advertisement, A fairly new addition to the evening lineup, Tucker Carlson will slide into the 8 p.m. time slot in place of O’Reilly. Fox News sources confirmed to Breitbart News the changes, including moving The Five program from 5 p.m. to the 9 p.m. time slot that Tucker Carlson is leaving. Eric Bolling, a regular presence on The Five, will take the 5 p.m. slot. Martha MacCallum, who has been hosting a seasonal special called The First 100 Days, is expected to continue at 7 p.m. According to Fox News, “After a thorough and careful review of the allegations,” parent company 21st Century Fox said in a statement, “the company and Bill O’Reilly have agreed that Bill O’Reilly will not be returning to the Fox News Channel.”, Fox News itself reported:, The climate shifted dramatically after The New York Times reported on April 1 that O’Reilly or Fox had paid $13 million to settle five cases against him alleging sexual or other harassment. More than 50 advertisers withdrew from his prime-time show, and 21st Century Fox asked a law firm to investigate a complaint from a woman who said O’Reilly dropped efforts to make her a contributor in 2013 after she turned down his invitation to visit his hotel room. The network also lost Greta Van Susteren in 2016 and Megyn Kelly in January of this year. Van Susteren is said to have exercised an exit clause in her contract that applied in the event that Ailes was no longer chairman of the network. She has since joined MSNBC. Kelly exited Fox News for a position with NBC News. The New York Times reported that O’Reilly’s behavior factored in to Kelly’s exit. Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana.\n",
      "The word “guys” should be avoided in the office, a new Australian campaign has said, arguing that such terms exclude minority groups.[The Diversity Council of Australia campaign launched Wednesday asks people to be open to changing phrases they have always thought “normal”. advertisement, One such word is “guys”, which is commonly used in Australia to refer to a group including men and women. A campaign video shows a group of women cringing at being referred to as “girls”, and a worker in a wheelchair questioning the use of the expression “walk the talk”. Former chief of the Australian Army, David Morrison, who is spearheading the #WordsAtWork campaign, said the use of inclusive language should be promoted. “For some time I have been advocating that everyone in our society, from all genders, races, creeds, ages, disabilities, religions or sexual orientations, be given a chance to achieve their potential,” he said in a statement. “Unfortunately, in many workplaces, this isn’t always the case. People use language to denigrate others and to take away their self-respect. Sometimes it happens unconsciously, but the effect is the same.”, The new campaign was not about creating a “language police” but simply about encouraging people to use terms at work that were respectful, accurate, and relevant to everyone, he said. “All the campaign is doing is saying, ‘Look, it’s a proven fact that more inclusive, more diverse workforces create real diversity of thinking and are more productive,” he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. “And one of the ways… that you can engender that type of environment is (by) being careful about how you speak to other people, talking to them with respect and listening to their views with respect.”, Morrison admitted that “guys” was a word he had previously used. “I have now removed that from my lexicon as best I can, I think it’s important,” he said. But the idea of dropping the word “guys” provoked a storm on Twitter, with some questioning whether it would also lead to the loss of the traditional favourite “mate”. But others praised the idea of removing gender-specific language, coming up with alternatives to “guys” including “folks”, “riff raff” and “mortals”.\n",
      "Billionaire hedge fund manager and political donor George Soros has said Europe must welcome huge numbers of asylum seekers and economic migrants, claiming they will benefit the economy.[Writing in Die Welt, Soros lays out “seven pillars” he beleives should be enacted in order for Germany and Europe to see financial gains from the mass migration of people from the third world. advertisement, Calling Britain’s vote to leave the bloc a tragedy, the Hungarian Billionaire warns that the prospect of “xenophobic, nationalist movements” winning elections in France, the Netherlands, and Germany constitutes a massive threat. Soros advocates the EU securing its external borders as a measure to prevent populists gaining power, reasoning that chaotic scenes during the height of the migrant crisis “alienated” and “frightened” Europeans. The open borders ideologue remains committed to pushing mass migration into European countries, however, arguing that the EU must take a “considerable number” of migrants directly from states’ bordering crisis zones “in a safe and orderly manner”. Soros claims one of the most important tasks Europe must commit to undertaking is the creation of a “welcoming environment” for economic migrants as well as asylum seekers. He contends: “Given the aging population in Europe, the benefits [of migration] significantly outweigh the associated problems and the cost of integrating migrants.”, Despite maintaining that migrants are a boon to European economies, Soros says the EU should create spend “at least €30 billion annually” on facilitating the migration of non-Europeans. The globalist billionaire has frequently championed the idea that EU nations should borrow large amounts of money to fund mass migration. Although Soros claims mass migration of unskilled migrants from poor countries would benefit European economies, facts suggest they are a serious drain on EU states’ resources. Non-EU migrants cost the UK treasury £16 billion a year, net, while across the continent they have more than double the unemployment rates of Europeans. A variety of datasets from different European countries support the idea that non-European migrants are a net cost to nations’ treasuries. In the Netherlands, 65 per cent of non-European migrants who arrived during the 1990s are still living on welfare. That aging populations should be offset by the mass importation of migrants has been described as a “Ponzi scheme” by Dr. Joseph Chamie, director of research at the Centre for Migration Studies. He argues that GDP growth driven by mass migration boosts companies’ profits at the expense of quality of life and the environment. The demographer ,who directed the United Nations Population Division for 12 years, notes that mass migration means more demand, consumption, borrowing, and profits, but explains that the system is unsustainable. He writes: “When the bubble eventually bursts and the economy sours, the scheme spirals downward with higher unemployment, depressed wages, falling incomes, more people sinking into debt, more homeless families — and more men, women and children on public assistance.”, Dr. Chamie contends that Ponzi demography allows companies to enjoy the increased profits brought about by a larger population while the general public, through taxation, is forced to pick up the tab for mounting costs of education, healthcare, housing, and crime.\n",
      "Former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton spoke to Breitbart News Daily on Thursday about speculation that President Trump will delay his decision to relocate the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem but announce America’s exit from the Paris climate accords.[“I don’t really know one way or the other,” Bolton confessed. “I wish they would move the embassy to Jerusalem. I suspect if they were going to that in the near term, they would have announced it on the president’s trip to the region – which was very successful in both its Saudi component and its Israel component.”, advertisement, Bolton noted that on the same day the White House is expected to announce the Jerusalem decision, it is also expected to announce withdrawal from the Paris climate accords, a combination he described as “a kind of good news/bad news strategy.”, “I have my fingers crossed that the president will get out of the Paris accords today. We’ll wait and see what happens on that, too,” he said. SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam asked why so many American leaders talk about moving the embassy to Jerusalem but never actually do it. Bolton replied that while there is “strong feeling about moving the embassy” among the general public not just among Jewish Americans, but also among dedicated Christian supporters of Israel, American politicians were given pause by the potential political fallout. He suggested that on the contrary, they should see moving the embassy as a domestic political winner. Another reason the embassy does not get moved is the U.S. State Department’s view that “the status of Jerusalem is a matter for the final negotiations in the creation of a Palestinian state.”, “Therefore, the argument goes, if you do anything to prejudice the outcome of the final status negotiations, you could blow the whole thing up,” he explained. “This is utter nonsense,” he argued. “Number one, the whole premise – that is to say, a two-state solution where a new Palestinian state is created, which we’ve been at now for more than 70 years – has proven to be a complete failure. If that’s the premise for the argument about final status, we can dispense with that pretty quickly.”, “I think, even more importantly, just as a practical matter, no one has ever suggested that the U.S. embassy, if it were moved to Jerusalem, would be put in East Jerusalem, which is what the Palestinians claim would be their capital,” he continued. “There has been space made available by the government of Israel in West Jerusalem, west of the ‘green line,’ in territory no one has ever in their wildest dreams claimed would be part of a new Palestinian state. So erecting a U.S embassy there could not conceivably prejudice the final outcome.”, “And then there’s another reason,” he added. “I think when the U.S. decides to have diplomatic relations with a country, it’s between the U.S. and that country alone to determine how they are going to conduct relations. I view this as an analog to dealing with Taiwan, where the mainland Chinese are constantly trying to tell the United States how to behave, and unfortunately, we respond. We don’t allow Taiwanese diplomats into the State Department, if you can believe it, because we don’t want to offend Beijing. I think it’s time for the United States to say, ‘You know, we’re going to conduct U.S. diplomatic relations the way we want, period.’ If that means putting the embassy in Jerusalem, let’s do it.”, Bolton shared Kassam’s dim view of the “hysteria emanating from Europeans” after President Trump’s overseas trip. He noted that the U.S. Embassy in Berlin issued an assessment that German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s negative comments about President Trump were intended to influence domestic politics. “In other words, this does not rise to the cosmic level of affecting the trans-Atlantic alliance,” Bolton elaborated. “I remember very well at the beginning of the George W. Bush administration, the Europeans were saying much the same thing: ‘Oh, my God, the United States is going to create a national missile defense system! They’re going to hide behind it! They’re going to go isolation again! They’re going to leave us poor Europeans out here to defend ourselves!’”, “And then President Bush withdrew from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty so we could create a national defense,” he recalled. “We did withdraw from the International Criminal Court treaty, we unsigned it. We did get out of a hopeless negotiation over an utterly unworkable biological weapons verification protocol. The only thing really we didn’t wrap up was we didn’t unsign the Kyoto Protocol, which we should have done.”, “My point is, it was the same wailing and gnashing of teeth by the Europeans about the end of the trans-Atlantic alliance, the decline of American leadership. It wasn’t true then. It’s not true now,” said Bolton. He sized up the Paris climate accord as “an excellent thing to withdraw from.”, “In fundamental terms, it’s basically an utterly meaningless document,” he noted. “Each country involved sets its own targets and then declares its own progress. The world’s two biggest polluters, India and China, don’t even have to begin reducing carbon emissions until 2030. The Europeans have the math rigged in their favor.” , “The whole thing is a charade, except to this extent: even in effect as toothless as it is, what the Europeans and the Obama administration did when they negotiated the Paris accord was try to take a step forward toward formalizing this global governance structure that they had tried and failed, in the predecessor Kyoto agreement and the predecessor Copenhagen agreement,” Bolton charged. , “Even though it appears toothless in the near term, it sets a foundation that they hope to advance toward a greater multilateral global governance. Forget the environmental aspect for a minute – we could be talking about global cooling here, rather than global warming. The advocates of this treaty would propose the same kinds of structures because that’s their larger objective: the reduction of national sovereignty and the pooling of sovereignty as in their favorite institution, their paradigm of the world to come, the European Union,” he warned. “I think it’s important for the United States to say, ‘If you people want to pool sovereignty and reduce your democratic control over governments, which is a very widespread view regarding Brussels and the European Union now, you go right ahead. We’re not going to play any part of it,’” Bolton advised. Kassam amplified Bolton’s point about individual countries playing games with their Paris emission targets by recalling how the French themselves dealt with high street-level emission targets by simply moving the sensors onto rooftops. “You gotta love the French!” Bolton chuckled. “When they invented the word ‘hypocrisy,’ it came from Paris, and they are great at it, God bless ’em.”, John Bolton is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and head of his own political action committee, BoltonPAC.

      "“I’ve waited 40 years for this moment.”[In a congressional meeting room, somewhere on Capitol Hill, one of the world’s leading sceptical climate scientists, Dr. Tim Ball, is toasting the advent of the Trump administration. advertisement, “I don’t want to use the phrase tipping point because that’s a phrase that has been abused in the scientific area. But I think we’re on the verge of a dramatic shift,” Ball tells the small invited audience of journalists, scientists, think-tankers, lawyers and DC politicos. He’s talking about the war on the Green Blob. Most of them are scarred veterans of the decades-long battle to expose the man-made global warming scare as what another speaker, Tony Heller, describes as “the biggest scientific deception in history.” Many have suffered personally and professionally for speaking out against the so-called “consensus.” Ball, for example, a distinguished Canadian professor of climatology, has exhausted all his retirement money defending a legal action brought against him by the notorious climate alarmist Michael Mann, creator of the discredited “Hockey Stick”. (You can hear more about Ball’s struggle for truth on my latest Delingpole podcast—he’s a fascinating, articulate man and he has an inspiring story to tell). But with Trump’s inauguration it will be the beginning of the end for the Green Blob—that sinister cabal of corrupt politicians, UN- and EU-technocrats, bent scientists, shrill activists, rent-seeking corporatists, blood-sucking lawyers and gullible journalists which has held the world to ransom these last four decades by promoting the man-made climate change scare story and other, related environmental scams. The protests will be fierce: the global decarbonisation industry alone is worth at least $1.5 trillion a year. So many snouts in such a vast trough—they’re not going to give up easily. One man present, a member of one of Trump’s transition teams, describes it as the climate realists’ “Anzio Moment.” That is, the teams fighting the Green Blob now have their beach head with the arrival of Donald Trump. The only question now is not “if” they’re going to be able to break out only “when”—and also “how long.”, If you’re a regular Breitbart reader, you’ll probably be under no illusion about just how loathsome the people in the Green Blob are. But just in case you’re not, in case you’re wondering: “Well, hang on. What if the ‘consensus’ scientists are right? What if man-made global warming is a serious problem? What if Donald Trump is about to ruin everything with his sinister right-wing anti-science agenda?” let me tell you just one story which shows why the forthcoming cleaning of the Augean stables (at institutions like NASA, NOAA and most especially the Environmental Protection Agency) is so very, very right and necessary. The story begins in 2012 in sunny La Jolla, California. A group of key figures from the Green Blob—academics, professional activists, lawyers, scientists, PR agency heads—have gathered to discuss the heist of the century. Their plan is to terrorise big business with a form of environmentalist blackmail, which they will use, in the manner of a Mafia-style protection racket to bully their target companies (with the help of tame lawyers and complicitous government officials) into handing over millions, if not billions, of dollars. This Danegeld will end up being paid to environmental campaign groups of the kind they work for themselves, thus funding yet more vexatious, money-grubbing actions against still more blameless companies. And the cleverest thing of all is, this heist isn’t even illegal. Environmentalists have been getting away with this sort of thing for years. You actually know what happens next because you’ll have read it, splashed all over the mainstream media in what became a campaign called “Exxon Knew.” Hillary Clinton (who was then Secretary of State) demanded an investigation into it a group of alarmist scientists wrote to President Obama demanding he launch a RICO prosecution of Exxon two supposedly major journalistic exposes were published at Inside Climate News and the LA Times, then eagerly endorsed in such publications as Scientific American and the Guardian. Sundry environmentalist politicians and activists weighed in with further demands for action, as I reported here. These activists include Sharon Eubanks, a former US Department of Justice attorney who once helped bring a similar case against Big Tobacco House Democrats Ted Lieu and Mark DeSaulnier Canadian eco-loon Bill McKibben (who talks, with characteristic wry understatement, of Exxon’s “sheer, profound, and – I think – unparalleled evil”) and, of course, Rhode Island senator Sheldon Whitehouse, another attorney determined to use lawfare to shut down the debate on climate change once and for all. But what had Exxon had actually done to attract all this opprobrium? Short answer: nothing. But that was never the point. The entire scam—essentially blaming Exxon for knowing something about “global warming” it couldn’t possibly have known because, hey, nobody did at the time they don’t even know now—was purely designed as a shakedown. Next stage of the plan was for the politicized U.S. legal system to get involved. This it did earlier this year when the grimly inevitable Al Gore turned up in New York to grandstand at a meeting with a bunch of tame Attorneys General from Democrat states to discuss ‘the potential of commencing new investigations or joining ongoing investigations,’ on climate change. New York AG Eric Schneiderman will appear with Vermont Attorney General William Sorrell, Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh, Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen and United States Virgin Island Attorney General Claude Walker at 11:30 a.m. at his Manhattan office, 120 Broadway, 25th Floor. Again this was all just for show. The main purpose, as one well familiar with the case explained to me in DC, was merely to put the frighteners on the chosen target of this campaign, ExxonMobil. ExxonMobil had been carefully selected as the Green Blob’s shakedown victim because it seemed to fulfil all the necessary criteria. It was a huge oil company with masses of money to squander (its annual revenue is around $270 billion) on environmental pay outs and, under its CEO Rex Tillerson, it had a track record of corporate cowardice (withdrawing funding from right-wing think tanks failing to speak up for fossil fuels kow-towing to greens) which meant that it was considered highly likely not to contest any court action but instead to settle. The legal case against ExxonMobil would be based on the one used so successfully against Big Tobacco. (One of the key figures in the campaign against Big Tobacco, Stanton Glantz, was present to advise at the La Jolla meeting). Never mind that there were actually no serious similarities: the Big Tobacco companies clearly knew that cigarettes caused cancer there was no similar knowledge that ExxonMobil possessed about “global warming” that it culpably withheld from its customers. The case, had it gone to court, would have been a nonsense. But that wasn’t the point. The point was, it was never meant to go to court, because ExxonMobil—it had been predicted by the Green Blob—would settle. Once ExxonMobil had settled, the Green Blob schemed, all the other companies would settle too. Except it didn’t turn out that way. ExxonMobil—quite remarkably, given Tillerson’s pusillanimity and cautiousness—refused to settle. The La Jolla plan—which might still yet have stood a chance had Hillary been elected—is now certainly doomed to failure in the Trump era. But by describing it I hope what I’ve succeeded in doing is giving you an indication of the extraordinary tentacular reach of the Green Blob. For years, the US – and the rest of the Western world—has afforded a climate in which Attorneys General and Senators and Secretaries of State and even Presidents can conspire with university professors and heads of government science institutions and environmental PR companies and green NGOs can exploit green issues in which to wage continual war on both the economy and the consumer, often enriching themselves in the process while the rest of us get poorer and more constrained by needless taxes and regulations. “Oh come on!” these people have always said when you try to call them on it. “What kind of deranged conspiracy theorist would you have to be to suggest that all these different groups with different interests would be working together to lie about global warming?”, You really don’t need to be a conspiracy theorist to believe this stuff, though. All you need is to be cognisant of the facts. These people are crooks. A lot of them should be in prison. In fact, funnily enough, that was the joke that got Tim Ball in trouble with Michael Mann. “He shouldn’t be in Penn State. He should be in the state pen,” Ball quipped. Not just Michael Mann. They all should. This scam is a disgrace and has gone on far too long. Trump’s destruction of the Green Blob will come not a moment too soon.\n",
      "Donald Trump addressed the nation from Gettysburg, Pennsylvania — not far from where President Lincoln delivered his famous address in 1863 — on Saturday afternoon, where he laid out his closing arguments ahead of the election in 17 days.[“President Lincoln served at at time of division like we’ve never seen before. It is my hope that we can look at his example to heal the divisions we are living through right now,” Trump stated, noting that he isn’t a politician. “When I saw the trouble our country was in, I knew I couldn’t stand by and watch any longer. Our country has been so good to me. I love our country and I felt I had to act.”, advertisement, “Change has to come from outside our very broken system,” he added, touting that he is the candidate that can create change in Washington, D.C. He referenced a number of problems facing the country, including voter fraud — an issue Trump has discussed recently while on the campaign trail. “According to Pew, there are 24 million voter registrations in the United States that are either invalid or significantly inaccurate,” Trump claimed. He noted there are 1.8 million dead people registered to vote “and some of them are voting.” Trump also said that 2.8 million people are registered in more than one state to vote and that 14 percent of non-citizens are registered to vote. “The system is also rigged because Hillary Clinton should have been precluded from running for the presidency of the United States, but the FBI and the Justice Department covered up her crimes,” Trump stated about his opponent, adding that Hillary Clinton is running against change. “There’s nothing better or stronger than the American character,” he declared, asking voters to rise above the noise from what he calls a rigged system and rigged media. The Republican nominee laid out his plan for his first 100 days in office if he is to become President of the United States, listing six measures he plans to execute in order to clean up special interests and collusion in Washington, D.C. The six measures include:, Trump went on to discuss a variety of ways that he plans to change government spending, including canceling billions of dollars being sent to the United Nation’s climate change programs as well as canceling federal funding for sanctuary cities. He promised an economic plan to benefit the American worker and tax reductions for the middle class. The Republican nominee also touted his plan to restore government ethics, end Common Core education and illegal immigration, and repeal and replace Obamacare with health savings accounts. Trump’s speech comes as two recent general election polls — LA Times/USC Tracking and IBD/TIPP Tracking — show him tied with Clinton.\n",

      "MOST POPULAR[.@jonkarl: Pres. Trump has \"fallen dramatically short in the first 100 days\" by standards he set during campaign https://t.co/BAx8ipcTbO pic.twitter.com/CpyEMT2mtE, Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” ABC News chief Washington correspondent Jon Karl said President Donald Trump had “fallen dramatically short” of the standard he set for his first 100 days during the 2016 presidential campaign. advertisement, Remarks as follows:, Well, on one hand, George, Donald Trump has truly shaken up Washington and he has big plans for the rest of the year. But by the standards that he set for himself during the campaign, there is no question that he has fallen dramatically short in the first 100 days. Just take a look at this. Back in October, he offered what he called a contract with the American voter. This is ten specific promises, ten pieces of legislation, that he promised to introduce and, quote, “fight for their passage within the first 100 day of my administration.”, Well, George, only one of those has even been introduced. And that is repealing and replacing Obamacare. And obviously, that hasn’t passed. There is one area where there has been a significant impact though, in the first 100 days, and that’s on regulations. Cutting, rolling back regulations that Obama put in place, especially on the environment. His economic team believes this is already having an impact on business, and they believe that ultimately rolling back those regulations could even have more of an impact that tax reform. And George, you mentioned him saying this is a ridiculous mark. But I’ve got to tell you, I am seeing a mad scramble in the West Wing to try to get points on the board before the 100-day marker. On one hand, they want to pass, make another effort to pass health care. And then there’s tax reform. You mentioned the promise that he made on Friday that he is going to unveil a plan for tax reform on Wednesday of next week. This shocked his own top advisers. The idea had been floated a few days earlier. They had agreed that they wouldn’t do it yet. It wasn’t ready. And then they heard him say it, clearly an indication that he wants to still get something done, something more before they reach that 100 days. Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN\n",
      "The news reads like something out of a screwball comedy: a far-left activist named “Reality Leigh Winner” somehow received clearance to work for the National Security Agency, which she allegedly proceeded to rob of classified material in the name of the kookburger anti-Trump “Resistance.” In the post-Edward Snowden era, how does someone like this get anywhere near sensitive data?[Speaking of Snowden, Ms. Winner is a huge fan of his. He was one of only 50 accounts she followed on Twitter, along with WikiLeaks, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif, and the Anonymous hacker collective. Her own Twitter posts were filled with foaming-at-the-mouth anti-Trump tirades such as, “Why burn a flag? Donald Trump thinks crosses burn much better.”, advertisement, She was also a supporter of climate change hysteria and the Black Lives Matter radical movement. Her last Tweet, from February, was advice for rapper Kanye West to “make a shirt that says, ‘being white is terrorism.’”, She didn’t just follow the Iranian Foreign Minister, she tweeted at him. “There are many Americans protesting U.S. government aggression towards Iran. If our Tangerine in Chief declares war, we stand with you!” she gushed to Zarif. She also referred to President Trump as “the orange fascist we let into the White House,” and some other names that cannot be reprinted at a family-friendly website without exceeding our allotment of asterisks for the day. “On a positive note, this Tuesday when we become the United States of the Russian Federation, Olympic lifting will be the national sport,” she sneered in advance of the 2016 election. The totality of the Reality Winner experience reads like a joke put together for a presentation by bored NSA staffers about the sort of person that should never, ever be given a security clearance. It’s as though a far-left blog downloaded itself into a human brain and chose a name by reading its own comments section. , It should also be noted that the circumstances of this Iran fangirl’s data theft are a blistering indictment of agency procedures. Even with a valid top secret clearance, Winner had no legitimate reason to see the documents she allegedly purloined. She was only caught because the website she reportedly leaked to contacted the NSA to ask if her material was legitimate. The agency that was stunned by how much sensitive material Edward Snowden managed to abscond with still doesn’t seem to be properly compartmentalizing information and enforcing need-to-know rules. Fans of the “Deep State” keep saying Trump made a big mistake picking a fight with them, but if the adventures of Reality Winner are an indication of the Deep State’s skill and discipline, Trump doesn’t have much to worry about. Also, it’s worth repeating that nobody voted to give the Deep Staters or Reality Winners control over America’s national security, law enforcement, and foreign policy. Some hay has been made over Winner’s support for Bernie Sanders in the 2016 presidential election, but that’s not nearly enough reason to question someone’s security clearance by itself. It is, however, fair to ask when the media will get around to asking Sanders if he disavows his treacherous supporter – as the press would certainly be doing if a red-hatted MAGAphile supporter of Donald Trump, boasting a Twitter feed full of right-wing causes and celebrities, had looted the NSA to help a “resistance” movement take down President Hillary Clinton. , In the alternate universe where that happened, you may rest assured the media freakout about Trump saboteurs threatening the very fabric of democracy has pushed all other stories off the front page today, and the upcoming Sunday talk shows are already booked solid. Of course, as we all know, Democrat politicians are firewalled from the misdeeds of their followers, and no left-wing Climates of Hate are ever detected. Certain Democrats have no compunctions about actually encouraging criminality, secure in the knowledge their party will never be made to pay a price for going off the rails:, Now more than ever we need whistleblowers to come forward. I created an official website on how to leak to the press https://t.co/IjTar3hv6U, — Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) May 17, 2017, , Remember the Democrat freak-out about President Trump supposedly compromising American secrets by warning the Russians about a terrorist plot? Some of them don’t actually seem all that concerned about real leaks of sensitive information, as long as it furthers their political goals. , Democrats have created an anything-goes, get-Trump-at-all-costs environment that’s guaranteed to drive their more loosely-wrapped supporters around the bend. If one believes, as Reality Winner evidently does, that Donald Trump is an illegitimate president who must be resisted by any means necessary, it’s not difficult to justify lawbreaking or even deliberately damaging America, for the greater good of shoving that reality-show usurper out of the White House. , Our security services absolutely must take this into account when granting clearances and sweeping sensitive departments for risky personnel. No one with Reality Winner’s political beliefs can be trusted with anything sensitive, period. , Democrats created the environment in which left-wingers cannot be trusted in sensitive posts, not Donald Trump. Leftists and extreme NeverTrumpers excuse every offense against this administration by saying Trump brought it on himself, just by being himself. That’s not how the rule of law works. , This anything-goes climate has to be shut down, and fast, before permanent damage to our national interest is inflicted, if that hasn’t happened already. A few words from top Democrats about acknowledging elections, honoring their oaths, and respecting the Oval Office even if you despise the current occupant (remember that?) would be very helpful.\n",
      "Former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger is reportedly considering a run for U.S. Senate in 2018, when incumbent Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) is said to be considering retirement.[Several media outlets report that Schwarzenegger, who recently raised his profile with a series of Twitter clashes with President Donald Trump, is thinking of re-entering the political fray after several years’ absence. advertisement, Politico’s Carla Marinucci reports: “The prospect of Schwarzenegger’s return to elected politics in a 2018 U.S. Senate run — possibly as an independent — is generating increasing buzz in state Republican circles, fueled by the former governor’s seeming ability to get under the skin of President Donald Trump on social media.”, Schwarzenegger also opposed Trump in the Republican presidential primary, backing Ohio governor John Kasich instead. If elected, Schwarzenegger could pose a significant opposition threat to the Trump administration on issues such as climate change. California’s controversial cap-and-trade system was introduced under Schwarzenegger’s administration. However, Schwarzenegger will have to confront his own political record along the way. Though he was re-elected to a second term in 2006, Schwarzenegger is mostly remembered for leaving the state in a fiscal mess after abandoning the reform agenda that brought him to office in the first place. The East Bay Times recalls:, The Republican governor’s approval ratings fluctuated while he was in office and were as high as 63 percent in March 2007. But five months after he left office, a Field Poll found that three of four California voters surveyed had a negative image of Schwarzenegger in the wake of revelations he had fathered a boy with a former household staff member while married to TV journalist Maria Shriver. Whether he runs as an independent or as a Republican, Schwarzenegger would face stiff competition from a long line of California Democrats who have been waiting, patiently, to angle for Feinstein’s seat.

      "An anti-corruption watchdog has urged actor Leonardo DiCaprio to return his earnings from the 2013 film The Wolf of Wall Street if the money is found to be linked to the billions of dollars misappropriated from a Malaysian sovereign wealth fund that was earmarked for development in the Southeast Asian country.[In a statement to the Hollywood Reporter on Thursday, Samantha Grant of Berlin-based NGO Transparency International said the organization would “very much like to see” DiCaprio return his paycheck for the film to the Malaysian people. advertisement, The actor is estimated to have earned around $25 million for his portrayal of unscrupulous Wall Street investor Jordan Belfort in the Martin Scorsese-directed film. “If that money is found by the DoJ to be corrupt, to not give it back sort of says that money that was due to go to the Malaysian public is sitting in Leonardo DiCaprio’s account,” Grant told THR. Grant added that the actor could “protect” himself and his reputation as an environmental advocate by signing Transparency International’s Declaration Against Corruption. A number of organizations and at least one charity have in recent months called on DiCaprio to return what they some have called “ill-gotten” donations to his environmental-focused Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation. The Department of Justice is investigating what is believed to be the world’s largest embezzlement scheme, involving Malaysian sovereign wealth fund 1MDB. An exposé in the Hollywood Reporter last summer alleged that billionaire Malaysian businessman and 1MDB advisor Jho Low had used money siphoned from the fund to make donations to DiCaprio’s charity foundation, including by purchasing artwork that was later auctioned off at the actor’s annual environmental gala in St. Tropez, France. The DOJ further alleges that hundreds of millions of dollars embezzled from the fund were used by U.S. production company Red Granite Pictures to fund production on The Wolf of Wall Street, for which DiCaprio won a Golden Globe in the starring role. Red Granite Pictures was co-founded by the Prime Minister of Malaysia’s step-son Riza Aziz, himself a central figure in the Justice Department investigation of the fund. At a press conference in London earlier this month, Malaysian rainforest preservation charity Bruno Manser Funds demanded the actor return any questionable donations made to his foundation or else resign as a United Nations Messenger of Peace for climate change, a position he was awarded in 2014. Executives from the charity were subsequently denied entry to the London Film Festival premiere of DiCaprio’s climate change documentary Before the Flood. A spokesperson for DiCaprio issued a statement earlier this month saying that both the actor and his eponymous foundation were “entirely supportive of all efforts to assure that justice is done in this matter.”, “Several months ago in July, Mr. DiCaprio first learned through press reports of the government’s civil action against some of the parties involved in the making of The Wolf of Wall Street,” the spokesperson said in a statement obtained by THR. “He immediately had his representatives reach out to the Department of Justice to determine whether he or his foundation, the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation (LDF), ever received any gifts or charitable donations directly or indirectly related to these parties, and if so, to return those gifts or donations as soon as possible. All contact was initiated by Mr DiCaprio and LDF.”,  , Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum\n",
      "Actress Sarah Jessica Parker says Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is “beyond capable” of defeating any Republican nominee.[“Hillary is, without question, beyond capable and it is the right time, but I’ve been proud of the tone of the conversation on the Democratic side,” the Sex in the City star said. “There’s been substantive, real conversation about policy, legislation, gender equality, pay, and climate. advertisement, “The GOP is a freakin’ sideshow,” she added. Parker, who’s a “huge fan” of Hillary’s, says Clinton’s “incredible” life in the service to the public has prepared her for the presidency. “She’s given her entire adult life being in service. It’s really incredible. And she and Bill, I can’t even begin to fathom how much money they’ve raised for the Democratic Party, and how much they’ve supported Democratic candidates,” Parker said. “I think she’s so impressive and such a crazy, wonderful policy wonk, and tireless, and she has enormous, real interest in inequality, choice, gender issues, and looking at how the world has evolved.”, In March 2014, Parker admitted that she’d be more than happy to work for Hillary Clinton — adding that she’d take on tasks that range from the duties of an unpaid intern to a hospice caregiver. “I would be happy to get her coffee, or carry her luggage, or offer soup when she’s tired, or make Xeroxes of speeches or documents,” Parker said. “If it proves to be that Hillary is in fact our nominee, I think she’s had extraordinary experience in her life as an elected official, as an appointed official, and even before she served in public life there was an enormous amount of time spent working with children,” the 51-year-old actress said. Parker endorsed Obama over Hillary in 2008. She worked a phone bank for then-Senator Obama in 2008, helped him raise mega cash, and cut an ad for his reelection in 2012. Eight years later, Parker says it’s time to put a women in the White House. “Other countries, including developing ones like Liberia, have had female leaders and are dealing with far more complicated affairs than a Constitution that basically works,” she said.

      "The terrorist attack in Orlando that ended 49 lives is another reminder of the threat we face from Radical Islam.  There is a deadly element of Islam spreading like a cancer throughout our country and we must unite to confront it.  [Democrats’ bludgeoning of Americans with political correctness has weakened our resolve.   Their hesitation to confront Radical Islam, or even utter the term, has emboldened the jihadists – and not for the first time. advertisement, During Bill Clinton’s presidency, Islamic terrorists perpetrated the following attacks against America:  1) 1993 World Trade Center bombing 2) 1996 Khobar Towers 3) 1998 Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania 4) 2000 bombing of the USS Cole.  Each attack was followed with little to no response.  The terrorists felt victorious.  They felt invincible.  And even worse, they did not fear us.  This of course culminated in the 9-11 attacks.  Ironically, the day before 9-11, President Clinton told an audience that he “could have killed” September 11th mastermind Osama Bin Laden in 1998. The next day, 2,977 Americans were killed by Bin Laden’s Al-Qaeda terrorist group. , Under the Obama presidency we have endured attacks on Ft. Hood, Benghazi, Boston, Chattanooga, San Bernardino, and now Orlando.   In 2009, President Obama referred to the massacre at Ft. Hood that killed 13 Americans as “workplace violence”. Benghazi was blamed on a “YouTube” video.  At every turn, President Obama and Hillary Clinton have been soft on terror and refused to utter the words “Radical Islam” as the jihadist death march against America continues.  President Obama even naively referred to the Islamic State as a “JV team”.  Incredibly, he and Hillary Clinton are now calling for increasing Syrian refugees to America despite known ISIS pledges to exploit the program and universal agreement that we cannot vet these individuals – how delusional.     , President Obama and Hillary Clinton have irresponsibly exploited terror attacks to further the agenda of Democrats by calling for things such as gun control.  Maybe Secretary Clinton has never heard of suicide bombers.  Perhaps she forgets that nearly 3,000 Americans were murdered on 9-11 without a single shot being fired.  We cannot afford another terror denier as commander in chief. , History repeats itself.  Their political correctness and willful blindness leaves them talking in circles and Americans dead.  In typical fashion, Hillary delivered a speech on Monday blaming the Orlando terror attack on gun control.  There were some words about combating terrorism, but if Hillary is going to have credibility, the Clinton Foundation should stop accepting blood money from countries that export terror, oppress women and persecute gays. , Donald Trump has promised to use every tool at our disposal to go after Radical Islam.  He speaks to Americans with unequivocal clarity at a time when clarity is required.  Americans know that Mr. Trump is right when he says we must “now get very tough, very smart and very vigilant.”  His plan to temporarily suspend immigration from areas with a “proven history of terrorism” could not be any more common sense.  I filed a bill to temporarily suspend the refugee resettlement program last December for the same reason. President Obama will say that rhetoric from some on the right is dangerous, but what’s more dangerous is sitting idle as Islamic Extremists slaughter innocent Americans.  America cannot afford another four years of willful blindness in the fight against Radical Islam.  President Obama and Hillary Clinton continue to endanger American lives with their politically correct assault on our common sense.  We need a decisive leader who will act in the best interests of this country to keep Americans safe.  We need Donald Trump.\n",
      "Donald Trump has an “An America First Energy Plan.”[In it, he calls for “American energy dominance,” which he sees as a strategic, economic, and foreign policy goal. He seeks “American energy independence”—which he defines as being “independent of any need to import energy from the OPEC cartel or any nations hostile to our interests.” According to his energy adviser, Rep. Kevin Cramer (R-ND), this acknowledges that we will still use oil from our friends like Canada and Mexico and that due to refinery configurations, there will likely continue to be oil imports and exports. advertisement, He understands that our amazing American energy resources offer the United States tremendous wealth and economic advantage. In his May 26 speech in North Dakota, addressing untapped oil and gas reserves on federal lands, Trump exclaimed: “We have no idea how rich we are. We want to cherish that wealth.” In comparison, he pointed out that Hillary Clinton wants to lock up “trillions in American wealth” while her “poverty-expansion agenda” enriches her friends and makes everyone else poor. In the speech, Trump pointed out to the audience, largely made up of people from the oil and agriculture industries: “If Crooked Hillary can shut down the mines, she can shut down your business, too.”, Trump will move away from government-central planning efforts and return authority back to the states—an idea that has made it into the Republican Platform. His plan has three main components. Under a Trump administration there will be big changes in climate policy, regulations, and the management of federal lands. Climate policy, Trump has pledged to “cancel the Paris Climate Agreement and stop all payment of U.S. tax dollars to U.N. global warming programs.” He says such policies are evidence of America bending to benefit other nations at a cost to the U.S. Once the “draconian climate rules” are eliminated there is no rationale for imposing a “job-killing cap-and-trade” scheme or to keep extending the subsidies for wind and solar. He is not opposed to wind and solar energy, and in fact, wants to “get bureaucracy out of the way of innovation so we can pursue all forms of energy,” but he doesn’t support the idea of “the government picking winners and losers.” Like other energy sources, once the subsidies expire, the wind and solar industry would benefit from typical business tax deductions and deferments. Regulations , Trump’s agenda calls for “Regulation reform that eliminates stupid rules that send our jobs overseas.” He knows that “costly regulation makes it harder and harder to turn a profit.”, Cramer told me we can expect Trump to roll back a lot of Obama’s regulatory overreach and take a different approach toward rules, like the Waters of the U.S. and the Clean Power Plan, that are currently under a court-ordered stay. Coal miners have come out en masse for Trump because of his promise to “save the coal industry.” I asked Cramer how Trump planned to do that. He told me that while coal-fueled power plants that have already been shut down or converted to natural gas will not likely be reopened, a Trump administration can save what’s left and stop the bleeding by not artificially punishing the industry through regulation. In short, Trump explained: “Any future regulation will go through a simple test: is this regulation good for the American worker? If it doesn’t pass this test, the rule will not be approved.”, Federal Lands, In his speech, Trump reminded people that President Obama has halted leasing for new coal mines on federal lands and aggressively blocked the production of oil and natural gas by closing down leases and putting reserves off limits. He pointed out that these resources are an American treasure and that the American people are entitled to share in the riches. As a part of his 100-day action plan, Trump has promised to “lift moratoriums on energy production on federal areas.” Instead of slow-walking permits or being passive-aggressive with the permitting process, he’ll order agencies to expedite exploration, drilling, and mining permits. Trump has said he intends to “trust local officials and local residents.” This idea will be played out in his approach to the management of federal lands—which Cramer explained will be more of a state and federal partnership where states will have a much greater say regarding the their  land use. This includes the regulation of hydraulic fracturing. We’ll see this same philosophy played out in the designation of national monuments—something the Obama administration has abused by turning the ability to designate national monuments into a land grab. His monument designations often prevent productive use of the federal lands—such as agriculture or mineral extraction. The GOP platform committee adopted language that empowers states to retain control over lands within their borders. New monuments will “require the approval of the state where the national monument is designated or the national park is proposed.” As a result, Cramer told me: “We will not see a lot of new federal lands.”, Additionally, Trump would “ask TransCanada to renew its permit application for the Keystone pipeline” and he has long been a supporter of nuclear power. Trump’s energy plan is a turn toward realism, based on the fact that our American energy abundance can allow for shared prosperity, better schools, more funding for infrastructure, higher wages, and lower unemployment.

      "Rocker Neil Young penned a lengthy letter on Facebook Monday demanding that President Obama “end the violence” against activists protesting the construction of the Dakota Access oil pipeline being built in North Dakota.[“We are calling upon you, President barack Obama, to step in and end the violence against the peaceful protesters at Standing Rock immediately,” Young wrote. advertisement, The “Rockin’ in the Free World” singer called the controversial protest on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation “an awakening” that has seen activists “standing strong in the face of outrageous, unnecessary and violent aggression, on the part of militarized local and state law enforcement agencies and National Guard, who are seemingly acting to protect the interests of the Dakota Access Pipeline profiteers, at a cost of hundreds of thousands of tax-payer dollars.”, The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has spent months protesting the pipeline project, on grounds that it would desecrate sites held sacred to the tribe. The pipeline is expected to transport more than 470,000 barrels of oil a day across four states. In his open letter, Young also chided and rebuked President-elect Donald Trump, avoiding mentioning his name but labeling him the “surprise president.”, “The surprise president elect was not the winner of the popular vote [and] does not have a mandate for the change of ideals envisioned. Keep in mind, close to over two million more people voted for another candidate,” the rocker wrote. “Nor is the surprise president the leader of the free world. Two hundred of the world’s nations believe in science, above the profits of the oil, gas and coal industries, and are committed to working together to protect the future from an unchecked climate crisis.”, The pipeline protest has seen it’s fair share of attention from celebrities. Actress Shailene Woodley was arrested at the site in October and charged with criminal trespassing and engaging in a riot. While protesting the $3.7 billion, 1,170-mile pipeline last week, the Snowden star said “Thanksgiving was founded on a massacre.”, Actors Mark Ruffalo and Leonardo Dicaprio, among other stars, have also criticized the project.  , Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson\n",

      "An Australian Islamic group wants government-sponsored “safe spaces” provided for young Muslims to discuss “inflammatory” issues away from broader public scrutiny.[In a submission to an Australian parliamentary inquiry into freedom of religion, the Islamic Council of Victoria (ICV) said such taxpayer-funded forums enabled opinions to be “respectfully and intelligently debated and challenged” while also helping to combat alleged “mental health” problems in the young Muslim community in the State of Victoria. advertisement, The ICV claimed “Muslim Victorians experience religious intolerance in the form of Islamophobia, racial abuse and breaches of our universal human rights.” The alleged inability of Muslim adherents to safely practice their religion without feeling subject to surveillance is a “human rights issue,” according to the ICV. The call comes just days after 29-year-old Somali refugee Yacub Khayre took a hostage, killed a man, and wounded three police officers in Melbourne. The terrorist explicitly dedicated the attack to the Islamic State and al-Qaeda, while Islamic State swiftly claimed him as a “soldier” of the caliphate. ICV spokesman Adel Salman said they did not consider the “safe space” proposal controversial, because it is a practice he claimed – without providing evidence – is already used with young people in other countries. “This is about good practice because the youth require an avenue to express their views in a safe environment… where they feel their views are valued, where they can be respectfully challenged and counter views presented,” Mr. Salman said. He said such spaces would be “conducted with experts who are familiar with the methodology, and understand the way the conversation can be guided”. Victoria State Premier Daniel  Andrews ruled out any possibility of funding such an initiative. “I am very troubled by the suggestion that we might have a space where people could be radical as part of a de-radicalisation programme. That makes no sense to me whatsoever”.  \n",
      "Violence has flared in one of the many Paris migrant ‘transit camps’ that have flourished in the city this week, with special police deployed to quell the riot.[Angered migrants threw missiles and charged one another with iron and wooden bars at the Stalingrad Metro on Thursday night, with the chaos caught on camera by the inhabitant of a neighbouring apartment. The extraordinary violence is reported to have started when a drunk man threw an object at the migrants, who returned in kind by throwing street furniture and strips of metal, reports Le Parisien. advertisement, Specialist police of the undercover ‘Anti-Crime Brigade’ were called to the scene, and riot police showered cannisters of tear-gas down on the rioting migrants to clear the area. The men being repulsed were primarily of Eritrean, Sudanese, and Afghan origin. Plain-clothes ‘Anti-Crime Brigade’ officers patrol France’s so-called Z.U.S.  ‘sensitive urban zones’ — better known as ‘no go zones’ — in unmarked cars and receive special weapons and vehicle training. Despite claims in some British media that anti-migrant vigilantes may have been involved, French reports state police are still unaware of what triggered the fight, although the possibility of disputes over territory or conflicts imported from foreign war-zones may be to blame. Breitbart London reported on the under-bridge migrant camps in May 2015, which had sprung up as a convenient transit-point on the route north to Calais, and then on to Britain. The number of men living in the tents under the railway bridge was then 500, but it has recently swollen to 1,000 as French police cleared the migrant camps at Calais, causing the illegals gathered there to disperse. The existence of the insanitary camp has been supported by local pro-migrant charities, which have provided old mattresses and tents for the illegals to live in. Chemical toilets are also provided to prevent worse fouling of the environment.\n",
      "Finally the mystery of Leonardo DiCaprio’s bizarre infatuation with the wilder reaches of environmental lunacy has been revealed. 1. His head was completely messed up by a freaky Hieronymus Bosch painting his parents hung above his crib when he was a baby. 2. He is quite exceptionally stupid — more stupid than even his most ardent detractors can hitherto possibly have imagined.[Here are some of the key take home points about Leonardo DiCaprio which have emerged from a fawning and no-doubt world-exclusive interview with Rolling Stone. advertisement, 1. Leo thinks global warming is real because… famous, apocalyptic 16th century painting. Leonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio’s parents hung a painting above his crib in the grotty 1970s East Hollywood neighborhood of Los Angeles when he was a baby. The painting wasn’t an action shot of Peter Rabbit or Curious George. No, it was a reproduction of Dutch painter Hieronymus Bosch’s three-paneled “Garden of Earthly Delights,” a dystopian visual description of Eden being found and lost. It is one of DiCaprio’s earliest memories. “You literally see Adam and Eve being given paradise,” says DiCaprio, his blue eyes peering above sunglasses in a Miami Beach restaurant that has somehow worked “SoHo” into its name. Underneath the table he fidgets his feet in and out of canvas loafers. He drifts away for a moment. DiCaprio just finished shooting an interview for a -climate-change film he’s making. (Original working title: Are We Fucked?) He’s already been to India flood plains and the Antarctica polar cap, and now he’s not far from Miami playgrounds where he once reputedly left a nightclub with every woman from his VIP section. All, according to DiCaprio, could be washed away. He snaps back to the painting. “Then you see in the middle this overpopulation and excess, people enjoying the fruits of what this environment’s given us,” he says. He laughs a sad laugh punctuated by the DiCaprio smile that can be mistaken for a sneer. “Then the last panel is just charred, black skies with a burnt-down apocalypse.” He stops for a second before shrugging. “That was my favorite painting.”, 2. Leo knows more than almost anyone about climate change. So says a completely neutral, unbiased and entirely reliable environmental activist and movie star. “There are very few civilians who have the same understanding that this guy has of climate change. Leo’s a wonk,” says Mark Ruffalo, who has just combined forces with DiCaprio on the Solutions Project, a group of scientists and stars hoping to move America toward full-renewable-energy use. “He’s putting his ass on the line.”, 3. If you’re going to use clever foreign words, Leo, at least take the trouble of discovering what they mean. There’s a word in German that they don’t have in the English language that’s called schadenfreude. It means humiliation for somebody else.”, Almost, Leo. It means taking pleasure in the humiliation of someone else. 4. Because Leo is famous, people suck up to him for knowing what is actually pretty basic, entry-level stuff that loads of normal schoolkids know. DiCaprio had grown up with a melancholy for extinct creatures – he once impressed Dr. Kirk Johnson, the director of the National Museum of Natural History, with his knowledge of the long-gone great auk, a bird hunted to extinction in the 1800s. 5. Leo is only clever relative to the guy they sent to interview him. “I remember the thing that I got the most sad about when I was little was the loss of species that have been as a result of mankind’s intrusion on nature,” says DiCaprio, whose Los Angeles home features a massive fossil collection. He then mentions three species, only one of which I’d ever heard of: “Like the quagga or the Tasmanian tiger or the dodo bird.”, 6. Leo’s environmental bloviating is a direct consequence of his sexual incontinence. Like Warren Beatty, Robert Redford and Paul Newman before him, DiCaprio longed to be seen as something more than just a panty-dropper. 7. More crap a Yoda could not have chosen he. A friend set up a meeting with Gore. The vice president sketched out the planet and the atmosphere on a chalkboard and told the actor, “You want to be involved in environmental issues? This is the most important thing facing all of humanity and the future.”, 8. The world’s oceans are now so awash with campaigning celebrities it is literally impossible to have a scuba accident without a Hollywood actor swimming to your rescue. A couple of years ago, DiCaprio met with a casual friend, the actor Fisher Stevens, once known as Michelle Pfeiffer’s ex and the ethnically dubious star of Short Circuit 2, but now an accomplished documentary producer. The two had become reacquainted while filming the disappearing reefs in the Galapagos, an event made memorable for DiCaprio’s scuba tank malfunctioning while shooting footage and DiCaprio desperately looking for someone to help him to the top. He (of course) found Ed Norton, who shared air with DiCaprio as they slowly ascended to avoid the bends. 9. Even after all the embarrassment, DiCaprio STILL hasn’t worked out what a Chinook is. The links grew stronger as DiCaprio visited the hellish Alberta, Canada, tar-sand oil fields, several hours north of the breathless mountains and streams of the Revenant set. Meanwhile, filming was repeatedly hampered by a lack of snow as Alberta “enjoyed” the warmest winter on record. The connections left Iñárritu and DiCaprio shaking their heads as they suffered through multiple delays. 10. Unlike his waterside-property-owning mentor Al Gore, poor Leo actually believes all that rising sea levels shit…, Then they begin to talk. DiCaprio asks Levine if he’s worried about declining real-estate prices. “I’m not going to preside over Miami Beach becoming Venice,” says Levine. “I think property levels are just going to continue to rise.”, DiCaprio doesn’t agree, saying he’d already unloaded his beach house: “I wouldn’t take that bet.”, 11. Whatever Leo’s smoking, you really don’t want it. Too black. Too strong. The conversation turns to places like Bangladesh that don’t have the money to deal with the rising waters. “The story of climate change is gonna be places with the most military power to protect their own resources,” says DiCaprio, hitting the vape pipe. “The billions of people that haven’t contributed to this problem are gonna be the first to suffer.”, 12. Amid the stupidity Leo has occasional glimmers of personal insight. “I had a friend say, ‘Well, if you’re really this passionate about environmentalism, quit acting,'” he says. “But you soon realize that one hand shakes the other, and being an artist gives you a platform.” He pauses and offers his palms upward. “Not that necessarily people will take anything that I say seriously [….]”, 13. Leo understands that to save the city you’ve got to destroy it. DiCaprio says goodbye to the crew and says he’ll see them in Paris for the climate-change conference. He knows that one of the first things conservatives will throw at him is the amount of fuel used by the thousands of attendees. “There’s no way we’re not all hypocrites,” says DiCaprio. “We’ve built this. Our entire society is oil-based. Everything that you see is because of fossil fuels. The day there is a sustainable way to travel, I’ll be first in line.”, For DiCaprio, the trip was worth it. After the Paris Agreement was signed, he declared, “[This] gives us a shot at saving the planet. There is no time to waste. This marks the end of the fossil-fuel era.”, 14. Monomaniacal bore? Lui?, On the way downtown, I mention that his intensity on global warming is, well, intense. “You noticed that, huh?” he says.\n",

There always are.”, “The solar probe is going to a region of space that has never been explored before,” he explained. “It’s very exciting that we’ll finally get a look. One would like to have some more detailed measurements of what’s going on in the solar wind.”, Nicola Fox, a scientist involved with the Parker Solar Probe project, claimed that the probe “is going to answer questions about solar physics that we’ve puzzled over for more than six decades.”, “It’s a spacecraft loaded with technological breakthroughs that will solve many of the largest mysteries about our star, including finding out why the sun’s corona is so much hotter than its surface,” she claimed. “And we’re very proud to be able to carry Gene’s name with us on this amazing voyage of discovery.”, According to NASA’s official website, “NASA missions are most often renamed after launch and certification.”, “In this case, given Parker’s accomplishments within the field, and how closely aligned this mission is with his research, the decision was made to honor him prior to launch, in order to draw attention to his important contributions to heliophysics and space science,” they declared.

      "Ralf Jaeger, German interior minister for North Rhine-Westphalia, has said that “what happens on the right-wing platforms and in chat rooms is at least as awful as the acts of those assaulting the women.”[Jaeger was distressed that the multiple sex attacks on German women by men of “Arab or North African” appearance in Cologne on New Year’s Eve might bolster the arguments of anti-immigration campaigners. “This is poisoning the climate of our society,” he said. advertisement, It’s not known which websites Jaeger was criticising, but free speech platforms such as 4chan are routinely branded “misogynistic” and “racist” by progressive campaigners and left-wing politicians because they are some of the only remaining places online where citizens can express their frustration with government policy free of censorship. Even on reddit, stories about Cologne were being heavily moderated and in some cases banned yesterday by touchy liberal moderators. Frustrated German citizens were expressing horror on Twitter today that one of their elected officials would compare words on the screen to a series of attacks that includes two alleged rapes and dozens of reported molestations. Germany continues to struggle with its legacy on racism, which, some say, has led to Angela Merkel’s disastrous refugee decisions and produces such outrageous remarks from earnest but out-of-touch politicians. Earlier this month the German government teamed up with Facebook to aggressively police what it called “hate speech,” but which German citizens say amounted to little more than criticism of government policy and anguish at the social effects of mass Muslim immigration. Earlier this week, Cologne mayor Henriette Reker prompted a firestorm of ridicule and criticism when she suggested that women should obey a “code of conduct” to avoid being sexually assaulted in the street. This, said critics, flew in the face of decades of feminist activism on so-called “victim-blaming” and illustrated a double standard when it came to assailants with brown skin.

      "German Police raided the homes of 60 people suspected of writing ‘hate’ speech on social media in Germany. Coordinated by the Federal Criminal Police (BKA), the operation saw officers from 25 departments search across 14 states.[The police raids took place as part of the government’s fight against “verbal radicalisation”, which it said has increased in the wake of Europe’s migrant crisis. BKA President Holger Münch said attacks on migrant shelters were the result of “radicalisation” on social media. advertisement, Forty of the defendants whose homes were raided were wanted in connection with a secret Facebook group focused on Kempten, in Bavaria. The search took place across 13 provinces. Bild reported that xenophobic and Nazi material was distributed on the group’s Facebook page between July and November last year. Attorney Bernhard Menzel, from the prosecutor’s office in Kempten, said that during the raids, police seized storage devices such as laptops and mobile phones. In Berlin, 11 men had their houses searched as part of the anti-‘hate’ speech operation. Berlin police reported that suspects had, independently from one another, written negative messages about migrants and politicians on social networks. Dresden’s interior ministry announced that they searched the properties of eight suspects in Saxony.

      "You have to admire the Obama Administration’s optimism. Even though the Supreme Court issued a stay on the president’s “Clean Power Plan” (CPP) earlier this year, the EPA insists that states should keep moving forward with efforts to radically alter their power sector.[It’s a bold move, since the High Court has already determined that states shouldn’t be compelled to incur such hefty costs before the case is fully litigated. advertisement, At the time of the High Court’s ruling, 27 states had formally opposed the CPP. That number has now risen to 29, as states grow increasingly concerned with both the federal overreach and massive costs involved. Although the president likes to tout the CPP’s projected energy efficiencies, he makes little comment about its economic ramifications. But if there were any doubt as to the plan’s hefty price tag, federal number crunchers at the Energy Information Administration (EIA) have released an analysis of the CPP’s impact. For starters, the EIA says the plan will mean “significantly higher” prices for residential and commercial electricity. They attribute this to “higher transmission and distribution costs” coming at a time when electricity consumption will also grow slightly (in 2015-2040), compared to 2000-2015. Interestingly, the EIA projects that these higher electricity prices will actually reduce demand 2 percent by 2030. Why? Because “compliance actions and higher prices” will force cash-strapped consumers to adopt their own austerity measures. A key part of the CPP is the dismantling of coal-fired power in the U.S. As the EIA sees it, “Coal’s share of total electricity generation, which was 50 percent in 2005 and 33 percent in 2015, falls to 21 percent in 2030 and to 18 percent in 2040.” Coal power plants currently anchor America’s base-load electricity generation, so it’s understandable that their elimination would drive up prices. But is such a move justified?, The EIA projects that “renewable energy” (solar and wind) will play a “significant role in meeting electricity demand growth throughout most of the country.” It’s a bold gamble, since the EIA believes that renewables will account for 27 percent of total U.S. generation by 2040. But EIA data shows wind and solar power supplying only 5.6 percent of U.S. electricity generation in 2015. So, the jump to 27 percent will require significant investments. What’s instructive is EIA data on Germany, where residential retail electric prices have risen, and are expected to keep rising, due to higher taxes and fees for renewable power. Overall, Germany’s foray into green energy has driven the average residential electricity price to 35 cents/kWh, almost three times the U.S. average of 13 cents/kWh. Along with Denmark, Germany has some of the highest residential electricity prices in Europe. Under the Clean Power Plan, the EIA envisions the most significant changes in power generation occurring in regions where coal-fired power has played a key role, including the industrial Midwest. In the Northern Plains, coal power displaced by the CPP is expected to be replaced with increased renewables generation. The net “benefit” of the CPP is that it will lower total power sector carbon dioxide emissions 20 percent by 2030. However, the EIA doesn’t mention the simultaneous increase in CO2 emissions from new coal plants in China, India, and other emerging Asian nations. Overall, the CPP will impose massive expenses on businesses and consumers for CO2 reductions that will be instantly negated by far larger CO2 emissions growth overseas. Perhaps this explains why the Obama Administration’s former Department of Energy fossil fuel director, Charles McConnell, recently told a Congressional panel that the EPA’s plan is “ideological mumbo jumbo” that will not significantly affect global CO2 emissions. As McConnell, who now serves as executive director of Rice University’s Energy and Environment Initiative, subsequently explained, he is “not against climate regulations … but I am against stupid regulations.”, The Supreme Court stay of the Clean Power Plan remains in effect, and governors currently have no legal obligation to comply. But thanks to the findings of the Energy Information Administration, they now have more reasons not to follow through.

      "Hollywood actress and pro-choice activist Scarlett Johansson says any talk about cutting funding to controversial abortion provider Planned Parenthood is “nuts.”[In an exclusive interview for the upcoming May issue of Cosmopolitan magazine, Johansson, 31, discusses using Planned Parenthood’s services, saying that with country facing issues such as terrorism and “global warming,” a conversation about defunding Planned Parenthood is evidence “we’re moving backward.”, advertisement, “There are countries at war, there’s terrorism, global warming, and we’re like, ‘We should definitely cut the budget for Planned Parenthood. Let’s take away the availability of women’s health initiatives!’” she said. “It’s nuts. We’re talking about preventing cervical and breast cancers.”, Johansson adds: “Growing up, I used [Planned Parenthood’s] services. All my girlfriends did—not just for birth control but for Pap smears and breast exams. You read about the rise of back-alley abortions, women having to mutilate themselves and teenagers having to seek help in unsafe conditions, and for what?!”, “We’re moving backward when we’re supposed to be moving forward,” she added, Planned Parenthood again came scrutiny last year after videos recorded in secret by David Daleiden and the Center for Medical Progress allegedly showed the organization’s personnel negotiating the sale of the livers, lungs, hearts and other organs of aborted babies. Planned Parenthood’s alleged selling of aborted unborn children has been a heated topic on the campaign trail and in the debates. Citing the organization’s other free health services for women, GOP frontrunner Donald Trump said in February he would “defund Planned Parenthood as long as they’re doing abortions.”, Republican presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz described Planned Parenthood as a “criminal enterprise” and called for an investigation into its business practices. Cruz told Breitbart News exclusively last August: “It is not sufficient to simply say we’re spending taxpayer funds for one division of the ongoing criminal enterprise, rather than anther division. We should defund Planned Parenthood across the board. Beyond that, the Department of Justice should investigate this criminal conduct and prosecute any and all crimes that investigation uncovers.”, Johansson has not made an official endorsement, but said last year she was “excited” for Hillary Clinton’s presidential bid. On Tuesday’s episode of The View on ABC, Clinton reiterated on her claim from last weekend that an unborn child, even on its due date, has no constitutional rights. A Planned Parenthood political advocacy executive criticized Clinton for referring to a “fetus” as an “unborn child”, In collaboration with Planned Parenthood, Johansson launched a pro-abortion T-shirt line in 2014.

      "MOST POPULAR[Thursday on Hugh Hewitt’s nationally syndicated radio show, “Meet the Press” moderator Chuck Todd was asked how he would define embattled former Fox News Channel host Bill O’Reilly on the heels of his departure from Fox News. advertisement, Todd told host Hugh Hewitt that he didn’t view O’Reilly as a traditional conservative and was more an entertainer than the rest of his Fox News Channel colleagues. Partial transcript as follows (courtesy HughHewitt.com):, HEWITT: Bill O’Reilly is gone. And I have been having an argument online today with our friend, Lachlan Markay at the Daily Beast, and Chris Cillizza. I have never considered Bill a conservative. I thought he was an entertainer, bombastic and loud, and there was a reason that President Obama would much rather be interviewed by Bill O’Reilly than Chuck Todd. He was never going to take you deep and focused. What do you, where do you put him on the spectrum of people who do what we do?, TODD: Look, I agree with you. He was not sort of a traditional conservative. He was, to me, he gave voice, what he did, he was the tone setter. He was sort of that anti-political correctness. That was, if he had a true north, that was it, right?, HEWITT: Yup. TODD: If there was some way he could do that story, and if he could do that every night, right, he would find a way to do some form of that every night. But what he was, was the you know, it’s like he was the opening act that brought the crowds, but he became almost more fun to watch than the concert itself, sometimes. HEWITT: Yeah. TODD: But he was the entertainer, probably more entertainer than any of the others, right? And anybody else in this ecosystem is, I mean, he said it in his own statement. I thought it was incredibly self-aware that he said informed and entertained. He used the word entertained. HEWITT: Yeah. TODD: No real journalist would use that. HEWITT: Yeah, yeah. TODD: Okay, and that’s fine. I admire the self-awareness at least by saying that. But, so but he set a tone, and I think so while he was never, you cannot take an issue and say Bill O’Reilly championed that issue beyond the war, the phony war on Christmas, right? That was like a fun, that was an entertainment thing for him. But you couldn’t say championed one issue or one cause or thing like that. But what was thought, what would the conservative media ecosystem be without him?, HEWITT: Well, he brought people to Fox. He built the mall, right? He built the mall, and the mall has Sean Hannity in it, who like me is a partisan. TODD: Yeah. HEWITT: But he was an anchor store in a mall, but he was not selling conservative goods. That’s what I’ve always said. I’ve got to ask you about, though, the other thing. And I’m, I don’t, allegations are allegations. There are a lot of them about it. I just point out I’ve been doing this since ’89. I’ve never had one allegation against me. And last time I was on your set, I’m sitting next to Tom Brokaw, who’s been doing this a lot longer than that, and there’s never been one allegation against him. You know, it is a business in which it’s possible to be professional and a gentleman without ever attracting these kinds of charges. TODD: It is. And the fact of the matter is, look, here’s my understanding of what happened. The board of directors at 21st Century Fox said this is just bad for business. And I, the culture is bad for business. HEWITT: Yeah. TODD: Obviously, advertisers are speaking. What are you doing? You’re paying all this money. And look, you cannot help but connect O’Reilly to Ailes and say there had to be a culture of look the other way if the guy approving settlements was also accused. So you know, it really underscores this idea that this stuff happens when you create a culture of tolerance for it. HEWITT: Yeah, workplace dynamic matters. I will say this as an NBC guy now, if they put Tucker Carlson in there, and they give Dana that hour, that’s stiff winds for us, because they’re both serious people and they’re smart. And that’s what we have to…, TODD: You know, I don’t want to get into the lineup. I have, let’s just say there’s a lot of people who have a lot of theories about, I will say this. I think there has never been more, if you enjoy watching the cable news prime time game, I would just say this. There’s never been more jump balls. HEWITT: Exactly. TODD: The big guy, the big guy on the block looks more vulnerable than ever. Golden State, they look like, you know, it’s like Golden State without Kevin Durant. It looks pretty beatable. HEWITT: Wait a minute. You’re talking about the Cavaliers without LeBron, Chuck. TODD: Oh, sorry. That’s right. I’m sorry. Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor\n",
      "Living near wind turbines can cause stress, anxiety and sleep loss, a government report has admitted.[The report, commissioned by the former Department for Energy and Climate Change last year, found a “clear link” between the amount of noise emitted by a wind farm and the irritation nearby residents experience. advertisement, If turbines exceed 40 decibels, there is an “increased risk” of sleep deprivation, thus in turn leading to stress and anxiety. However, the sleeplessness was caused more by the frustration evoked from living near a loud wind turbine than the turbine itself, the report added. It recommends that “excessive” noise should be curbed, citing the possibility of modifying turbine blades to stop disturbances. However, it is not just noise that causes irritation. The report also says that flickering shadows caused by revolving turbine blades, as well as the general “appearance in the landscape” of wind farms can be equally irksome, Conservative MP Glyn Davies told the Sunday Telegraph: “Where there are noisy wind farms they are hugely disruptive. Noisy wind farms should be shut down unless they can be changed. They would need to be shut down permanently.”, In 2014, a senior Irish health official warned of so-called “wind turbine syndrome”, saying that infrasonic vibrations emitted by the turbines can potentially lead to “fatigue, dizziness, headache, difficulty concentrating, and insomnia.”, “There are specific risk factors for this syndrome and people with these risk factors experience symptoms,” the country’s deputy chief medical officer said. “These people must be treated appropriately and sensitively as these symptoms can be very debilitating.”, Ireland’s Department of Health did not heed the advice, however, calling it a “general overview of the literature in this area” that “did not constitute expert advice.”\n",
      "CHARLOTTE, NC — Donald Trump offered a “new deal” to African Americans in a speech at the McGlohon Theatre at Spirit Square on Wednesday afternoon, packing hundreds of supporters into the former Baptist church, an unusually small arena for the GOP nominee.[“Today I want to talk about how to grow the African-American middle class, and provide a new deal for black America,” Trump began. advertisement, That “new deal” rests on three pillars — “safe communities, great education, and high-paying jobs” — and one principle: “America first.”, Trump’s pitch to African Americans has been drawing some support. The most recent poll in Pennsylvania showed Trump winning 29% of the black vote, and 30% of the Hispanic vote, in the Keystone State. “Here’s the promise I make to you: whether you vote for me or not, I will be your greatest champion. We live in a very divided country, but I will be your greatest champion,” he said. “Our opponent represents the rigged system and the failed thinking of yesterday,” he said, adding that Hillary Clinton’s campaign represented pessimism. “She’s been doing this for thirty years, and for thirty years it’s only gotten worse.”, Trump’s voice, slightly hoarse, brightened when he described his “movement” — “there’s never been anything like it in this country,” he said. He described the opportunity for change in the political system as “once in a lifetime.”, He went on to describe the many sacrifices made by African Americans for the country — and the dire state of the community today. “In 2015, violent crime in Charlotte increased by 18%, and it’s expected to rise to 24% this year,” he said. He noted that Democrats had governed in African American communities for decades — and achieved nothing. Trump shaped his broader economic policies for a specifically African American audience. describing the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as a threat to jobs in the black community, and talking about illegal immigration as a violation of the civil rights of black Americans. “We won’t let your jobs be stolen from you anymore,” he said. He added that he would cancel subsidies for climate change, “including all global warming payments to the United Nations,” and redirect what he said would be $100 billion over eight years into inner city infrastructure. On education, Trump said: “School choice is the civil rights issue of our time.” He vowed to be the “greatest champion” of school choice for disadvantaged children. He also touted vocational education, remarking that everyone knew classmates who were less adept at book learning but who could take apart a television with their eyes closed, drawing applause from the crowd. On public safety, Trump — who has often cast himself as the law-and-order candidate — said that he had listened to the concerns of the black community, and that under his administration, the law would be applied “fairly, equally, and without prejudice.”, He also slammed what he called a double standard that benefited Hillary Clinton, saying that if he had done what she had done, he would receive “the electric chair.”, He noted that Clinton associate Terry McAuliffe, the governor of Virginia, had given nearly $500,000 in campaign donations to the wife of the deputy director of the FBI as Clintons case was under consideration. Later, in discussing corruption, Trump was met with chants of “Drain the swamp!”, his latest slogan on the campaign trail. Trump added that his “new deal” also included “the protection of religious liberty,” which drew a standing ovation. He vowed “support for the African-American church,” which he said had been a “tremendous power” in America. He closed with a swipe at Obamacare, reminding the audience that Obama had lied to sell the plan. “Obamacare is now destroying our health care system.” He noted that premiums in Arizona were soaring 118%. “Doctors are quitting, insurers are leaving, and companies are fleeing … If we don’t repeal and replace Obamacare, we will lose our health care system forever.”, The audience was a diverse one, and welcomed Trump warmly. Herb, an international marketing specialist from Fort Mill, South Carolina, told Breitbart News he expects Trump to win North Carolina decisively despite polls showing a statistical dead heat — thanks to the role of silent Trump supporters. “I’m Puerto Rican. I’m Latino. I’m supposed to be a Democrat. I just came out of the closet,” he said. “How can anybody by happy with the idea of Hillary Clinton as president? Considering all she’s done — not said, but done.”, Prior to the address, Trump had met backstage with a group of African-American faith and community leaders from North Carolina. Joel B.

      "Traffic congestion and skyrocketing housing prices have caused approximately 46 percent of the Bay Area’s millennial residents to start looking at potentially exiting the increasingly unlivable region.[The findings were part of a new poll released by the Bay Area Council on Thursday which also showed that 40 percent of Bay Area residents say they want to move away from the area over the next few years. That figure is up by 12 percent from last year’s report from the Bay Area Council which found that 34 percent of residents wanted to exit. advertisement, “It turns out that we were wrong about millennial preferences, the stories were wrong that millennials wanted to live in a hyper-urban environment and that it would be OK to raise families in a condo,” Micah Weinberg, president of the Bay Area Council’s Economic Institute, said, according to the East Bay Times. “Millennials are putting off family formation, but when they have a family, they want what their parents had: a house on a nice lot pretty close to work.”, The council reportedly polled 1,000 residents across nine Bay Area counties in late January for its annual survey including Alameda, Contra Costa, Santa Clara, San Mateo, San Francisco, Marin, Sonoma, Napa and Solano Counties. Asked which direction those polled believe the Bay Area is going, the Council found that 42 percent believed it was going down the “wrong track,” an increase of 15 percent since 2014. , The council also found that most of the people polled, 26 percent, have household incomes greater than $150,000 annually. Breitbart News previously reported that the housing affordability crisis in the Bay Area has caused many small businesses to lose their employees as workers have been forced to leave the region for more affordable neighborhoods. , Last year, in neighboring Palo Alto, a tiny 180-square-foot shack was listed for sale at $1.98 million. Around the same time, a 764-square-foot rotting, wooden earthquake shack located close to San Francisco’s Mission district sold for $408,000. Follow Adelle Nazarian on Facebook and Twitter.\n",

This respect extends to every student of Tulane and every member of the broader community,” the statement said. “The comment was written on a makeshift wall on our private property, normally used for a game of capture the flag, to mock the ideologies of a political candidate.”, Tulane University said in a statement that it “encourages and supports the free exchange of ideas and opinions,” but the fraternity’s actions “sparked a visceral reaction in the context of a very heated and divisive political season.”, You can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at ben@yiannopoulos.net\n",
      "Marion Maréchal-Le Pen, a rising star of France’s right wing, has backed Donald Trump’s bid for the White House.[The niece of Front National leader Marine Le Pen said the Republican presidential nominee “responds to people’s hopes” and wrote to Twitter: “Donald Trump is a less harmful candidate than Hillary Clinton.”, advertisement, \"Donald #Trump est un candidat moins néfaste que ne le serait #Hillary #Clinton\" #USA #MMLP, — Marion Le Pen (@Marion_M_Le_Pen) July 27, 2016, , Her aunt has previously been compared to Mr. Trump due to their similar views on immigration, climate change, Christian values, and patriotism. A New Yorker headline from December 2015 declared: “Donald Trump is now America’s Marine Le Pen”. Marion became the youngest French Member of Parliament in modern history aged just 22 in 2012, while studying law in Paris, and remains one of the party’s only two members of parliament. She is unapologetic about her strong Catholic faith and defence of traditional values, and recently called for Christians to stand up for their values in the wake of the Islamic State attack in Nice – where a priest was beheaded as he gave mass in a church. She tweeted: “In the West as in the East, Christians must stand up to resist Islam!” Adding: “Faced with the threat that weighs on France, I decided to join the military reserve. I invite all the young patriots to do the same.”, She has also called on France to scrap the European open-borders Schengen agreement as her country wages a “war against radical Islam”. Sarah Palin, the former Governor of Alaska and U.S. presidential running mate, recently wrote in Breitbart that Marion was her “political crush” who she would vote for if she were French. “Marion Maréchal-Le Pen is the new deserved ‘It Girl’ of French politics and a clear voice of courage and common sense in a country and continent in need of both,” she wrote. Adding:, “But despite today’s tough losses, Marion and her aunt Marine Le Pen, the leader of the National Front (FN) Party, have established themselves and their supporters as a force to be reckoned with in France’s 2017 presidential race, in which Marine is sure to be a contender with her talented niece right behind her.”\n",
      "A California college professor who called President Trump’s election win an “act of terrorism” during class was nominated to become “faculty member of the year,” Campus Reform reported.[A panel of school administrators are in charge of selecting the professor for the award, which gives the chosen faculty member a chance to speak at Orange Coast College’s commencement ceremony. advertisement, The professor in question, Olga Perez Stable-Cox, declined the award for an unspecified reason, according to Doug Bennet, executive director of college advancement at OCC. Even though Cox turned down the award, some people at the school think the faculty’s decision to nominate her was wrong in the first place, given what she said last semester. “The fact that the faculty chose professor Cox for the faculty member of the year award speaks volumes to how blind they are about what she did last semester,” said Joshua Recalde-Martinez, president-emeritus of OCC’s College Republicans group. On Saturday, campus police discovered graffiti targeting the OCC College Republicans and Recalde-Martinez. “Doxx Joshua Martinez OCC Young Republicans = Fascists,” one graffiti message read, according to the Los Angeles Times. Recalde-Martinez says that Cox probably did not accept the nomination because of these recent events. “She understood the impact that accepting the nomination could have on the campus climate, and that is why she refused,” Recalde-Martinez said. Recalde-Martinez’s group is the same group responsible for posting the video of Cox’s comments on Facebook. In her comments, Cox blamed the Electoral College for Trump’s win and and said that the “act of terrorism” was committed by someone “among us.”, “It’s an act of terrorism. One of the most frightening things for me, and most people in my life, is that the people committing the assault are among us,” Cox said.

      "1. Target: Trump[Is there a media-driven “climate of violence”?  You bet there is, and it’s being whipped up by the left and the Main Stream Media, here and around the world.  And it has a clear purpose: The ultimate goal is the destruction of the Trump presidency—and, for at least some, seemingly, the goal is the assassination of President Trump himself. , advertisement, But don’t take Virgil’s word for it: Have a look at the cover of Village magazine.  That cover shows a rifle’s crosshairs superimposed on a photograph of Trump’s head.  And the headline reads, “Why not.” , , The once-obscure magazine, published in Ireland, is now basking in worldwide attention, and American social media are happy to magnify Village’s glorification of a criminal act.  Here’s that deadly image, for example, on Twitter.  As an aside, we might ask: Doesn’t Twitter have rules against “hate speech” and “incitement of violence”?  Or are they not enforced when the target is on the right?, The Village article itself plays a clever editorial game.  It begins by describing Trump as “a purveyor of hatred” and then lists all his other purported sins, including the mistreatment of refugees, an overall wrong-headed foreign policy, retrograde ideas on “climate change,” and opposition to abortion. , After that litany, the magazine considers the options: “So perhaps the solution is tyrannicide.  As he might say himself—‘take him out.’”  , Next, under the heading, “Kill Him?” the magazine proceeds to cite philosophers and theologians who have declared tyrannicide to be justifiable, from Cicero to Thomas Aquinas to Martin Luther.  And then, to rub the point in even harder, the magazine admiringly recalls the German Klaus von Stauffenberg, who nearly succeeded in killing Hitler in 1944.  The message is obvious: Trump is another Hitler, and so you, the reader, must decide for yourself what to do next. , Yet then, having raised all these issues in the most load-the-deck manner possible, the magazine pulls back, sort of, at the last moment. It writes, “Shooting Trump is unnecessary and disproportionate.” , Of course, we all know what’s going on here.  Indeed, Virgil recognizes the technique employed by Village as a variant on the ancient rhetorical device known as paralepsis–that is, raising an idea while pretending not to raise it.  Having argued, vehemently and at length, that Trump is a civilization-level menace, the magazine then adds a few weasel-words about not harming him.  So Village hopes that it has itself covered: If any bad fate befalls Trump, its writers will say, as they barely conceal their smirks, “Gee, we didn’t want that to happen!” , Indeed, even before the Village article, the idea of killing the 45th president was out there—bigtime.  Various  celebrities and rappers have wished death, if not murder, on Trump. , And Twitter seems to be a favored venue: The online publication Mashable reports in just the first 12 days of the Trump presidency, more than 12,000 tweets have called for the President’s assassination.  As the story notes, this volume of threats is far beyond the capacity of the US Secret Service to investigate. Meanwhile, the incendiary attacks keep coming.  Under the header, “Beau Willimon Declares War On Donald Trump,” Deadline: Hollywood details the strenuous efforts of the House of Cards creator to bring the President down.  The  article details Willimon’s voluminous tweets, including his own mock-version of the Declaration of Independence, which begins with the words:, Perhaps one day, Twitter, and other social media, will get around to deleting these offensive, dangerous, and illegal posts.  Of course, perhaps one day, it will be too late.  Perhaps then, in the view of the anti-Trump haters, it will be a case of the end justifying the means—“mission: accomplished.” , 2.  The “Climate of Violence”—The Left Loves It So Much, So let’s look more closely at this idea of a “climate of violence,” which is said to foster acts of actual violence.  Sometimes this inflammatory “climate” is real, and sometimes it is not real.  We’ve learned that while the political left usually says that it opposes this sort of violence-inducing “climatology,” in fact, quite often, it embraces it—even adores it. , Yes, today, the left talks a lot about “peace,” “coexistence,” and all that.  And yet, as Virgil wrote in January, when it comes to Trump, one tool of the left, the MSM, gets notably militant it becomes hormonally eager to reach for violent imagery.   , So it’s in this context that we must evaluate extreme anti-Trump media items, such as the semi-suggestion of Rosa Brooks, a former high official in the Obama administration, that what’s needed is a military coup d’etat against the Trump White House.  We can note that Brooks published this piece in a well-known MSM outlet, Foreign Policy, on January 30, and it’s still there.  Nobody in the MSM, at least, seems to have a problem with it.  , More recently, in the same pro-violence spirit, the German magazine Der Spiegel, arguably the most influential publication in that country, unveiled a cover story showing a knife-wielding Trump holding high the bloodily decapitated head of Liberty, from the Statue of Liberty.  The message to readers is clear: We must stop this madman before it’s too late.  , , We can note that the Spiegel cover was admiringly echoed all over the planet among the admirers was The Washington Post, which, sticking up for the American media, pointed out that The New York Daily News had presented a similar cover back in December 2015. , Meanwhile, as John Nolte has chronicled, CNN has been a serial offender: For more than a year now, it has hurled, against Trump, just about every loaded epithet imaginable. , And it’s not just Trump.  It’s also his staff that’s in the crosshairs.  For instance, on February 5, USA Today published an editorial entitled, “What Bannon shares with ISIL leader.”  Yes, you read that right: A newspaper that claims a readership in the many millions just equated White House adviser Stephen K. Bannon and the Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.  As the piece asserted brazenly, the two “share similar world views.”  , We might pause to note that this was an editorial, as opposed to a random opinion piece.  In other words, the words represent the collective judgment of the USA Today editorial board, whose names can be found here.  Yes, this is what they really think.  The sheer nuttiness of the editorial aside, we can observe that the piece is seemingly an open invitation to take, uh, strong action against Bannon.  , So, yes, the left hates the “climate of violence”—except when it loves it.  , And there’s a long history: Perhaps the most cynical use of the “climate” trope has been the way that the left has twisted the cultural and historical memory of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963.   , That tragic incident, of course, occurred in Dallas then, and now, North Texas has been a conservative area.  And so for more than half-a-century, it’s been an MSM cliche—boosted by prominent historians, such as Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.—that a local “climate of hate” was somehow responsible for JFK’s death.  Even today, after it’s been established beyond doubt that the assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, was a pro-Castro communist, the “climate of hate” meme still persists in the MSM.  In other words, it’s the fault of Dallas, and the right, that Kennedy was murdered. , Similarly, after the 2011 shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, the left/MSM immediately heaped the blame on “right-wing media.”  And this drumbeat has continued, even after it was learned that the shooter, Jared Lee Loughner, was sexually obsessed with Giffords and was listening to nothing but the voices in his head. , More recently still, in 2016, we were reminded that the left never objects to a climate of violence—if it’s for a “good cause.”  Thanks to the efforts of James O’Keefe and others, it’s easy to find abundant, we-have-it-on-tape evidence that the Clinton campaign, or at least its close allies, deliberately sent provocateurs to Trump rallies to cause trouble—trouble which then could then be blamed on Trump.  In the summarizing words of Breitbart’s Joel Pollak:, Clinton’s defenders might claim she did not know anything about the tactics being used, but that defense does not suffice.  The consultants who carried out the tactic, centered around Robert Creamer and his Democracy Partners organization, told O’Keefe’s undercover investigators that they had set up a “double-blind” system so that Clinton would not have to know directly about any particular action being taken on her behalf, but Creamer appeared to admit on video that Clinton had general knowledge about their activities. Needless to say, state and local authorities have been completely uninterested in pursuing any of these seemingly open-and-shut cases of conspiracy and incitement. , And the beat goes on.  In DC on January 21, the pop-singer Madonna, speaking to a large crowd of angry feminist protesters, mused about “blowing up the White House.”  And she has continued to defend her remarks, which could reasonably be construed as incitement to violence, even murder.  (One can only imagine what would have happened if a conservative had said that.)  And yet of course, Madonna will face no economic or legal consequences indeed, Hollywood will probably find a way to give her some new award or endorsement gig.  , In the meantime, out west, Milo Yiannopoulos has also been the object of a “climate of violence.”  And yet for their part, pressies have oscillated between yawning and cheering.  A man was shot and critically wounded in Seattle, and still, the MSM didn’t much care, because, after all, the man seems to have been a Milo supporter. , And just a few days ago, at the University of California’s Berkeley campus, rioters shut down a Milo appearance.  As Milo said afterward, the rioting “tells you something very, very clear about the left’s commitment to free expression.”   It’s worth recalling that back in 1964, Berkeley was the hub of what was grandiosely dubbed, by students, as the “Free Speech Movement.”  Now, 53 years later, the self-proclaimed guardians of the First Amendment have had no interest in upholding Milo’s constitutional right to free speech. , In fact, some on the left have gone the complete opposite way: toward fact-free ideological conspiracy-mongering.  One such is UC Berkeley’s Robert Reich, the former Clinton cabinet secretary Reich went on TV to accuse the right—and specifically, Breitbart—of causing the violence, as a provocation against the left.   In other words, the whole fracas was Milo’s fault.  Talk about blaming the victim! , Reich’s brand of fantastic projection was too much for Rush Limbaugh, who asked of his radio-show audience:  , Do you know any right-wingers capable of this kind of behavior?  I mean, go to Ferguson, go to Baltimore, go to San Bernardino, go to Watts.  Take any protest, any violence.  Go to Oakland any time you want.  Any time there is violent protests, it’s always left-wingers bought and paid for by the Hillary campaign, the Democrat Party, or George Soros, and never once have the Democrats ever condemned them, ’cause they’re proud of them. Yes, that is correct: Cutting-edge Democrats have never condemned the violent hooligans doing their dirty work, for one simple reason—they’re proud of them. , And even now, Reich continues to unapologetically—make that, eagerly—spew his crackpot conspiratorializing.  Obviously Reich is a devotee of the Big Lie: that is, a falsehood, repeated often enough, equals truth.  So never mind the fact that we have since learned that it was the anti-Milo protesters who were on someone’s payroll—George Soros’ payroll.  (We might also observe, not that any of the local authorities seem to have noticed, that the fomenting—and financing—of violence is a crime.), As Milo told Fox News’ Tucker Carlson, the left’s game plan is to claim that its opponents are nothing but racists, sexists, white nationalists, anti-Semites, and homophobes.  And to make these charges, the left doesn’t need any evidence, only the accusations.  Once again, that’s the Big Lie technique.  And yet such fact-free slandering is just fine with the MSM, which then goes to work amplifying the accusations, thus amping up, yes, the “culture of violence.”  As Milo said:, The media has created this environment in which it’s okay to say almost anything about somebody who is right of Jane Fonda. … And it’s a way of legitimizing, in some cases, as happened last night, violent responses. And we might add, beyond Milo, Breitbart itself is increasingly the target.  Virgil might add that the tactics being used are straight out of Saul Alinsky’s Rules for Radicals.  All of Alinsky’s “rules” are being practiced today, but we can focus on Rule #11: “Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.”, Breitbart is tough we’re used to fights and fighting.  This wasn’t a fight we began, but it is a fight we seek to win.  And yet everyone on the populist-nationalist right ought to see the current situation clearly: The hard left has plenty of resources, and no scruples about deploying those resources.  And so Breitbart is just one of many targets.  And of course, if the left can attack us, well, Soros &amp Co. won’t stop there.  They’ll be coming for you next. , So that’s the real context of the vast “climate of violence” conjured up by the left. It’s all part of a master plan—a plan for mastery.  That is, smash the enemy, and then rearrange the pieces into a new left-wing order. , Yet in the meantime, we must remember the main target: President Trump.  And so we can can step back and observe, with grim certainty, the dream scenario of some on the other side: , A weird and bloody kind of lefty-media glory awaits the person who takes to heart the message of that cover story in Village.\n",
      "What Americans have long viewed to be the traditional nuclear family arrangement — children living with a working father and stay-at-home mother in their first marriage — is now one of the rarer family structures in the U.S. says a new report from the Pew Research Center.[In 2014, just 14 percent of children under the age of 18 were living with parents in their first marriage with a father who worked and a stay-at-home mother. In the 1960s 50 percent of children lived in that family environment, declining to 26 percent in 1980 and continuing to decline until the 1990s when Pew reports the level began to remain more steady. advertisement, Asian American children were more likely to live in that “traditional” family structure than any other group — with 24 percent living with parents in their first marriage in which the dad worked and the mother stayed at home compared to 18 percent of Hispanics, 15 percent of white and 4 percent of blacks. More prevalent overall, according to Pew, is the family arrangement in which parents are in their first marriage but have “other work arrangements.” In 1960 24 percent of children lived in such households, in 2014, 32 percent of children lived in homes with married parents in “other” work arrangements. Forty-seven percent of Asian-American families had this structure in 2014, compared to 25 percent of Hispanic families, 37 percent of white families, and 18 percent of black families. While the shift has been away from the “traditional” structure to other arrangements — including 15 percent with remarried parents, 7 percent with cohabiting parents and 5 percent living with neither parent — Pew reports that the biggest change has been the increase of children living in single-parent households. Where in 1960 just 9 percent of children lived with a single parent, in 2014, 26 percent of children lived with a single parent. Asian-American children were the least likely to live in this family structure, with just 13 percent in single-parent homes. Meanwhile, 29 percent of Hispanic children, 19 percent of white children, and 54 percent of black children lived in single-parent homes. Pew notes there is a strong link between family structure and economic outcome, with children living with cohabiting parents or single-parent families being “two to three times more likely” to be living in poverty than children in married parent homes. Further, children living in homes where both parents work tend to be more well off than those in homes where just dad worked.\n",
      "Scandal producers Shonda Rhimes and Betsy Beers produced a 12-minute biopic of Hillary Clinton’s life that aired live just moments before the Democratic presidential nominee took the stage at the party’s national convention in Philadelphia Thursday night.[The short film, narrated by actor and Clinton supporter Morgan Freeman, includes a brief biography of the candidate’s mother, Dorothy Rodham, and also features interviews with 9/11 first responders, Clinton’s childhood friends, President Obama and former President Bill Clinton. advertisement, “It is an honor to provide America with an intimate portrait of Hillary,” Rhimes, who also produces ABC’s Grey’s Anatomy and How to Get Away with Murder, said in a statement. “Everyone already knows the powerhouse. Now, with this piece, everyone will also get to know the person.”, , Rhimes is one of Clinton’s biggest Hollywood backers. In March, the writer-producer enlisted some of the stars of her television series — Ellen Pompeo, Kerry Washington and Viola Davis — for an advertisement in support of Clinton that aired on ABC. In February, Clinton visited the set of Rhimes’ Scandal and posed for pictures with the show’s cast, including Washington and actor Tony Goldwyn, who spoke at the Democratic National Convention earlier this week. The stars of the series also hosted a fundraiser for Clinton’s campaign in Washington, D.C. in April. Rhimes has also been a vocal critic of Clinton’s chief opponent, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. The most recent season of Scandal featured the character of Hollis Doyle, an unabashedly sexist, xenophobic billionaire oil magnate running for president as a Republican who was not so subtly based on Trump. Rhimes was also among the more than 100 celebrities who joined progressive group MoveOn.org’s “United Against Hate” initiative earlier this week in an effort to prevent Trump from winning the White House in November. Rhimes was not the only high-profile Hollywood producer to create videos for the DNC. Star Wars: The Force Awakens director J.J. Abrams produced an introductory video for First Lady Michelle Obama on the first night of the convention, while Avatar director James Cameron helmed a pro-Clinton climate change warning video that aired at the convention Wednesday night.  , Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum,  ,  \n",
      "Jerry Seinfeld has lent his support to Kathy Griffin after the comedian came under fire last week for a photo in which she posed with a fake, bloodied head meant to resemble President Donald Trump, saying in an interview he believes Griffin simply made a “bad joke.”[“Yes, it was a bad joke. Every comedian tells bad jokes,” the 63-year-old Seinfeld star told People magazine Tuesday. advertisement, “We all do it. That’s how we find the good jokes. So someone told a bad joke — so what, I don’t understand the big deal,” he added. Griffin sparked a firestorm last week when a photo taken during a shoot with L.A.-based photographer Tyler Shields was published by TMZ. The photo showed the 56-year-old My Life on the D-List star holding a decapitated prosthetic head meant to resemble that of the president in her outstretched arm. Griffin quickly apologized after the viral photo drew strong condemnation from both sides of the political aisle, writing in a Twitter message that she had gone “too far.” In his own response, Trump called the photo “sick,” while First Lady Melania Trump described it as “very disturbing” and “simply wrong.”, In a press conference Friday, Griffin fought back tears as she accused the Trump family of bullying her and attempting to ruin her career. The comedian was fired from her role on CNN’s New Year’s Eve Live coverage in the wake of the controversy, while at least five venues on her cross-country comedy tour scrapped her scheduled performances. The Secret Service also opened an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the photo shoot. Seinfeld wasn’t the only celebrity to come to Griffin’s defense in a speech at the premiere of his new Showtime series last week, actor Jim Carrey advised Griffin to double down on the photo by holding up Trump’s “severed leg,” adding that comics represent the “last line of defense” in a a politically-charged environment. Actor and Saturday Night Live Trump impersonator Alec Baldwin also reached out to Griffin on social media following the backlash, and advised her to ignore her critics.  , Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum\n",
      "Online voting to choose San Diego’s Major League Soccer (MLS) team currently shows “Footy McFooty Face” leading other possible names by a wide margin.[By Saturday morning, “Footy McFooty Face” had 5,229 votes, well over four times as many as of the other possible names. advertisement, According to 10 News, the other names include “San Diego Bad Hombres,” “San Diego Surf,” “Mission San Diego FC,” “San Diego Football Club (SDFC),” and “San Diego Armada.”, Votes can be cast on SoccerCity SD’s Facebook page. There is precedent for Internet voting to go awry in these kinds of situations. For example, in March 2016 the British government decided to let people vote online to name a $287 million “polar research ship.” The New York Times reports that people “quickly disregarded the more dignified names suggested by the Natural Environment Research Council,” opting instead for “R.R.S. Boaty McBoatface.”, The Huffington Post reports that Mountain Dew asked internet voters to “Dub the Dew” by choosing a name for a new flavor in 2014. The voting was “hijacked” by 4Chan, and the names with the most votes were “‘Hitler Did Nothing Wrong,’ ‘Diabeetus’ [and] ‘Moist Nugget.’”, The voting to name San Diego’s MLS team ends March 31. SoccerCity SD has not said whether it will use “Footy McFooty Face,” if in fact that name wins the internet poll. Ultimately, the British government decided to name the research vessel the RRS Sir David Attenborough, after a popular host of nature programs. It named a submersible research vehicle Boaty McBoatface instead, in a mild tribute to the results of the original popular vote.

      "Despite protests from progressive student activists, Cal Poly State University President Jeffrey Armstrong issued a memo defending Breitbart Senior Editor MILO’s right to speak on campus next week.[On Wednesday afternoon, Armstrong issued the following memo to the entire campus community:, advertisement, Many of you have raised concerns about Milo Yiannopoulos, a guest speaker invited by the Cal Poly College Republicans club to present at Cal Poly on January 31, 2017. Several individuals who find Mr. Yiannopoulos’ comments offensive have contacted the university and demanded that he not be permitted to speak. To be clear, it is not the role of a public institution such as ours to endorse any position or decide who should or should not be allowed to appear on campus. Indeed, numerous guest speakers considered by many to be controversial or offensive have presented at our university throughout its history. Armstrong’s statement is true. In 2012, he also quietly dismissed those who were protesting conservative commentator Ann Coulter’s right to speak on campus. Challenging the “safe space” rhetoric of his counterparts, Armstrong continued to emphasize that “Public universities such as Cal Poly represent communities where the free exchange of opposing ideas is both encouraged and necessary.”, “It is, in fact, the university’s responsibility to support the rights of all people to express their opinions and ideas – regardless of how unpopular they may be – while also encouraging students to think critically and independently,” he explained. “It is only in this environment that students hone the ability to consider a spectrum of information and reach informed and intelligent conclusions.”, “The real danger is not the expression of controversial voices – it is censorship and the restriction of free speech,” continued Armstrong. “Freedom of speech is a foundational tenet of higher education and a functional democracy. It does not allow for the suppression of viewpoints based upon popularity or individual perspectives. Rather, open expression of a diversity of ideas and opinions – including those we may not agree with – ensures rich discussion, debate and critical thought.”, “Protecting freedom of speech is not an option,” Armstrong concluded. “[I]t is a critical responsibility that the university, and all of us as members of a democratic society, must defend.”\n",
      "The Tacoma Public School Superintendent is now demanding “safe zones” for migrant students after President Donald Trump’s immigration executive orders were signed earlier last week.[Superintendent Carla Santorno told parents of the Tacoma School District in a letter, that she would like to see safe zones for students so they can be hidden from federal immigration officials, should authorities show up to any schools looking to deport them. advertisement, “Our schools will be a safe zone for immigrant students to learn and thrive,” Santorno wrote. “The diversity of our student body, our community and our staff is a strength that benefits all of us and should be celebrated. Our rich cultures and the more than 70 different languages spoken in our schools provides all children with the opportunity to learn from others with dissimilar backgrounds and recognizes our common humanity.”, Santorno also said the Tacoma Public School Board would be reviewing a resolution that would further help provide migrants with a “safe zone.”, “Every school has been directed to provide a safe, private location where students may seek assistance, information, and support related to any immigration law enforcement that interferes with their learning experience,” Santorno continued. “To support this work, our School Board is evaluating a Resolution in support of every student, every day in an equitable and inclusive environment.”, “We will continue providing all students their legal right to access free public K-12 education, regardless of their religion, their place of birth, their language, their citizenship, their immigration status, their parents’ status or any other legally protected characteristics,” Santorno wrote in the letter. The Tacoma Public School District is one of the first education systems promising to protect migrants with a physical safe zone for them, echoing similar strategies by universities across the country which have promised to be “sanctuary campuses”.

      "According to a report by the Yale Daily News, a recent survey revealed that conservative views are “unwelcome” on the Ivy League school’s campus. [Of the over 2,000 students from across the political spectrum who participated in the survey, over 75 percent agreed that Yale “does not provide a welcoming environment for conservative students to share their opinions on political issues.”, advertisement, “Anybody who supports Donald Trump or is a Republican is just hated,” said one survey respondent, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of backlash from liberal students. “I just get the general vibe that Republicans aren’t respected for their beliefs as much as maybe the liberal people are.”, Of the Yale students that support Donald Trump, more than 60 percent revealed that they feel uncomfortable discussing their political beliefs publicly. More than 60 percent of the 103 Yale students supporting Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said they are “uncomfortable” or “very uncomfortable” discussing their political beliefs at Yale. …, By contrast, more than 98 percent of respondents said Yale is welcoming to students with liberal beliefs. And among students who described themselves as “liberal” or “very liberal,” 85 percent said they are “comfortable” or “very comfortable” sharing their political views in campus discussions. …, Claire Williamson ’17 said it became harder to express conservative viewpoints during the controversies surrounding Calhoun College and the title“master” last fall. Students who did not hold the “popular vocal opinion” of renaming the college and changing the title were seen not only as wrong, she said, but as bad people. “I would say it’s a frustrating Catch-22 to be a conservative-leaning moderate or conservative on campus,” Williamson said. “You’re sort of airing your own political views and trying to talk about them with the risk that someone disagrees with you to the point of assuming you’re an immoral person because of them. You either stay silent or you risk alienating some of your friends and groups around you.”, Yale isn’t the only Ivy League institution where conservative students have felt that they are unwelcome.

      "WASHINGTON, D.C. – The top U.S. military commander in Europe said Thursday at a Senate hearing that the terrorist threat is higher in Europe than anywhere on the globe, with the exception of current war zones.[“The number of threat streams that we have of this type within Europe, it’s probably higher in Europe than in any other part of the globe with the exception of the places where we’re actually physically fighting in, like Syria and Afghanistan and Iraq,” said U.S. Army Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti. advertisement, The four-star Army general told senators on the Senate Armed Services Committee that a terrorist attack in London the day before underscores “the dynamic environment in Europe.”, “Europe is challenged by both the flow of terrorists returning from Syria and other places. They’re challenged by an internal threat by those inspired by ISIS or directed by ISIS and this is another, an example of the attacks that we’ve seen in Europe in the past year. It’s a difficult challenge.”, Scaparotti, who is dual-hatted as NATO Supreme Allied Commander, said the U.S. would remain “solid and stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our allies in NATO to defeat this threat.”, When asked by committee Chairman John McCain (R-AZ) whether there is a “connection” between the increased threat stream and refugees, Scaparotti responded:, The flow of refugees and those who move them, particularly criminal activities that will help move them, they also are more than willing to move both equipment, personnel, weapons, and people. So far, eight have been arrested in connection with the London terror attack, the deadliest there in 12 years. The attack underscores the difficulties Europe is facing from homegrown Islamic terrorism, while it handles an influx of refugees from war-torn countries. Prime Minister Theresa May said the attacker was British-born and once linked to violent extremism. She said he had been investigated by security services but was regarded as a “peripheral figure.”, An ISIS-affiliated news agency has claimed the attacker was a “soldier” of ISIS inspired by its message, though direct evidence has not yet emerged. Four people have died in the attack so far, including the attacker, who plowed a car into crowds of people, injuring over 40 and killing two people. He then stabbed a police officer dead at the gates of the UK Parliament. “The likelihood of further actions like this, particularly by some that are self-indoctrinated, are very hard to stop,” McCain said.\n",
      "The NBA announced its decision on Thursday to move its 2017 All-Star Game from Charlotte because of a North Carolina law that restricts multiple-person public bathrooms on government property to those matching the biological sex indicated on the entrances.[North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory issued an immediate blistering response. advertisement, “The sports and entertainment elite, Attorney General Roy Cooper and the liberal media have for months misrepresented our laws and maligned the people of North Carolina simply because most people believe boys and girls should be able to use school bathrooms, locker rooms and showers without the opposite sex present,” Governor McCrory stated in a response. “Twenty-one other states have joined North Carolina to challenge the federal overreach by the Obama administration mandating their bathroom policies in all businesses and schools instead of allowing accommodations for unique circumstances. Left-wing special interest groups have no moral authority to try and intimidate the large majority of American parents who agree in common-sense bathroom and shower privacy for our children. American families should be on notice that the selective corporate elite are imposing their political will on communities in which they do business, thus bypassing the democratic and legal process.”, The NBA, which enthusiastically travels to China in October for preseason games, issued a statement explaining the decision to bail on a city that built an arena for league use for more than a quarter-billion dollars more than a decade ago. The statement in part read:, Since March, when North Carolina enacted HB2 and the issue of legal protections for the LGBT community in Charlotte became prominent, the NBA and the Charlotte Hornets have been working diligently to foster constructive dialogue and try to effect positive change. We have been guided in these discussions by the long-standing core values of our league. These include not only diversity, inclusion, fairness and respect for others but also the willingness to listen and consider opposing points of view. Our week-long schedule of All-Star events and activities is intended to be a global celebration of basketball, our league, and the values for which we stand, and to bring together all members of the NBA community — current and former players, league and team officials, business partners, and fans. While we recognize that the NBA cannot choose the law in every city, state, and country in which we do business, we do not believe we can successfully host our All-Star festivities in Charlotte in the climate created by HB2. We are particularly mindful of the impact of this decision on our fans in North Carolina, who are among the most passionate in our league. It is also important to stress that the City of Charlotte and the Hornets organization have sought to provide an inclusive environment and that the Hornets will continue to ensure that all patrons — including members of the LGBT community — feel welcome while attending games and events in their arena. We look forward to re-starting plans for our All-Star festivities in Charlotte for 2019 provided there is an appropriate resolution to this matter. The NBA indicated that Charlotte could reapply to host its All-Star Game in 2019 should lawmakers repeal House Bill 2, which allows girls to use public school restrooms without fear of an invasion of privacy by a member of the opposite sex and moms to use rest-stop restrooms without sharing them with males. The NBA promises to name a replacement host for 2017’s All-Star Game soon. Adrian Wojnarowski reports that the league leans toward New Orleans. The NBA, which didn’t admit an African-American player until its fourth season, remains, like the WNBA and state-operated public bathrooms in the Tar Heel State, the domain of a single sex. \n",

GMG has exceeded its target of cutting 250 jobs, with 70 journalists taking voluntary redundancy as the media group struggles to deal with the harsh advertising environment that is hurting print publications.Controversy over responsibility for losses at GMG led to Alan Rusbridger, its former editor-in-chief,, Controversy over responsibility for losses at GMG led to Alan Rusbridger, its former editor-in-chief, stepping down in May as incoming chair of the Scott Trust, which is GMG’s sole shareholder. Mr Rusbridger and Andrew Miller, GMG’s former chief executive, were accused of allowing costs to escalate as the Guardian expanded globally. The Guardian’s growth, including launching digital editions in the US and Australia, was predicated on increasing digital advertising while remaining free online. Although it recorded 167m monthly unique browsers in June, it has faced intense competition for advertising from Facebook and Google. The operating loss of £68.7m for the year to March, to be unveiled on Wednesday, exceeds its earlier estimate of £58.6m, according to figures circulated to senior executives.

Special Envoy — honored the life of the late UN diplomat Sergio Vieira de Mello, who was killed in Iraq in 2003, and praised the United Nations as a vital forum where countries could come together to seek peace and unity. advertisement, But Jolie also sounded a warning note, saying that as an American citizen, she sees a global environment “more troubling and uncertain” than at any time in her lifetime. “We are grappling with a level of conflict and insecurity that seems to exceed our will and capabilities,” Jolie said, “with more refugees than ever before, and new wars erupting on top of existing conflicts, some already lasting decades.”, “We see a rising tide of nationalism, masquerading as patriotism, and the re-emergence of policies encouraging fear and hatred of others,” she added. , The actress also appeared to criticize President Donald Trump without mentioning his name, referring to leaders who talk “as if some of our proudest achievements are in fact our biggest liabilities – whether it is the tradition of successfully integrating refugees into our societies, or the institutions and treaties we have built rooted in laws and human rights.”, Describing herself as a “proud American” and an “internationalist,” Jolie called for reform at the United Nations so as not to “bequeath a darker and more unstable world to all those who come after us.”, “The challenge is how to restore that sense of balance and hopefulness in our countries, while not sacrificing all we have learnt about the value and necessity of internationalism,” Jolie said. “Because a world in which we turn our back on our global responsibilities will be a world that produces greater insecurity, violence and danger for us and for our children.”, Read the full transcript of Jolie’s speech here.  , Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum\n",
      "The international nuclear accord signed with Iran should be abrogated due to Iran’s recent provocative moves, posited John Bolton, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.[Bolton was being interviewed for “Aaron Klein Investigative Radio,” broadcast on New York’s AM 970 The Answer and Philadelphia’s NewsTalk 990 AM. advertisement, Klein, who doubles as Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter, asked Bolton how the U.S. should respond in light of Iran’s recent ballistic missile tests, which may go against the comprehensive nuclear agreement signed in Vienna last year. “I think that the real decision here has to be to abrogate the entire Vienna nuclear deal,” Bolton replied. “It was a strategic mistake when it was signed for the United States. It’s been violated repeatedly by the Iranian regime. They violate now both on ballistic missiles and on the nuclear side. Bolton continued:, But it’s very clear that what the Obama administration, Secretary of State Kerry, former Secretary of State Clinton are doing is playing the same kind of game we saw played so badly during the Cold War. They think if only they can help the moderates, in quotes, in Iran, that they can basically remove the Ayatollahs peacefully, sideline the Revolutionary Guard Corps, stop the ballistic missile and nuclear programs, convince the Saudi Arabian government to share the Middle East with Iran and that peace will break out. And this idea that somehow the United States can identify moderates that we can then influence the internal politics of a country like Iran is just the same delusion as in the Cold War. Reuters reported last week on the international concern over the ballistic missile tests:, A series of tests conducted by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards caused international concern, with the United States, France and other countries saying that, if confirmed, the launch of nuclear-capable ballistic missiles would violate U.N. Security Council resolution 2231. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called for Western powers to take “immediate punitive steps” against Iran in response to the missile launchings. Last week, the United Nations Security Council and the European Union criticized Iran’s missile launchings as disrupting the “peaceful environment” and eroding trust with the international community, but neither body took any action against Tehran.  The UN said more information was needed before determining whether Iran violated a UN resolution approved after the nuclear accord was finalized.  \n",
      "Amid activist calls additional protections for transgendered migrants, the Obama administration is planning a new detention facility for illegal immigrants that would include a unit designated solely for transgender detainees, according to a new report.[Fusion reports that Immigration and Customs Enforcement has confirmed plans for a separate transgender unit within the new facility, slated to open in November in Alvarado, Texas. advertisement, “The facility is expected to house about 700 detainees, including a separate 36-bed unit for transgender individuals,” Carl Rusnok, an ICE spokesman, told Fusion. The facility will be called the Prairieland Dention Center and provide each transgender detainee with an special detention plan “covering items such as searches, clothing options, hygiene practices, medical care, and housing assignments,” Rusnok added to Fusion. While ICE is taking special precautions to house transgendered illegal immigrants in safe conditions, the plan is not quite what immigrant rights activists had in mind. Rather activists, according to Fusion, would prefer the transgender illegal immigrants not be housed in a detention facility at all but rather with community organizations. “[ICE] is talking about the new detention center as if they are providing as a service to the community, and they’re not,” Isa Noyola, the program director at the Transgender Law Center, told Fusion. ICE estimates that it has about 65 “transgender woman” in it’s custody on an average night, according to Fusion. Last year the Obama administration issued a memorandum dictating the proper care and placement of transgendered detainees in ICE custody. “The Transgender Care Memorandum reaffirms ICE’s commitment to provide a safe, secure, and respectful environment for all those in our custody, including those individuals who identify as transgender,” Thomas Homan, the Executive Assistant Director for ICE’s Office of Enforcement and Removal Operations, said in a statement at the time. “We want to make sure our employees have the tools and resources available to learn more about how to interact with transgender individuals and ensure effective standards exist to house and care for them throughout the custody cycle,” he added.\n",
      "Pistol permits for citizens in “Danbury [Connecticut] and seven surrounding towns” are running “30 percent” above the previous record, set in the post-Sandy Hook climate of 2013.[One of the biggest motivators for the current surge in permits is concern over the government’s inability to protect citizens from violence. advertisement, According to The News-Times:, “Without a doubt, we saw a dramatic increase in 2013 after the events of Dec. 14, 2012, and we are seeing it spike again this year,” said Newtown Police Chief James Viadero, referring to the Sandy Hook shooting in 2012. “People say ‘Chief, I would just like to have a gun in the home for personal protection,’ and you have to admit they do have a legitimate concern, Viadero said. “You had the event at the Pulse in Orlando and then Dallas happened last week, and now you wake up and see what just happened in France.”, Bethel First Selectman Mike Knickerbocker spoke to the spike in permits by suggesting another driving force is the fear of more gun control. He said, “It’s a national trend that gun sales and permit applications spike after a mass shooting hits the news, and Bethel is part of that trend. People think ‘Oh no, this is going to be the event that makes Congress restrict guns, so I better get one now.’”, Knickerbocker’s observation is apropos, as the town of Bethel has issued more permits January through June 2016 than it did in all of 2013. And Bethel Police Chief Jeffrey Finch made clear the desire for gun ownership goes beyond handguns alone. He said, “People I know who couldn’t be bothered with guns before now want to get an AR-15, because they think their right to buy one is going to be taken away.”, Finch also pointed out that the spike in permits comes at a time when “crime is down.” But people do not feel safe, and “perception can be every bit as serious as the facts.” He said, “The government still tells us that they are taking care of everything, but nobody believes that anymore.”, AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

      "Filmmaker Oliver Stone railed against the U.S. government, technology giants and the presidential candidates of both parties during a Wednesday press junket in France for his upcoming Edward Snowden biopic.[During an appearance at Cannes Lions to promote Snowden, Stone reportedly accused technology giants including Facebook, Google and Microsoft of “collaborating” with the U.S. government in the notorious ex-NSA contractor’s case. advertisement, “It’s a form of fascism — the sovereignty of the state versus the sovereignty of the individual,” Stone said, according to AdWeek. “It’s the reverse of the way this country was founded.”, The 69-year-old three-time Oscar-winner also piled on both political parties’ presumptive presidential nominees, accusing Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton of supporting what he called “the surveillance state.”, The National Security Agency’s (NSA) secret domestic surveillance program “was not even mentioned in the debates both candidates are for it—and want more of it, it seems. Nor have they discussed climate control, nor the Earth’s fate, nor the wars and the U.S.’s involvement in them, nor the buildup of our military,” Stone said. The controversial director’s upcoming biopic Snowden tells the story of former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, who leaked classified details of the U.S. government’s surveillance programs in 2013 before fleeing the country and taking asylum in Russia. Stone previously revealed that he held secret meetings with Snowden in Russia while preparing the biopic. At one point, the director said, he became so fearful of interference from the National Security Agency that he moved the film’s entire production from the United States to Germany. , When asked his thoughts on Trump, Stone dodged the question and instead bashed both Clinton and the GOP White House hopeful. “Both candidates represent the system and there’s no alternative of voices in the American scene,” Stone said. “There’s this form of sanitized politics, and we don’t talk about that.”, Stone also expressed doubts about President Obama’s “conviction” as it relates to the U.S. surveillance programs. “I don’t know that he’s a man of conviction,” he said, adding that “Snowden’s revelations are not a campaign issue.”, Stone also mentioned that there is a scene in his upcoming film that features a clip of Trump calling for Snowden’s execution.

      "Despite his voiced desire to stay out of the political theater, former president Barack Obama returned again to defend his presidency and speak out against his successor Donald Trump.[The former president has repeatedly spoken out against Republicans and their policies, facing a sharp reversal of his presidency. advertisement, “I want to be quiet a little bit and not hear myself talk so darn much,” Obama said to reporters during the last press conference of his presidency. But it’s clear that the president has no intention of staying out of the public spotlight. On Sunday, the president urged members of Congress to save Obamacare, his signature piece of legislation. He described all the Democrats who voted for Obamacare and lost their re-election campaigns as a “profile in courage.” He urged members of Congress, “look at the facts” and “speak the truth” as they faced future legislation. “I hope that current members of Congress recall that it actually doesn’t take a lot of courage to aid those who are already powerful, already comfortable, already influential,” he said. “But it does require some courage to champion the vulnerable and the sick and the infirm, those who often have no access to the corridors of power.”, Obama delivered his speech after receiving the 2017 John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award. In March, Obama issued a statement to defend his bill as Republicans neared a vote in the House of Representatives to replace it. He described his political victory as a moral one. “We finally declared that in America, health care is not a privilege for a few, but a right for everybody,” he said in a lengthy statement. Obama also broke his silence to praise protests of President Donald Trump’s travel ban, saying that “American values are at stake.”, During a political forum at the University of Chicago, Obama defended an immigration system that wasn’t strictly adherent to the rule of law. “It’s not like everybody on Ellis Island had their papers straight,” he said. “The history of our immigration has always been a little bit haphazard.”, He also urged students to confront “economic inequality” in the United States, inequality in the justice system, and even climate change. Obama then broke his silence to endorse French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron, in an effort to break the chain of populist-nationalist political victories in Europe.  “I have admired the campaign that Emmanuel Macron has run,” Obama said. “He has stood up for liberal values, he put forward a vision for the important role that France plays in Europe and around the world. And he is committed to a better future for the French people. He appeals to people’s hopes and not their fears.”, The president will likely speak out against the rising tide of populist-nationalism in the world later this month during a conversation with German Chancellor Angela Merkel about global responsibility.  \n",
      "West Virginia Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin III praised President Donald Trump’s reversal Tuesday of President Barack Obama’s “Clean Power Plan,” which created a regulatory regime that targeted the coal mining industry and coal-fired energy plants.[“Since I was governor, I have fought against unnecessary bureaucratic regulations that harm our way of life with no regard for the catastrophic economic impacts they have on West Virginians,” said the only Democrat to stand and applaud during the president’s joint address to Congress. advertisement, “We need to strike a balance between the environment and the economy. The Clean Power Plan never achieved that balance. Rolling back this regulation is a positive step towards preventing further job loss, increases to consumer energy bills, and more damage to our economy,” he said. “We must stop ignoring the damage these regulations caused our energy sector, our economy and our way of life in West Virginia,” the senator said. The president touched on the human side of what he called the War on Coal in his remarks Tuesday after signing the executive orders. I actually, in one case, I went to a group of miners in West Virginia — you remember, Shelly — and I said, how about this: Why don’t we get together, we’ll go to another place, and you’ll get another job you won’t mine anymore. Do you like that idea? They said, no, we don’t like that idea — we love to mine, that’s what we want to do. I said, if that’s what you want to do, that’s what you’re going to do. And I was very impressed. They love the job. That’s what their job is. I fully understand that. I grew up in a real estate family, and until this recent little excursion into the world of politics, I could never understand anybody who would not want to be in the world of real estate. (Laughter.) Believe me. So I understand it. And we’re with you 100 percent, and that’s what you’re going to do. Okay?, The “Shelly” Trump was calling out was  Senator Shelly Moore Capito (R-WV), Manchin’s fellow senator from the Mountain State. Manchin said Trump gets it on coal and the effects of the last administration’s approach towards coal. “This step by the administration recognizes that the Clean Power Plan went beyond the bounds of EPA’s authority, instead of working against us and imposing self-inflicted economic wounds like the last administration,” he said.\n",
      "MOST POPULAR[Thursday night at PBS Democratic presidential primary debate, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) challenged his opponent Hillary Clinton on her Wall Street contributions. advertisement, Sanders said, “This has blown me away. Never in a million years would I have believed I would be standing here tonight saying that we have received $3.5 million individual contributions from well over a million people. Now, Secretary Clinton’s super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million last reporting period, $15 million from Wall Street. Our average contribution is $27. I’m very proud of that.”, Clinton said, “Let me respond. We are mixing apples and oranges. My 750,000 donors have contributed donations. That demonstrates the strength of support we have among people who want to see change in our country. But the real issue I think the senator is injecting into this is that if you had a super PAC, like President Obama had, which now says it wants to support me—it’s not my PAC—if you take donations from Wall Street, you can’t be independent. I debated President Obama numerous times. He was the recipient of the largest number of donations ever. When it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street. He pushed through and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930s. So let’s not in any way imply here that either President Obama or myself would in any way not take on any vested interest, whether it’s Wall Street or drug companies or insurance companies or frankly the gun lobby to stand up to do what’s best for the American people!”, Sanders said, “Let’s not insult the intelligence of the American people. People aren’t dumb. Why in God’s name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions? I guess just for the fun of it. They want to throw money around. Why does the pharmaceutical industry make any contribution? Any connection to our people paying the highest amount of money for prescription drugs? Why does the fossil fuel industry pay huge amounts of money in contributions? Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and this we have got to transform our energy system? And when we talk about Wall Street, let’s talk about Wall Street. I voted for Dodd-Frank. Got an important amendment in it. My view, it doesn’t go anywhere near far enough. But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash. No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted.”, Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN\n",
      "The ongoing saga of LGBT protests of an upcoming Chick-fil-A restaurant on campus at Duquesne University, a Catholic college in Pittsburgh, has taken on biblical dimensions as a test-case of safe spaces and microaggressions in American higher education.[According to its mission statement, Duquesne University is “a Catholic university founded by members of the Congregation of the Holy Spirit,” dedicated to serving God while espousing a “profound concern for moral and spiritual values.” It also professes a commitment to “an ecumenical atmosphere open to diversity.”, advertisement, For its part, Chick-fil-A CEO management has articulated a biblical understanding of marriage that exactly mirrors Catholic teaching, while also emphasizing that they do not discriminate in any way, and are more than happy to serve anyone who wishes to eat at their establishment. In 2012, Dan Cathy, CEO of Chick-fil-A, stated: “We are very much supportive of the family — the biblical definition of the family unit. We are a family-owned business, a family-led business, and we are married to our first wives. We give God thanks for that.”, “We know that it might not be popular with everyone, but thank the Lord, we live in a country where we can share our values and operate on biblical principles,” he said. Lambda Gay-Straight Alliance, the LGBT student organization on campus, considers Chick-fil-A’s commitment to traditional marriage potentially offensive to gay students, despite the obvious fact that no one is required to patronize the restaurant who doesn’t want to. At the March 26 meeting, Lambda executive board member Niko Martini proposed that the Student Government Association (SGA) pass a resolution asking the university to reconsider the inclusion of Chick-fil-A as a dining option for students. Martini said he made the proposal on his own behalf and not Lambda’s. “Chick-fil-A has a questionable history on civil rights and human rights,” Martini said. “I think it’s imperative the university chooses to do business with organizations that coincide with the [university’s] mission and expectations they give students regarding diversity and inclusion.”, Martini did not explain how eliminating a food establishment committed to a biblical understanding of marriage would increase diversity on campus. Meanwhile Lambda President Rachel Coury expressed worries that the safety of LGBT students might be at risk. “I’ve tried very hard within the last semester and a half to promote this safe environment for the LGBTQ+ community,” Coury said. “So I fear that with the Chick-fil-A being in Options that maybe people will feel that safe place is at risk.”, Debate sparked by the confrontation, swirling around a series of issues from religious liberty to gay rights to a proper academic environment, have now reached a national level, according to the Duquesne Duke, the university’s campus newspaper. In an interview on Fox and Friends, retired U.S. Army Ranger Sean Parnell, an alumnus of Duquesne University, minced no words in expressing his dissent from the contemporary environment on the campus of his alma mater. “They’re a bunch of babies. College is supposed to prepare you for the real world, not shield you from opposing opinions, and safe spaces do exactly that. Who doesn’t want as an undergrad Chick-fil-A on their campus? I would have killed for a c on my campus when I was at Duquesne,” he said. “My message is: toughen up. there are no safe spaces in the real world,” he said. “If you’re going to be successful in this life after you leave college you’ve got to learn to embrace adversity and open yourself up to a litany of different opinions. You will never be a CEO of a major company or an entrepreneur or a manager if you are not willing to work with people different than you.”, Hostility toward proponents of traditional marriage was foreseen by Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito in his potent dissent of the landmark 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges case that made gay marriage the law of the land. Alito prophesied that the misguided decision would be used to damage citizens who do not share a contemporary view of marriage as an elastic arrangement between an unspecified number of unspecified persons. “It will be used,” he wrote presciently, “to vilify Americans who are unwilling to assent to the new orthodoxy.”, Follow Thomas D.

      "A new survey from CNBC shows that Americans are highly optimistic about the economy and strongly support for President Donald Trump’s economic agenda.[The “CNBC All American Survey” recorded the highest level of economic optimism in its 10 year existence. Thirty-eight percent of the public say the economy is good or excellent, a four point improvement from December. Forty percent expect the economy to improve over the next year, which is close to the record set in 2010–when the economy was in truly dire straits. advertisement, The survey also shows overwhelmingly strong support for Trump’s plans to improve America’s infrastructure, cut taxes, and renegotiate trade deals.  Nearly 75 percent of Americans approve of Trump’s infrastructure improvement plans, with just around 10 percent disapproving. More than 60 percent of the public endorse plans to cut individual taxes, with just over 20 percent opposing. Renegotiating trade deals is favored by 58 percent of the public, and opposed by just over 25 percent. Reducing taxes also wins the approval of most Americans, but it generates opposition from over a third of the public. Cutting business regulations has an approval rating in the high forties, and a disapproval rating in the mid-thirties. The results on trade show that while Americans are divided over the benefits of free trade–34 percent say it helps the U.S. and 31 percent say it hurts–they aren’t divided on the president’s efforts to strike better trade deals. According to CNBC’s Steve Liesman, even Americans who like free trade say they approve of those efforts. Fifty-one percent of Republicans say that they want their party to “work to pass Trump’s agenda” rather than “hold the line on conservative positions.” Democrats divide nearly evenly on whether their party should compromise with the president. The president’s personal popularity is far weaker than his economic agenda. Just 39 percent say they approve of how he is doing his job, compared with 48 percent who disapprove, and 13 percent who said they don’t know or were unsure. One reason for this may be that many of the most public actions taken by the Trump administration have been in areas where public support is weaker. Nearly half of Americans say they disagree with the Trump administration’s attempt to replace Obamacare.  The border wall also divides Americans, with slightly more Americans opposing it than supporting it, according to the CNBC survey. Efforts to rollback some of the Obama administration’s policies on climate change also have more opposition than support. The survey is not perfect. It’s results show that nearly half of Americans oppose Trump’s “Immigration Ban,” when there was no ban on immigration. Instead, the administration tried to put in place a temporary halt on travel from certain countries. Perhaps the actual question asked, which CNBC has not released, was less contentious.\n",
      "President Barack Obama’s Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) director, John Brennan, said that people on federal government no-fly lists are subjected to “unnecessary searches and inconvenience.”[Brennan’s 2010 remarks depart from the current Democratic Party effort to ban people on the no-fly list from purchasing firearms. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is using that effort as a political tool to bash Republicans and the National Rifle Association, saying, “If you’re too dangerous to get on a plane, you’re too dangerous to buy a gun in America.”, advertisement, Republicans have blocked the measure for various reasons, including because, as Marco Rubio put it, “The majority of the people on the no-fly list are often times people that just basically have the same name as somebody else who don’t belong on the no-fly list.”, But Brennan, who then served as President Obama’s homeland security adviser, spoke at the Islamic Center at New York University in February 2010, where he seemed to take the eventual Republican side in the political battle that sprang up several years after his remarks. Brennan said:, In the spirit of candor, we must also acknowledge that over the years the actions of our own government have at times perpetuated those attitudes. Violations of the Patriot Act, surveillance that has been excessive, policies perceived as profiling, over-inclusive no-fly lists subjecting law-abiding individuals to unnecessary searches and inconvenience, creating an unhelpful atmosphere around many Muslim charities that made Muslims hesitant to fill their sacred obligation of zakat.  (17:00 Minute Mark In Video Below), Of those and other problems, Brennan said, “President Obama and his administration are pursuing a comprehensive approach to address them.”,  Brennan also praised Islam, disparaged terrorists who supposedly misrepresent Islam, and said that jihad is a legitimate “holy struggle.” He said:, But for more than three decades I have also had the tremendous fortune to travel the world, and as part of that experience to learn about the goodness and beauty of Islam. As a college student in the 1970’s, I spent a summer traveling through Indonesia, taking in the wonderful landscape, culture and people of Java and Bali. Despite my long hair, and my earring, and my obvious American appearance, I was welcomed throughout that country in a way that is a reflection of the tremendous warmth of Islamic cultures and societies. Like the president during his childhood years in Jakarta, I came to see Islam not how it is often misrepresented, but for what it is…A faith of peace and tolerance and great diversity. “They are not jihadists,” Brennan said of terrorists. “For jihad is a holy struggle, an effort to purify for a legitimate purpose, and there is nothing, absolutely nothing, holy or pure or legitimate or Islamic about murdering innocent men, women, and children.” (12:15 Mark n Video Below), ,  \n",

There’s no debate! The science is settled. But people continue to do this smokescreen and pretend that there’s a debate, you know?”, “And I think the Armenian Genocide is the same in that there is no debate,” Bale continued. “The evidence is in. And hopefully what is needed is not more hostility—it’s healing, it’s help, and of course there’s the complication of reparations and the desire not to admit that your country is born out of one of the worst atrocities known to mankind.”, Asked about how a free press is always constrained under tyrannical dictatorships, Bale said it’s “worrying, isn’t it, for us right now?”, “It’s like we’re watching somebody reading a ‘Dictatorship for Dummies’ book,” the American Psycho star said. Bale had few details to offer about his rumored role as former Vice President Dick Cheney in an upcoming biopic about the former vice president’s life from writer-director Adam McKay. “Well, we’re very early days.

      "MOST POPULAR[Actress Rosario Dawson blasted Dolores Huerta in an open letter regarding the Latino activist’s criticism of Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders. advertisement, In a post on Medium in February, Huerta, who is a United Farm Workers co-founder, slammed Sanders’ record on immigration. “Sanders has positioned himself as a champion of the immigrant community … But here’s the truth: Candidate Bernie Sanders, advocate for immigrants, is not the same as Senator Bernie Sanders,” wrote Huerta. Huerta also claimed Sanders supporters chanted “English only” at her while she tried to translate for Spanish-speaking caucus-goers, after Clinton won the Nevada caucus in February. Dawson — who laid into the Democratic National Committee this week for allegedly showing preferential treatment to Hillary Clinton over Sen. Bernie Sanders — published an open letter at the Huffington Post this week, in which she accuses the 85-year-old of creating “a narrative that distorts facts and misguides American voters.”, While Dawson does praise Huerta for her decades of immigration advocacy, she also accuses her of assisting the DNC in distorting Sanders’ record:, …It’s race baiting, misleading, divisive and inaccurate and I hope you both will rectify that immediately. Regardless of either your interpretations of the event, the guidelines strictly prohibited any form of communication with caucus participants by campaigners once the caucus was called to order!, The democratic process, as it was intended, is quite simple: Present your facts, track records and plans, move forward honestly and openly, debate, call out discrepancies, explain and educate, then let the American people decide whom they would like to lead the country based on such answers. By distorting and omitting facts you do not give us, the American people, a transparent picture. You cheat us out of making an educated and well-informed decision and dishonor our voting process and democracy itself. … Bernie Sanders, the proud son of an immigrant, wants to raise the minimum wage and make it easier for workers to join or form a union. He led the first civil rights sit-in in Chicago history, protesting the University of Chicago’s segregated housing policy walked alongside Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. during the 1963 March on Washington, supports ending all family deportations and is the leading voice on issues of income inequality, global warming, LGBTQ issues, and universal health care. He is transparent and consistent and has been, time and time again, on the right side of history fighting for all of us and our rights.

      "MOST POPULAR[Sunday on CNN’s State of the Union,” while discussing leaked audio of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton saying the supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) live in their parents basements, Sanders said, “Well, I agree with her,” adding the claim that he was making “false promises,” to them bothers him. advertisement, Partial transcript as follows:, TAPPER: What was your reaction when you heard that, calling your ideas indefensible, saying that you were selling them false promises?, SANDERS:  Well, two things. If you listen to the whole discussion that she had, a very important point that she made is that a lot of young people who went into debt, worked very hard to get a good education get out of school and can’t find jobs commensurate with the education that they received. And there’s a lot of unhappiness about young people.  And this is an issue that we must address.  But the bottom line here is that I think that what Secretary Clinton and I have done since the election, since the primary nominating process, we have worked together in a number of areas…And, by the way, apropos to Donald Trump not paying any taxes, she’s come up with an estate tax proposal which will ask the very wealthiest people in this country, wealthiest families in this country to start paying their fair share. TAPPER:  Yes.  I get that, Senator.  But she’s calling other ideas you pitched, not the ones that you two are working on together, but she called other ones false promises and said what you were doing was indefensible.  That must bother you. SANDERS:  Well, look, we’re — of course it does. But we’re in the middle of a campaign.  And I — trust me.  If you go to some of the statements that I made about Hillary Clinton, you can see real differences.  So we have differences.  There’s nothing to be surprised about.  That’s what a campaign is all about. TAPPER: She also said this about your supports and also I should remind people they should go and listen. Go to the The Washington Free Beacon website they have the whole comments. You should listen to them all. But here is what she said about your supporters. (AUDIO CLIP) CLINTON:  Some are new to politics completely.  They are children of the great recession, and they are living in their parents’ basement.  So, if you’re feeling that you’re consigned to being a barista or, you know, some other job that doesn’t pay a lot and doesn’t have much of a ladder of opportunity attached to it, then the idea that maybe, just maybe, you could be part of a political revolution is pretty appealing. TAPPER:  What was your reaction to that, sir?, SANDERS:  Well, I agree with her.  What she’s saying is what I suggested a moment ago.  There are young people who went deeply into debt, worked very hard to get a good education, and yet they are getting out of school and they can’t find decent-paying jobs.  And that’s a major problem.  They are living in their parents’ basements.  And that’s the point there. So, I personally do believe we do need a political revolution, that we do need to transform the society, create decent-paying jobs, make sure that Donald Trump and his billionaire friends start paying their fair share of taxes, do what Donald Trump does not want us to do, address the crisis of climate change, transform our energy system, do what Donald Trump does not want us to do, raise the minimum wage to a living wage, and have pay equity for women.  So, I think that Secretary Clinton — and, by the way, as I said, I just talked to her a few days ago — she’s prepared on all of those issues to move forward within the first 100 days of her administration…, TAPPER:  Senator, what would you say to a Bernie Sanders supporter who listens to that tape and thinks, that sounds condescending, to call me a basement-dwelling barista that’s buying false promises from Bernie Sanders, and I think she’s just using Bernie Sanders to get elected? What is your message to that Bernie Sanders supporter?, SANDERS:  This is what the message would be.  Take a hard look, not at Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump.  Take a hard look at the needs of the American people.  And issue by issue, whether it is climate change, whether it is Citizens United, the need to overturn that, whether it is pay equity for women, whether it is raising the minimum wage to a living wage, rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, a tax system that says to Trump and his friends they are going start paying their fair share of taxes, look at Clinton’s positions, look at Trump’s positions, understand that one or the other of those two will be the next president of the United States. And after you take a hard look at those two candidates and their issues, I think the conclusion that the vast majority of people will reach is that Clinton is far and away the superior candidate.

      "You’ve read about the climate fraud committed ‘on an unbelievable scale’ by the shysters at NASA.[You’ve read about how NOAA overestimated US warming by 50 percent. advertisement, Now it’s NSIDC’s turn to be caught red-handed fiddling the data and cooking the books. NSIDC – National Snow and Ice Data Center – is the US government agency which provides the official statistics on such matters as sea ice coverage in the Arctic. Naturally its research is of paramount importance to the climate alarmists’ narrative that man-made global warming is causing the polar ice caps to melt. At least it was until those ice caps refused to play ball…, Where the alarmists have for years been doomily predicting ice free summers in the Arctic –  according to Al Gore in 2007, 2008 and 2009 it would be gone by 2013 – the truth is that multi-year ice has been staging a recovery since 2009. , So what do you do if reality doesn’t suit your narrative? Simple. If you’re NSIDC (and NASA and NOAA…) you just change reality. NSIDC’s latest attempt to breathe new life into the corpse of the alarmist narrative comprised a press release a few weeks ago claiming that 5+ year old sea ice is at its smallest level on record. To prove it, they’ve produced a new chart that looks like this. , But according to Steven Goddard of the Real Science website this claim needs to be taken with a huge pinch of salt. Note how, to confuse matters, NSIDC have upended their chart so that 5+ year ice instead of being at the bottom is now at the top. Far worse, though, they’ve gone and deleted all the old style maps from their archive. At least they thought they had. But a sharp eyed reader of Goddard’s managed to find one old style map that NSIDC had forgotten to delete. This enabled Goddard to compare the new style map with an old style map for the same week. What he discovered is that NSIDC has been making some dramatic and unexplained adjustments to the record: about half the 5+ year sea ice which should be there, for example, has been mysteriously erased. Here is a chart Goddard has composed showing the differences. , And here are the two maps, new and old. Note how much larger the 5+ year sea ice coverage is on the old one than on the new one. Note also that there is no scientific reason for this.  , , , NSIDC must know that what they are doing is unethical. Why else would they have gone to the trouble not just of deleting their old records – but of trying to block the auto-archiving of that data?, , We’re often told by the alarmist establishment that the ‘science is settled’, that there’s a 97 per cent consensus on man-made global warming and that the debate is over. Well, fine. But normally when a case is rock solid the facts are allowed to speak for themselves. Usually, the only time you need to tamper with the evidence is when you’re really desperate and when, you might say, you’re skating on really thin ice…\n",
      "The Polar Ocean Challenge expedition – aka Ship of Fools II – has escaped from the Arctic by the skin of its teeth.[It was supposed to show how amazingly navigable the Arctic Circle has become now that climate change is supposedly melting the polar ice caps at a dangerous and unprecedented rate. But according to one observer who has followed their progress closely (see comments at Paul Homewood‘s place), the intrepid explorers – including a 14-year-old boy – came within just two days of calamity, after being hampered by unexpectedly large quantities of a mysterious substance apparently made of frozen water. advertisement, The southern NWP route is now closed at the NE exit, with northern Prince Regent Sound blocked by 9/10 ice in freeze up mode. Exactly where they barely made it through after hours of probing on 9/12. Northabout made it through NWP with just two days to spare. Had they taken the planned 2 days resupplying in Barrow rather than 1, and the planned one day call at Cambridge Bay (meeting up with Polar Bound), they would not have made it out and would have had to turn around and overwinter at Cambridge Bay. It was that close. You’d never have guessed this listening to the expedition leader David Hempleman-Adams on the BBC yesterday. Though he admitted the journey had been a close-run thing, he maintained heroically that all that extra ice he had encountered was not a sign that the climate alarmists had got their predictions wrong. “We’re not scientists. We weren’t collecting data. It’s wrong to suggest that this adventure will show that there’s less ice,” he explained – or rather tried to explain. “All we’re trying to do is to make people more aware of the hundreds of scientists doing good work who actually do show that.”, So, on the one hand, Hempleman-Adams is asking that we see him as a rank amateur with no scientific expertise. And on the other, almost in the same breath, he is asking us to trust his judgement that there are “hundreds of scientists” who claim the Arctic is melting at unprecedented speed are doing “good work.”, How exactly does he know this?, Well the answer is, he doesn’t. Clearly he doesn’t because if he’d done his homework, he’d find that far from shrinking at dangerous rates predicted by loons like Cambridge University’s house climate loon Peter Wadhams  Arctic Ice has already passed its minimum this year (earlier than usual) and is now growing at a quite terrifying lick. , Paul Homewood notes:, It is now safe to confirm that the minimum Arctic sea ice extent has now been passed this year, with an area of 4.083 million sq km on 7th September. This is 22% greater than in 2012, despite two major storms in August that led to break up of ice. The ice has been regrowing remarkably rapidly for the last week, and already stands above the start of the month. Tentatively, we may be seeing one of the fastest September growths on record. It’s also the earliest minimum since 1997, indicating that the Arctic is currently experiencing a very cold spell. Needless to say, this is not the version of events you are seeing reported in the mainstream media. Here’s the New York Times breathlessly reporting “Arctic Ice Shrinks to Second Lowest Level on Record.”, Not even the Daily Mail has proved immune to the scaremongering, reporting a “tremendous loss” – even though it’s no greater than the one recorded in 2007 and even though it’s not remotely unprecedented historically. By far the worst culprit, though, in perpetuating alarmist myths is the BBC which has just produced this emotive video claiming that a “3 million year ice age is coming to an end” making it harder for polar bears to find food on the shrinking ice. This – as polar bear expert Dr Susan Crockford explains – is “polar bear tragedy porn dressed as science.”, This new effort by the BBC would make the PR department of theCenter for Biological Diversity proud, with it’s prominent use of animal tragedy porn pretending to be science. In contrast, the actual science shows something quite different: though summer sea ice since 2007 has declined to levels not predicted until 2040-2070, there has been virtually no negative impact on polar bear health or survival, a result no one predicted back in 2005. When the history of the great late 20th/early 21st century climate scare is written, no institution is going to emerge with less distinction than the BBC.\n",

      "The future of the mining industry isn’t below ground — it’s asteroids in the reaches of space.[The world has begun to look beyond Earth itself for a frontier boom that will make the madcap California gold rush of 1849 seem like little more than a brief economic diversion. advertisement, In 2009, The Review of U.S. Human Spaceflight Plans Committee concluded that we must “chart a path for human expansion into the solar system” in “seeking a human spaceflight program worthy of a great nation.” At the time, they had projected a $99 billion dollar investment to that end by 2019. Recent developments suggest that even that sum is little more than a drop in the bucket compared to the potential value floating in the immediate vicinity of our planet. Just outside our atmosphere is a single 90-foot-wide asteroid hosting about $50 billion in platinum. It’s one of the virtually innumerable examples of rich but untapped resources, floating just beyond our grasp. It’s so close, yet so far. Right now, it takes a ludicrous amount of fuel just to carry the fuel that we’d use to return safely home — much less the prohibitive amounts that would be required for any major mining operation. To alleviate this problem, Canadian company Deltion Innovations wants to use the asteroids themselves to provide that fuel. The company, which is designing tools and equipment specifically for the challenges of space mining, believes that it can use electrolysis to break down the copious amounts of water frozen on asteroids into its base components of hydrogen and oxygen, and use that in the creation of fuel that wouldn’t need to be hauled up when breaking Earth’s gravity. If successful, the practical range of operations within our solar system would explode. President Barack Obama ensured that U.S. mining interests would have a strong position from which to launch such harvesting operations when he signed the U.S. Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act, giving them until 2023 before they would be subject to regulation, and thus become bound by the international Outer Space Treaty of 1967. So far, however, it’s the tiny European country of Luxembourg that’s made the greatest strides toward a frontier that is quite literally caked with untold billions — even trillions — of unclaimed wealth. American companies like Planetary Resources and Deep Space Industries are migrating to Luxembourg at the promise of $227 million in government funding. It’s a whole new space race, with the future of the world economy on the line. Follow Nate Church @Get2Church on Twitter for the latest news in gaming and technology, and snarky opinions on both.\n",
      "Students at the University of California, Santa Barbara, recently held an anti-racism rally in response to pro-Trump chalk messages that appeared throughout the campus in early April.[Student organizers of the “Million Student March” at UCSB claimed that the “heinous, racist, sexist, Islamophobic, anti-semitic, homophobic, and transphobic chalk statements”  lead “to an intensification of campus climate.” As a sequel to a march in November 2015, the students organized a demonstration to protest the chalkings and to advocate for progressive ideals popular with millennials such as free public colleges. advertisement, In response to the chalkings, several hundred students, faculty, and community members marched from UCSB’s Davidson Library to People’s Park is Isla Vista. The demonstrators demanded free tuition at public universities, university divestment from prisons, and a $15 minimum wage for all university jobs. The rally took place on the heels of a university-wide email from Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn that claimed the “intolerance contained in” the chalkings were “inconsistent with [the university’s] core values…and commitment to maintaining an inclusive and safe learning environment for every member of the UCSB community.”, A group of pro-Trump students challenged the demonstrators and marched down the streets of Isla Vista with their own signs. When they tried to speak with the student demonstrators, they were shouted down. , One of the marchers told a Trump supporter that his “white supremacist and imperialist domination of the world is not appreciated on [UCSB’s] campus.” When pressed for an example of Trump’s racism, the student refused to respond. , One of the demonstrators suggested that the pro-Trump students were unfeeling and incapable of compassion. He encouraged his fellow demonstrators to “hug” the pro-Trump students because “they need to be shown how to do it, not told how to do it.”, , Although the event is several weeks away, UCSB students are already protesting Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos’ scheduled event at the University on May 26th.

      "Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s address to the United Nations General Assembly was focused on economic issues, with a surprisingly strong critique of globalism.[Sisi argued that “developing countries are not afforded a sufficient opportunity to achieve sustainable development they require a conducive international environment which provides them with a larger share of international trade, finance mechanisms, and transfer of technology, as well as influx of investments and debt settlement, in addition to the necessity of a conducive national environment for development.”, advertisement, “Egypt also stresses the importance of harnessing the global monetary system to establish a fair global economic system, one that provides equal opportunities for development and contributes to minimizing the gap between developed and developing countries,” Sisi added. He spoke at some length about Egypt’s support for the U.N. Convention on Climate Change, saying efforts to confront climate change “must take into consideration equity and the right to development, as well as adherence to the principles of international law, the importance of universal benefit, refraining from harm, enhancing cooperation, and the participation of different countries in the prospective projects, in accordance with the rules that regulate international financial institutions headed by the World Bank.”, Sisi segued into his assault on globalism, which is an interesting contrast, since climate-change treaties are nothing if not exercises in globalism:, The world has become a global village as a result of the positive impact of the communications technology revolution, as well as the freedom of capital flow and investments and global trade. However, we continue to see another side to globalization, one that has produced a number of social and economic challenges. Globalization has been linked to a rise in poverty, the expansion of the inequality gap, and the undermining of the social contract in a number of developing countries, and these factors combined have exerted pressure on the institutional cohesion of these countries. Perhaps these challenges and pressures constitute the biggest incentive for the international community to work diligently to provide state institutions in all countries with the best possible means to undertake the responsibilities and meet the needs and aspirations of their peoples. Sisi praised the success of the Egyptian people at “enforcing their will to achieve stability, to protect the state and its institutions, and even to safeguard the society from fragmentation and chaos,” celebrated its progress on human rights – including “paving the way for women to occupy 15% of seats in the House of Representatives and expanding the representation of youth within it” – and “implementing giant national projects” to improve the national infrastructure. He returned to the theme of Egyptian stability, in a passage that seems intended to get international critics to ease up on his government, which is often denounced as authoritarian:, While the Middle East continues to suffer from bloody conflicts, Egypt has managed to preserve its stability in the midst of a highly unstable region, thanks to the solidity of its institutions and its people’s awareness of their great cultural heritage. The international community must acknowledge and support this fact, to the benefit of the region and the world at large, so that Egypt may continue to act as an anchor of stability in the Middle East, sparing no efforts in carrying out its natural role by working with regional and international parties to restore security and stability in the region. Sisi talked about the “agonizing situation in Syria,” promoting Egypt’s willingness to take in half a million refugees from the conflict, “treating them as Egyptians in terms of providing healthcare, education, and housing.”, He called for an “immediate and comprehensive halt to all hostile acts across all of Syria,” and praised the ceasefire agreement between Russia and the United States as a positive step in that direction. Sisi expressed his support for a “political solution” that would end the bloodshed and chaos while preserving “the territorial integrity and security of Syria and its state institutions.”, He described the Arab-Israeli conflict as “the core of regional instability in the Middle East,” which he proposed to resolve by ending “the Israeli occupation through negotiations and progress in the peace process, in order to reach a final settlement and sustainable and just peace on the basis of the two-state solution.”, “We thus welcome current efforts based on a genuine desire to improve the situation in the Palestinian territories, as the Palestinian people continue to suffer in a state of affairs that must be rectified, with a focus on ending the occupation and reclaiming the rights of the Palestinian people via a peace agreement consistent with the resolutions of international legitimacy, one that guarantees the Palestinians’ right to their own state and achieves security for Israel within the context of normal relations in its region,” the Egyptian president said. He regretted the situation in Libya, which he said had “direct implications on Egyptian national security,” and expressed support for Libya’s National Unity Government. Sisi then called for lifting the arms embargo against Libya, declaring “there is no place for terrorism and militias in Libya the time has come to restore the institutions of the Libyan state.”, This would seem to be a declaration that the Libyan unity government is strong and reliable enough to be armed against the Islamic State invaders and the warlord gangs ruling much of the country. Western powers have been reluctant to drop weapons into Libya for fear that the government would lose control of them. Sisi called for the restoration of the legitimate government of Yemen, by way of U.N.-brokered peace negotiations, and said Egypt would continue providing humanitarian assistance to Yemenis caught in the conflict. He went on to reject “foreign interference in Arab affairs,” denounced “attempts to foment sectarian strife in the Arab world,” and called for pan-Arab unity. He spoke at length about Egypt’s involvement in Africa, mentioning unrest in Somalia and the crisis in South Sudan. Sisi devoted the final passages of his speech to “the phenomenon of terrorism, and the hostility towards the right to life it represents,” which he said have “become an urgent threat to international peace and security.”, Terrorism constitutes a threat to the entity of the state, in favor of an extremist ideology that utilizes religion as a veil from behind which to conduct monstrous acts and menace the destinies of peoples. This necessitates intensive regional and international cooperation. Egypt has always been keen to stress that the endeavor to defeat terrorism will never achieve its ends unless we address the roots of the phenomenon, confront terrorist groups with decisiveness, and refute the extremist ideologies that give birth to terrorism and its proponents. Egypt calls upon the international community to take all possible measures to prevent terrorism from exploiting advances in information technology, which have contributed to endowing the phenomena of terrorism and ideological extremism with dangerous new dimensions that have grained them global reach. It is essential to end the broadcasting of channels and the hosting of websites that incite violence and extremism, He went on to urge the United Nations and its Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) to “give greater attention to addressing the cultural aspects of development and peacemaking, and the elimination of destructive ideologies, including via access to knowledge, transfer of technology, and confronting extremist ideologies.”, “It is mankind’s obligation to reclaim the essence of our humanity, sharing knowledge and technology without monopoly, and uniting in the face of challenges,” Sisi declared. \n",

      "The Task Force on Diversity at all women’s university Barnard College has released draft recommendations for the school that include hiring a Chief Diversity Officer and social justice workshops.[In a draft proposal on “three action areas that we believe have the potential to transform the College into a more representative, inclusive and equitable campus,” the group’s first recommendation is for the school to “create a position for a Chief Diversity Officer (CDO) with a campus-wide and community-focused mandate.”, advertisement, An experienced CDO will prioritize and focus on diversity and inclusion initiatives and institutional continuity over time re-conceptualize diversity and inclusion as a strength/priority institute a leadership and accountability structure for Barnard’s diversity mission and provide necessary expertise in managing change relative to diversity and inclusion. The CDO will lead a collaborative team comprised of staff and faculty who are already working on diversity and inclusion across the campus, along with others whose work is relevant to this aspect of the College’s mission. A newly established Diversity Council that represents all campus constituencies will serve in an advisory capacity. Creating this role signals importance of diversity and inclusion to the entire Barnard community, including students, alumnae, faculty, administrators, and staff. The plan also calls for the university to hire ten professors from underrepresented groups by 2022. Barnard administrators claim that “diverse student bodies and diverse faculties” lead to “better learning outcomes and campus climate, [and] enhanced support for underrepresented students and faculty.”, In addition to the hiring initiative, the task force wants Barnard to hold required workshops on “inclusion and equity” for students. Organizers claim that these will “create a shared understanding of the distinctive challenges facing … historically underrepresented groups.”, “Such initiatives create a true community-wide conversation about the value of diversity and will promote a sense of community and cohesion among all members of Barnard community,” it claims.\n",
      "In my last column I promised I’d name the guilty names: all those morally bankrupt, intellectually tainted, mendacious, ignorant useful idiot shills who for the last several years have assumed the mantle of scientific expertise and loftily declared that the “Pause” in global warming wasn’t a thing, only a fantasy cooked up by evil deniers.[You may say that I’m using a sledgehammer to crack a nest of cockroaches that rather than crow in victory one should be magnanimous in order to prove oneself a better man than they are, Gunga Din. advertisement, I disagree. I want blood. Entrails too, please. Those of us who have spent years of our lives being mocked and traduced and demeaned by these verminous charlatans deserve our pound of flesh, not only for the sake of sweet vengeance, but also for the greater cause of scientific honesty and journalistic integrity. This is no more than I would expect were the positions ever reversed. Suppose, for example, that I had written in the Spectator an article on global warming and it subsequently emerged that it was scientifically illiterate, that I’d dragged the name of a good journalist (who had got his facts right) through the mud, and that I’d brought the title into disrepute by adopting a tone of lofty, scornful, apparent expertise entirely unjustified by reality: well here’s what I’d expect to have to do…. Apologise. First to the journalist I’d unfairly, perhaps libellously, maligned next to the magazine’s editor for having been such a dogmatically wrongheaded prick finally to the readers for having abused their faith in my due diligence and my supposedly superior knowledge. Indeed, I think if I’d ever got an article as comprehensively wrong as the one I’m about to mention, I’d feel so shit I think I might seriously consider never broaching the topic again. So now, without further ado, let me introduce MARK LYNAS – activist, prominent environmental campaigner, and author of a very angry, high-handed 2008 article in the New Statesman (the left’s answer to the Spectator) called Has Global Warming Really Stopped?. This was in response to a piece by David Whitehouse which – quite controversially for the time – tentatively noted that the temperature record showed that there had been no “global warming” for several years and that this fact might, at some stage, become a significant issue. Lynas was having none of it. His response brimmed with righteous indignation. Here’s a flavour of the tone:, First let’s ask whether Whitehouse is wholly or partially correct in his analysis. To quote:, “The fact is that the global temperature of 2007 is statistically the same as 2006 as well as every year since 2001. Global warming has, temporarily or permanently, ceased. Temperatures across the world are not increasing as they should according to the fundamental theory behind global warming – the greenhouse effect. Something else is happening and it is vital that we find out what or else we may spend hundreds of billions of pounds needlessly.”, I’ll be blunt. Whitehouse got it wrong – completely wrong. Lynas goes on to rehearse his involved and tedious cod-scientific explanation as to how David Whitehouse (formerly of the BBC, now science editor of the Global Warming Policy Foundation) apparently got it wrong. Except, of course, as I reported yesterday David Whitehouse did not in fact get it wrong. Lynas did. So we really needn’t waste any valuable time reminding ourselves of the threadbare and rambling rationale Lynas (or rather, it seems from his piece, his friends at RealClimate) produced to try to poo poo the existence of the Pause. All that matters, we now know with hindsight, is: Skeptic Whitehouse 1 Environmentalist Lynas 0. Now we all make mistakes. Today’s magazine article is tomorrow’s bogpaper. But for me what makes it much, much harder to indulge or forgive Lynas his error is the arrogance, the rudeness and the hectoring self righteousness of his delivery. Yes all right, I know: when I write about global warming and environmentalism generally, I too can be pretty unforgiving, contemptuous and free with the insults. But I do this in full of knowledge of the consequences, both good and bad. On the plus side, if I am right, then I deserve more kudos than those on my side who have taken a more cautious line. I’m like the berserk warrior hero who has leapt over the shield wall to confront the enemy mano a mano – I have chosen the path of death or glory. If I win, then my name shall resound through all eternity in the halls of Valhalla. On the bad side, of course, it means that having committed myself so thoroughly and uncompromisingly to a particular position, then I run the risk of being slaughtered horribly should it emerge that I am in the wrong. If I accept this then so should the berserk warriors on the other side of the climate argument – the green James Delingpoles. I absolutely refuse to allow them the luxury of being able to shrug their shoulders and go: “Oh all right. Maybe we called it slightly wrong a few years back. But we still deserve to live to fight another day because everyone’s entitled to their opinion.”, No. That is not the deal and it should not be the deal. Those who announce to their adversaries that they intend to offer no quarter should expect no quarter in return when they lose the battle. Let me quote some more of that article by Mark Lynas to show why he deserves no mercy:, However, readers of my column will know that I give contrarians, or sceptics, or deniers (call them what you will) short shrift, and as a close follower of the scientific debate on this subject I can state without doubt that there is no dispute whatsoever within the expert community as to the reality or causes of manmade global warming. But even then, just because all the experts agree doesn’t make them right – it just makes them extremely unlikely to be wrong. That in turn means that if someone begs to disagree, they need to have some very strong grounds for doing so – not misreading a basic graph or advancing silly conspiracy theories about IPCC scientists receiving paycheques from the New World Order, as some of Whitehouse’s respondents do. So, a mistaken article reached a flawed conclusion. Intentionally or not, readers were misled, and the good name of the New Statesman has been used all over the internet by climate contrarians seeking to support their entrenched positions. This is regrettable. Good journalism should never exclude legitimate voices from a debate of public interest, but it also needs to distinguish between carefully-checked fact and distorted misrepresentations in complex and divisive areas like this. The magazine’s editorial policy is unchanged: we want to see aggressive action to reduce carbon emissions, and support global calls for planetary temperatures to be stabilised at under two degrees above pre-industrial levels. What sticks in the craw most here, I think, is the egregious hypocrisy. Here is Mark Lynas pompously invoking the highest principles of what he calls “good journalism” and adopting a fake air of neutrality and reasonableness – “this is regrettable” – not in order to practise a single one of the noble virtues he preaches but rather as a squalid, shoddy  exercise in shitting over the opposition. “Readers were misled”. Yes, indeed, they were Lynas. And guess which pernicious little tic of a git of a faux expert was doing the misleading here…, “We want to see aggressive action to reduce carbon emissions”. How dare you preach about “good journalism” and then go onto write a sentence which has nothing whatsoever to do with journalism, but is nothing more than political activism given the fig-leaf of objectivity by its presence in a bylined article in a half-way-respected political journal. This is purely a left-wing game, by the way. There is no right-wing publication I can think of which would dream of publishing such pure political propaganda in the guise of authoritative journalism. Yet organs like the New Statesman and the Guardian – especially in their environmental coverage – do this all the time. Not only that but they then “project” this particular sin onto their blameless opponents. (See David Whitehouse, above). I’ve lost count of the number of times people like me have been accused by Guardian and New Statesman writers of propagandising on behalf of Big Oil, of writing unscientific bullshit, of getting our facts embarrassingly wrong. They’re very good at the “tell” part, these lefty polemicists. What they’re much weaker at, in my experience, is the “show” part. Rarely if ever do their claims stand up for the very simple reason that those of us on the right side of the political argument don’t need to make stuff up: the truth is our friend so we cleave it with a passion. One of my favourite tropes when I talk about climate alarmists is “study bottle of whisky service pistol.” I’m not of course seriously advocating that they all commit suicide out of shame (though of course that’s what they’d love to believe I’m saying, climate alarmists being suckers for using false victimhood as a weapon against their opponents) but I swear to God that it’s what I personally would feel like doing if I were finally revealed by events to have been as ignorant, corrupt, and morally bankrupt as they have been. Yes, you could argue in the scheme of things that when set against the suppurating bubo of really appalling characters like Al Gore or Michael Mann or Tom Steyer, Mark Lynas is just an irksome little flea bite, that no one reads the New Statesman, that his views carry no weight outside the tiny bubble of green left-wingery…, But this, I think, would be to underestimate the influence of his cheesy propaganda stunts and his dodgy journalism and the way, at places like the BBC, he has been given licence to pose as some kind of environmental expert to whose views we should pay attention. Lynas, let’s not forget, once assaulted the blameless Bjørn “Skeptical Environmentalist” Lomborg with a custard pie. (Lomborg’s crime? Why, to write a book full of facts and figures demonstrating that the green doomsday narrative is simply not borne out by empirical data), Lynas also exploited his reputation as an environmental crusader to land a cushy gig working for the Maldives government of discredited president Mohamed Nasheed. He was responsible for that publicity stunt whereby the Maldives cabinet posed underwater in diving masks – in order to highlight the non-existent threat that the Maldives will soon be disappearing beneath the oceans as a result of man-made global warming. If this threat were real then you might reasonably say: “Fair play. Nice PR job. Well done for getting all those free holidays in the sunny Maldives where the snorkelling is great, one gathers.” But the threat is illusory. It is unsupported by scientific evidence. So what Lynas has been doing here is the very thing that he and his fellow activists so often accuse people like me of doing: misrepresenting the facts for ideology or for money. The dishonesty is bad enough, but worse are the consequences: those underwater cabinet photos went round the world. They sowed in the minds of the impressionable the idea that sea levels are rising at a dangerous, unprecedented rate (not true) and that therefore concerted international efforts must be made to deal with the global warming problem. In the interests of full disclosure, I should note that Lynas once wrote a dismissive review of my book Watermelons – which he admitted he hadn’t fully read. The review, I should point out, did the very thing I accused greenie-lefty writers above of doing – the “tell not show” thing. Here’s a sample sentence: “Data is dispensable for Delingpole – that’s for the hated elite with their clipboards, computer models and lab coats.” Yep, that’ll be why nearly 30 pages of the book comprise very densely packed notes referencing every single one of its scientific claims. Why did I go to all that trouble (and let me tell you, these things really are an effort)? Why, precisely because I did not want to give my opponents the pleasure of being able to fault me on my facts. But hey guess what: Lynas was so buoyed up by his belief in the sublime justice of his cause that he told himself he didn’t need to treat his opponents with any kind of fair consideration. Deniers: they’re basically just scum, aren’t they?, Well, I hope I’ve left readers of this polemic in no doubt as who the real scumbag is here. And I say so in the spirit of mild contempt rather than strong hatred. Yes there are people in the alarmist camp that I do hate with a vengeance but Lynas isn’t one of them: way too minor league. I’ve simply decided to pick on him first because the Pause story is quite topical right now and because it just so happens that of all the articles anyone wrote on the subject that one that Lynas did for the New Statesman happens to be the most noxious and embarrassing. Trust me, though, there’s plenty more loathing and exposure where this came from. Maybe having just had a near-death (-ish) experience has concentrated my mind. Maybe it’s because I can see the global warming narrative is really starting to fall apart now and I’ve recognised that this is the time when you signal to the cavalry hidden on the reverse of the slope to sweep down onto the enemy’s flank and cut them to pieces. This just the beginning. It’s going to be like Kill Bill. It’s going to be fun. These bastards deserve a skewering and I’m sharpening my samurai blade.\n",
      "MOST POPULAR[Jerusalem (AFP) – Israeli ministers have approved measures aimed at improving the Palestinian economy and facilitating crossings, rare moves said to be at Donald Trump’s request hours ahead of the US president’s arrival. advertisement, An Israeli official told AFP on condition of anonymity that ministers were responding to a Trump request to present him with “confidence-building measures” ahead of his talks with Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas on Tuesday. In a statement, Trump’s administration welcomed the moves, saying he “has been encouraging both sides to take steps that improve the environment for peace making.”, “He has expressed particular interest in taking steps to improve the Palestinian economy in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.”, In what the Israeli official described as a “gesture for Trump’s visit, which does not harm Israel’s interests”, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s security cabinet on Sunday approved the enlargement of a Palestinian industrial zone on the edge of the southern West Bank. He said that the possibility of extending Israel Railways services to the northern West Bank city of Jenin would also be examined. They also gave the nod to streamlining transit procedures at Shaar Ephraim, a busy crossing point in the northern part of the occupied West Bank for Palestinian labourers with permits to work in Israel. The official said that opening hours for passage across the main Jordan River bridge linking the Palestinian territory and the neighbouring kingdom were to be extended to 24/7. There would also be reforms to Palestinian land use in urban areas in the 60 percent of the West Bank under full Israeli control. He did not elaborate but Israel’s Haaretz daily said the intention was to allow construction of “thousands of Palestinian homes” in the area where for years it has been almost impossible for Palestinians to get Israeli permits to build on their own land. Haaretz said that at Sunday night’s meeting Education Minister Naftali Bennett and justice minister Ayelet Shaked, of the religious-nationalist Jewish Home party, “objected vehemently” to the building plans. In an apparent attempt to calm opposition from within Netanyahu’s coalition government, seen as the most right-wing in the country’s history, the security cabinet also approved setting up a committee to work for retroactive legalisation of wildcat Israeli construction in the West Bank, the official said.\n",
      "TEL AVIV – Temperatures in Israel reached a scorching 47ºC (116.6 ºF) over the weekend, resulting in over 450 people being treated by paramedics and brush fires sweeping the country.[The extreme and unusual weather generated a dramatic increase in the number of calls to Israel’s emergency services MDA. MDA has been handing out stickers to remind drivers not to leave children (or pets) in locked vehicles even for a moment. advertisement, Fire and rescue services were called out to eliminate two large brush fires in forested areas and several smaller ones elsewhere in the country. The heatwave, known locally as sharav in Hebrew or hamtzin in Arabic, drew strong winds from the north all the way along the coast later. Forecasters said that by Tuesday the heat is predicted to break, and a further drop is expected on Wednesday. The blistering temperatures could set new records for the month of May. The record for May in Eilat was recorded on May 31, 1980, at 45.2ºC (113.36ºF) – a number that has already been surpassed. Meteorologist Dr. Baruch Ziv explained that the current heat wave is considered a “subsidence heat wave. It’s caused by the sinking of higher air levels, which is a slow process when the area has a high pressure system, which is semi-immobile. It takes time, and it cooks, quite literally, for a few days. Actually, on Independence Day, we were in its initial stages, but in most parts of the country, it wasn’t felt. And since then, it’s only gotten hotter. “The temperatures in Israel’s hot season rose by two degrees over 40 years. Our climate is already changing, and it’s going to change further. Coping with it is done by air conditioning, and as a result, there’s a rise in electricity demand, and the implication is that the Earth gets warmer,” he added. The electricity demand in Israel reached its peak on Sunday at 3:26pm with 11,349 MW used, Ynet news reported. The previous peak demand for the month of May was last year at 11,332 MW. The Israel Electric Corporation has postponed disconnecting customers who have not paid their electricity bills until the end of the current heat wave.\n",

Other reports say Ebell wants the staffing level to be on par with that 45 years ago when the EPA was started during the administration of former Republican President Richard Nixon. That would mean as few as 5,000 employees would remain. “President Trump said during the campaign that he would like to abolish the EPA, or ‘leave a little bit,'” Ebell said. “I think the administration is likely to start proposing cuts to the 15,000 staff, because the fact is that a huge amount of the work of the EPA is actually done by state agencies. It’s not clear why so many employees are needed at the federal level.”, Trump has nominated Scott Pruitt, Oklahoma’s attorney general to serve as his EPA Director.

EPA Spokeswoman Enersta Jones told Axios that the agency has frequent training seminars and that “This is just one of the more recent ones that were offered.”\n",
      "Students4Justice, a student activist group at the University of Michigan, is demanding campus officials provide them with “a permanent designated space on central campus for Black students and students of color to organize and do social justice work.”[The student activists are disappointed with school administrators and launched a petition aimed at University President Mark Schlissel. They claim he has shown “lackluster leadership” in “protecting the safety” of non-white students on campus. advertisement, The activist group spent the last month marching on campus, holding sit-ins, and even protested outside of Schlissel’s home “in the middle of the night.”, “Our president has blatantly ignored us and it is time for us to speak up. We have been told that our demands are ‘rude,’” states a Facebook post. “We are calling on someone to care about students’ concerns and to lead us with integrity and help us fight against the oppression and hateful acts that try to destroy us and our community.”, , The Michigan Review — an independent student news outlet that first reported Student4Justice’s list of demands — reports the group’s insistence on a segregated space for students of color to launch social justice projects is raising eyebrows, given that the university has already begun construction on a $10 million center for non-white students in the center of campus. “The same organization that criticizes the University for failing to create ‘an environment that engages in diversity, equity and inclusion,’ is calling upon the University to undermine these ideals by facilitating a sort of de facto segregation? One where space and resources are designated for students based solely on the color of their skin?” the Michigan Review reported. “To advocate for the ideals of diversity, equity and inclusion, while simultaneously calling upon the University to sanction these spaces on campus is both unprincipled and laughably regressive.”, Students4Justice’s list of demands, the College Fix reports, insists that school administrators offer  “‘marginalized” students ‘when oppressive attacks occur,’ increasing the affirmative action of ‘Black, Arab, and other PoC’ in tenured faculty, more readily alerting students on campus of ‘bias incidents,’ and offering more financial aid for those of lower socioeconomic status.”, “Our president has blatantly ignored us and it is time for us to speak up.

      "Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins said the Eagles plan some kind of anthem protest on Monday Night Football.[“Everyone wants to be a part of it, and I feel like it’s no different on our team,” Jenkins told WIP Radio. advertisement, It’s unclear what polling service Jenkins used to discern that “everyone wants to be a part of it.”, This is perhaps an embellishment. It would stand to reason there are players around the league who disagree with teammates kneeling during the anthem. Jenkins was asked if he’s concerned with dividing his team over his social activism. “It’s important, but you obviously walk a fine line,” Jenkins said. “Your goal is not to divide people but the goal is also not to beat around the bush. If it comes down to making somebody feel uncomfortable by speaking the truth, then I’d always make you uncomfortable with the truth than make you feel comfortable with a lie. It’s always a fine line to walk when you’re talking about a team atmosphere and making sure that your cognizant of the guys next to you, but at the same time, you know, this is bigger than football.”, While in Chicago, perhaps Jenkins will also protest the city’s 2016 homicide rate, which is currently on a record pace. Over 500 people, many black, have been killed this year in Chicagoland. “Still to be determined,” Jenkins said Saturday when asked what exactly the Eagles will do during the anthem. “Still want to have a couple conversations with my teammates, and it’ll be a decision I weigh over the next couple days.”, Jenkins is totally supportive of San Francisco 49ers reserve quarterback Colin Kaepernick who started this movement. “I support everything Kap’s doing and his whole entire message,” Jenkins said. So that means Jenkins supports comments like this:, “You can become a cop in six months and don’t have to have the same amount of training as a cosmetologist,” Kaepernick said recently. “That’s insane. Someone that’s holding a curling iron has more education and more training than people that have a gun.”, As for the game…, Philadelphia Eagles (1-0) at Chicago Bears (0-1), There is a good chance the Bears get their first win of the year. Eagles QB Carson Wentz makes his second NFL start, and remember, he beat the rebuilding Cleveland Browns at home in his first game. Now he’s on the road at Soldier Field. History tells us that rookie quarterbacks tend to struggle mightily on the road. And some of Wentz’s teammates might be distracted. They seems to be spending a lot of time planning their protest.\n",
      "“Lies” were responsible for the electoral success of Donald Trump and Brexit, and the role of teachers is to push students towards “progressive rebellion”, according to a piece in this week’s TES.[Writing in the weekly magazine for educators, which was formerly known as the Times Educational Supplement, Oliver Beach called victories for populism at the ballot box last year “frightening” and said teachers must counter the “post-truth” climate from which he claims they resulted. advertisement, Beach, who appeared on the BBC show ‘Tough Young Teachers’ before quitting the profession, cites “post-truth politics” as “the most frightening development” of the last year. Asserting that the decisions of “naive voters” to opt for Trump and Brexit were “based on lies”, citing the property tycoon’s campaign promise to build a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico, Beach said educators must prepare students to ‘empower and encourage’ young people to “challenge and question” right-wing politics. The former reality TV star said he fears teachers have become “complacent” in believing progressive politics will continue sweeping the West, and warned of “pitchfork”-wielding right wingers who support a “narrative of pro-guns, anti-gays, limiting women’s reproductive rights and building physical national borders”. Educators should be prepared to combat a “reactionary counter-revolution”, Beach cautioned, stating that (unspecified) rhetoric from the president-elect had the power to “divide, terrorise, outrage and exclude”. If unchallenged, he warned that populist victories at the ballot box would give “new momentum to those with similar views here and across Western democracies”. “The next world leader is sitting in a classroom today”, he noted, and asserted that teachers’ role of “curating minds” at this time in history “could not be more important”. The world “[doesn’t] need more Donald Trumps, Nigel Farages or Marine Le Pens”, the former educator wrote. Instead, he concludes, teachers should prime children to become “Martin Luther Kings, Harvey Milks and Rosa Parks”. Though Beach claims Trump’s pledge to erect a wall is an example of “post-truth politics”, one-third of the world’s countries have built or are now in the process of building fences on their borders, as physical barriers become an increasingly popular way of excluding illegal migrants.\n",
      "MOST POPULAR[On Thursday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” DNC Senior Adviser and head of the Democrats’ Trump War Room Zac Petkanas reacted to President Trump revoking President Obama’s guidelines on transgendered students by stating, “Donald Trump is not only a monster, but he’s a coward. We’re talking about somebody who is so emasculated by Vladimir Putin…that he has to come back and pick on vulnerable kids.”, advertisement, Petkanas said, “This is guidance that was provided to schools that schools wanted and asked for, and it is very — it’s for a very specific reason, they wanted to create a safe environment for all the kids in their school, and they wanted to avoid Title IX lawsuits. I mean, that’s what’s so mind-boggling about what the Trump administration did today. He took away practical guidance to school administrators and principals, who were looking to create this safe environment, and were looking to not get sued for Title IX violations.”, He added, “Donald Trump is not only a monster, but he’s a coward. We’re talking about somebody who is so emasculated by Vladimir Putin, that he has to come back — no no — that he has to come back and pick on vulnerable kids.”, The discussion then turned to the issue of transgenderism writ large. Petkanas stated that “One’s gender identity is enough to show what gender they are.”, Petkanas was asked what would prevent host Tucker Carlson from playing on a women’s sports team, serving a prison sentence in a women’s prison. He responded that there aren’t any examples of anyone doing this. After Petkanas said later in the interview that “Your gender identity determines your gender, period.” Carlson asked if this would mean he could go to a women’s college or qualify for an SBA loan for women-owned small businesses if he identified as a woman. Petkanas answered in the affirmative, and re-iterated that gender identity determines gender. When asked if you could identify as another race, Petkanas answered that you can’t, and dismissed this as a “silly” hypothetical. Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett\n",
      "While Americans are scrambling to meet the 2016 tax filing deadline, the number of illegal immigrants submitting their returns in the present climate are reportedly down significantly. Also, a Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) report exposing significant refund fraud has “most certainly contributed to it,” says the taxpayer advocate department within the IRS.[The Internal Revenue Service stated that millions of people who do not have Social Security numbers (SSN), most of these illegal aliens, filed federal tax returns last year, reported NPR the day before the tax deadline. Many of those who are ineligible for SSN use “ITIN,” or Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers when filing. advertisement, The Taxpayer Advocate Service, an independent organization within the IRS, reports that “Without ITINs, approximately 4.6 million taxpayers would not be able to comply with their annual tax filing and payment obligations, or receive tax benefits to which they are legally entitled.”, The advocate service states that ITIN applications and “associated return filings” “have dropped precipitously, down 58 percent between 2011 and 2014.” They write that the “general economic climate and immigration trends” explain part of this drop, but the “IRS ITIN procedures have most certainly contributed to it.”, After the TIGTA report “alleging significant refund fraud connected to ITINS,” in 2012 the IRS made what its independent advocacy service calls “sweeping changes that require applicants to submit original identification documents (subject to a few alternatives).”, The IRS has also continued its policy of requiring applicants to apply for an ITIN with a paper tax return. The new requirements led to delays for the ITIN applicants and associated large backlogs, the Taxpayer Advocate Services says. The independent arm charges that “While concerns about refund fraud are legitimate, the IRS’s solutions do not effectively target the fraud nor do they balance the anti-fraud regime with the taxpayer’s need for a process no more intrusive than necessary, part of a taxpayer’s right to privacy.”, Moreover, NPR reported that tax preparers in the sanctuary city San Francisco area told them there is approximately a 20 percent decline in the number of people filing with ITIN numbers. A tax law professor at the University of Nevada said that tax preparers in other parts of the United States are making similar claims. “Sending in a tax return with your current address and information is very unnerving to a population that wants to comply with the law and is actually leaving significant refunds on the table by not filing tax returns,” educator Francine Lipman said. The IRS is barred from giving information it has obtained to other United States agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security. They may share information only under “limited circumstances” NPR reported. The professor says that those bearing ITIN numbers must decide “whether to trust that firewall.”, “Many of our clients are telling us that in years past they felt more hope and more of ability to have a pathway toward citizenship and lately there’s a lot less hope,” Max Moy-Borgen, the head of a tax program at the Mission Economic Development Agency told NPR.

      "Did you hear the speech that Al Gore gave in Texas the other day saying that the oil industry should take climate change more seriously, that oil could peak in the next decade, that the “social acceptance” for oil was disappearing, that there needed to be a meaningful tax on carbon emissions and that he “strongly supported” the Paris climate agreement?[Oh no, wait. It wasn’t Al Gore. My bad. It was actually Ben van Beurden, chief executive of Shell speaking at an oil industry gathering at the U.S. oil capital of Houston. advertisement, Now do you see why I so hate Big Oil?, Well, partly it’s bitterness. For many years now, I – and many sceptics like me – have been accused by climate alarmists of being “in the pay of Big Oil”. But even though we deserve it for promoting fossil fuels so enthusiastically and fighting their critics so heroically, few of us have ever received even a penny for our troubles. That’s because Big Oil is far too busy trying to greenwash its image – as Shell itself did by sponsoring the Guardian’s environment pages for many years – to waste time on the plucky, outspoken heroes who do a better job for Big Oil’s PR than the Big Oil’s paid PR departments do. Mainly, though it’s disgust. Big Oil has this public image of being an industry for fearless, no-nonsense manly men who aren’t afraid of getting their hands dirty or braving the environmentalists’ wrath in order to do their ugly but important work supplying the world with much-needed energy. Yet it’s an image almost entirely undeserved. Almost everyone at a senior level in Big Oil is a craven, simpering, politically correct, spineless, surrender-monkey corporate shill. They’re cowards who are scared of free markets, won’t speak up for capitalism, won’t even defend their core business. Typical of this attitude was the current Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. One of his first moves on becoming CEO of Exxon in 2006 was to announce it would stop funding organisations like the Competitive Enterprise Institute “whose position on climate change could divert attention from the important discussion on how the world will secure the energy required for economic growth in an environmentally responsible manner.” Unlike his punchier predecessor Lee Raymond, Tillerson clearly decided that discretion being the better part of valor, he would throw his industry’s supporters to the wolves. One of the first big energy stories I covered for Breitbart was the incredible true story of how Chevron Oil fought off a $9.5 billion damages case filed on behalf of Ecuadorean natives whose lands had supposedly been polluted as a result of Chevron’s negligence. The truly incredible part of the story was that Chevron decided to defend the case. The more usual position of Big Oil is to surrender as soon as possible and settle out of court. If Big Oil won’t speak out for the oil industry, who will?, Sadly, the burden invariably falls to that small group of maverick believers in free markets and honest science who don’t care about all the brickbats they get for being defenders of “dirty fuel” because they’d rather speak the truth than be popular. Among them is Steve Milloy who, May 2008, intervened in an Exxon shareholder meeting on behalf of all those shareholders who think that Exxon’s core business should be drilling oil and creating value for shareholders – not getting distracted by trying to make themselves look cuter for their Watermelon (green on the outside, red on the inside) critics. Follow this link and you can hear the huge round applause Milloy won from shareholders when he proposed that Exxon should amend its bye-laws so that it no longer had to waste time on politicised interventions from “nuisance shareholders”. Stock ownership has become politicized. Many shareholders own stock in publicly-owned corporations for the sole purpose of advancing the shareholders’ own social or political agendas, while simultaneously assailing the corporations’ legitimate business operations. These activist shareholders are “nuisance shareholders.”, A primary tool of nuisance shareholders is the submission of non-binding precatory (advisory) proposals for discussion and vote at annual meetings of shareholders. Proposals from nuisance shareholders can coerce management into making decisions not in the best interests of the Company and its bona fide shareholders, and turn the annual meeting into a media-activist circus. You’d think Exxon would have been grateful for this fire support from their public. Not one bit. We can see this from Exxon’s response to a submission from Milloy that he intends to make a similar proposal at Exxon’s next shareholder meeting this May. They applied to the SEC to try to get Milloy’s proposal excluded. Happily, the SEC’s lawyer wasn’t having it. , It goes without saying that Exxon, like Shell, like most Big Oil companies, like Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is now using its influence to try to prevent President Trump to fulfil his campaign trail promise to withdraw the U.S. from the UN Paris Climate Agreement. Ostensibly their excuse is that it would be bad for US international relations and “send the wrong signals”. In reality, it’s for the worst of reasons. First, it’s because spinelessness is an integral part of their corporate culture: they’ve spent years surrendering to the green movement by paying it Danegeld and by paying lip service to its eco pieties – and they’re not about to grow a pair just because Donald Trump is president. Second, it’s because they’re so heavily diversified into eco-friendly sectors like “renewables” and into unproven but lucrative technologies like Carbon Capture and Storage that they can’t afford the massive hit they’d suffer if Trump were to sever all ties with the Climate Industrial Complex. Big Oil is evil all right but not in the way the Greenies would have you think. It’s because, heeding the voices of the industry’s Wormtongues, Big Oil surrendered to the dark forces of Eco Mordor. It makes you hope that the smaller scale producers of the global fracking industry go from strength to strength – and make the politically correct Big Oil monoliths history.\n",
      "Some rare good news from the eco wars: it looks increasingly likely that a lunatic green project to build a £1 billion tidal lagoon across Swansea Bay in South Wales is going to be scrapped.[Or so reckons Christopher Booker who has been on its case from the start. advertisement, If it still goes ahead, the Swansea Tidal Lagoon (pictured) will produce the world’s most expensive electricity – at a massively taxpayer-subsidised £168 per megawatt hour: over three times the going rate – while changing forever the character of the bay and causing all manner of disruption to the local wildlife. But hey, as the saying goes, “You can’t make a green omelette without killing lots of eels, fish and wading birds, ruining the view, and enriching a small cabal of crony capitalists at everyone else’s expense.”, Apart from its eye-watering cost and utter pointlessness (for the same price you could build a gas-fired power station producing 35 times as much as electricity, at a third of the cost, with no subsidy), quite the most disturbing aspect of this project is the unseemly haste with which the government has attempted to steamroll it through the system. Prime Minister David Cameron – who, like his role-model Tony Blair, loves an “eye-catching initiative” – was initially very enthusiastic. So much so that he had it written into the Conservatives’ election manifesto and then rushed through the planning system. And why not? As every idiot who knows nothing whatsoever about renewable energy knows, tidal power is totally great because the sea is all wavey and powerful with, like, loads of untapped energy which could be harnessed for free, probably…, Meanwhile in the real world, thank God, there remain one or two hard-headed people who can tell when the Emperor is wearing no clothes. One of them, as Booker reports, is Mr Justice Dove in the High Court who ruled over Christmas that a key element in the plan – the re-opening of a quarry in Cornwall, from which 1.5 million tonnes of rock would be dug every year to build the Lagoon’s six-mile breakwater – had been given illegal consent by Cornwall council. There were several sites of natural interest in the quarry area but the council’s planner had not thought to conduct an environmental assessment for any of them. By strange coincidence it emerged that this same planning officer had been responsible for waving through two deeply unpopular and controversial wind farms with which, unfortunately, the poor county of Cornwall is now littered. Imagine, though, if the local campaign group Cornwall Against Dean Super Quarry had been less committed, or if they hadn’t been able to raise the considerable amount of money needed to fund a judicial review like the one that overturned that planning officer’s noisome — and likely ideologically green-motivated — illegal decision. What’s so terrifying about the environmental movement is that though its most zealous adherents are few in number they punch far above their weight because they’ve infiltrated all the most influential positions: in local council planning departments, on the planning inspectorate, at the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, at the European Union drafting ever more stringent and intrusive directives…, You’d expect a properly Conservative government to oppose this nonsense. But that would be to mistake David Cameron and his cronies — such as his Environment Secretary Amber Rudd — for proper conservatives.\n",
      "The Senate confirmed Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to be the next administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, 52-46, on the Friday before Congress leaves for a week-long Presidents Day recess.[“As I come here to the floor: I chaired the committee, the Environment and Public Works Committee, on Scott Pruitt’s nomination,” said Sen. John Barrasso (R.-Wyo.) in the minutes before the bipartisan vote that saw two Democrats joining the Republican majority, West Virginia’s Sen. Joseph Manchin and North Dakota’s Sen. Heidi Heitkamp. One Republican voted against the nomination, Maine’s Sen. Susan Collins. advertisement, “I listened to six and a half hours of testimony,” Barrasso said. “I listened and read through responses that he gave to 1,200 questions being asked of him. He gave thorough answers. Perhaps not the answer the Democrats wanted to hear but answers that I felt were responsive.”, Barrasso took the nomination out of his committee by invoking a special rule approved by the Senate parliamentarian office, because Democrats boycotted the committee’s vote on Pruitt, which robbed the committee of a quorum. The chairman said despite the opposition from Senate Democrats, Pruitt was an excellent choice to run the EPA. “He is a nominee who, as Attorney General in Oklahoma, protected the environment, worked to strengthen the economy, and stood up for state’s rights, which continues to be most crucial.”, Outsider businessman Sen. David Perdue (R.-Ga.) said 0n the Senate floor Pruitt is the key man for lifting the regulatory burden off the private enonomy. “Scott Pruitt will return some sanity to the EPA, which over the past eight years has overzealously issued thousands of regulations with little environmental benefit, all while ignoring the high economic cost,” he said. “I look forward to working with Mr. Pruitt and President Trump to scale back the EPA and provide farmers, businesses, and the American people with some relief after eight years of blatant overreach,” he said. Senate Democrats did not have the votes to defeat Pruitt’s nomination, but they exercised the option to use all 30 hours of debate allotted to each confirmation, as they have with most of the other nominees. To eat up the clock, Senate Republicans have extended the chamber’s sessions and scheduled votes in the early morning hours, if that was when the debate time was running out. When senators came to Capitol Hill Friday morning, they were armed with news that a judge ordered Pruitt to turn over thousands of emails as part of an Open Records Request by an Oklahoma television station. Minority Leader Sen. Charles Schumer (D.-N.Y.) held a press less than four hours before the vote, where he and other Senate Democrats demanded that the Pruitt confirmation vote be delayed until Feb. 27. Rhode Island Democrat Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said the delay was necessary to fully understand Pruitt’s relationship with the industry figures in his home state. “Time will tell and facts will come out, but I believe our Republican friends will rue the day that they had this nomination rammed through the Senate on the very day that the emails were being litigated in Oklahoma, in order to get ahead of any counter-pressure.”, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R.-Ky.) — at his own press conference after Schumer’s — dismissed any calls for delay as more of the same. \"My overarching goal will be to lead in a way that our future generations inherit a better and healthier environment.\" – Scott Pruitt, @EPA pic.twitter.com/WrqHYa0AWY, — Senate Republicans (@SenateGOP) February 17, 2017, , The Pruitt vote was scheduled for 1 p.m. but at 12:30 p.m. Sen. Al Franken (D.-Minn.) took to the floor to challenge the language used by Barrasso earlier in the day. Barrasso was making the point that Democratic tactics were not sincere. “These delays are all about obstruction,” the Wyoming senator said. “They’re all about denying President Trump his cabinet — that’s what this all about. It’s about pretending that their candidate, Hillary Clinton, didn’t lose the election in November.”, Franken said this characterization was a violation of Senate Rule XIX, which forbids senators from questioning the motives or impugning the character of another senator. This was the same rule Republicans used to call out and silence Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D.-Mass.) during the floor debate for Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ confirmation. Unlike Warren, Franken did not force a vote after the presiding officer denied his point of order. But Fraken did walk from his own desk in the back rows to the well of the chamber to hash it out with Barrasso and McConnell. Americans believe that a great country deserves safe drinking water, clean air, and a hospitable environment. That's where @EPA comes in. pic.twitter.com/RKRzmjYEUo, — Sen. Al Franken (@SenFranken) February 17, 2017, , Barrasso was clearly ticked off, and Franken gestured with his index finger at Barrasso, saying that it was not right to say that the Democrats were acting as if Clinton won the election. Before the exchange between the two senators got more serious, McConnell told Franken that he had lost his sense of humor. This brought Franken to a full-stop. Then, smiling broadly, he told McConnell: “Don’t tell me Mr. Majority Leader that I have lost my sense of humor. That is not impugning my motives–that is impugning my career!”, With the point of order resolved, Franken then made a motion requesting the debate on the Pruitt confirmation extend another 248 hours–through the recess. That vote went down on party lines, 47-51. Sen. John McCain (R.-Ariz.) and Sen. Joseph Donnelly (D.-Ind.) were not at the Capitol. When senators return Feb. 27, they are scheduled to vote on the nomination of businessman Wilbur Ross for Commerce Secretary.\n",
      "Rep. John Lewis (D-GA) is a civil rights hero. He is also one of the most partisan members of the Democratic Party, and frequently accuses his political opponents, falsely, of racism.[Lewis also uses his iconic stature to deflect criticism when he is called out for these false attacks, exploiting — and, arguably, demeaning — the civil rights movement. advertisement, Here are five of the worst recent examples of what has become, for Rep. Lewis, a shamefully routine practice. 2008: Falsely accused Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) and Gov. Sarah Palin of racism. Lewis attacked McCain and Palin, then running against Sen. Barack Obama (D-IL) for president: “Sen. McCain and Gov. Palin are sowing the seeds of hatred and division,” he said, going on to suggest that the Republican ticket were creating the climate for racist terrorism. “[Democrat] George Wallace never threw a bomb … but he created the climate and the conditions that encouraged vicious attacks against innocent Americans …  four little girls were killed on Sunday morning when a church was bombed in Birmingham, Alabama.” Years later, McCain still had not forgiven him: “I’ll never forgive John Lewis,” he told AL.com in 2013. 2010: Falsely claimed that Tea Party demonstrators said the “N-word” during anti-Obamacare rally. Lewis joined several other members of the Congressional Black Caucus in claiming that a crowd of thousands of Tea Party protesters on the steps of Capitol Hill had shouted the “N-word” at them when they walked through the crowd — apparently in the hope of provoking a reaction. “It surprised me that people are so mean and we can’t engage in a civil dialogue and debate,” Lewis claimed. But he never proved the accusation — and when Andrew Breitbart offered to donate $10,000, then $100,000, to the United Negro College Fund for any video evidence of the “N-word,” none surfaced — despite hundreds of cameras present. 2012: Falsely accused Republicans of wanting to take Americans back to Jim Crow. Lewis gave a speech at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina in which he recalled being beaten by white racists, along with fellow Freedom Riders, in 1961. He concluded by implying that Republicans wanted to bring back those days of blood and hatred: “Brothers and sisters, do you want to go back? Or do you want to keep America moving forward?”, 2016: Falsely compared Donald Trump to George Wallace. Reviving his theme from 2008, Lewis said that Trump reminded him of the governors of the Jim Crow South and the police who let dogs loose on demonstrators: “I’ve been around a while and Trump reminds me so much of a lot of the things that George Wallace said and did … Sometimes I feel like I am reliving part of my past. I heard it so much growing up in the South…I heard it so much during the days of the civil rights movement. As a people, I just think we could do much better,” he told the Los Angeles Times in an interview. 2017: Falsely claimed Trump is “illegitimate” because of a Russian “conspiracy.” Joining the tin foil hat brigade, Lewis claimed that Trump was a kind of “Manchurian Candidate” put in place by Russia: “I don’t see the president-elect as a legitimate president. … I think there was a conspiracy on the part of the Russians, and others, that helped him get elected.”, Update:, 2016: Falsely claimed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) played no role in the civil rights movement. Lewis, a supporter of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s bid for the presidency, tried to trash Sanders’s civil rights credentials. “I never saw him. I never met him,” Lewis said. Proof later emerged of Sanders’s arrest in civil rights protests in Chicago in the 1960s.  , Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

      "Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) delivered a virtual concession in a written statement following his speech on Tuesday evening after losing all but Rhode Island — the lone state with an open primary — to presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.[“I congratulate Secretary Clinton on her victories tonight, and I look forward to issue-oriented campaigns in the 14 contests to come,” Sanders wrote in a statement issued from his campaign’s temporary headquarters in Huntington, West Virginia where he is campaigning. advertisement, West Virginia will be holding its primaries on May 10, and Sanders on Tuesday night predicted a win there. His choice of words drew back to the “political revolution” he is waging against the Establishment, indicating that he is not running a political campaign, but that his goal is something far greater for the eyes, minds and hearts of those who have embraced his principles. “This campaign is not just about electing a president. It is about transforming our nation,” he said. “You are the revolutionaries because you understand that unlike football or basketball. Politics is not a spectator sport.”, Clinton won in Connecticut, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Delaware collectively, including Rhode Island, Tuesday’s vote was dubbed the “Acela Primary” because the five states that held primaries on that day coincide with the route of Amtrak’s speediest carrier. Despite having a greater number of delegates over Sanders, Clinton is far less popular of a candidate. Several polls also project Sanders beating Republican frontrunner Donald Trump by a greater margin than Clinton a point Sanders pointed out again during his Tuesday evening speech from the podium. “What is also extremely important, is [for the] Democratic Party to look at which candidate is the candidate to defeat Donald Trump or any other Republican.” He said “What we are seeing in national polls, [is that they] have us 15-20 points ahead of Donald Trump. Far more than Secretary Clinton.” Sanders also emphasized this point during an interview in California last month. The race is likely to come down to California for both the Republicans and the Democrats. Drawing back to the premise of his revolution, Sanders reiterated his belief in “one person, one vote” and that the more popular candidate should be the one to succeed to the presidential mantle. The people in every state in this country should have the right to determine who they want as president and what the agenda of the Democratic Party should be. That’s why we are in this race until the last vote is cast. That is why this campaign is going to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia with as many delegates as possible to fight for a progressive party platform that calls for a $15 an hour minimum wage, an end to our disastrous trade policies, a Medicare-for-all health care system, breaking up Wall Street financial institutions, ending fracking in our country, making public colleges and universities tuition free and passing a carbon tax so we can effectively address the planetary crisis of climate change.

      "MOST POPULAR[Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” conservative commentator Mary Matalin and liberal commentator Van Jones had a heated exchange over race in America in light of President-elect Donald Trump’s victory. advertisement, Partial transcript as follows:, MATALIN: Can I have an honest moment here people, Van has to my mind retracted your whitelash with what you just said, no, that we have to not focus on the toxic stuff — okay, but you — if you don’t, you’re wrong. You are not — that’s not the path for progressives. We’ve all agreed at the outset that the path which is Ellison’s message is to go back to the rust belt and the rednecks . You’re not going to get there with climate change and Putin. JONES: I said and stand by it. I said that race was a part and there was a part that alt-right part is part of the whitelash. If you listened to the whole quote you would agree with what I said So i dont take that back–, MATALIN: I did listen and you said what do I tell the kids. I’m a black man in America who went to Yale and written books who served a president and now —, JONES: I’m a ninth generation American and the first born in my family with all my rights. Ninth generation American, so we have not escaped because I went to Yale all the problems of this country. MATALIN: You should not be a racial polemicist you should be a racial reconciler. JONES:  You should be ashamed about yourself to say that about me to my face. MATALIN: Should I say it behind your back would be better?, JONES: I spent more time than you have trying to be a racial reconciler. MATALIN: Really? how do you know that? Do you know anything about me?, JONES: Apparently you don’t know anything about me. MATALIN: I do know your daddy, your grandparents were teachers. your grandfather was a bishop. JONES: This is a problem we have right now. It is in fact the case there was a populist revolt in this country, both Sanders and Trump. One was marbled through. if someone like myself married to a white woman who has spent my entire life building bridges can’t point out the alt-right whitelash reaction without accused of being a racial polemicist we have a big problem.

      "Gaining the worldwide rights to stream 10 NFL Thursday Night games is a positive for Twitter, but it does not address the erosion of its Monthly Average User (MAU) numbers, and competition from Facebook, YouTube and WeChat.[It has been six weeks since Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) negotiated a $1 million-per-game deal for the global rights to stream NFL games. Silicon Valley venture capital firms claim the deal with the most popular sport in America will demonstrate that social networks can take market share from cable TV in their highest-value category — live sports. advertisement, Twitter followed up on May 24 with an announcement that over the coming months, the company will allow posting videos, photos and other media not to count against the company’s rigid 140-character limit. But the new rules caused tech analysts at MoffettNathanson to downgrade “TWTR” stock to “sell,” sending the price to an all-time low of $13.72 per shapre. MN warns: “Twitter is suffering from user fatigue, and it also notes that advertiser fatigue is also present.”, Twitter’s cost for the NFL streaming rights is peanuts compared to the $450 million in fees and royalties paid by CBS/NBC for the annual pro football package. Twitter associating with the NFL has upside if it produces 1 million new users and serves as a conduit for Twitter to premier new features to a wider base. Sports organizations, like the NFL, are vigorously trying to ensure that all potential viewers can gain real-time access to their events, given that the Nielsen audience rating service found that 95% of total sports program viewing happens in real-time. Although TV networks claim can achieve a goal of “TV everywhere,” the U.S. cable ecosystem is a patchwork of locations that is not conducive to mobile audiences. The Twitter deal follows the NFL selling rights in 2015 to Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO) to stream a single game. The experiment produced 15.2 million viewers and 33.6 million video streams, but Yahoo obviously lost money. Twitter has only bought the “digital rights” to the games, so TV rights still belong to the broadcasters and the NFL Network. Of the 70 potential advertising slots available for sale during each NFL games, Twitter will only be allowed to sell 15-20 ads. Twitter’s marketing types have been praising the deal as an effort to move the company beyond posting content from journalists, politicians and celebrities to building social media engagement with the sports “ethosphere.”, Twitter Chief Financial Officer Anthony Noto suggests that success with the NFL games will lead to more video deals that could include other professional sports, proprietary political content, and eventually a stable of live entertainment. But pioneering a new business model where social media firms purchase high-priced content is substantially different than YouTube’s strategy of embracing a roster of its “site-grown” stars, while Netflix and Amazon create their own original dramas using top Hollywood talent. In sum, the NFL deal will definitely drive new users onto Twitter’s platform. But it is unclear how the company expects to address its declining MAU and engagement growth, since logging in to a streaming NFL game on Twitter does not require opening the Twitter social media message feed.  \n",
      "An environmental group and an Arizona Democrat legislator have filed the first lawsuit against President Donald Trump’s border wall, though the case may be thrown out.[The San Diego Union-Tribune reports that the Center for Biological Diversity, a well-known national environmental group along, with Rep. Raúl Grijalva, (D-AZ), the highest ranking member of the House Committee on Natural Resources, filed a legal challenge Wednesday against the Trump’s administration over its proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall, which will reportedly start in San Diego County. advertisement, The lawsuit specifically names the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which has been soliciting bids for the wall project. The agency informed Breitbart News that it is standard procedure to not comment on any pending litigation. The Hill reports that the lawsuit focuses on a requirement by Department of Homeland Security to draft a new environmental review to examine the impacts of the wall on the environment. “Trump’s border wall will divide and destroy the incredible communities and wild landscapes along the border,” Kierán Suckling, the group’s executive director, said in a Wednesday statement, reported by The Hill.  “Endangered species like jaguars and ocelots don’t observe international boundaries and should not be sacrificed for unnecessary border militarization,” he added. The lawsuit’s prospects are not promising, but the goal may be to delay, rather than stop, the building of the wall.  A law passed in 2006 — the same year the the Secure Fence Act became law — will likely trump the legal action.  It gives DHS a waiver from environmental laws that hamper construction everywhere else in California, granting the department tremendous latitude in the border region in the name of national security. In recent months, the border wall, which was a controversial linchpin of President Trump’s campaign, has become the symbol of resistance to his policies. Pension funds in California are threatening to divest from any company that participates in building the border wall, and the California legislature is planning to consider a lifetime ban from state contracts against any company that works on the wall. In an interesting side note, a Los Angeles Times report noted that one contractor addressed threats to wildlife — raised by the lawsuit and Democrat lawmakers alike — with an innovative design that allows some animals to cross over the wall. Tim Donnelly is a former California State Assemblyman and author who is doing a book tour for his new book: Patriot Not Politician: Win or Go Homeless. He ran for governor in 2014.

      "Ahead of a meeting between with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, lawmakers are demanding President Donald Trump drop his executive order calling for a legal review of the H-1B visa.[In April, Trump’s signed an executive order targeting abuse by U.S. companies, Breitbart Texas reported, calling for the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Labor Department and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to conduct a “full legal analysis” of all the problems negatively impacting American workers in the H-1B visa system. advertisement, As Trump and Modi are expected to meet in Washington, D.C. India’s top lawmakers want the H-1B legal review dropped entirely. India Congress spokesperson Anand Sharma requested Modi tell Trump to “reverse” his H-1B crackdown. “He should demand and obtain credible and firm assurances from US President Donald Trump that he will reverse his decision which discriminates against Indian professionals… He cannot return empty-handed,” Sharma said. “We do not want mere statements and photographs,” Sharma said. “We want answers and also how the Prime Minister responds and registers our protest over the disparaging observations made about the Republic of India recently when US decided to walk out of the Paris (climate) pact. We will wait for the Prime Minister’s response or reaction.”, India’s outsourcing and H-1B visa industry, which relies on U.S. companies firing Americans and replacing them with foreign workers, have been rattled by the mere prospect of changes to the unfettered globalization business model. As Breitbart Texas reported, in 2017 SEC filings, the India-based outsourcing firm Infosys, which is responsible for the displacement of thousands of American workers, seemed worried about their future. “An increase in anti-outsourcing sentiments in certain countries in which we operate, including the United States and the United Kingdom, may lead to the enactment of restrictive legislations that could limit companies in those countries from outsourcing work to us, or could inhibit our ability to staff client projects in a timely manner thereby impacting our revenue and profitability,” Infosys executives wrote in the SEC filing. Every year, more than 100,000 foreign workers are brought to the U.S. on the H-1B visa and allowed to stay for up to six years. That number has ballooned to potentially hundreds of thousands each year, as universities and non-profits are exempt from the cap. With more entering the U.S. through the visa, Americans are often replaced and forced to train their foreign replacements. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart Texas.

      "George Clooney is headed for another flop with his latest film, the Jodie Foster-directed financial thriller Money Monster, box office analysts predict.[Money Monster — which stars Clooney as a Jim Cramer-style TV finance guru who is taken hostage on air by a disgruntled viewer — is projected to open in the low-teen million range this weekend, according to tracking estimates in the Hollywood Reporter. advertisement, The studio behind the film, Sony/Tristar, projects an even softer opening, at $10 million. If those estimates hold, it would be a disappointing opening for the star-studded film, which reportedly carried a production budget of $27 million and will open on roughly 3,000 screens. The film — which reunites Clooney and actress Julia Roberts for the first time since 2004’s Ocean’s Twelve — was set to premiere Thursday night at the Cannes Film Festival in France. Industry tracking suggests the film will ultimately open in the $12.5 million range, Deadline reported earlier this week. Money Monster faces stiff competition from the second weekend of Captain America: Civil War, which raked in a staggering $179.1 million in its first weekend of release. The Marvel superhero juggernaut is expected to take in an additional $75 million in its second frame. Money Monster is just the latest misfire for Clooney, whose Coen Brothers-directed film Hail, Casesar! cratered with an $11.4 million opening weekend in February on its way to a tepid total domestic take of $30 million. But Hail, Caesar! was more of an ensemble film and was only budgeted at a reported $22 million. The failure of that film was nothing compared to that of Tomorrowland, the $300 million-plus Brad Bird-directed Disney climate change drama that brought in an anemic $41 million from nearly 4,000 theaters over Memorial Day weekend last year. That flop led Disney to take a more than $100 million write-down on the film. Money Monster is Jodie Foster’s fourth outing in the director’s chair, and the first since 2011’s Mel Gibson-starrer The Beaver. Early reviews for the film are positive, with an early score of 68% at ratings aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. In addition to Clooney and Roberts, the film also stars Jack O’Connell, Dominic West and Giancarlo Esposito.

      "Ken Vogel reports on a gathering of major progressive donors and politicians to “lick wounds [and] retrench” after Donald Trump’s presidential victory which also left both houses of Congress under Republican control.[From Politico:, advertisement, George Soros and other rich liberals who spent tens of millions of dollars trying to elect Hillary Clinton are gathering in Washington for a three-day, closed door meeting to retool the big-money left to fight back against Donald Trump. The conference, which kicked off Sunday night at Washington’s pricey Mandarin Oriental hotel, is sponsored by the influential Democracy Alliance donor club, and will include appearances by leaders of most leading unions and liberal groups, as well as darlings of the left such as House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Congressional Progressive Caucus co-chairman Keith Ellison, according to an agenda and other documents obtained by POLITICO. The meeting is the first major gathering of the institutional left since Trump’s shocking victory over Hillary Clinton in last week’s presidential election, and, if the agenda is any indication, liberals plan full-on trench warfare against Trump from Day One. Some sessions deal with gearing up for 2017 and 2018 elections, while others focus on thwarting President-elect Trump’s 100-day plan, which the agenda calls “a terrifying assault on President Obama’s achievements — and our progressive vision for an equitable and just nation.”, Yet the meeting also comes as many liberals are reassessing their approach to politics — and the role of the Democracy Alliance, or DA, as the club is known in Democratic finance circles. The DA, its donors and beneficiary groups over the last decade have had a major hand in shaping the institutions of the left, including by orienting some of its key organizations around Clinton, and by basing their strategy around the idea that minorities and women constituted a so-called “rising American electorate” that could tip elections to Democrats. That didn’t happen in the presidential election, where Trump won largely on the strength of his support from working-class whites. Additionally, exit polls suggested that issues like fighting climate change and the role of money in politics — which the DA’s beneficiary groups have used to try to turn out voters — didn’t resonate as much with the voters who carried Trump to victory. “The DA itself should be called into question,” said one Democratic strategist who has been active in the group and is attending the meeting. “You can make a very good case it’s nothing more than a social club for a handful wealthy white donors and labor union officials to drink wine and read memos, as the Democratic Party burns down around them.”, Read the rest of the story here.\n",
      "BRUSSELS (AP) — The Belgian region of Wallonia affirmed Saturday it still stands in the way of a trade deal between the 28-nation European Union and Canada, but its leader and a top EU lawmaker were cautiously optimistic that the standoff could be resolved within days.[“I think it’s worth taking a little more time,” Walloon leader Paul Magnette after European Parliament President Martin Schulz waded into the dispute to try to salvage the pact. advertisement, Politicians in Wallonia, which is smaller than New Jersey, argue that the proposed deal would undermine labor, environment and consumer standards and allow multinationals to crush local companies. They have vowed to block a pact that the world’s biggest trading bloc and Canada want to sign Thursday. Magnette said Wallonia still saw “some small difficulties.” He said a better deal would bolster EU standards and set a strong precedent for future trade talks between Europe and its trading partners. Canada’s International Trade Minister Chrystia Freeland walked away from the talks Friday on the verge of tears, saying that the EU appeared incapable of signing the deal. The pact was produced two years ago but must be endorsed unanimously. After Saturday’s separate talks with Freeland and Magnette, Schulz said he was hopeful that a compromise could be found to clear the way for Thursday’s planned EU-Canada summit. “To my eyes, there is no problem we cannot resolve,” Schulz told reporters. Freeland said “the ball is in Europe’s court and it’s time for Europe to finish doing its job.” She said she was heading back to Canada but hoped to return with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to sign the CETA accord, short for Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement. EU leaders have warned that failure to clinch the deal with Canada could ruin the bloc’s credibility as a trade partner and make it more difficult to strike such agreements with the United States, Japan and other allies. A similar free trade agreement being negotiated between the EU and the United States is facing far more opposition than the Canada pact. Progress on the American deal appears unlikely until a new U.S. president takes office in January.\n",
      "A new report states that only 36 percent of Indian software engineers can write working, compilable code based on a test used to automatically grade programming skills.[The report was published by Aspiring Minds, an Indian skills assessment company, which based their report on a sample of 36,800 people from more than 500 colleges across India. The company used an automated tool called Automata to perform the study. Automata is a 60-minute test that is taken in a compiler integrated environment that rates candidates on a number of levels including programming ability, programming practices, run-time complexity, and test case coverage. Candidates in the test were made up of 61.1 percent male candidates and 38.9 percent female candidates, coming from cities such as Delhi, Chennai, Mumbai, and Hyderabad. advertisement, Automata utilizes advanced artificial intelligence technology to automatically analyze and grade a candidates coding abilities. The study states, “We find that out of the two problems given per candidate, only 14 percent of engineers were able to write compilable codes for both and only 22 percent were able to write compilable code for exactly one problem.” The test also found that of all the subjects tested, only 14.67 percent would be employable by a modern IT firm. When testing for candidates that could write fully functional code using the best practices and methods, only 2.21 percent passed the test. “Functionally correct code is the basic requisite of a good programmer. However, to enhance the quality of the code, a few more important indicators have emerged — efficiency, time complexity and space complexity,” the study said, “Nothing is more time-consuming than dealing with badly written code which leads to enormous bugs and exceptions. The analysis unveils that only 2.21 percent of engineers possess the skillset to write logically correct code with best efficiency and least time-space complexity.”, The full report from Aspiring Minds can be found here.

      "Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy (D-WFP) issued an executive order Thursday instructing the state department of education to develop policies with local school districts that allow gender confused children to use the school bathrooms and locker rooms of whichever gender they identify with at any given time.[According to a press release from Malloy’s office, the governor and state department of education Commissioner Dianna R. Wentzell issued a memo to all Connecticut public school superintendents, referring them to former President Barack Obama’s 2016 transgender bathroom policy for guidance until more “formal guidance” is developed within the state. advertisement, Malloy’s executive order is in response to President Donald Trump’s decision to abandon Obama’s May 2016 directive, which effectively asserts that children can change their sex by simply announcing they have the “gender identity” of the other sex. Trump essentially returned the issue of school bathrooms to the states. Obama’s transgender bathroom policy was actually halted in August of 2016 by a U.S. district judge who said the former president had overstepped his authority in issuing the directive. The order comes “in light of an action yesterday by the Trump Administration to roll back federal guidelines that protected transgender students in public school,” states the press release from the governor’s office. The governor said in a statement:, Discrimination, harassment, and bullying have no place in our classrooms or at our schools. Despite the actions taken by the federal government yesterday, the State of Connecticut remains committed to ensuring that every student has access to a high-quality education in a safe, supportive and welcoming school environment. Every child, no matter their gender identity or expression, should be treated equally and fairly in a safe, supportive environment. Connecticut will remain a state of inclusiveness because we strongly believe that diversity makes us stronger. Malloy, who served as a surrogate for Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential race, signed legislation in 2011 that added yet another category of a special protected class – gender identity and expression – into Connecticut’s anti-discrimination statutes. Less than one-quarter of Americans support the “gender-identity” ideology pushed by gay activists and by Obama. Policies associated with the ideology would allow transgender activists to sue single-sex institutions — such as sports leagues, public shower-rooms, and women’s shelters  — until both biological sexes are viewed as interchangeable. Since the presidential election, Obama has twice admitted that his unpopular transgender policy helped to defeat Trump’s rival, Hillary Clinton. In an email statement, Family Institute of Connecticut (FIC) says, “[T]he governor’s statement of opposition is a farce, just the typical grandstanding to his base for which he is prone.”, FIC continues:, As White House spokesman Sean Spicer explained in his daily briefing, President Trump rescinded President Obama’s transgender imposition on the nation’s schools because “He just believes this is a state issue that needs to be addressed by the states.”, In other words, President Trump could care less whether Gov. Malloy reaffirms transgender impositions on Connecticut’s schools. Trump rescinded Obama’s “guidelines” for reasons of states’ rights, the very idea Malloy appeals to in resisting Trump’s immigration policies. On Wednesday, the Connecticut governor also ordered his state’s law enforcement officers to refuse to comply with Trump’s immigration orders and policies, urging them to bar federal immigration officials from having access to illegal immigrants. Additionally, Malloy’s order encouraged schools to develop their own plans to bar access to schools by federal immigration officials. In June of 2016, Quinnipiac University released a survey that found Malloy’s approval ratings had plummeted to 24 percent – his lowest since taking office in 2011, and “one of the lowest approval ratings ever recorded for a governor in any of the nine states surveyed by the Quinnipiac University Poll,” reports the school. In the same month, a study from George Mason University’s Mercatus Center found that Connecticut ranked as the state in the worst fiscal condition – second only to Puerto Rico.\n",
      "British manufacturers may once again be able to sell goods in pounds and ounces after the country has left the European Union, the Environment Secretary has hinted.[Andrea Leadsom said the government would be free to change food labelling laws once Britain has ditched EU regulations, with manufacturers able to indicate weights in measurements such as ounces and pounds, volume in pints and fluid ounces, and sugar content in teaspoons. advertisement, Speaking at the British Food Fortnight Awards, Mrs Leadsom said: “Once we have left the EU, we will get the opportunity to look at how we can change rules that will be better for the United Kingdom and whether that’s on weights and measures or issues like teaspoons, those are things for the future.”, Britain has proven more resistant to metrication than other nations, maintaining miles and yards for its roads, while still selling milk, draught beer, and cider in pints. Many Brits also prefer to use imperial measurements such as feet, inches, pounds, and stones in everyday language. However, EU rules mean that most good must be labelled in metric measurements. While shops can display imperial units alongside metric ones, they cannot “stand out more than the metric measurement”. Warwick Cairns, a spokesman for the British Weights and Measures Association, told the Telegraph: “I think the key word in all of this is freedom. “For well over a hundred years, people in Britain were free to buy and sell in whichever measures they pleased. If they wanted to use imperial, they could. If they wanted to use metric, they could. It didn’t hurt anyone or inconvenience anyone. “In January 2000, that freedom was taken away. There were raids on greengrocers’ shops and market stalls. There were prosecutions.  Honest traders were turned into criminals. “It was madness – and the fact that ‘metric martyrs’ like the late Steven Thoburn still have criminal records on file is nothing short of wicked. It would be a truly wonderful thing to have our freedom back.”\n",
      "MOST POPULAR[First of Two Parts…, advertisement, 1. The Latest Battle in the Class War, Blue Dots vs. Red Heartland, On Thursday, President Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the United Nations Framework on Climate Change.  Speaking of the deal, which had been signed by President Obama in 2015 but never submitted to the Senate for ratification, Trump said:, The Paris Climate Accord is simply the latest example of Washington entering into an agreement that disadvantages the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries, leaving American workers . . . and taxpayers to absorb the cost in terms of lost jobs, lower wages, shuttered factories, and vastly diminished economic production. At the White House, the audience applauded, and it’s a cinch that across the country, folks in the red states of Trump Nation, too, were pleased. However, elsewhere, especially in the culture-crafting blue cities along the two coasts, opposition to Trump’s decision flowed, fast and furious. Indeed, the reaction was so strong, and so deeply comprehensive—cutting across so many sectors of society and the economy—that one is left to wonder whether or not Trump’s decision will have the stimulative effect in the Heartland that he was hoping for—and that Heartlanders deserve. That is, it’s possible that blue-state opposition will thwart red-state efforts to make more use of—or even to continue to use—fossil fuels.  We will consider this point more closely later, in Part Two. Yet in the meantime, we can marvel over the totality of anti-Trump hostility: Just about every headline and press report in the Main Stream Media has been critical, with some going out of their way to neon-sign their negativity.  For instance, a writer in Politico declared that Trump’s decision “was about extending a middle finger to the world.”, In a similar vein, there was this headline in The New York Daily News: “Trump to World: Drop Dead.” Here, some of us old-timers might pause to recall that the Daily News was once the regular read of New York City’s working class, which was always interested in the lunch-bucket questions of jobs and growth.  But now that the paper is owned by a post-industrial billionaire, its editorial stance has changed dramatically it no longer reflects Queens and Canarsie, but rather Manhattan and the Hamptons—and that might help account for its vanishing circulation. As for other elite outposts, the reaction was just as fierce. “Hollywood suffers meltdown over Paris Climate Accord” was the headline for a “greatest hits” roundup on Foxnews.com. Meanwhile, the left end of the political system, too, is reacting fiercely.  Indeed, the left is reacting with such ferocity that it threatens to jolt our constitutional system.  Hence this headline from Roll Call: “New York, California, Washington Form Climate Alliance in Wake of Paris Accord Withdrawal.”  An “alliance,” really?  How many more states will join?  And how far will this alliance go?, In addition, the anti-Trump forces have injected yet another disruptive element into our constitutional equation—the idea of dealing directly with foreign powers to undercut U.S. policy.  Here’s a New York Times header: “Bucking Trump, These Cities, States and Companies Commit to Paris Accord.” The story outlines the efforts of non-federal activists to create their own foreign policy they seek to do so by submitting a climate plan of their own, directly to the United Nations, pledging to meet the requirements of the Paris agreement.  According to the Times, the as-yet unnamed group includes 30 mayors, three governors, more than 80 university presidents, and more than 100 businesses. Moreover, Bloomberg Philanthropies, the charity of former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, has committed $14 million to help fund the effort.  Once again, this is strange legal territory the Logan Act, a federal statute since 1799, would seem to specifically forbid this sort of ex parte diplomacy. So why all this fervor for U.S. participation in the Paris agreement?  After all, according to the UN’s own figures, if the U.S. doesn’t participate in the Paris deal, the atmospheric temperature will rise by a mere 0.3 celsius in the next century (that is, if one trusts these sorts of projections). Many will ask: Is it really worth ripping up the political fabric of the U.S. for such a tiny goal?  Yet the answer that’s coming back, of course, is an emphatic “Yes!”, Thus we come to see that the climate change issue is perhaps better to be regarded as a matter of morality or even theology, as opposed to money, or science. Indeed, maybe it’s akin to a religious revival—that is, a revival for the mostly non-religious.   And so The New York Times’ David Brooks probably spoke for many in his social class when he entitled his June 2 column, “Donald Trump Poisons the World.”, In that piece, Brooks outlined the ultimate rationale for many Trump opponents who have picked up a green hammer (among other kinds of hammers) to wield against the dreaded 45th president: “People yearn for righteousness. They want to feel meaning and purpose in their lives, that their lives are oriented toward the good.”  Such emotions can be viewed as either righteous or self-righteous, but either way, they are powerful. By this reckoning, the sacred guideposts of this new worldview include not only the United Nations, but also the European Union.  And so it should come as little surprise that American elites openly side with the UN and the EU that is, they prefer to associate themselves with, say, Angela Merkel of Germany, and never you-know-who.  Indeed, in this new world order, Merkel is now routinely  considered to be the world’s most moral political leader. 2. China Plays the Green Card, In their untiring enthusiasm to hammer Trump with everything available, the elites have made some curious choices.  Here’s a revealing headline from the MSM’s marquee name, the Times: “Trump Hands the Chinese a Gift: The Chance for Global Leadership.”, Let’s try to get this straight: China as the global leader, because of climate change?  To many, that will seem like quite a stretch, since, under the terms of the Paris agreement, China must make precisely zero cuts in carbon emissions before “around 2030.”  In the meantime, China is emitting more carbon dioxide than any other country indeed, even now it emits twice as much as the US. Yet for their part, the Chinese, who seem relentlessly conscious of the strategic goal of de-industrializing the West, even as they themselves continue to industrialize, seem happy to play along with politically correct green thinking. On June 1, China’s Premier Li Keqiang stood alongside EU leaders, intoning about the “global consensus” on climate change, and declaring the “international responsibility” to do something about it.  Given such high-minded words, nobody seemed to notice that China won’t start doing anything about carbon for another 13 years—maybe. Why the maybe?   Let’s remember that this is the same People’s Republic of China that is flagrantly defying adjudicated international law on the high seas in order to protect its strategic interests.  Can that same regime really to be trusted to give up its economic interests?, To be sure, some American leaders outside of the Trump administration are courageous enough to call out this bizarre process.  One such is Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who last month laid out the stakes to Breitbart News’  Matthew Boyle:, About eight billion tons of coal is burned per year in the world.  The United States of America burns less than one billion tons of coal a year, so we’re less than one eighth of the world’s consumption.  That tells you seven-eighths of all the coal in the world is being burnt somewhere else.  Four billion tons is being burned in just China alone. [emphasis added], In other words, the Chinese burn four times as much coal as we do, and yet we’re judged to be the bad guys.  Sad!, 3. The Coming Battle: Plutocrats vs. People, We shouldn’t kid ourselves: The actions of the Trump administration notwithstanding, it’s still possible that green activists—greatly bolstered, as we have seen, by overall anti-Trump enthusiasm—will succeed in stopping fossil fuels in their tracks.  Indeed, if we go to the web page of the same Bloomberg Philanthropies, we see that already, Bloomberg and his allies have succeeded in shutting down 251 coal plants.  So we can ask: Did anything Trump decided on Thursday make it more likely that any one of those plants will re-open?, In the meantime, we can be sure that all the actors, activists, litigators, and regulators will keep right on going, true to their self-appointed righteous mission of  domestic energy shutdowns, freelance international diplomacy—and anything else they can think of.   Indeed, from their point of view, if bashing coal and fossil fuels means bashing Trump as well—all the better.   And of course, such Trump-bashing also has a way of becoming Trump-supporter-bashing. For instance, Frank Rich, the longtime New York Times theater critic and columnist now writing for the similarly-minded New York magazine, looks askance at any possible effort, post-2016 election, to understand the motivations of Trump supporters.  Rich derides such efforts as “Hillbilly Chic,” adding:, For those of us who want to bring down the curtain on the Trump era as quickly as possible, this pandering to his voters raises a more immediate and practical concern: Is it a worthwhile political tactic that will actually help reverse Republican rule?  Or is it another counterproductive detour?, In other words, no sympathy for the hillbilly from that New Yorker—nor from many others. Of course, the idea that city dwellers look down their noses at the “rubes” in the rest of America is nothing new in fact, Manhattanites have been known to proudly proclaim their arrogance. Moreover, it’s no shock that most Democrats—Manchin is just about by himself in his party on climate change—are inclined to oppose just about anything that a conservative or a Republican might wish to do.  That is, after all, what partisan politics is often about. However, what might be surprising is the degree to which the very wealthy have turned against one of the historic engines of economic growth, namely, fossil fuels. In fact, we can look back at the last three centuries and see that energy consumption has soared a thousand-fold since George Washington’s time.  It’s that growth in energy consumption that has fueled, literally, the standard of living that we enjoy today.  And, of course, nobody enjoys it more than the very wealthy. In fact, the environment is, according crucial metrics, vastly better than it was in the old days, when people hunched over unventilated wood- or-peat burning hearths for cooking and for warmth, or else hunted down whales, nearly to extinction, for their blubber, which provided scanty amounts of fuel and tallow. Yet today we find that many of the wealthiest families are now distancing themselves from economic growth.  Or, as they might prefer to say it, they are demanding that we “evolve” beyond fossil fuels.  Of course, it’s never clear  whether or not the world is ready to make such an economic leap of faith. Indeed the reader might ask himself or herself: Is it wise to trust our “betters” when they tell us that the affluent-favored renewables—solar, wind, biomass, and geothermal energy—can be expanded rapidly enough to protect the well-being of the average American?, In fact, according to the National Academy of Sciences, in 2015 those four renewables made up less than eight percent of total U.S. energy consumption.  So realistically, what are the chances that they could be expanded sufficiently to take the place of the energy sources (fossil fuels, nuclear, hydropower) that are now out of fashion in high circles?, Or, is it wiser for the ordinary Joe and Jane to conclude that the Al Gore class simply doesn’t care what happens to them?  After all, the last few decades of environmental politicking, which have undercut so many Heartland industries and jobs, would seem to point to that bleak conclusion. Indeed, speaking of haute, perhaps the most astonishing bit of plutocratic guilt-tripping can be seen in the choices made by the Rockefeller Family Fund, which announced in 2016 that, having deemed ExxonMobil to be “morally reprehensible,” because of its ongoing energy production, it was therefore choosing to divest itself of its stock in the company. This is a remarkable turn of events, since ExxonMobil is descended from John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil.  In other words, the fortune that the Rockefellers enjoy to this day comes from fossil fuels. We might note that “divestment” is not the same as “giving the money away.” That is, the Rockefellers, this branch of the family at least, are simply transferring their wealth from one stock to another.   Meanwhile, the rest of us might observe: If gains are judged to be ill-gotten, they should be renounced, not simply shuffled. Yet in the meantime, these Rockefellers will now be free to join the swelling blue chorus that regards climate change as a greater threat than all the other threats, including—but certainly not limited to—terrorism, North Korea, and the Zika virus. Yes, these are curious choices that some, especially in the toniest zip codes, are making.  But as we have seen and will see, they aren’t just making these choices for themselves instead, they seek to make choices for the rest of us. So that’s why should all be paying attention, and seeking appropriate strategies in response.

      "Isn’t it amazing how all these militant atheists end up with God complexes? In the last instalment of my series looking at celebrity atheist drum-beaters who pass themselves off as “scientists,” I looked at Neil deGrasse Tyson, a progressive icon who puts even my own attention-seeking to shame. Today, I’ll be ruining your childhood with a deconstruction of Bill Nye.[Let’s get this out of the way at once. Bill Nye’s primary qualification for being “The Science Guy” is that his last name rhymes with the phrase. I like to imagine some brilliant scientist named Phil Frye drunkenly ranting in a bar: “It should have been me!”, advertisement, Nye’s most “sciencey” qualification is an undergrad degree in mechanical engineering. One would hope that one of the world’s foremost finger-waggers on climate change would have at least spent some of his precious carbon footprint earning a Masters, or even stretched himself for a dubious doctorate like Tyson, but alas, no. Still, it’s a welcome relic of the 1990s that they at least found a STEM major to be “The Science Guy.” His successor will surely be a feminist art history major, or perhaps even a fat studies graduate. After all, as Nye would surely agree, facts are just a construction of the patriarchy designed to keep women and ethnic minorities down. After a career in aerospace, where he admirably made things and improved the world by enabling jet travel — well before his pearl-clutching carbon panic phase — Nye was introduced to the world of sketch comedy. Ironically, while his acting is pretty good, it was his science that would become the big joke. As an actor playing the role of “The Science Guy,” Nye served an important purpose: getting children interested in science. It wasn’t an original idea, of course. Children of previous generations were entranced by science-themed entertainers like Mr. Wizard. At least Nye looked the part, though: he might charitably be considered a character actor for the quintessential pencil-neck geek. As a science advocate, Nye would follow a now-familiar pattern. He would start out as a fun, harmless communicator — not a true scientist, but at least a good entertainer — and then he would get bored and turn to political grandstanding. The admirable goal of holding children’s attention with fun educational content would transform into the tedious business of appeasing liberal benefactors with barely-concealed progressive propaganda. And so it has been. This has become so common among scientists with book deals that we really need a name for it. The best I could come up with was the title of this series, “Scientists Who Are Actually Really Stupid.”, In business, there’s something called the Peter Principle, which describes people who are promoted one level above their peak competence, thus making them incompetent. We need an equivalent for science, but with a more appropriate moniker. Perhaps Crusher’s Law, named after the most dreary, incompetent and annoying Star Trek character of all time, Wesley Crusher. He was promoted to ensign and then constantly mucked everything up. The only time actor Wil Wheaton ever pleased an audience was being told to shut up by Picard and his mother. Bill Nye’s Crusher moment came with “The Eyes Of Nye,” a science show for grown-ups. The programme comprised a brazen list of liberal hobby-horses: global warming, race and genetically-modified foods. Like a mind-numbingly tedious Pokemon, Nye evolved from a fun, endearing kids TV character into a moody partisan hack. The show wasn’t nearly as popular as his earlier work, of course, running for only 13 episodes. A box set is now available for $499.00 — just the right price range for his exclusive audience of champagne socialists. Despite the show’s doomed trajectory, however, Nye caught the bug for berating Americans from on high. One of Nye’s favourite pastimes is climate change fearmongering. “This isn’t something you should be debating or denying,” he said last year. Because as we all know, shutting down debate and scepticism is how real science works. Nye also signed a letter calling on media companies not to give airtime or column inches to climate sceptics. Like most climate alarmists, Nye is a hypocrite. He spent earth day 2015 spewing tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere as he tooled around in Air Force One with Obama. How typical — lecturing Americans about their Sport Utility Vehicles from the comfort of a private plane. Once again, this sort of high-flying climate campaigner is now such a common sight that we really need a word for them. Advocates at Altitude? Mile-High Missionaries? Al’s Apostles?, Heading down to DC to catch an #EarthDay flight on Air Force One tomorrow with the President. We're going to #ActOnClimate. — Bill Nye (@BillNye) April 21, 2015, , Nye is also famous for playing to a number of other pet liberal causes. Surprising no-one, Bill Nye on abortion reads like an engineering undergraduate trying to explain biology. When it comes to abortion, the only thing Nye is qualified to do is manufacture the coat hangers, and even then he’d probably fuck it up by trying to make them out of sustainable “green plastic.”, Even when debating young-earth creationists, which should be a fairly easy task, Nye fails to meet expectations. The Daily Beast, hardly a conservative publication, admitted that Nye’s famous debate with creationist Ken Ham was a “nightmare for science.” Whereas atheists like Dawkins or Hitchens at least knew how to present an argument, Nye can do little but hurl abuse. His attitude towards teaching evolution is that kids “need” to believe it, “or else.” (It’s the “or else” that gets me.) Weirdest of all is Bill’s wacky beliefs on GMO crops. For years, Nye held the fashionable — yet scientifically laughable — view that GMOs were dangerous. At the height of 1990s environmentalism, this was a hugely popular progressive dogma. It has since gone out of fashion, and — lo and behold — Nye has changed his mind. The Washington Post said this change of heart was “proof he’s the Science Guy.”  Nah. It’s proof that he’s the Fashionable Liberal Opinions Guy. I’ve profiled a lot of insufferable people, but I’ve yet to encounter anyone quite as uniquely odious as Nye. It’s no wonder that he was married for a mere seven weeks before his marriage license was denied. Did he perhaps lecture the officials about their lack of faith in the church of climate change? If Kim Davis had denied Bill Nye a marriage licence instead of those gays she’d be a national treasure by now. His former spouse then did the worst thing she could do: poured herbicide on his rose garden. All that environmental damage! He ended up filing for a protection order against her. Shouldn’t have married a SJW, Bill. It’s truly a shame. In his early days, Nye was a brilliant, albeit intellectually limited, entertainer, entrancing kids across the country with genuinely delightful educational material. But like so many celebrity scientists, Nye has been drawn to the dark side. Or at least the hectoring, nannying, fainting-couch progressive side. I started this column by saying I’d ruin one of your childhood heroes… but in reality, puritanical liberalism did that a long time ago.

EPA scientists, postdoctorate researchers, and contractors use the library for research. The 24 Hour Fitness facilities boast “thousands of square feet of spectacular workout space, complete with premium gym equipment [and] unmatched amenities,” according to the gym’s website.

      "Members of the California State University Los Angeles Black Student Union assaulted Breitbart News journalist Adelle Nazarian on Thursday as she tried to cover their protest against a lecture by Breitbart News editor Ben Shapiro.[Nazarian was on campus and using Periscope to broadcast her coverage of the event. The video is below. advertisement, , I was videotaping the procession of the Black Student Union and one woman noticed me making a video of the event. She approached me, and said, “I will beat the piss out of you.” She approached me, and she shoved me, and then she tried to push my iPhone down. And then the lead organizer, carrying a cone megaphone, noticed the confrontation and came back towards me and hit my phone with his megaphone. The front of the cone, at bottom, was pushed in by the force of the impact.

      "Women in the east Paris district of Chapelle-Pajol are claiming that they cannot leave their homes without being subjected to verbal abuse from migrants in the area.[Over the past year or so the district has become a no-go area for women as migrants and drug dealers have flooded the area. Dozens of these groups of young men crowd the streets, harassing women who walk by wearing what they consider to be immodest clothing Le Parisien reports. advertisement, The situation for women has gotten so bad in the area that many women are effectively banned from cafes and bars. 50-year-old Natalie, who has been a resident of the area for 30 years said, “these are insults, incessant reflections. The atmosphere is agonising, to the point of having to modify our itinerary, our clothes. Some even gave up going out.”, An 80-year-old female resident is said to have totally stopped leaving her apartment after being sexually assaulted as she was returning home one day. Aurélie, 38, who has lived in the area for 15 years said that the cafe below her apartment has turned into an exclusively male establishment. “I have to listen to a lot of remarks when I pass in front, especially since they drink a lot,” she said. “A few days ago, the simply standing by my window triggered a flood of insults and I had to lock myself in my apartment. I used to walk down the Boulevard de la Chapelle from Stalingrad [metro station], even late at night … It’s unthinkable today,” she added. The Stalingrad metro was the former location of a large makeshift migrant camp in Paris which was cleared and relocated to Porte de la Chapelle. Earlier this month Breitbart London visited the camp and talked to the migrants there. All blamed Europe for their situation and demanded handouts from the French government. Another woman said she would not allow her 12-year-old daughter to walk the streets of the area alone anymore. She said that after getting off at the Chapelle metro station she ended up in the middle of a brawl of migrants who pulled knives out and threatened her with them. “I thought my last hour had arrived,” she said. Due to mass migration, the situation in various parts of Paris has rapidly deteriorated over the last few years. Various suburbs of Paris, such as Seine-Saint-Denis, have become breeding grounds for radical Islam according to France’s top expert on the subject, Gilles Kepel. The women of Chapelle-Pajol have said they will organise a walk around the area with female city officials in order to bring attention to the problem and perhaps find a solution. So far newly elected French president Emmanuel Macron has not addressed the issue of safety in the French capital, using his first weeks as president to court the approval of German Chancellor Angela Merkel instead.\n",
      "President Donald Trump has instructed the State Department to slash its $10 billion budget for funding United Nations programs by as much as 50 percent, Foreign Policy is reporting.[The article said the move is “signaling an unprecedented retreat by [the] administration from international operations that keep the peace, provide vaccines for children, monitor rogue nuclear weapons programs, and promote peace talks from Syria to Yemen.”, advertisement, FP used three unnamed sources for its report, which also called Trump’s directive “draconian measures” taken ahead of the planned release on Thursday of his 2018 federal budget proposal. The budget “is expected to include cuts of up to 37 percent for spending on the State Department, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and other foreign assistance programs, including the U.N. in next year’s budget,” according to the report, which went on:, It remains unclear whether the full extent of the steeper U.N. cuts will be reflected in the 2018 budget, which will be prepared by the White House Office of Management and Budget, or whether, as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has proposed, the cuts would be phased in over the coming three years. One official close to the Trump administration said Tillerson has been given flexibility to decide how the cuts would be distributed. Richard Gowan, a U.N. expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations, told FP these budget cuts would create “chaos.”, The U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR), for example, received nearly 40 percent of its budget from the United States in 2016. Cutting the U.S. contribution would “leave a gaping hole that other big donors would struggle to fill,” according to Gowan. The left-leaning FP cites Trump’s intention to cut diplomacy and foreign assistance programs will help him increase the funding for the U.S. military by $54 billion, a “shift” from the Obama administration’s approach to the federal budget. “State Department officials, for instance, were told that they should try to identify up to $1 billion in cuts in the U.N. peacekeeping budget, according to one source,” FP reported. “The United States provides about $2.5 billion per year to fund peacekeepers.”, Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, cautioned against “slash-and-burn cuts” during her Senate confirmation hearing but is said to be reviewing the U.N.’s 16 peacekeeping missions for possible cuts. The United States pays over 22 percent of the U.N.’s $2.5 billion yearly administrative budget, including money “to battle climate change.”, FP reported that “U.N. diplomats and foreign dignitaries say they expect the United States to seek to eliminate funding for some agencies unpopular with conservatives — including the U.N. Population Fund, which receives about $35 million a year from the United States for family planning programs, and the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change.”, Also, “the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which provides aid to Palestinian refugees, has long been the target of Israeli and congressional criticism on the grounds that it has a pro-Palestinian bias. According to the FP report:, But one diplomat said UNRWA might be spared because it relieves Israel of the obligation to care for some Palestinians and because Israel sees the program as ultimately promoting stability. The United States has broad discretion to cut voluntary funds to humanitarian agencies, including the World Food Programme and UNICEF. But those programs are popular among Democrats and Republicans, and any move to slash funding could undermine Washington’s case for leading those agencies. In the early days of his administration, Trump reinstated the “Mexico City Policy,” a policy first instituted by President Ronald Reagan and continued by Republican presidents since. The policy prohibits funding international NGOs and other entities that provide or promote abortion around the globe. “Anticipating cuts to family planning programs, Dutch Development Minister Lilianne Ploumen recently established a fund to solicit contributions to institutions that have faced a cutoff of U.S. assistance because they perform abortions,” FP reported. FP also reported that if the U.S. “fails to honor its funding commitments to the U.N.’s regular budget, which is obligatory, it could lose its voting rights in the General Assembly.”\n",
      "A group of feminist performing artists ‘galloped’ seven kilometres through Stockholm past a number of the city’s statues on Saturday to protest “patriarchal” statues of men on horseback.[“When you look at the sculptures we have in the park and city in Stockholm, you see men on horses and other men,” choreographer Anna Källblad told SVT. “Statues of women tend to be naked, and quite small.”, advertisement, The group ‘galloped’ past the Royal Palace, Humlegården, Royal Garden, and Gustav Adolf’s Square, pausing at statues, where participants “snorted”, kicked, and flicked their hair in an attempt to mimic equine behaviour. Hoping that ‘City Horses’ could start a debate about men and women in public space, artist Helena Byström said the “feminist dance gallop” acted as a necessary “counterweight to the great hordes of men who take up room in the city in different ways”. Statues of men from Swedish history on horseback are outdated, and their presence overpowers Stockholm with “the male gaze and the idea of male power”, according to Källblad. “Our performance is a fun way to confront it,” the choreographer told Svenska Dagbladet, describing the group as “living sculptures”. “Horses are a symbol of power, but at the same time they represent equestrianism and dance  — both female activities which are often marginalised. “And just like the female body, horses can symbolise both the restrained and the wild,” said Källblad, remarking that “‘City Horses’ poses viewers the question of how women can occupy the public domain without being objectified.”, The idea that men occupy public spaces at the expense of women is a key theme of feminism in Sweden. Its environment minister announced in March that the country should reduce the number of cars on the road because male drivers outnumber women. “Cars are driven largely by men so by giving a lot of space to cars we’re giving a lot of space to men — at the expense of women,” she explained.\n",
      "From the Guardian: [The EU has given us cheap mobile phone roaming charges, cheaper flights and proper compensation when things go wrong. It has helped clean up the environment, improving our rivers and beaches. It has given us unprecedented freedom to travel visa-free across the continent. And I’m voting out. Why? I know a painter/decorator who has not been able to raise his wages for 15 years. There’s always someone else, he says, willing to work for less. A driver who arrived from Turkey 18 years ago, who says the bus companies used to pay more than £12 an hour, but can now pay £10 or less because they have so many takers (and yes, the irony is noted). A care-home cleaner in a rundown seaside town who reckons her hopes of ever getting more than the minimum wage are zero. Each blames an influx of workers from the EU. Each of them are voting out. Tell them the EU protects workers’ rights and they just laugh. When companies launch recruitment drives in eastern Europe they blame skills shortages in Britain. Really? If a big business wants to hire, say, drivers on £25 an hour, it will find it can do so easily what they really mean is that they can’t find people willing to work for £10 an hour or less, with antisocial hours to boot. Meanwhile, workers here rejecting low wages are told they are lazy, chavvy and feckless when they refuse to be part of the so-called “jobs factory of Europe”. Meanwhile, as wages for people in low-income groups are pegged back, rents rise. Many times I interviewed Britain’s biggest buy-to-let landlord, Fergus Wilson, and many times he told me how well he was doing from eastern European migrants, who filled nearly all his properties and kept his rental income booming. Rents in parts of the country are at catastrophic levels, snatching as much as 60% of pay. Migration is only part of the reason why that is happening. But when George Osborne declares house prices will fall by 18% if Britain quits, he’s giving the game away. He is saying membership of the EU keeps prices and rents much higher than they would otherwise be. Young people struggling with ludicrous rents, take note. CONTINUE READING AT THE GUARDIAN\n",
      "Jonathan Martin writes in the New York Times:[NEW ORLEANS — Striding up the sidewalk of one of this city’s most affluent neighborhoods on Monday evening, S. Scott Sewell seemed an unlikely figure to be attending a fund-raiser for Senator Ted Cruz. An oil industry executive, Mr. Sewell served in President George Bush’s administration, lent a hand to George W. Bush’s 2000 presidential recount, and was twice a chairman for Mitt Romney’s Louisiana campaigns. But if such a creature of the Republican establishment appeared an odd fit to support a candidate whose political identity was shaped challenging his party’s leadership, the candlelit, art-filled setting for Mr. Cruz’s reception was even more surprising: the elegant home of the longtime Bush loyalist Mary Matalin and her husband, James Carville, the Democratic strategist. The vast majority of Republican elites remain bitterly opposed to the prospect of Mr. Cruz’s becoming the party’s presidential nominee, some even preferring to take their chances with Donald J. Trump. Yet, to the strains of a jazz trio a block from St. Charles Avenue here, over Texas barbecue at his Houston campaign office and in one of Washington’s see-and-be-seen steakhouses, Mr. Cruz, Washington’s chief anti-establishment agitator, has quietly begun wooing some of the party’s most entrenched donors and officials. “We’re working hard to consolidate a lot of support,” Mr. Cruz told a reporter as he mingled with guests arriving at Ms. Matalin’s home. Some in the old guard have started signaling to their reluctant right-of-center brethren that it is time to face the possibility that the hard-line Mr. Cruz could be their standard-bearer. “If Cruz makes it, which is very doable, every one of the establishment crowd who is now eviscerating him will line up, salute smartly and get on board,” Ms. Matalin said, offering a mix of prodding and prophecy. “No one will want to be responsible for a G.O.P. defeat.”, That even traces of détente have appeared between Mr. Cruz and the party’s traditional power brokers this early illustrates how thoroughly unpredictable the Republican race has been — and that, for major political donors, it can be safer to hedge one’s bets in such a volatile environment.

      "The Canadian Parliament is debating a motion urging the government to “condemn Islamophobia” and “quell the increasing public climate of hate and fear.”[Motion 103, or M-103 as it is commonly called, was introduced in the House of Commons by Iqra Khalid, a Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) and a Pakistan-born Muslim Canadian. advertisement, Not long after an attack on a Quebec mosque in late January, the motion is now being debated in the House of Commons. It calls on the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage to undertake a study on what the government could do to reduce or eliminate systemic racism including Islamophobia and to present its findings no later than 240 calendar days from the adoption of the motion. The motion has generated passionate debate between supporters and opponents, and has raised at least five serious points of contention. Although M-103 summons the government to “recognize the need to quell the increasing public climate of hate and fear,” its proponents have produced no evidence for the claim that such a public climate is indeed growing. No statistics were presented to Parliament and no cases of Islamophobia were cited to back up the claim that anti-Muslim violence is on the rise in Canada. On introducing the motion, Khalid cited strong anti-Muslim sentiment in Canada, alleging that she was “among thousands of Muslims who have been victimized because of hate and fear,” but no further evidence of such victimization was furnished. According to Freudian psychology, a phobia is “an overwhelming and unreasonable fear of an object or situation that poses little real danger but provokes anxiety and avoidance.” Properly understood, therefore, a phobia is not just a fear, but an irrational fear that goes far beyond any real possible harm. It is the disproportion between the fear and the danger and the unreasonableness of the dread that characterizes a phobia. Who will judge what degree of fear is proportionate in this case? Moreover, who will judge which expressions of concern over Islam are motivated by an irrational fear rather than an appropriate prudence?, Conservative MPs have contended that condemning “Islamophobia” without defining it could stifle legitimate debate about controversial issues like sharia law and the niqab. The problem here is that any discussion of sharia law, the danger of Islamic terrorism or simply the relationship between the Islamic worldview and that of the Judeo-Christian West could easily provoke the accusation of Islamophobia. Evidence of this can be seen in the way that the other phobia du jour—“homophobia”—is commonly used an as paralyzing insult for anyone who manifests the slightest hesitation to embrace homosexual activity as an unqualified moral good. A number of opponents to M-103 have sustained that the motion threatens free speech by targeting an attitude (“Islamophobia”) rather than a certain sort of illegal behavior. Many have logically deduced that measures aimed at curbing Islamophobia would include pro-Muslim government propaganda encouraging positive views of Islam, along with pressure on individuals not to express negative opinions. Among Conservative politicians, Brad Trost expressed his fear that the motion would be an instrument of the “thought police in Ottawa.”, Chris Alexander, the former Minister of Citizenship and Immigration said that M-103 is “ground zero” for freedom of speech, not just in Canada “but for the world today.”, Although M-103 condemns “all forms of systemic racism and religious discrimination,” it only mentions one by name: “Islamophobia.” The motion refers to Islamophobia twice, while never mentioning anti-Semitism or the need to combat anti-Christian discrimination—which arguably occurs far more often in Canada than victimization of Muslims. Critics such as Conservative leadership candidate Kellie Leitch have suggested that the motion is singling out Islam for “special treatment” by mentioning it by name while lumping the rest together under the generic title of “religious discrimination.”, The introduction of hate legislation has undermined the right order of criminal justice by irrationally elevating the human passion of “hate” above other passions such as pride, anger, lust, envy and a host of other possible motives for malfeasance. A motion like M-103 replicates this wrong-headed legislation by addressing a state of mind—Islamophobia—rather than illegal behavior. Whether or not the motion translates into law, it creates an atmosphere where certain opinions are considered unlawful and others are prohibited. In traditional jurisprudence, hate only becomes a criminal problem when one’s behavior contravenes the law. When prosecutors investigate motive and premeditation, they do so only to ascertain guilt and the level of personal responsibility involved in a given act. They do not try to measure the quality of the motive. The matter of criminal law, moreover, is not internal dispositions but external actions. These and other arguments would suggest that the best way for government to counteract violence against groups or individuals is not by stifling debate or trying to sway public opinion, but by making it clear that certain behavior will not be tolerated, regardless of one’s motives or intentions.

      "MOST POPULAR[White House Communications Director Jen Psaki said that the president has “no plans” to address Iran detaining 10 American sailors in the State of the Union, the president will “absolutely” tout the deal as an accomplishment, and cancelling the nuclear deal if Iran refuses to release the sailors “would not be aligned with what we want and what we want to see with the nuclear deal” on Tuesday’s broadcast of CNN’s “Situation Room.”, advertisement, When asked if President Obama would address the issue during the State of the Union, Psaki stated, “There are no plans to address this issue. This is an issue, like many others, that as president of the United States and commander-in-chief of the country, we address things that come up every single day, and he’s certainly working today, even though the State of the Union is tonight. So, he’s tracking this closely, following this closely, but the State of the Union will not be about this issue. Psaki was then questioned on whether the US will go forward with the Iranian nuclear deal if the Iranians won’t release the 10 Americans the two American vessels. She responded, “i’m not going to get ahead or predict outcomes like that. that certainly would be — would not be aligned with what we want and what we want to see with the nuclear deal. You’ve seen progress made on the nuclear deal, you know what else needs to happen, but this is a situation, again, where we’ve been in touch, we’ve been assured of their safety, that they’ll be able to move forward on their journey promptly, and that certainly is our hope.”, Anchor Wolf Blitzer then asked Psaki if President Obama will still mention the Iran nuclear deal as one of his foreign policy achievements. She said, “Absolutely, Wolf. The united states is leading around the world. we’re leading coalitions that have made incredible progress around the world on issues like climate change, bringing a number of countries together to come to agreement on a trans-pacific partnership agreement, and we’ve opened up kind of lines with Cuba, that have really changed our role and our relationships with the western hemisphere. so, he’ll certainly talk about that, as well as the steps that we all took, with a number of countries, over the course of the last couple years, to prevent iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. those are achievements that we — the united states should be proud of, he’s proud of, and we want to build on those moving forward.”, She added, “I think we’ve always said that there are still concerns we have with Iran. They are still a state sponsor of terror. They are still holding american citizens. There are things we remain concerned about, but there’s no question that, not just for the united states, but for countries in the region, that preventing them from acquiring a nuclear weapon to take steps forward, that would be hugely problematic for the world, is an achievement, and something that we should be — applaud and be proud of.”, Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett\n",

      "There was a “march for science” in Washington D.C. yesterday, purportedly to defend science funding and “evidence-based policy.” Dominated by ideological leftists like Bill Nye and preoccupied with leftist concerns like diversity, it has faced accusations of being an attempt to “dress up the marchers’ political beliefs as science.”[But perhaps the science march should be given the benefit of the doubt. If their priority truly is science, and not pushing a particular political doctrine, then they should have no problem acknowledging the following scientific facts, which are a frequent cause of panic, outrage, and denialism on the left. advertisement, 1) There Are Only Two Genders, This fact is particularly popular amongst people who question the “science march’s” commitment to, well, science. The idea that there are only two genders, male or female, and that you have to be born either one or the other is a basic truth acknowledged by most people. Biologically, it is irrefutable: humans are a sexually dimorphic species. The only exceptions are the tiny minority of intersex people, who in very rare cases are born with chromosomal types that do not align with regular male-female patterns. That’s the only exception. If you are not intersex, you are a man or a woman. You certainly aren’t one of Facebook’s 58 gender options, which extend to “lesboflexible,” “agender” and “pansexual.”, Will the Science March organizers acknowledge this inconvenient truth? They certainly haven’t done so yet. And given that feminists bullied them out of using the word “female,” it may be a long time coming. 2) Race is Not a Social Construct, Sorry Rachel Dolezal, you’re white. The case for a biological basis for race, and all the differences of skin color, height, weight and physical characteristics that come with it, is overwhelming. Indeed, the biology of race is so real that you can trace it with a DNA test. , Yet Bill Nye, one of the faces of the science march, thinks otherwise. Here is his brilliant argument:, We obsess about whether our dog is a pug-Jack Russell terrier mix with corgi overtones and an oaky finish. ‘An approachable little dog,’ whatever. They’re all dogs, okay? And so the idea of a purebred is just a human construct. There’s no such thing – in a sense there’s no such thing as a purebred dog. Yes Bill, if we didn’t name Corgis Corgis, they wouldn’t be Corgis. But they’d still be biologically distinct from Jack Russells. That’s science. , 3) Green Energy is Inefficient, Climate change and renewable energy is one of the chief causes of the Science March, championed by Bill Nye and others. The march was deliberately scheduled to take place on Earth Day, when people are supposed to demonstrate their support for the environment by turning all their lights on (MILO recognizes Earth Day by turning all his electronic devices up to max). Yet many of the fossil fuel alternatives championed by the eco-warriors are woefully inefficient. Wind farms in particular are a poster child for wastefulness, operating at 90 percent capacity or above for just 17 hours a year. Solar energy is another shocker – according to electrical engineering professor Petr Beckmann, it would take 1,000 hours of pure sunshine for a 15-square inch solar panel to generate the same amount of energy as a single lump of coal. In the U.K. vast sums of money have been poured into green energy schemes, only to disappear after the companies that took advantage of government spending either went into administration or failed to deliver. Another problem for environmentalists: wind turbines kill more birds of prey like eagles, raptors, and kestrals than deliberate shootings and poisoning. 4) Inequality is Not (Predominantly) Socially Constructed, One of the most troubling scientific facts for the left concerns the heritability of intelligence and behaviour. In the 1960s and 70s, the consensus in the fields of psychology and sociology argued that both intelligence and behaviour are wholly or mostly shaped by our external environment. In other words, if we grow up surrounded by books, with smart parents and good teachers, we become smart ourselves. Alternatively, if we grow up surrounded by poverty and crime, we’re more likely to fall into poverty and crime ourselves. Unequal environment, unequal outcomes. This theory is central to the thinking of the left. It’s also long past its sell-by date. Known as the “Standard Social Science Model,” it has been undermined by a growing body of research which highlights the innate, genetic factors that drive human behaviour and achievement. The research from geneticist Robert Plomin is particularly difficult to argue with. Plomin has used studies of twins raised in separate households to determine the heritability of character traits. He has found that even when a twin is raised in isolation from their biological parents, they still end up far more similar to their sibling – and to their biological parents – than they do to their foster parents. Plomin has estimated that 58 percent of variation in school test scores can be accounted for by inherited ability. To test the Science March’s commitment to science, ask them – repeatedly – to comment on Plomin’s research. 5) Men and Women Are Born Different, The Science March has made a big deal out of the lack of diversity in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math). “The lack of inclusivity and diversity in STEM thwarts scientific advancements,” says an official statement on the march’s website. But diversity in STEM, particularly gender diversity, is not something that can be solved by policy. Feminists insist that the lack of women in some STEM fields, like physics, is caused by entrenched sexism. However, these accounts consistently fail to explain why this alleged sexism is nowhere to be found in biology, where 58 percent of doctorates, bachelor’s, and master’s degrees are awarded to women. Or in zoology, psychology, and veterinary science — all scientific fields, all dominated by women. So why do women choose the latter, but not the former? It it just sexism?, The answer can again be found by looking at studies that trace the innate differences, and preferences, of men and women. Autism expert Simon Baron-Cohen has been studying the differences between men and women for over a decade, ever since he discovered that boys were far more likely than girls to develop autism. His research has found that boys (on average) are born with brains oriented towards understanding systems rather than people, emotions, and living things. This is backed up by research on newborns, which show clear differences between male and female newborns in their preferences. Before they are nine months old, infants show gendered preferences with regards to toys, with male infants gravitating towards trucks and mechanical objects, and girls gravitating towards dolls. The study on newborns in particular helps rule out the the theory that sexist influences from a child’s social environment are the cause of gender differences.

      "According to a task force report out of Northwestern University, administrators are planning to quadruple the number of safe spaces for black students.[The proposal for additional environments for black students came after a 149-page-report on the “Black Student Experience” at Northwestern. The report concluded that black students feel “dissatisfied, exhausted and alienated on campus.” As a result, the report provided 14 recommendations on how the experience for black students could be approved at Northwestern. advertisement, Members of task force behind Black Student Experience committee hope to see changes soon. https://t.co/ZAkrWgNEow pic.twitter.com/Gq5epH6H2h, — Daily Northwestern (@thedailynu) September 22, 2016, , The recommendations include increasing the black population amongst both the students and faculty, creating an “academic support hub” for black students, increasing the inclusivity of fraternities and sororities, and quadrupling the spaces where exclusively black students can socialize. One finding in the data is the sense of diverse Black identities and experiences that cannot all be encompassed in the Black House alone. So it seems like a good moment to call for the creation of new spaces for Black connection and community building, but ones which are open to student definition and creation. Therefore, in addition to the Black House, the task force recommends three space options for making Northwestern accessible to Black students for social purposes. The guidelines for reserving the spaces should be broadly understood and have clearly articulated policies. The report also suggests that admissions officers at the university should aggressively recruit black students and faculty. To achieve this end, the report suggests that prospective black students should be offered attractive financial-aid packages and black faculty candidates should be offered exciting research opportunities. Some students interviewed for the report argued that the predominantly white greek life system dictates the campus culture trends that have they now want reversed. “In fact, some African American/Black students go so far as to blame the predominantly White fraternity and sorority community for campus climate issues.”, Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about Free Speech and Intellectual Diversity for Breitbart.

      "Washington (AFP) – Hillary Clinton’s campaign aides last year used the Keystone oil pipeline project to try to divert attention away from her use of private email while serving as secretary of state, according to emails released by WikiLeaks.[The Canada-US pipeline project, finally rejected by President Barack Obama’s administration in November 2015, had crystallized the debate over energy and the environment in the United States. advertisement, It was fiercely opposed by Bernie Sanders, Clinton’s rival in the Democratic primary elections to pick the party’s presidential nominee. In August 2015, several months before the Obama administration announced its decision, Clinton’s advisers wondered how to reveal her opposition to the Keystone project, the emails show. Until then she had made no public stance. “We are trying to find a good way to leak her opposition to the pipeline without her having to actually say it and give up her principled stand about not second-guessing the president in public,” wrote speechwriter Dan Schwerin. Clinton’s campaign manager Robby Mook came up with a different solution: publicly state her opposition. That “will solicit criticism… but that might help distract from emails,” he said, according to the leaked messages. The controversy over Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was the Obama administration’s top diplomat was in full swing at the time, forcing her to publicly apologize for its use in September. The idea of publishing an op-ed article stating her opposition to Keystone was also discussed. “Given that we just offered an apology on emails that some reporters think happened ‘on a dime’ after months of resistance, do we worry that publishing an oped… will be greeted cynically and perhaps as part of some manufactured attempt to project sincerity?,” wrote campaign spokesman Brian Fallon. Clinton eventually announced her opposition to Keystone at a campaign rally in late September 2015. The emails recently released by WikiLeaks also reveal Clinton was wary of supporting a bill to separate commercial and investment banks, a financial reform championed by Sanders and the left wing of the Democratic Party. “I understand that we face phoniness charges if we ‘change’ our position” by supporting the law, wrote campaign aide Mandy Grunwald. “But we face political risks this way, too.”, Clinton ended up refusing to support such a law. In other documents recently released by WikiLeaks, Clinton, in private speeches to major banks in 2013 and 2014, expressed views in favor of free trade and Wall Street self-regulation that are at odds with her positions as a candidate. Clinton won the Democratic presidential nomination in July of this year. Her campaign has accused anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks of releasing documents to help Republican rival Donald Trump in the race for the White House.\n",

The actor, now 50-years-old and 22 years sober, also sold an array of dangerous and illegal drugs and was found not guilty of shooting a drug dealer in Los Angeles in 1990. advertisement, In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Bridges spoke fondly Mrs. Reagan, who passed away on Sunday at the age of 94, and her impact on his life after she appeared on his popular TV sitcom in 1983. In the episode, Mrs. Reagan appeared to help Gary Coleman’s character Arnold learn more about the drug epidemic. Watch a clip below:, , “My first memory is how tight the security was and how we weren’t able to move around like we were used to. At that point, I didn’t know that much about the Secret Service and all that. Once you were around her, you saw how serious they were about it. Most of our audience was made up of Secret Service,” Bridges recalled of the event. Explaining to THR that the idea of having Mrs. Reagan on the show was one of his producers’, Bridges said, “We didn’t know if she’d agree to it, but she did. She was great.”, “She was very personable, very nice,” he added. “She sat down and had long talks with all of us. She was wonderful, a really nice lady … to have her on our show was a wonderful thing.”, Bridges added that he thinks the former First Lady’s appearance on the program made a positive impact on part of the world, despite her trademark slogan “Just Say No” to drugs being too vague. “It really did [have an impact]. You have to realize it was the ‘80s, when drugs hit really hard. It was everywhere fast, because of Miami, which just exploded with [cocaine].”, “But she actually did help me through my troubles,” said Bridges. “At my lowest point, I started remembering what she was talking about and the reason why the stuff was so bad. Once you figure out the root cause — what makes you do something [self-destructive] — you figure out how to stop.”, The actor added: “It’s really all about you when it comes down to it. You can’t blame anybody else. You can’t put it on whatever environment you grew up in. You have to quit blaming and put the responsibility on yourself to get off of it.”, Read Bridges’ full interview here.\n",
      "Actress and Fox News contributor Stacey Dash described Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump as “street” in a recent blog post, in which she defended the party frontrunner against allegations he condones violence at campaign events.[“There’s a lot of talk about Donald Trump being violent, condoning it, or at least inciting it,” writes Dash in a blog post on Patheos. advertisement, Describing Trump as “our next President,” the 49-year-old says Trump is “not responsible for what every random guy does — out of thousands.”, She continues: “Second of all, he’s not violent, he’s just ‘street.’ He was born in Queens. Of course, that doesn’t mean he was hustling on the street, dodging bullets. I know he had a privileged upbringing that no doubt isolated him from much of the violence and strife that some people grew up with in the city.”, Citing her New York upbringing, Dash says she first saw a dead body when she was three and that growing up in the Bronx made her “see the world in a certain way.” She adds:, Actions have consequences. Rude people are not tolerated. If you attack me, I’ll come back at you twice at hard. I’m not saying that Donald Trump grew up slamming people’s heads into walls. But there is something about growing up in New York, a certain toughness instilled, a certain level of “street” that can’t be ignored. At least, that’s how it worked out with Trump. Dash further argues that Americans “LOVE” Trump because they are tired of “being pushed around”:, …They want someone who will not put up with non-sense. Remember Mitt Romney’s “No Apology” tour? I love it that he did that tour. I voted for Romney, and don’t regret it. Romney is a gentleman… almost too good to do what needs to be done. But what he TRIED to do, Donald is actually doing. He’s not apologizing. He’s not backing down. Dash concludes Trump “knows both sides of the street,” and he “knows the game.”, “And he knows how to WIN IT. Like I’ve said… he doesn’t bring a knife to a gun fight!” she writes. “That’s why we support him.”, Trump has been accused of fostering a climate of violence at his rallies and other campaign events. On Thursday, Mar. 10, Trump supporter John McGraw was charged with assault and battery and disorderly conduct for allegedly punching Trump protester Rakeem Jones at an event in Fayetteville, North Carolina. Jones was among a group of protesters who interrupted the rally a total of 17 times. A day later, on Friday, a Trump event in Chicago was shut down by thousands of violent leftist protesters. On Saturday morning in Dayton, Ohio, a man was detained after he rushed and attempted to grab Trump while he was speaking onstage. Watch video of the encounter below:\n",
      "At the NBC News “Commander in Chief” forum on Wednesday night aboard the U.S.S. Intrepid in New York, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton invented a new alibi for her mis-handling of classified information, telling host Matt Lauer that she used a secure server when she needed to send classified information.[In July, FBI director James Comey revealed that Clinton not only withheld and deleted work-related emails, but also sent classified emails — many marked as such — on her private, non-secure email server. advertisement, Clinton told Lauer on Wednesday evening:, I communicated about classified material on a wholly separate system. I took it very seriously. When I traveled, I went into one of those little tents that I’m sure you’ve seen around the world because we didn’t want there to be any potential for someone to have embedded a camera to try to see whatever it is that I was seeing that was designated, marked, and headed as classified. In fact, the FBI report released last week confirmed that Clinton declined to use a state.gov email account, and defied her own department’s policy to use an “authorized information system” for official business. She had no computer in her office, which was a secure environment, nor did she use a computer inside the secured area in her homes. (In her FBI interview, she said she could not recall receiving any advice about email policies.), The report implies that the only time Clinton used a secure system for sending email was when she was traveling abroad — when State Department career staff, not her personal entourage, were responsible for setting up her communications. As left-leaning PolitiFact noted in July:, To electronically transmit classified information, State Department employees must use a specific closed system, not their usual @state.gov email addresses. Clinton has said she viewed classified information in hard copy in her office, and she used other secure channels when traveling. Some emails now made public actually show Clinton’s team discussing how they couldn’t email each other classified information over the private server and instead had to move the conversation to a more appropriate venue. So while it might be true that Clinton used a secure system when abroad, she did not use that system as a matter of routine when sending classified material. Quite the opposite, in fact: at least some of the time, she sent and received classified information and documents, including emails pertaining to drone strikes, on her private, secret, non-secure server. If there is evidence she used a secure server to send email while inside the U.S. the public has yet to see it. Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

Although Los Angeles dropped its average number of unhealthy days to its lowest level ever recorded, the mega-city still suffers the most ozone pollution in the nation. Another five U.S. cities with historically high ozone levels experienced their lowest number of unhealthy ozone days on average since the report began in 2000, including: Visalia–Porterfield–Hanford, CA Sacramento, CA Dallas–Fort Worth, TX El Centro, CA and Houston, TX. Four other California cities also experienced their lowest number of unhealthy ozone days, including: Bakersfield, CA Fresno–Madera, CA and Modesto–Merced, CA. San Diego had more high-ozone days on average in this report compared to the 2015 report. Harold P. Wimmer, President and CEO of the American Lung Association commented:, Thanks to cleaner power plants and cleaner vehicles, we see a continued reduction of ozone and year-round particle pollution in the 2016 ‘State of the Air’ report. However, climate change has increased the challenges to protecting public health. … There are still nearly 20 million people in the United States that live with unhealthful levels of all three measures of air pollution the report tracks: ozone, short-term and year-round particle pollution.\n",
      "Breitbart London’s James Delingpole has slammed the National Trust for jumping on the political correctness bandwagon by holding a festival highlighting some of its properties’ connections to historical LGBT figures.[The festival is part of a series of events marking fifty years since the passing of legislation partially decriminalising homosexuality in the UK, dubbed the ‘Prejudice and Pride’ season. But, in a segment for the BBC’s Daily Politics, Delingpole took aim the National Trust for stepping beyond its mandate in promoting such politicised events. advertisement, // <![CDATA[_informq.push(['embed'])// ]]&gt, The National Trust owns and preserves many of Britain’s notable historical properties and great houses a role which Delingpole lauded – he often took his children to visit their properties when they were young, he said. But, he continued, “I gave up on the National Trust when it gave up on its day job. “Instead of preserving our heritage it started dabbling in politics. It came out against fox hunting and started campaigning against global warming – it jumped on the political correctness bandwagon. “Britain, as we’re well aware, has a fine and glorious tradition of stately homos. The Trust’s greatest director James Lees-Milne was a delightfully bitchy queen. But so what?” Delingpole asked. “What exactly does sexuality have to do with heritage? Aren’t there already enough right-on charities out there, treating us like primary school children, telling us what to think about the politically correct matters of the moment?”, The National Trust, Delingpole argued “is the guardian of our history, not some trendy social justice warrior”. He concluded: “Maybe if enough of us resign our memberships, it might take the hint.”, The BBC invited a National Trust spokesman to debate Delingpole on the program, but no spokesman was offered. However, fellow guest Nus Ghani, the Conservative MP for Wealden countered “It’s important that these properties show the history of who lived there, whether they’re lesbian, gay, or transgender. I think it’s also important that the National Trust shows the stories of people that lived there that were oppressed [sic], and also the heroes as well. Suggesting that Delingpole had a racist agenda, she added: “Also it’s important that people of all backgrounds visit these properties, and I worry that’s going to upset you, when we all turn up and we don’t all look like you.”, Delingpole shot back “that’s exactly what I would expect a virtue-signalling member of the modern Tory party to say.”\n",
      "An immigration expert says President Donald Trump’s pledge to transform the country’s legal immigration system into one based on merit and skills is a maneuver the U.S. “desperately needs.”[In a piece for The Huffington Post, Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) Executive Director Bob Dane explains that Trump’s potential merit-based immigration overhaul would mean an end to the current system which favors immigrants who already have family in the U.S.:, advertisement, Today, the U.S. remains a meritocracy in many respects, but not in one notable area: its immigration system. This is why President Donald Trump’s call for an immigration policy overhaul ― in favor of applicants whose skills and talents are most likely to benefit the country ― is so important. Such a merit-based policy would be a radical departure from the way we now select immigrants but one our nation desperately needs. We should not let history hold us back any longer. For the last half century, America has maintained an immigration policy that can only be described as codified nepotism. Of the approximately 1 million new immigrants who are legally admitted to the United States each year via green cards, about 60 percent enter for no other reason than that they have a relative ― in most cases a recently settled immigrant ― living in this country. Only about 15 percent of immigrants are admitted because of their skills, while the remainder are admitted on humanitarian grounds. Dane says the current system of family chain migration ends up a drain on American taxpayers, as they must foot the bill, writing “In 2012, more than half of immigrant-headed households in the United States relied on at least one welfare program, compared with 30 percent of households headed by a native-born citizen, according to a report based on data from the Census Bureau’s Survey of Income and Program Participation.”, Trump, according to Dane, should focus on creating a merit-based immigration policy where only immigrants who have a high likelihood to succeed are admitted, as this would be in the national interest:, All prospective immigrants to the U.S. should be evaluated based on objective criteria. These include education, job skills and English proficiency. Admission should be granted to those who are most likely to be net contributors to our economy, complement our existing labor force and successfully assimilate into the mainstream of American society. The criteria for admission must also be fluid, understanding that the needs of the country and our economy change over time. Dane also blasts the infamous open borders advocate’s favorite catchphrase “We are a nation of immigrants” in his call for immigration policy to move forward instead of sticking with past measures. The ballooning population of the U.S. driven largely by legal immigration, is troublesome, as Dane argues, because it “is ecologically and socially unsustainable and serves no national interest.” Dane says he would like to an immigration system which is capped below 550,000 new immigrants a year. Instead of the current system of extended family chain migration, where relatives to immigrants living in the U.S. are given priority over others, Dane says immigration should be scaled back to focus on not only skills, but on nuclear families, which solely include parents and their children. Family-based immigration should be limited to nuclear families. People who choose to immigrate to the United States are making the decision to live apart from their extended families. There should be no reasonable expectation on the part of people who immigrate to the U.S. that our laws will guarantee them the right to have their entire extended families join them here. Moreover, in an age of modern communications and relatively affordable travel, extended family connections can be maintained without chain migration. Dane’s support for Trump’s pledge of a merit-based immigration system is just the latest endorsement the President has received. As Breitbart Texas reported, the majority of likely American voters say they want to see a merit-based immigration system, rather than the current family chain migration system. Other immigration experts like NumbersUSA President Roy Beck and the Center for Immigration Studies Director Mark Krikorian have praised Trump’s call for a merit-based immigration system, Breitbart Texas reported. “We were thrilled to hear the President once again place struggling American workers at center stage in the rationale for strong immigration enforcement,” Beck said at the time. “The best news for workers was the President’s insistence that legal immigration must be reformed so it will stop depressing wages.”, John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart Texas.

      "Even though most Americans view California as a lost cause—the “land of fruits and nuts”—and now, the epicenter of resistance to President-Elect Trump, it would be a mistake to ignore it.[The whiny, crybaby brigade of Democrats in leadership, who wield unchecked power over the most populous, and in many ways, the most significant state. advertisement, California Democrats doubled down this week—hiring former US Attorney General Eric Holder to go on offense against the policies of the incoming White House. President-Elect Trump should engage California’s petulant leaders in much the same way—“pick a fight.”, Ignoring California in hopes that it will go away would be a disastrous mistake.  California is far too important to the national security of the United States to simply ignore it. In spite of the government-created water crisis that has devastated the world’s “food basket,” (the San Joaquin Valley), California still supplies a majority of US agricultural products for export.  Grapes, citrus, almonds—yes, fruits and nuts–(no surprise here)—in addition to beef, poultry, dairy, tomatoes, all manner of vegetables, alfalfa, wine, cotton…to name a few. Water wars between federal and state regulators, environmentalists, the Democrat governor, the Democrat-controlled state legislature, and farmers have gone on for decades with devastating results.  Much of the world’s most fertile farmland lies fallow, as groundwater, its lifeblood, is slowly siphoned off to keep farmers alive. President-Elect Trump has already wisely tapped a few leaders from the crucial Central Valley region, which is not only known for its agriculture but is also home to vast quantities of domestic oil sitting atop the massive Monterey Shale. Both food and energy security are critical to the security of a nation. So far the new president’s appointment to EPA, Scott Pruitt, bodes well for California.  A “climate-change skeptic,” Pruitt will loathe to ruining the economy in the name of “fake science,” and could be the best friend California farmers have had in decades.  Any relief from California’s crushing “climate change” regulations— affecting everything from regulating dust kicked up by tractors, to requiring dairy farmers to capture cow flatulence—could be a windfall for this persecuted industry. And if the EPA took a balanced approach to the Endangered Species Act, weighing food production against the life of one tiny, insignificant, bait fish—the Delta Smelt—which has become the proxy for the environmentalist activists who populate the bureaucracies at both the federal and state level, water would once again flow to the San Joaquin Valley. An old saying—“Whiskey’s for drinking, water’s for fighting.”—has been true for far too long. But water’s not the only thing hanging in the balance. Land use is a massive issue all over the West. The Federal Government claims ownership of almost 50% of California’s land—a source of constant harassment for ranchers, loggers and anyone trying to operate a business in or around the land controlled by BLM, US Forest Services, and other federal agencies.  Picking a Representative from a western state like Ryan Zinke of Montana, as the nominee for Secretary of the Interior was another brilliant move. But the biggest issue that Mr. Trump raised in his campaign by far—and the one that is front and center in the showdown with the California Democrat monopoly—is immigration. What a President Trump does on immigration affects California’s 38 million people more than any other state. California officials have declared California to be a “sanctuary” from any enforcement of federal immigration laws, and are defying the new president by refusing to cooperate with immigration officials in any way—preferring to dump criminal aliens on the streets so they can terrorize citizens rather than hand them over for deportation. Since immigration is one of the specifically enumerated duties of the Federal Government, this is the fight you need to pick, Mr. President. A few action items to consider:, The future for millions of Californians is in your hands, Mr. President. Will you engage and fight this battle and win a victory for the American people or punt like every administration before you?, The world is watching.

      "Analysts had grave predictions for the future of Twitter following the release of the company’s 4th quarter earnings Thursday.[Speaking to Bloomberg, Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group, discussed Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and the division of his time between Twitter and his other company Square. “The fact that they’ve tolerated having a shared CEO is remarkable given the situation they’re in,” he said, “Unfortunately, it’s a situation of investor indifference — everyone is used to Twitter’s troubles by now.”, advertisement, The company’s earnings for the fourth quarter were $717 million, falling short of Wall Street predictions of $740 million. Twitter’s sales growth of 1% slowed dramatically from the 48% gain for the same quarter last year. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jitendra Waral believes this will be a big issue for Twitter in the coming year: “Sales growth recovery for Twitter will be very challenging in 2017. Google and Facebook results show robust ad environment in the fourth quarter.” Waral stated that Twitter’s sales growth “is showing their strategies are not working.”, Twitter has been relying on live video partnerships with larger brands such as Dick Clark Productions in recent months in an attempt to attract more users to their platform, a move that hasn’t seemed to yield much success. The company also introduced new video ad monetization features, allowing advertisements to be played before videos. However, advertising revenue decreased from the year previously, with the company reporting revenue of $638 million. James Cakmak, an analyst at Monness Crespi Hardt &amp Co. believes that although Twitter has carved out a niche in the political world, “It’s still in an identity crisis. People that use Twitter get it, the world conceptually gets it, but your average potential user doesn’t.”, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, however, currently has no plans to step down as CEO of Square, saying, “This focus, and this team, allows me and gives me a lot of confidence I can continue to focus on the meaningful things at both companies and we have the right prioritization in front of us.”, “Late last year, we really flattened the org… so I could be closer to the product,” he said. “Now we’ve spent a year going through and making sure we reset the foundation on what we’re executing and what our priorities are, we have a lot more confidence that we can move a lot faster on bigger things.”, Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

      "In an analysis of Monday’s meeting between Pope Francis and Sheikh Ahmed el-Tayeb, the Grand Imam of the al-Azhar Mosque in Cairo, Vatican expert John L. Allen said that there is no Christian leader in the world today with a more credible claim to the title of a “friend of Islam.”[Lining up the Pope’s credentials for such a claim, Allen notes that Francis opposed the idea of Western strikes on the Assad regime in Syria in September 2013, which won him the enduring gratitude of the Grand Mufti of Syria, Ahmad Badreddin Hassoun. On Holy Thursday, Francis washed the feet of Muslim inmates. He has welcomed Islamic leaders to the Vatican, and has become Europe’s “leading voice of compassion for Muslim refugees,” Allen states, including bringing back three Syrian Muslim refugee families after his recent trip to the Greek island of Lesbos. advertisement, Along with his direct outreach to Muslims, Francis has also visited five places with a majority Muslim population, Allen observes, while paradoxically he has yet to make a single state visit to anywhere in Western Europe, “the traditional cradle of Christendom.” So far, he has visited Jordan, the “State of Palestine,” Turkey, Albania and Sarajevo. As further evidence for his claim, Allen cites the Pope’s recent interview in La Croix, where he insisted that “co-existence between Christians and Muslims is still possible,” while criticizing the West for attempting to impose its version of democracy on Islamic nations such as Iraq and Libya. In his meeting with the Grand Imam Monday, Pope Francis offered a “hugely symbolic” hug and exchange of kisses, and told a small group of reporters: “Our meeting is the message.”, The Vatican did not release a text of the Pope’s words to the Grand Imam, but reported that in their noon meeting the two focused “on the common commitment of the authorities and faithful of the great religions to peace in the world, the rejection of violence and terrorism, the situation of Christians in the context of conflict and tension in the Middle East, and their protection.”, The official communiqué also said that the two men underscored “the great significance of this new meeting in the framework of dialogue between the Catholic Church and Islam,” and noted that the discussion between the two leaders “took place in a very cordial atmosphere” and “lasted for around thirty minutes.”, As Breitbart News reported last week, the Al-Azhar university is the most prestigious institution in Sunni Islam, and the meeting between the two religious leaders was without precedent. Al-Azhar had broken off its one-time collaboration with the Vatican in 2011, after Pope Benedict XVI spoke out against an attack on Coptic Christians in Alexandria as a reason why it was urgent for governments in the region to adopt “effective measures for the protection of religious minorities,” which authorities interpreted as a meddling in the country’s internal politics. As one of the chief centers of Islamic learning in the world, the al-Azhar university is an important reference point for Sunni Muslims, and boasts a yearly enrollment of some 90,000 students.

      "MOST POPULAR[On Thursday’s Breitbart News Daily on Sirius XM Patriot channel 125, veteran NBC newsman Tom Brokaw said Breitbart News is one of the outlets that he reads to keep up with the news and viewpoints across the political spectrum. advertisement, In a discussion about new and old media with host and Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon, Brokaw revealed, “I read Breitbart, for example, because I want to hear what you all have to say, take your philosophy very seriously… and it’s authentic.”, In speaking about the glorified “old days” of media, Brokaw said many news veterans think those days “were sensational because there were very few network outlets” and, in a way, “America sat down at 5:30 at night or 6:30 at night… in a unified fashion” to get their news. Brokaw said many old media veterans yearn for the “good old days” and ask, “why can’t we go back to the old days?”, The NBC legend said, though, that “what they were seeing was the news through the prism of white, middle-aged men who lived on the Eastern seaboard.”, “Now, we’ve expanded that universe so that there are so many more choices,” he said, adding that he doesn’t know what “mainstream media means” anymore with the proliferation of news outlets. Brokaw said the three conventional networks and the major newspapers now “sit in a universe with Breitbart, Fox News” and all the digital sites like BuzzFeed and Huffpo. “It’s very hard to say that one part of that spectrum has the kind of control that it might of had at one time,” Brokaw said. He said ultimately “this is for every individual to sort out.”, “I honestly think that we’re well-served by all of this access,” Brokaw said. But he noted that the new media environment “now puts much more of the burden on” the viewer/reader “to determine what holds up over time, what matches their values, who they can count on to be authentic.” Brokaw praised NBC News foreign affairs reporter Richard Engel as a go-to person for international news who has held Democrats and Republicans to account. He said “across the spectrum there are any number of places to go” and said he also recommends that people seek out some outlets like the Financial Times of London (Middle East reporting) and the Council on Foreign Relations that do not have a “particular political view.” He acknowledged that a lot of people have problems with the Council on Foreign Relations but they “have extraordinarily gifted scholars and analysts” and “you can access their overnight update on what is going on in the world.”, “Pick out two or three others and test them,” Brokaw said. “And if they hold up, continue to go back to ‘em.”, \n",
      "Border Patrol agents opened a single gate in California to let separated families hug it out.[Border Patrol agents allowed six families to be temporarily reunited on Sunday at the “Door of Hope”, The San Diego Union-Tribune reported. advertisement, The event, held for the fifth year in a row, took place at Friendship Park–where the U.S.-Mexico Border separates San Diego from Tijuana. Families were allowed a three-minute window to embrace their loved ones as the event celebrated Mexico’s National Children’s Day. The San Diego Union-Tribune highlighted the emotional toll that can take place when families are separated. Lorenzo, 31, was able to see her mother for the first time in years. Her mother traveled to Mexico in 2010 to visit family and thought she would be able to return to the United States easily. She was wrong, and what they thought would be a short-term ordeal turned into a long-term separation for the family. What was not mentioned in the article was the fact that this family became separated under the Obama Administration. The article proceeded to play on readers’ emotions by highlighting the fears that illegal immigrants have of being deported by President Trump. “Most of my family is scared, really scared,” Lorenzo said. “My mom lost a little more hope.”, Writing for the San Diego Union-Tribune in 2015, John Fanestil wrote a piece titled Friendship trumps racism at San Diego border park. Fanestil asks readers to “join us in saying ‘no’ to racism and #YesToFriendship.”, The author describes the San Diego-Tijuana region as, “characterized principally by productive, binational relationships spanning social sectors from business to higher education, from food to arts and culture, from environment to high-tech, from tourism to religious and social justice organizing.”, The article fails to mention for the years 2015 and 2016, there were 1,580 murders in Tijuana, which is more than Chicago had in the same time span. In one instance, a Mexican cartel took the fight to law enforcement in Tijuana, shooting a total of 20 police officers, only five survived, according to Breitbart Texas reporting at the time. The Sinaloa Cartel builds elaborate smuggling tunnels in the Tijuana area to ship multi-ton quantities of narcotics worth tens of millions of dollars into the United States through San Diego.

      "MOST POPULAR[Tuesday after Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) won his home state Democratic primary in Vermont by a large margin, he gave a victory speech saying, “this campaign is not just about electing the president, it is about transforming America.”, advertisement, Sanders said, “This campaign is, I think all of you know, this campaign is not just about electing the president, it is about transforming America. It is about making our great country the nation that we know it has the potential to be. It is about dealing in unpleasant truths and having the guts to confront the untruths. It is about recognizing that in our state, we have town meetings and people come out, they argue about budgets, and then they vote. one person, one vote. In Vermont, billionaires do not buy town meetings, and in America, we are going to end a corrupt campaign finance system. We can disagree in a democracy, and that’s what a democracy is about, but I hope all of us agree that we’re going to not allow billionaires and their super pacs to destroy American democracy. In our state, you all know that we have many, many thousands of Vermonters working not just one job, they’re working two jobs, they’re working three jobs. And you all know that while our people are working so hard, almost all of the new wealth and income generated in America is going to the top 1 percent. “Well, together, what we are going to do is create an economy that works for all of us, not just the people on top,” he continued. “And together, we are going to end and reform a broken criminal justice system. This country, the wealthiest country in the history of the world, should not be having more people in jail than any other country on earth. That’s wrong. So we are going to invest for our young people in education, in jobs, not jails or incarceration. Now, I know many of my Republican colleagues think that climate change is a hoax. Well, I believe that you don’t develop real public policy unless you listen to the science and the science is clear. Together, we are going to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. Now, I know that Secretary Clinton and many of the establishment people think that I am looking and thinking too big. I don’t think so. So let me go on the record and say, as you have heard me say for years, health care is a right for all people. And let me also say that in the United States of America, when we talk about public education, it’s not just first grade through twelfth. That has got to be expanded to make public colleges and universities tuition free. What I have said from day one in this campaign and I suspect many of you went down on the lake with me when we announced on that beautiful day. What I have said is that this campaign is not just about electing a president.”, “It is about making a political revolution,” he added. What that revolution is about is bringing millions of millions of people into the political process. Working people who have been so disillusioned, they no longer vote. Young people have never been involved. The political revolution is about is bringing our people together. Black and white, Latino, Asian Americans, gay and straight. People born in America, people who have immigrated to America. When we bring our people together, when we do not allow the Donald Trumps of the world to divide us up. When we bring our people together and when we have the courage to stand up to the billionaire class and tell them they can’t have it all.

      "Evidence has emerged that convicted sex offender and Bill Clinton associate Jeffrey Epstein tried to use his close relationship with Bill Clinton to get out of his conviction, and even falsely claimed, to impress authorities, that he was part of the cabal that founded the Clinton Foundation charity.[Epstein’s lawyers authored a 23-page letter of recommendation as part of an unsuccessful plea deal to mitigate his sentence for using underage girls in a sex ring, according to Fox News. advertisement, The sex ring based in Palm Beach, Florida, and Epstein’s private estate in the Virgin Islands were dubbed “Orgy Island” by the high powered clients who indulged their desires, including, some say, former President Bill Clinton, who was a frequent visitor to Epstein’s estate. But the long letter also made the claim that Epstein was part of the group that founded the Clinton Foundation:, “Mr. Epstein was part of the original group that conceived the Clinton Global Initiative, which is described as a project ‘bringing together a community of global leaders to devise and implement innovative solutions to some of the world’s most pressing challenges,” read the July 2007 letter to the U.S. Attorney’s office in the Southern District of Florida. “Focuses of this initiative include poverty, climate change, global health, and religious and ethnic conflicts.”, The claim appears to be false, or is at least questionable, as Epstein’s name does not appear on any of the official documents connected to the foundation. Fox, however, did find much evidence that Clinton was a repeat passenger on Epstein’s notorious plane. “A FoxNews.com investigation in May showed the former president was a frequent flier on Epstein’s infamous jet, dubbed the ‘Lolita Express,'” Fox noted, “which earned its Nabakov-inspired nickname because it was reportedly outfitted with a bed where passengers had group sex with young girls.”, Fox found that Clinton took at least 26 trips around the world on Epstein’s plane. Documents also show that several police agencies had been investigating Epstein for suspected incidents of child abuse, sexual exploitation, and underage prostitution throughout the time Bill Clinton was close to him.

      "As voters, Californians rejected Donald Trump. As consumers, they love him.[The Conference Board, which measures consumer confidence, reports that consumers in the Golden State are more confident that they have been since 2007, before the Great Recession. advertisement, The Orange County Register notes:, The Conference Board’s consumer confidence index for California rose in December to its highest level since October 2007. This was the first month the continuous polling that tracks shoppers optimism in eight big states and across the nation had fully reflected Trump’s upset win in the November presidential election. Exit polling showed the economy’s future was a major decision-changing topic for presidential voters across the nation. In California, where presidential votes went heavily in favor of Trump’s opponent, Hillary Clinton, confidence fell for two months in advance of the election, pushing the state’s optimism to a nine-month low in October. The index then rose in November and December in the largest two-month surge in nearly two years. The Conference Board also reported a surge in consumer confidence nationwide:, The Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index®, which had increased considerably in November, posted another gain in December. The Index now stands at 113.7 (1985=100), up from 109.4 in November. …, “Consumer Confidence improved further in December, due solely to increasing Expectations which hit a 13-year high (Dec. 2003, 107.4),” said Lynn Franco, Director of Economic Indicators at The Conference Board. “The post-election surge in optimism for the economy, jobs and income prospects, as well as for stock prices which reached a 13-year high, was most pronounced among older consumers. Consumers’ assessment of current conditions, which declined, still suggests that economic growth continued through the final months of 2016. Looking ahead to 2017, consumers’ continued optimism will depend on whether or not their expectations are realized.”, It is unclear how much of the surge is directly due to Trump’s victory, as consumer confidence decreased in some states where Trump won, such as Pennsylvania and Michigan, though confidence levels in both states were still at historically high levels, the Register reports. In addition, there may be independent reasons for Californians to feel confident. Rains, for example, may have encouraged Californians to believe the state’s five-year drought is ending. Still, the state seems to be experiencing a “Trump bump,” along with the rest of the nation, as consumers anticipate an end to the onslaught of federal regulation and a more favorable climate for entrepreneurship, economic growth and job creation.

      "In a recent op-ed, writer Matthew Archbold decries the modern tendency to avoid religious language in public, promising “good thoughts” rather than prayers for people, in a bow to a secular environment where Christianity is seen as “the new secondhand smoke.”[Archbold relates a series of instances where even religious people are cowed into offering a “good thought” rather than a prayer for people in need, for fear of appearing to “impose their values” on others, anathema in today’s social climate. advertisement, In an effort to explain the underlying suppositions behind the new trend, Archbold offers three hypotheses as to why people are suddenly offering “good thoughts” and “positive waves” for people. On possibility, the author suggests, is that people now believe in their “supreme ability to nurture positive energy and aim it at their intended target.” In other words, rather than appeal to an external divinity to beg for blessings, people now think they are capable of altering the state of affairs just by willing it. A second option is that people are just trying to say something nice without offending anybody else, even though the thought itself is completely meaningless. “They just don’t care about anyone else and that’s a good quick end to the conversation,” Archbold proposes. The third alternative, which Archbold believes to be the most probable, is that people are simply too scared in today’s world to say, “I’ll pray for you.”, The author suggests that American society may have slid so far into secularism that offering prayers for others is seen not only as ineffective, but downright irritating and dangerous, like “secondhand smoke.”, The accusation of “imposing one’s faith” on others “are the scare words used nowadays,” he asserts. Promising prayers has gone the way of the now-forbidden greeting of “Merry Christmas” in exchange for the politically correct “Season’s Greetings.”, A number of reactions to the recent massacres of San Bernardino and Orlando revealed the deep-set hostility that many harbor toward Christian prayer—accusing those who promised prayers as avoiding action and taking refuge in pipe dreams. Popular hashtags on Twitter included #actionnotprayers and #nomoreprayers, among others.

But unlike Clinton, or perhaps having learned her lessons, they are encrypting their communications, using secure messaging apps like Signal. advertisement, Politico notes:, Whether inside the Environmental Protection Agency, within the Foreign Service, on the edges of the Labor Department or beyond, employees are using new technology as well as more old-fashioned approaches — such as private face-to-face meetings — to organize letters, talk strategy, or contact media outlets and other groups to express their dissent.The goal is to get their message across while not violating any rules covering workplace communications, which can be monitored by the government and could potentially get them fired. At the EPA, a small group of career employees — numbering less than a dozen so far — are using an encrypted messaging app to discuss what to do if Trump’s political appointees undermine their agency’s mission to protect public health and the environment, flout the law, or delete valuable scientific data that the agency has been collecting for years, sources told POLITICO. The effort is part of what Breitbart News has called the “coup of the bureaucrats.” There are several steps the Trump administration could take to clamp down on it. One involves internal investigations, leading to disciplinary action — though that could also lower morale and drain administrative resources. Another is to set an example by firing high-profile rebels — like acting Attorney General Sally Yates — though that does not solve the problem completely. The Trump administration could also appeal to former President Barack Obama to stop encouraging protests and to urge bureaucrats to do their jobs — though it seems unlikely that President Trump would want to make such an appeal, or that President Obama would agree. The simplest solution may simply be to cut or close federal government departments that seek to operate independently of the executive. With Republican budget hawks in charge of Congress, the Trump administration might have a unique opportunity to fulfill conservatives’ long-standing ambition to reduce the size of the federal bureaucracy and the scope of its powers.

      "For the first time since the end of World War II, Japanese forces have been deployed abroad with a mandate to use force.[The first of 350 members of the Self-Defense Force arrived in South Sudan on Monday, with authorization to use force to protect civilians, U.N. staff, and themselves, according to a report by the Associated Press. advertisement, They will be acting under new laws passed in 2015, over the objections of some Japanese who worried about their forces becoming embroiled in overseas conflicts. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe supported the new law, arguing expanded military powers were required to deal with such threats as terrorism, North Korea, and China. Opponents staged massive street protests, and there were a few brawls inside the parliament building. The Washington Post notes that most of the Japanese troops are engineers whose “main mission is to engage in construction projects,” but it is “not unlikely” they will be called upon to use their guns, as other U.N. peacekeepers and humanitarian workers have been attacked in South Sudan, some of them fatally. Japan Times elaborates that under the new mandate, Japanese troops can “go to the rescue of U.N. staffers and others under attack in response to an urgent request,” and can fight alongside foreign troops to defend U.N. peacekeeping camps even when Japanese Ground Self-Defense Forces (GSDF) members are not directly targeted by attacks. However, it is still hoped that South Sudan security forces and other U.N. peacekeeping units can respond to most violent situations. Voice of America summarizes the situation that awaits Japan’s first overseas troop deployment in 70 years:, South Sudan has been mired in violence since clashes erupted in December 2013 between supporters of President Salva Kiir and his former deputy, Riek Machar. Fighting largely along ethnic lines has caused the economy to sink, killed tens of thousands of people, displaced more than 2 million, and created a dire humanitarian situation, with nearly 5 million believed to be severely food insecure. Machar returned to Juba this year after the sides reached a peace deal, but fresh fighting erupted outside the presidential palace on July 8 while Machar was inside. “South Sudan cannot assure its peace and stability on its own and for that very reason, a U.N. peacekeeping operation is being conducted. The SDF… is carrying out activities that only it can do in a tough environment,” Prime Minister Abe said last week.\n",
      "Oakland, one of California’s many sanctuary cities, set up a $300,000 anti-deportation fund on Tuesday in response to President Donald Trump’s executive order last week that aims to cut off federal funds to “jurisdictions that willfully refuse to comply” with federal immigration enforcement.[According to the San Francisco Chronicle, the fund will be disbursed to to a “rapid response network” composed of 12 Oakland organizations to help families that cannot afford legal representation and whose illegal status could result in deportation. Money will also go towards creating an emergency hotline for residents, holding “know your rights” workshops, and providing free consultations. advertisement, “Without counsel, up against a federal prosecutor, they’re supposed to represent themselves in one of the most complex areas of law, where the stakes are permanent separation from their families,” Eleni Wolfe-Roubatis, immigration program director of Centro Legal de la Raza, told the Chronicle. According to the Chronicle, over a quarter of residents in Oakland are foreign-born. The publication further noted that on Tuesday, during a City Council meeting to discuss Oakland’s budget for the next two years, Mayor Libby Schaaf said, “I caution that we are at a moment of unprecedented uncertainty in this new, I would say, horrific federal environment.”, Schaaf had previously warned, according to the San Jose Mercury News, that Turmp’s order would “destroy trust in government” and complaining that “it’s disrespecting the American tradition of a peaceful transfer of power.”, Trump’s order states, “Sanctuary jurisdictions across the United States willfully violate Federal law in an attempt to shield aliens from removal from the United States.  These jurisdictions have caused immeasurable harm to the American people and to the very fabric of our Republic.” It stipulates that such jurisdictions will not be eligible to receive Federal grants unless they are found necessary for law enforcement purposes as prescribed by the Attorney General of Secretary of Homeland Security. Oakland is located just over 10 miles away from San Francisco, another sanctuary city where Kate Steinle was infamously murdered by an illegal alien and felon with multiple convictions and deportations in July 2015. Only one mayor from a major California city agreed with Trump’s order. Last week, Fresno Mayor Lee Brand told the Fresno Bee, “I’m not going to make Fresno a sanctuary city because I don’t want to make Fresno ineligible from receiving potentially millions of dollars in infrastructure and other types of projects …  My philosophy is to follow the law and to avoid these national culture-war questions.”, Follow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter and Periscope @AdelleNaz\n",
      "A scholar from Northwestern University argued recently that Christian Fundamentalism poses a greater threat to the United States than Islamic terrorism.[Catherine M. Wallace, who is a faculty member at Northwestern’s School of Medicine and a Christian herself, argues that fundamentalist access to United States armaments is the number one threat to the nation’s security. advertisement, Wallace argues that because radical Christians are in positions of power and control the nuclear codes, they pose a greater danger to American society than do Islamic terrorists. “If [anything Islamic] wanted to attack an American city, they had to hijack an airliner. If they want to blow up a concert, they need to put bombs on their own children and send young men in to kill themselves… that kind of radicalism [Christian fundamentalism] in control of nuclear codes was a much, much greater threat,” Wallace claimed. According to The Chicago Maroon, the student newspaper of the University of Chicago, Wallace believes that a literal reading of the Bible is responsible for the threats posed by Christian fundamentalists. In Wallace’s view, this radicalism stems from a literal reading of the Bible. “Nobody in the ancient world would have read the Bible literally,” Wallace said. The idea of a literal reading is a thoroughly modern phenomenon, according to Wallace—church fathers of the past would discourage anyone from taking the Bible literally. Therefore, according to Wallace, the fundamentalists have it all wrong. “Christian fundamentalism is a malignant form of Christianity,” Wallace said. In her opinion, their literalist reading creates misconceptions of what the Bible means, fostering a climate of hate and leading to increased and unnecessary conflict between Christians and the rest of the world. …, When asked a final question on how she thought Jesus would respond to the modern political climate, Wallace answered on a positive note. “Jesus was first a Jewish prophet reciting the Jewish rant in its standard edition, which is social justice, socio-economic justice. Care for widows and orphans, which is to say the unemployable. People who can’t earn their own living. And the just sharing of the world’s resources.”, Wallace concluded the conversation on the dangers of Christian fundamentalism by arguing that a modern Jesus Christ would be a socialist and advocate for “the just sharing of the world’s resources.”, Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about Free Speech and Intellectual Diversity for Breitbart.

      "Indonesian authorities in Yogyakarta have shut down the Islamic Al Fatah School for transgender students after complaints from residents.[“We decided to close down the transgender Islamic school considering security, order and public comfort issues,” explained Banguntapan chief Jati Bayu Broto. advertisement, Officials in Al Fatah, security officers, representatives, the Yogyakarta Islamic Jihad Front (FJI), and locals met with each other Wednesday night. Authorities justified their decision because “the school was located in a cramped residential area.”, “Whenever there are activities, motorcycles are parked on the street and disturb the public,” said Jati. Public attorney Aditia Arief Firmanto, who represented Al Fatah’s leader Sinta Ratri, claims the locals used the meeting to inflict “psychological abuse.”, “There was no clarification in the meeting. Our clients could not defend against the accusations of alcohol, karaoke and other activities at the Islamic School,” he retorted. , Hard-liners visited the school last week after the school promised “not to bow to acts of intimidation.” FJI commander Abu Hamdan insisted the group only wanted to make sure no one committed “deviant acts” inside the school. Hamdan told the students to “return to ‘the right way.'”, Ratri went to police for protection, who vowed to support the school. “It’s my area I will give a security guarantee,” exclaimed Banguntapan Police Chief Comr. Suharno. The school was opened in 2008 by a waria, a transgender Indonesian, named Maryani to accept other transgender Muslims and give them a comfortable place to act as themselves. She made the news in 2013 when she attempted a pilgrimage to Mecca, but it ended “due to documentation problems.” She achieved her wish, though, in 2015, when she went “to Mecca on April 26 and returned May 5, and performed all the pillars of the umrah (minor haj), covered from head to toe as a woman.”, “They come to Yogyakarta just because they know about this school,” said Italian photographer Fulvio Bugani. “They know that there they can pray and live like a woman in a good atmosphere.”, Bugani spent three weeks with the transgender community. One image won “third prize in the World Press Photo’s Contemporary Issues.”, The school closed in 2014 after Maryani passed away, but reopened to a house that belongs to Shinta. Local officials said no one complained about the school before. “But I have never heard any negative reports on the transgender Islamic school. We would know if there were because village officials hold regular meetings,” said former Jagalan village chief Sholehudin.\n",
      "Politico reports Sunday: “The push to block, rewrite and delay scores of Obama-era rules may be the [Trump] administration’s biggest untold success.”[That declaration comes just one month after Politico mocked President Donald Trump’s efforts to use the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to reverse his predecessor’s rules: none of it, Politco declared, “evoke[d] the drain-the-swamp anti-establishment populism that Trump rode to the presidency.”, advertisement, “Trump’s ardent supporters and detractors alike tend to exaggerate the impact of the 13 rules he’s rescinding, out of more than 20,000 approved under President Obama,” Politico’s Michael Grunwald wrote on April 10, adding: “For the most part … Republicans won’t score many political points with their CRA victories.”, He also argued that the deadline for repealing Obama-era regulations on the CRA had tolled (though others would argue it extended all the way back to the beginning of Obama’s presidency, covering any regulation that was not reported to Congress). At the time, Breitbart News called Trump’s use of the CRA a “legislative milestone,” arguing that Trump’s “use of the CRA to repeal regulations has put future administrations on notice that there is a limit to government’s regulatory reach, and that given the opportunity by the voters, conservatives will enforce those limits.”, Now, Politico’s Andrew Restuccia and Nancy Cook seem to agree — and they fill in the rest of the picture, noting that Trump’s executive orders and executive actions amount to “a series of actions that could reshape American life for decades — efforts to rewrite or wipe out regulations affecting everything from student loans and restaurant menus to internet privacy, workplace injuries and climate change.”, They add:, Trump is … setting bureaucratic wheels in motion that could eventually ax or revise hundreds of regulations as agencies reorient themselves toward unwinding red tape and granting speedier approvals to projects … If successful, these efforts could represent the most far-reaching rollback of federal regulations since Ronald Reagan’s presidency, especially if Trump’s proposed budget cuts make it hard for a future Democratic president to reaccelerate the rule-making apparatus. Trump’s assault on regulations represent a fulfillment of a core campaign promise, and the execution of what adviser Steve Bannon called in February the “deconstruction of the administrative state.”, Read the full Politico article here.

      "While discussing San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s controversial refusal to stand for the National Anthem, former Boston Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling recalled the very different treatment given by sports and political media to another football player who demonstrated his deeply-held beliefs on the field — Tim Tebow.[“This is the same sport whose media couldn’t wait, on a weekly basis, to vilify Tim Tebow for lowering his head in prayer to God as a Christian. The media had a field day. You go back and look at that, and they just went nuts and berated this guy,” Schilling told Breitbart’s Washington Political Editor Matthew Boyle on Tuesday’s edition of Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM. advertisement, Schilling said the same media that mocked Tebow every week are now praising Kaepernick for demonstrating his beliefs. “The media has become entranced with being the story,” he observed. “That’s one of the reasons why we are where we are. They’ve given up all pretense of objectivity. They’ve made it very clear that they, as a whole, are left-leaning, liberal, progressive, socialist, envying people who want Hillary Clinton to be the President. That’s no longer a mystery. So who and how you turn to to get information, I think, is something that needs to be adjusted now.”, “As an athlete, this is the kind of publicity and attention that gets you kicked off a team or cut from a team, especially if you’re not – you have to be in a special place as a player in order to do and say things like that, unfortunately,” Schilling said, in response to a caller who asked if Kaepernick should be fired as a consequence of his actions. “Because the NFL is all about the advertising dollar and the TV revenue, and I gotta believe the 49ers are going to get some blowback.”, “The challenge is that they’re in San Francisco, which is one of the most liberal cities on the planet. They may give him a standing ovation the first game instead of a boo,” he added. “But I think as they travel, if he stays on the team, things will change.”, “I’ve been someone who is on that frying pan, as far as saying things that I believe and think, and people saying it’s to get attention,” Schilling said earlier in the show. “I think sometimes we underestimate the impact of the things we say and do, which is easy to do, given the environment you live in, in that clubhouse, that life.”, Schilling is currently engaged in raising money for the Jimmy Fund, “the enormously successful charity that handles pediatric cancer at Dana-Farber.”, “It’s full of amazing people and patients and survivors,” he said. “I count myself among the survivors of cancer.

      "Two years after the launch of space-sim Elite: Dangerous, a player has had a close encounter with mysterious alien lifeforms.[Until now, series creator and Frontier Developments CEO David Braben has done little more than taunt long-time fans of Elite with a simple answer to any questions about the existence of a hidden alien menace from earlier games in the series: “They are coming.”, advertisement, In an online galaxy of 400,000,000,000 stars, there’s a whole lot of space in which the creatures might hide. But finally, two years from the debut of the massive online universe, one intrepid explorer has instead been found. The player, “DP Sayre,” was pulled out of “witchspace” during travel, disabled, and apparently scanned by a strange craft with an almost organic appearance. Just after it happened, the official Elite: Dangerous twitter tweeted a brief message, along with a link directly to DP Sayre’s XboxDVR page:, A report just coming through that a CMDR has experienced something… strange. https://t.co/NJVhHWe4eB, — Elite Dangerous (@EliteDangerous) January 5, 2017, , There is little doubt that these are the legendary Thargoids, “an insectoid alien race who are said to originate outside of known space,” according to the Elite: Dangerous wiki. The creatures are speculated to have come from another dimension, and in the past have been exclusively hostile to players. But this is only the latest in a virtual world steeped in mystery. From unknown artifacts to ship diagrams and spectrographic codes, Frontier has given players enough breadcrumbs to fuel an independent subreddit. And in a gaming climate in which developers are inclined to purposely make sure that nothing is ever truly out of a player’s reach, Frontier’s cryptic slow-burn approach to the Thargoid reveal is both refreshing and genuinely compelling. It will be interesting to see what happens from here. So far, in-game artifacts have played with the ships upon which they’re carried and shut down entire space stations with their mere presence. Other than confirming the legitimacy of the footage with their tweet, the developers have maintained their silence. If the past two years are any indication, they’re more than content to allow their players to have the spotlight as events unfold.

      "Actresses and staunch Bernie Sanders supporters Rosario Dawson and Shailene Woodley aren’t necessarily prepared to vote for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, even after the Vermont senator endorsed her and called for unity at the party’s national convention earlier this week.[In an interview with The Young Turks at the DNC, Dawson said that the convention’s treatment of former state Sen. Nina Turner — whom Sanders had asked to speak but who was then apparently disinvited from speaking — showed that the Democratic Party is still grappling with deep divisions between supporters of the two candidates. advertisement, “There’s a lot of talk about unity, but we’re not feeling it, we’re not seeing it, it’s not being really reflected to individual delegates I’ve spoken to,” the 37-year-old Sin City star told TYT’s Cenk Uygur. “People have spent a lot of money to be here, have gone into debt to be here, who are representing voters, and a lot of voters didn’t even get to be counted, and just wanting to make sure that that’s part of it so we’re not just saying unity but trying to build it.”, , Dawson said that the thousands of internal DNC emails leaked by WikiLeaks last week exacerbated the suspicion among many Sanders supporters that “there isn’t integrity there.”, “It has not been a fair fight,” the actress told TYT. “It’s been an ugly fight. The DNC leaks just showed this weekend that there was a willingness to be anti-Semitic in order to push back against Bernie Sanders. That’s big, and that’s not being acknowledged.”, Dawson and Woodley were among the most vocal Sanders supporters in Philadelphia for this week’s Democrat convention. In a fiery speech in front of Sanders delegates on Monday morning, Dawson said that the Democratic National Committee should not just expect supporters of the Vermont senator’s campaign to simply “fall in line” behind Clinton, whom she called a “follower” and “not a leader.”, Dawson reiterated that sentiment in her interview with TYT: “I think it’s important that [Sanders supporters’] votes are earned and not just expected to be delivered.”, Other celebrity Sanders supporters critical of Clinton’s campaign include Susan Sarandon and Danny Glover, who attended a rally in Philadelphia on Sunday to raise awareness on climate change issues. In an interview with TYT at the rally, Sarandon called the DNC’s email leak “disgusting.”, “Nixon resigned when they broke into the headquarters,” Sarandon said. “And now you find all this tampering going on, and I know there are lawsuits and things.

      "President-elect Donald J. Trump named Dr. David J. Shulkin as his nominee to run the Department of Veterans Affairs at his Wednesday press conference at Manhattan’s Trump Tower.[“He’s fantastic. He’s fantastic. He will do a truly great job,” said Trump, who called the press conference to discuss his plan to transfer control of his business operations to his two eldest sons, Eric and Donald Jr. and a long-time Trump Organization executive. “You’ll be very impressed with the job he does.”, advertisement, The incoming president said he interviewed more than 100 candidates for the VA job, “some good and some not so good.”, Trump said improving the VA was one of the key commitments he made in the 2016 campaign. “Veterans have been treated horribly,” he said. “They wait for 15, 16, 17 days–cases when they go in with a minor, easy form of cancer and they can’t see a doctor,” he said. “By the time they see a doctor, they’re terminal,” he said. If Shulkin takes over the VA, it will be a promotion for the internist with more than 20 published academic papers. Sulkin is one of the few holdovers from President Barack Obama’s administration, where he currently serves as the chief executive of the 300,000-worker strong Veterans Health Administration, the nation’s largest integrated health care system with more than 1,700 sites of care, serving nine million Veterans each year. The VA also conducts medical research and is the largest employer of medical graduate students in the country. “VA is at a historic crossroad and will need to make bold reforms that will shape how we deliver IT services and health care in the future, as well as improve the experiences of Veterans, community providers, and VA staff,” Shulkin said at his June 22 testimony before Congress. “Throughout this transformation, our number one priority has and will always be the Veteran—ensuring a safe and secure environment for their  information and improving their experience is our goal.”, In addition to naming Shulkin, Trump again talked about the partnerships he is forming between the VA and the Cleveland Clinic, the Mayo Clinic, and other elite private medical institutions to improve the medical care veterans receive. Shulkin was confirmed by the Senate in June 2015 as the VA’s Undersecretary for Health. Before joining the Obama administration, Shulkin held leadership positions in private medical companies and hospitals and was the founder of DoctorQuality, which developed and sold software allowing medical professionals to identify, track, and analyze medical adverse events and other events relevant to lessons learned and exposure to regulatory reporting.  \n",
      "Americans for Limited Government President Rick Manning wants Congress to help President Trump get rid of “rogue bureaucrats [who] are not serving the American people” by “cutting the personnel budgets of non-defense civilian departments and agencies, reducing the enacted full-time equivalent number for each department, agency and office by 10 to 20 percent reduction in the workforce on a last-one-in, first-one-out basis,” according to a statement released on Friday.[“By now it should be abundantly clear to the Trump administration that there are Obama administration holdovers in the 1.3 million non-defense, civilian federal workforce who have no other intention than to politically damage the White House,” Manning said. advertisement, Breitbart News has reported extensively on many ways federal bureaucrats who oppose President Trump’s policies are sabotaging his agenda. “That sabotage comes in several forms, from secretly circulating emails among fellow ideologically committed members of the federal bureaucracy plotting strategy, to working behind the scenes with Democratic legislators to create out-of-the-ordinary bureaucratic actions, to leaking confidential documents to the press,” as Breitbart News reported earlier this month. A number of federal bureaucrats are expanding the means by which they are resisting the policies of President Trump. On Tuesday, FederalNewsRadio.com in Washington, D.C. part of the Hubbard Radio empire owned by Minnesota billionaire Stanley Hubbard, reported that “Twitter [has become] an outlet of resistance [to the Trump agenda and] information for federal employees.”, When a former employee of Badlands National Park took over the park’s official Twitter account to tweet climate change facts in direct defiance of the Trump administration, they couldn’t have known that they were starting a movement. Almost one month later, more than 80 accounts claiming to represent various federal organizations and employees, many of them national parks, exist in opposition to the Trump administration and its policies. “The goals and methods of these accounts vary widely. Some stick to spreading scientific facts and research performed by their agencies, especially regarding climate change,” David Thornton, FederalNewsRadio.com’s digital editor reported. “Others, lacking specific actions or nominees to oppose, share memes and ridicule the President, his staff and lawmakers to maintain engagement,” Thornton notes:, And some, like Alt Immigration, [using this Twitter address: \"\">reported earlier this week, the Acting Director of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services [USCIS] at the Department of Homeland Security, Lori Scialabba, made waves earlier this month when she released an internal memo countermanding President Trump’s executive order temporarily blocking the issuance of visas to citizens of seven Middle Eastern countries and temporarily banning the arrival of refugees. Scialabba released her internal memo one day before Federal District Judge James Robert issued a temporary restraining order halting President Trump’s executive order. “Sources tell Breitbart News that the Department of Homeland Security, and in particular U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services [USCIS], is a hotbed of career open borders ideologues, many of whom intend to directly and indirectly subvert President Trump’s agenda,” as Breitbart News reported:, “If you go down the list of current management at USCIS, probably 80 percent are open-borders left-wing ideologues,” a source, who has worked at the Department of Homeland Security for more than a decade and supports President Trump’s agenda, tells Breitbart News. “USCIS probably has the most violent anti-border people in the United States. These are in the management. These do not believe in borders. I know them personally,” the source says. “The whole reason the District of Columbia was created without voting rights or representation was so that those who work for the federal government would not wield political power. They are supposed to be neutral. Working for the government is a privilege, not a right, and it’s time that President Trump remind them by removing Obama administration hires, particularly if there is no other way to root out subversive employees,” Manning said in his statement:, Part of the problem is former President Obama changed civil service rules to make it easier to hire federal employees. Trump has solved that by initiating his hiring freeze. But federal rules also make it extremely difficult to fire civil servants. It is a process that can take up to two years, even when there is cause. That said, problem employees who, say, don’t show up for work should be dealt with through this process immediately. In addition to “reducing the enacted full-time equivalent number for each department, agency and office by 10 to 20 percent reduction in the workforce,” Manning wants Congress to take two additional steps:, “Taken together, a comprehensive civil service reform can only possibly be accomplished in the context of the upcoming continuing resolution and budget process, by simply not appropriating monies for the same number of full-time equivalent employees as last year, and defunding preferences for rehiring previously laid off personnel. Not only can’t Trump do it alone, Congress should step up to the plate exercising their Article I powers and rein in this rogue administrative state,” Manning concluded in his statement.\n",
      "Part of Donald Trump’s appeal as a candidate is that he has never served in public office. That also means that he doesn’t have a political record to stand on.[But he does have a business record. How consistent are Trump’s business practices with his stated political positions?, advertisement, Having written quite a bit on the question of hypocrisy (see, for example, my New York Times bestseller Do As I Say (Not As I Do): Profiles in Liberal Hypocrisy), I can say that there are often yawning gaps between what Trump criticizes other for and what he himself does. The New York Times reports that Trump, who has been brutally critical of companies that import foreign workers to take the job of American workers via foreign visa programs, has done that very thing at his Largo resort. But there are numerous other examples where Trump’s attacks on other corporations could be directed at his own. Take, for example, Trump’s consistently held criticism on U.S. corporations who outsource their manufacturing jobs to Mexico and China. This has been a major part of his economic pitch. As Economics Professor Mark J. Perry at the University of Michigan-Flint (full disclosure: a friend) has pointed out, Trump did that very thing with his own clothing brand. If it’s bad that other companies do this, isn’t it bad that Trump does it too?, The same goes for Trump’s criticism on major corporations such as Ford for setting up factories in places like Mexico. Trump has major commercial operations around the world and could be criticized for the same thing. As Economics Professor Donald Boudreaux of George Mason University says, “Trump is either inexcusably hypocritical or inexcusably ignorant of economics. There is zero economic difference between, say, a U.S. car company’s investments abroad in factories and Mr. Trump’s own investments abroad in hotels: both are meant to improve the bottom line of companies headquartered in the U.S. by taking advantage of profitable economic opportunities outside of the U.S.”, Trump has also been vocal on the issue of taxes, arguing that the wealthy in the U.S. should pay more while also criticizing individuals who use legitimate tax write-offs to minimize their tax burden. In 2015, for example, he critiqued Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos for using the Washington Post as a “tax shelter.” (Because the paper operates at a loss, Bezos gets a tax deduction.) Trump declared that the deduction was a “scam” to lower the tax rate for Amazon. But Trump admits that he does the same thing: he looks to minimize his tax burden. “I fight like hell to pay as little as possible for two reasons,” he admits. “Number one, I’m a businessman. And that’s the way you’re supposed to do it. The other reason is that I hate the way our government spends our taxes. I hate the way they waste our money. Trillions and trillions of dollars of waste and abuse. And I hate it.”, Why is it okay for Trump to “pay as little as possible” but not others? Does Trump use tax shelters to minimize his tax burden? We can’t say for sure. Trump has been unclear when, or if, he plans to release his own tax returns. Calling a public figure a hypocrite can turn into a cheap game. But when the inconsistencies revolve around a core issue that they claim to be passionate about, it’s a legitimate issue. The Hollywood Starlet who professes her fear of global warming and overconsumption but flies around the world in a massive private jet deserves criticism. So do candidates who attack others for their business practices but end up doing the same thing themselves.\n",
      "Investigations by Breitbart News into the global network run by George Soros have contributed to the negative atmosphere the billionaire has been facing in Europe, Politico reported on Tuesday.[The news outlet reported the Hungarian government’s move to minimize the influence of Soros’s Open Society Foundations and other foreign-funded non-governmental organizations, or NGO’s, is being “seemingly buoyed by U.S. President Donald Trump’s election victory and the ascendance of the alt-right in Washington.”, advertisement, Politico reported on the role of Breitbart News in exposing Soros, falsely labeling the news agency an “alt-right website.” Breitbart News, recently ranked as the 29th most trafficked U.S. website by the Alexa rankings system, is an independent news website considered by many to be the largest conservative news site in America. It has no affiliation with the so-called alt-right movement. Politico reported:, The American alt-right website Breitbart, formerly run by Stephen Bannon, now White House chief strategist, has long fixated on Soros, accusing him of trying to bring down Europe’s borders, furthering the migrant crisis and funding Trump’s opponents. The perceived sympathy within the Trump administration for anti-Soros sentiments appears to have emboldened politicians throughout Central and Eastern Europe to intensify their assault on Soros-backed groups. …, These efforts have already borne fruit: two letters, one signed by Republican Senator Mike Lee and the other by six House Republicans, were sent to the U.S. Mission in Macedonia in mid-January inquiring about U.S. funding for Open Society Foundation projects in Macedonia. Politico went on to report the Hungarian parliament’s plans to submit a bill on the manner in which NGOs operate within the country. Although the text of the proposed law has not yet been made public, it is widely believed that the bill will seek to require such organizations to make public the amount of money received from foreign sources.  Israel passed a similar measure last July. Sentiments against Soros have been rising in numerous European nations, including Romania, Poland, Serbia, Bulgaria and Slovakia, Politico reported. Breitbart News has featured a large number of stories documenting Soros’s financing of groups pushing open borders in Europe and worldwide, with specific focus on using the migrant crisis to achieve policy aims. In the U.S. Soros has been tied to advocacy for illegal aliens, opposition to immigration enforcement and most recently to activist groups attempting to halt President Trump’s domestic agenda. Reviews by this reporter of the more than 2,500 documents hacked from the servers of Soros’s Open Society Foundations highlight the undue influence the billionaire financier exerts domestically, from attempting to remake the American electorate to successfully lobbying for changes in U.S. immigration policy to funding initiatives targeting local police forces. While many of the documents spotlight Soros’s global network, focus on the hacked materials from his Foundations’ U.S. contingent begins to expose the many tentacles of the Democratic party mega-donor’s operation and its deep impact on the policy objectives of the former administration of Barack Obama, often using a slew of U.S.-based progressive groups and activist organizations.  Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

      "TEL AVIV – More than 20 senior officials from the Arab-Israeli party Balad were arrested Sunday on suspicion of illegally transferring millions of shekels in donations to the party’s coffers.[Balad responded to the arrests by saying they were “fabricated,” “baseless” and part of a systematic campaign to persecute Israel’s Arab minority in general and the party specifically. advertisement, Those arrested include lawyers, accountants, and members of Balad’s political bureau and central committee, including former secretary-general Awad Abd al-Fatah. The investigation into Balad, which holds three Knesset seats and is one of the four parties comprising the Joint (Arab) List faction, was launched with the authorization of the attorney general “according to the recommendation of the state prosecutor and following the findings of the state comptroller’s report” that found the party had a method of “systematically misrepresenting” the origin of millions of shekels in donations, the police said. According to police, the charges include “falsifying corporate documents, forgery, use of forged documents, money laundering, and violating the party financing law.”, Balad denied the charges in a statement, saying the Sunday raid “was carried out under a general climate of fascism and racism against the Arab public as a whole. All of the attempts at political persecution of Balad have failed, and here too it will become clear that a mountain was made out of a molehill.”, “The latest arrests are a brazen and dangerous escalation, but will not deter us from continuing our work,” the statement said, adding that the “despotic” arrests were an “authoritarian” attempt to undercut the party’s “national and democratic role.”, Since its inception the party has been embroiled in controversies. Its founder, MK Azmi Bishara, fled Israel in 2007 following accusations that he had provided the terror group Hezbollah with classified information during the 2006 Lebanon War. In February, three of the party’s Knesset members – Jamal Zahalke, Haneen Zoabi, and Basel Ghattas – were widely condemned and subsequently suspended from the Knesset for paying condolence calls to the families of Palestinian terrorists killed while carrying out attacks on Israelis. Ghattas also stirred controversy when he responded to former president Shimon Peres’ stroke by calling him a “ruthless, colonial settler” and “blood-covered war criminal.”\n",
      "MOST POPULAR[Columnist Charles Krauthammer said Democratic presidential candidate former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s “sisterhood of the marching pantsuits” “is going to have to dress light” if women who don’t support each other are going to hell and that New Hampshire was “a huge night for Trump” and GOP presidential candidate New Jersey Governor Chris Christie’s attack on fellow candidate Florida Senator Marco Rubio helped Trump the most and Rubio’s going to have “a very hard slog for him” on Tuesday’s coverage of the New Hampshire primary on the Fox News Channel. advertisement, Krauthammer said, “I think the main — the most striking elements are race and gender. Of course, race doesn’t show up, because Iowa and New Hampshire are lily white, which is why I think in the end, even though this is a terrible night for Hillary, I do think in the end, it’s not going to matter, because a large part of the Democratic constituency is African-American, and Sanders is going to try to appeal to it by pandering tomorrow. He’s going to be meeting in New York. But I’m not sure that’s really going to help him. The other one that struck me in the exit polls, is the gender issue. Sanders wins the men by almost 30%, and Sanders also won among the women. Which I think is a refutation of Madeleine Albright, who said, just a couple days ago, that women who don’t help women, essentially who don’t support Hillary, have a special place in hell. Well, I think it was Mark Twain who said, ‘Heaven for the climate, hell for the company.’ It looks like the sisterhood of the marching pantsuits is going to have to dress light. If she loses women, it shows you how much of a shellacking she took.”, Krauthammer added, “On the other side, of course, this is a huge night for Trump. … His margin over number two is really astonishing. But the most interesting element is, the one event in the debate, the hit that was put on Rubio by Christie, who incidentally appears not to have been helped. It was something like a suicide attack. But the others have been helped. But the one who’s helped the most is trump, because now you have a muddle among the so-called mainstream lane. It’s easier to see four of them, three of them, possibly four proceeding. And as we saw, with the late deciders, Rubio won them in Iowa, which gave him a strong kick, but he lost them in New Hampshire, lost by 8 points to Kasich. Imagine if those numbers were switched, Kasich and Rubio, he would likely be number two now, and have the momentum. So he looks like he’s been stopped in his tracks right now. And imagine one other thing, Trump gets over 30%, which is extremely impressive in a big field, but had the field been winnowed today, tonight, to one person for the mainstream lane, Cruz, and Trump, 30% or so means a dead heat among the three. The longer that is postponed, and New Hampshire has postponed it, the better it is for Trump.”, He concluded that if Rubio comes in 5th or 6th, he would still continue his candidacy, but the debate “terribly hurt” him, and there have been times where one event has killed a candidacy. Krauthammer added that Rubio will have to overcome his debate performance, which he thinks Rubio can, but that the election will be “a very hard slog for him. Much harder than it would have been otherwise.”, Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett\n",
      "When Democratic presidential candidates get together to debate, it really is like watching the Mensheviks and the Bolsheviks, as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) once joked.[They don’t just live in a different America. They live on a strange, faraway planet where politicians can control the weather, and evil corporations control everything else. (Oh, and where BLACK LIVES MATTER, über alles.), advertisement, It’s ripe with comic potential. These were the ten funniest moments. 10. The candidates talked down the economy. Last Tuesday, President Barack Obama said: “Anyone claiming that America’s economy is in decline is peddling fiction.” His would-be successors did not get the memo, as each of them talked down the economy. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton led off by talking about how “we have to get the economy working,” and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) talked about growing inequality between rich and poor. 9. Everyone competed to hate the Second Amendment. While Clinton and Sanders disputed which of them had been consistently worse for gun rights, former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley boasted that he had been worst of all, passing gun regulations that somehow have failed to prevent an ongoing death spiral of violent crime in Baltimore. It was a reminder that there is no room in the Democratic Party for dissent–or for the Constitution. 8. Bernie Sanders couldn’t hear a question. In a reprise of Admiral James Stockdale’s catastrophic gaffe in the 1992 vice presidential debate, when he claimed his hearing aid was off, Sanders asked moderator Lester Holt to repeat a question from YouTube. It highlighted the sheer age of the field, as well as the age of their ideas. Later, in an encore, Sanders had to explain what it meant to be a “democratic socialist”–an ideology that died decades ago. 7. The candidates competed to take credit for Obamacare. Clinton, Sanders, and O’Malley each claimed credit for helping to write, fight for, and implement the “Affordable Care Act”–a law that the majority of Americans want to repeal. Millions lost their insurance, millions lost their doctors, and millions are paying more in premiums and high deductibles. In Obama’s home state, nearly 200,000 more just lost their plans. But it’s working great, right?, 6. When Hillary Clinton used the word “jail.” She was referring to corrupt Wall Street bankers–whom, by the way, the Obama administration failed to prosecute as promised. But with much of the country wondering whether Clinton will be indicted before Election Day for corruption and misuse of classified information, jail must certainly be weighing on the Secretary’s mind. Neither of the other two candidates had the guts to say the word. But she did!, 5. Martin O’Malley bragged that no one from Wall Street has contributed to him this year. In response to Clinton reminding him that he had been happy to accept contributions from Wall Street in the past, O’Malley said he had not taken money from Wall Street “this year.” The year is 17 days old and O’Malley is at 2.3% in the latest Real Clear Politics national poll average, so no surprise. Even the audience of loyal Democrats laughed at that one. 4. Bernie Sanders dinged Donald Trump. One of the few moments of genuine humor came from Sanders, who said that Trump believes “climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese.” It was a good line, capturing Trump’s opposition to climate change policies, as well as his suspicion of China. Of course, Sanders thought the U.S. was on the wrong side of the Cold War, and still blames us for fighting it (see below), so take that from whence it comes. 3. Hillary Clinton claimed credit for the Iran deal–and Iran sanctions. If Clinton wants to take credit for a deal that allows Iran to develop nuclear weapons after a decade or so, and gives it over $100 billion to fund its terrorist proxies, so be it. But she told a knee-slapper when she claimed credit for the sanctions that brought Iran to the table.  The truth: her State Department, like the rest of the Obama administration, tried to prevent sanctions against Iran. 2. “We were able to get the chemical weapons out” of Syria, said Clinton. Clinton dodged a question about Obama’s failure to enforce his “red line” in Syria by claiming that he had found a unique window of opportunity to solve the problem of chemical weapons peacefully in a deal with Russia. She topped that fraudulent history with a claim that Syria gave up chemical weapons–a claim not even the Obama administration takes seriously anymore. 1. Clinton claimed to have stood up to Russian President Vladimir Putin. That “reset” button must have been flushed down the memory hole, because now Clinton is claiming that she put up a fight against Russia, describing Putin as “someone you have to continually stand up to.” A brazen lie–and a total joke, equaled only by Sanders’s complaint that the military aims “to fight the old Cold War with the Soviet Union.” He’s stuck in 2012–or 1917.  \n",
      "After having spent years starring in the blockbuster Harry Potter film franchise, Emma Watson’s latest film, The Colony, pulled in a paltry £47 in her native United Kingdom this weekend — or about $60.75 in U.S. dollars.[The political thriller opened in five cinemas, with three theaters reporting weekend sales numbers, according to The Telegraph. advertisement, “Ticket prices at the venues suggest that only seven people paid to see the film,” the British website reported. The Colony, directed by Oscar-winner Florian Gallenberger, follows a German woman (Watson) who rescues her boyfriend (Daniel Brühll) from a cult led by Nazi paedophile Paul Schäfer. The film’s distributor, Signature Entertainment, downplayed the depressing ticket sales, noting that the movie’s target audience was simultaneous home-streaming viewers who’d watch The Colony on their laptops. “We wanted to ensure the title was accessible to everyone by releasing it simultaneously in limited screens and on demand – allowing consumers to enjoy the movie in any environment they wish,” a company spokesman said. Watson’s last movie credit was Noah, another critical and theatrical flop. The 2014 film grossed $101 million domestically on a $125 million budget. In the years since starring in the Biblical thriller, the 26-year-old actress has taken up a number of social causes, becoming an advocate for gender equality and immigration. Last January at the World Economic Forum, as a U.N. Women Goodwill Ambassador, Watson helped launch the gender equality campaign “HeForShe,” in which she asked governments, universities, and companies to help “bring an end to the persisting inequalities faced by women and girls globally.”, The Beauty and the Beast star took to Twitter in January and asked her 22 millions followers for name ideas for her new feminist book club.

      "NEW YORK CITY, New York — Trump Tower is ecstatic as his pathway to 270 plus electoral votes and the White House keeps widening with a new poll out of Colorado showing that Donald J. Trump has tied his rival Hillary Rodham Clinton there.[The University of Denver poll, released Wednesday evening, shows Trump and Clinton tied at 39 percent while Libertarian Gary Johnson gets five percent and the Green Party’s Dr. Jill Stein gets four percent. The survey, conducted from Oct. 29 to Oct. 31—after the FBI announced it was reopening the criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton’s illicit home-brew email server set up in violation of State Department guidelines—has a margin of error of 4.2 percent. advertisement, Colorado’s nine electoral votes would easily put Trump over the top of the necessary 270 electoral votes if the New York billionaire businessman can hold Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, Nevada, and Iowa—all of which he’s leading in—and the red states, among other states in which he is surging. Surveys out this week have shown Trump trending upwards into the lead in Virginia and close to Clinton inside the margin of error in Pennsylvania and New Hampshire. Other states, like Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and New Mexico, have tightened as well—while Maine’s second congressional district is moving in Trump’s direction. Veteran Colorado pollster Floyd Ciruli, who conducted the poll, told the Denver Post that the results are “reflective of the fact that this environment has turned negative for Clinton”—specifically in the wake of the fact the FBI has reopened the email investigation. It has also been confirmed the FBI is investigating the Clinton Foundation in recent days. Early voters in Colorado benefit Clinton, according to the poll, per the Denver Post’s John Frank. “Among voters who already cast ballots, Clinton sits in a much better position at 45 percent to 38 percent for Trump — a number that appears to support early voting figures showing Democrats with a 23,000 ballot advantage,” Frank wrote of the survey. “But among those who have not yet voted, the numbers flip — which gives Republicans hope that its voters will close the gap in the final days.”, Recent polling out of Colorado shows the state has become a key battleground over the last month, and Clinton’s campaign—which originally abandoned Colorado during the summer—has now gone up with six-figure television ad buys in Colorado and elsewhere to try to regain the states they have lost. This survey confirms other polls in recent days, from CBS/YouGov, Remington Research, and Emerson College—each of which showed statistical ties between Trump and Clinton in Colorado. Breitbart News/Gravis Marketing polling from early October was the first to show Colorado tightening again after the party conventions, but then it reopened for Clinton over the course of October, only to close back up again to a tight race in the end.\n",
      "Retired Army Lt. Col. Allen West told baseball pitching great Curt Schilling, the host of Whatever It Takes, that it is important to take care of our veterans and the warriors down range in a Thursday interview.[“I know that we are not taking care of our veterans,” said Schilling, whose show broadcasts weekdays from 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. at Breitbart.com, with replays available at Soundcloud.com/Breitbart. “I am embarrassed that my country does not take care of its veterans.”, advertisement, West, a former Republican congressman from Florida, said, “That is why we need more veterans serving in the House and Senate.”, The former battalion commander in Iraq told Schilling if there were more veterans in Congress, they would stop programs like the $17 million program to decide which handgun should replace the Beretta 9mm. Schilling asked West, as someone who deployed overseas, how does a democracy like the United States that accepts the Law of Warfare prepare its soldiers to combat an enemy that plays by no rules?, “This is what I told my soldiers before we deployed in 2003 to Iraq: ‘The person that you are here in the United States of America in this environment, you have to leave that person here,'” he said. “When you get on the airplane, the person that lands over there has to be a different person,” he said. “The person who lands over there in a combat theater of operations needs to understand their task and purpose,” he said. “They have to understand they have to protect themselves and they have to protect the soldiers to their left and to their right–and they have to realize that they are in an environment where any man, woman, or child can potentially be the enemy.”, West said before going into a combat zone, at some point the soldier’s training must be supplemented by the soldier’s own will to fight and survive. Given that the Rules of Engagement are so restrictive and the penalties so severe, soldiers must make split-second decisions under an unfair duress, he said. “We cannot have our men and women second-guessing themselves because they are concerned about any type of legal ramifications.”, West said we need to do a better job preparing the American people for war so that they understand the enemy we are facing and what our soldiers need to do to defeat that enemy. It is sickening that Army 1st Lt. Chris Lorance was sentenced to 20 years at Fort Leavenworth for firing upon the enemy, but Army Pvt. Chelsea Manning had her sentence commuted by President Barack Obama and Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl still has not been court-martialed for deserting his post in Afghanistan, the colonel said.

      "A media researcher who serves on the global board of billionaire George Soros’ Open Society Foundations has called for the creation of a “public social media platform” to counter an alleged “right-wing media network,” which he claims is “anchored” around Breitbart News.[Ethan Zuckerman is director of the Center for Civic Media at MIT and serves as the principal research scientist at MIT’s Media Lab. He is also a member of the global board of Soros’ Open Society Foundations. advertisement, Zuckerman penned a piece in the Atlantic last week titled, “The Case for a Taxpayer-Supported Version of Facebook.”, “A public social media platform would have the civic mission of providing us a diverse and global view of the world,” was the subtitle of his missive. Zuckerman referred to a study he conducted last March that analyized 1.25 million stories published during the 2016 election cycle and purportedly found “a right-wing media network anchored around Breitbart developed as a distinct and insulated media system, using social media as a backbone to transmit a hyper-partisan perspective to the world.”, Without citing a single example in his Atlantic article, Zuckerman claimed that Breitbart served as the anchor of a “media ecosystem of new, online-only outlets that mixed propaganda and conspiracy theory with partisan news.”, Referring to media outlets within this self-described right-wing “media ecosystem,” Zuckerman claimed those outfits are “not fake news in the usual sense of wholly fabricated articles written to earn online ad dollars, but hyperpartisan, partly factual news.”, Once again without citing any evidence, Zuckerman blamed this alleged “echo chamber” for taking a “fringe position on ending legal immigration, making it central to the 2016 presidential campaign and, ultimately, for helping the candidate willing to support this position rise to the presidency.”, He posited that those who get news from the “new right’s echo chamber” exist in a “hermetically sealed” online environment where such users often do not get news from outlets on other sides of the political spectrum. Zuckerman failed to note the massive distrust that the American public has in the establishment news media, which could be a contributing factor to this alleged phenomenon. Instead, he warned that “being able to escape echo chambers and encounter a wide picture of news may be a necessary precursor towards a functioning democracy.”, Failing to note the left-leaning tendencies of public broadcasters like National Public Radio, Zuckerman claimed the “best public broadcasters in strong democracies – Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany – use their position to bring a wide range of perspectives and voices into the broader public dialog.”, His solution to the so-called “new right’s echo chamber,” which he claims is anchored by Breitbart, is the creation of a “public social media.”, Zuckerman opined:, Private platforms like Facebook are under no obligation to provide us a diverse worldview. If it is more profitable to bring us baby pictures from our friends than political stories, or to isolate us in a bubble of ideologically comfortable information, they will. A public social media platform would have the civic mission of providing us a diverse and global view of the world. Instead of focusing resources on reporting, it would focus on aggregating and curating, pushing unfamiliar perspectives into our feeds and nudging us to diversity away from the ideologically comfortable material we all gravitate towards. Zuckerman’s study on news patterns in the 2016 presidential election seems to contradict an extensive study that found so-called fake news didn’t significantly impact the outcome of the election. That study recently received a positive nod from the Poynter Institute, the group helping Facebook determine whether certain news stories are “disputed.”, The study, titled “Social Media and Fake News in the 2016 Election,” was co-authored by economists Matthew Gentzkow of Stanford University and Hunt Allcott of New York University.  The paper utilized web browsing data, a database of what the authors claimed were fake news stories and a 1,200-person online survey about news trends. The study concluded:, Our data suggest that social media were not the most important source of election news, and even the most widely circulated fake news stories were seen by only a small fraction of Americans. For fake news to have changed the outcome of the election, a single fake news story would need to have convinced about 0.7 percent of Clinton voters and non-voters who saw it to shift their votes to Trump, a persuasion rate equivalent to seeing 36 television campaign ads. A project of Poynter, meanwhile, is the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN), which drafted a code of five principles for news websites to accept, and Facebook explained that it will work with “third-party fact-checking organizations” that are signatories to the code of principles. Facebook says that if the “fact checking organizations” determine that a certain story is fake, it will get flagged as disputed and, according to the Facebook announcement, “there will be a link to the corresponding article explaining why. Stories that have been disputed may also appear lower in News Feed.”, Breitbart News reported that a cursory search of the Poynter Institute website finds that Poynter’s IFCN is openly funded by Soros’ Open Society Foundations as well as the Bill &amp Melinda Gates Foundation, Google and the National Endowment for Democracy. Poynter’s IFCN is also funded by the Omidyar Network, which is the nonprofit of liberal billionaire eBay founder Pierre Omidyar. The Omidyar Network has partnered with Open Society on numerous projects and has given grants to third parties using the Soros-funded Tides Foundation. Tides is one of the largest donors to left-wing causes in the U.S. Omidyar also recently provided seed capital to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), whose chief has baselessly smeared Breitbart News with claims of anti-Semitic associations, for plans to build a Silicon Valley command center that says it is aimed at combating online hate. , Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

Other cities should follow the orders of their local law enforcement. The emergency spillway, which is unpaved, was activated on Saturday morning to relieve the flow down the dam’s normal spillway, where a major hole appeared in recent days and began to widen. The height of the lake, once drained by drought and now swollen by recent rains and snow melt, had reached 901 feet above sea level when the emergency spillway was opened.

They repeated those assurances on Saturday as the emergency spillway was used for the first time since the dam’s construction in 1968. Now, however, local ABC News affiliate KRCR reports that state officials warn the emergency spillway could suffer a structural failure. It is not clear whether that would lead to a structural failure of the dam itself, which would be a major ecological and economic disaster. #Evacuation area for #OrovilleDam #spillway.

Update (11:30 PST): A late-night press conference revealed that water had stopped flowing over the emergency spillway. Authorities plan to keep flow through the main spillway at about 100,000 cubic feet per second, with a goal of lowering the level of the lake by 50 feet, which will help the lake absorb additional runoff from anticipated storms later in the week. Law enforcement said that there was no looting or violence in Oroville or neighboring towns, and that the rumor of looting had been started thanks to a coincidental break-in within Oroville at the time that the crisis began. Authorities said they hoped for drier weather, as well as cooler weather (to keep snow from melting on the mountains). The maximum flow rate of the main spillway was 150,000 cubic feet per second current inflows were 40,000 cubic feet per second. They planned to evaluate the damage to both the main and emergency spillways at first light Monday morning. Meanwhile, evacuation orders would remain in place for nearly 200,000 people in the area below the dam. Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

      "Breitbart’s editor-in-chief Alex Marlow interviewed House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady on reforming the tax code, the proposed border adjustment tax, and abolishing the death tax.[Brady highlighted congressional Republicans’ proposal to tax foreign imports and end taxes on American-made products. advertisement, “We’re going to end the tax on ‘Made in America,’” Brady said at the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Maryland. , , The “Made in America” tax gained its nickname from supporters of American-made products because foreign-made products in the U.S. are taxed at a lower rate than products made in the U.S. Brady and House Republicans have proposed a border adjustment tax that would impose a 20 percent tax on imports and is estimated to raise over a trillion dollars in a decade. President Trump has said that the border tax could boost U.S. jobs, but Marlow wondered whether the tax will have any consequences for small businesses that rely on imports, such as job losses. Marlow said that 97 percent of importers are small business and asked Brady whether the tax would make it harder for small businesses to conduct business. Brady said that foreign products receive a lot of special tax breaks, and “competition is best for consumers when everyone is taxed the same.”, Brady also advocated for a “fairer, simpler tax code” and said Americans will soon be able to file taxes with less paperwork. “The tax code will be so fair and so simple, nine out of 10 Americans will be able to file on a postcard-style system,” Brady said. Marlow brought up the topic of media bias — which, as the editor-in-chief of Breitbart News, was his “favorite topic.” He asked Brady what he thought of the current “media environment” surrounding the issue of taxation. “It’s a challenge, ” Brady said. Marlow also highlighted how taxation can be viewed as a moral issue, citing “the confiscation of wealth from the American people,” and asked Brady whether the issue of taxation should be considered through a “moral lens.”, Brady replied that it should be, citing the “work, innovation, and value” American workers bring to the economy. Marlow closed the interview by asking Brady what would happen to the death tax in the future. “For the first time since the death tax was created in 1916, House Republicans propose to permanently kill the death tax,” Brady said.\n",
      "Last year, I interviewed Yale history professor Timothy Snyder about his book, Black Earth: The Holocaust as History and Warning, which argues that the reason so many more Jews were murdered outside Germany than inside it was that they were stateless.[Crucially, Black Earth points out that in the countries previously occupied by the Soviet Union — which wiped out their prior state institutions — Nazi occupiers were far more ruthless and efficient at killing Jews than in Germany itself. advertisement, I intended to finish reading the book and publish a review far sooner, but events — the presidential campaign, my own book — intervened. And in the interim, a new Nazi analogy crept into American political dialogue, one that made Snyder’s book all the more relevant — namely, the idea that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is some kind of throwback to Hitler and his Brownshirts, or at the very least is appealing to alt-right fascists through subtle antisemitic “dog whistles.”, I suspect that Snyder might be at least somewhat sympathetic to that view, though not convinced by it. The latter part of Black Earth — the “warning” — is that xenophobia (broadly defined) is poised to make a comeback, given the failure of states around the world. He is a man of the left: he gives credence to the most alarmist climate change estimates, for example, warning that we could see states disintegrate further under ecological pressure that destroys agriculture and sets vast populations in motion. But one of Snyder’s most valuable contributions in Black Earth is to remind us that Nazism was something much more than just antisemitism taken to an extreme. Hitler had a “zoological” view of the world, where the ideal state was one of constant racial strife, where only the strongest races would survive. Jews prevented that struggle, he believed, by introducing ideas of various kinds, from Christianity to communism. In his imagination, the Soviet Union was just a giant Judeo-Bolshevik plot. That unique and bizarre worldview is what led Hitler to accelerate the murder of Jews even as Nazi armies retreated from the Soviet Union. If he could not defeat the Judeo-Bolshevik system through direct confrontation, by wiping out the Soviet Union and colonizing the Ukraine, then he would at least do so indirectly, by ridding the world of Jews and allowing the stronger eastern races to prevail. Hitler was not a German nationalist he was prepared to see Germany defeated, to destroy the Jews. There is nothing even remotely comparable in American politics today. Trump’s nationalism is strongly state-centered — a point that conservative radio host Mark Levin brings up in attacking Trump. When Trump warns that we need to strengthen our borders, or else “we don’t have a country,” he shares Snyder’s concern for the collapse of states — though Snyder would likely see the small minority of extremists among Trump supporters as the kind of demons that state collapse would unleash. Snyder is at pains to point out that the prevailing narrative of the Holocaust, dominated by the German Jewish experience in which discrimination led to death, is actually atypical. Most Jews who were murdered lived in the east, where ordinary Germans who might have saved Jews at home readily murdered Jews in a lawless environment. The Nazis also found a new “political resource” in former Soviet collaborators eager to demonstrate their loyalty to the new occupiers by killing Jews. From the perspective of Jewish victims — and survivors — it mattered little whether their murderers were motivated by old-style antisemitism or more complex political motivations. But the statelessness created by Stalin was the necessary precursor to the Final Solution. Snyder told Breitbart News of similar potential for genocide today: in Syria, and its refugee crisis, the world risks repeating history, for example. The problem is that state-building has little support — from Trump, or anyone else. Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

      "NEW YORK – An internal Democratic Party memo allegedly hacked from Nancy Pelosi (D-CA)’s personal computer and posted by purported hacker Guccifer 2.0 seems to agree with Donald Trump’s sentiments that the policies of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama helped to create the Islamic State.[“In short: Our invasion created the atmosphere for a Jordanian to start a Muslim sectarian war, which ultimately created ISIS,” states an October 2, 2014 memo from Mike Ryan, policy director for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC). advertisement, The memo, titled, “ISIS Backgrounder,” was clearly attempting to first blame the creation of the Islamic State on the Bush administration’s invasion of Iraq in 2003, a war supported by Clinton. IS did not exist as an organization until about June 2014. However, the memo details the situation “worsened after U.S. troops left Iraq, helping quickly deteriorate the situation further.” Unmentioned is that the bulk of the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq took place under the Obama administration and was completed by December 2011. The memo further relates IS is armed with U.S.-made weapons seized from Iraq troops. The weapons seizures took place largely after the U.S. withdrawal from Iraq. Regarding the “creation” of IS, the memo states:, “When the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003 we triggered a massive insurgency against our presence,” the memo stated. “Around this time, a Jordanian ex-convict named Zarqawi travelled to Iraq with one goal: to establish a religious state just for Sunni Muslims.”, “…Zarqawi was killed by American forces in 2006. His successors now lead the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS).”, The memo further outlines the origins of some of the terrorist group’s weapons:, ISIS owns hundreds of millions of dollars of sophisticated weapons, including vehicles and GPS-equipped weapons. Many of these are American-made and were captured from Iraqi troops. The memo depicts IS as the “most extreme and powerful Sunni jihadist group worldwide and has rapidly taken control of large parts of Iraq and Syria.”, The descriptions are a far cry from Obama’s classification of IS as “a jayvee team” in a New Yorker interview released January, 2014. The October 2014 memo details the number of fighters IS was thought to possess at the time:, Fighters: 20,000-31,500 fighters, and as many as 15,000 of them are believed to be foreign recruits. Those 15,000 come from 80 different countries. Reports indicate that approximately 100 are from the United States. Earlier this month, Trump sought to spotlight the role the Obama administration’s policies played in leading to the deteriorating Middle East security situation that aided in IS’s rise to power. “ISIS is honoring President Obama,” Trump said at an August 10 rally in Broward County. “He is the founder of ISIS. He is the founder of ISIS, okay? He is the founder. He founded ISIS. And I would say the cofounder would be crooked Hillary Clinton.”, During a radio interview with Hugh Hewitt, Trump clarified his remarks about Obama founding IS: “He was the founder. His, the way he got out of Iraq was that that was the founding of ISIS, okay?”, In a follow up tweet, Trump indicated his comments about Obama founding IS were sarcastic, seemingly explaining that he didn’t mean the president actually founded IS but was referring to Obama’s policies.

      "The Berkeley College Republicans and the Young America’s Foundation have filed a lawsuit against members of the University of California system for their role in restricting an upcoming speaking event featuring Ann Coulter.[Our lawsuit agst Berkeley filed moments ago. @thomasfullerNYT at failing NYT won't understand it. Read it yourself https://t.co/I9fvYdDwBU, — Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) April 24, 2017, , advertisement, The suit alleges that administrators unlawfully violated the student’s rights to free expression on campus by placing unusual restrictions on events that the Berkeley College Republicans organized. An event featuring renowned conservative commentator David Horowitz was canceled after the university forced students to hold the event at 3 PM when most students are in class, at a venue far from the center of campus. According to the suit, Berkeley is accused of engaging in a discriminatory practice of applying unusual time and venue restrictions on events planned by the UCB College Republicans. These restrictions have led to the cancellation of two events in the month of April 2017. Defendants engage in a pattern and practice of enforcing a recently adopted, unwritten and unpublished policy that vests in University officials the unfettered discretion to unreasonably restrict the time, place, and manner of any campus event involving “high-profile speakers” – a term that is wholly undefined, and that has enabled Defendants to apply this policy in a discriminatory fashion, resulting in the marginalization of the expression of conservative viewpoints on campus by any notable conservative speaker. Defendants freely admit that they have permitted the demands of a faceless, rabid, off-campus mob to dictate what speech is permitted at the center of campus during prime time, and which speech may be marginalized, burdened, and regulated out of its very existence by this unlawful heckler’s veto. The suit condemns the University of California system for failing to provide an academic environment that promotes free debate and the free exchange of ideas, which students were promised at the time of their enrollment. Though UC Berkeley promises its students an environment that promotes free debate and the free exchange of ideas, it had breached this promise through the repressive actions of University administrators and campus police, who have systematically and intentionally suppressed constitutionally-protected expression by Plaintiffs (and the many UC Berkeley students whose political viewpoints align with Plaintiffs), simply because that expression may anger or offend students, UC Berkeley administators, and/or community members who do not share Plaintiffs’ viewpoints.

      "The grim findings of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom in its 2016 report suggest that religious liberty continues to take a beating throughout the world, and persecution against believers is not waning but intensifying.[The Commission released its new report on Monday, together with its updated lists of countries of particular concern (CPC) and recommendations to the U.S. government. advertisement, “By any measure,” the report states, “religious freedom abroad has been under serious and sustained assault since the release of our commission’s last Annual Report in 2015.” In its sober evaluation of the situation of religious freedom in the world, the report mirrors the 2016 World Watch List published earlier this year by Open Doors, an organization founded in 1955 to assist persecuted Christians. The brutal, worldwide persecution of Christians during the past year makes 2015 “the most violent and sustained attack on Christian faith in modern history,” according to this watchdog organization that has been monitoring Christian persecution for decades. The USCIRF report notes that the incarceration of prisoners of conscience, including those jailed for their religious beliefs, remains “astonishingly widespread.”, Among the worst offenders in this regard, the USCIRF once again draws attention to Pakistan, where more people are on death row or serving life sentences for blasphemy “than in any other country in the world.”, Aggressive enforcement of Pakistan’s severe blasphemy laws “emboldens the Pakistani Taliban and individual vigilantes,” the report states, “triggering horrific violence against religious communities and individuals perceived as transgressors, most recently Christians and Muslim bystanders on Easter Sunday 2016 in Lahore.”, In fact, the Easter-Day massacre targeting Christians in Lahore saw the death of 72 victims, mostly women and children, along with at least 320 injured. Islamist suicide bomber Yousuf Farid blew himself up in a large park, where hundreds of families had gathered to celebrate the feast of Easter. Among the victims were more than 30 small children, who at the time of the blast were playing sports and outdoor games. In Pakistan, religious minorities “experience chronic sectarian and religiously-motivated violence from both terrorist organizations and individuals within society.” This environment of persecution is exacerbated by the government’s “failure to provide adequate protection for likely targets of such violence or prosecute perpetrators” which has “created a deep-rooted climate of impunity.”, Despite the egregious violations of religious freedom in Pakistan that regularly make headline news, the U.S. State Department has remarkably refused to add Pakistan to its lists of Countries of Particular Concern, an error that the USCIRF once again endeavors to remedy as it has done every year since 2002. In its report, in fact, the USCIRF urges the U.S. government to add eight countries to its current list, namely, Central African Republic, Egypt, Iraq, Nigeria, Pakistan, Syria, Tajikistan, and Vietnam. The USCIRF also designated Western Europe as a “focus of concern” because of religious freedom issues in this region, including a worrisome increase in anti-Semitism. “Despite the increasing police protection in places where European Jews congregate, the rise in anti-Semitism has produced an exponential rise in Jewish emigration from Europe,” the report states, “with immigration to Israel from France increasing from less than 2,000 in 2012 to nearly 8,000 last year alone.”, The report also devotes ample space to the “genocidal” crimes of the Islamic State, which have religion as their primary motivation. “ISIL’s summary executions, rape, sexual enslavement, abduction of children, destruction of houses of worship, and forced conversions all are part of what our commission has seen as a genocidal effort to erase their presence from these countries,” it notes. “Adding disproportionately to the ranks of the displaced were millions from Iraq and Syria, including Yazidis, Christians, Shi’a Muslims, and Sunni Muslims who do not subscribe to the barbaric interpretation of Islam of the terrorist group ISIL,” it added. The commissioners urge the U.S. government to pay closer attention to the matter of religious freedom worldwide, and to use the means at its disposable to push for effective guarantees of this fundamental right. “The United States and other countries must fully accord this right the respect it deserves and redouble their efforts to defend this pivotal liberty worldwide,” the report states. As an independent, bipartisan U.S. federal government advisory body, the USCIRF is uniquely positioned to offer counsel to the President and the State Department, although its advice often goes unheeded.

      "Irish journalist Hermann Kelly, who is the communications director for the EFDD Euroskeptic group in the European Parliament, spoke with Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM on Tuesday about the morning’s horrific terror attacks in Belgium.[“People here are absolutely appalled by the loss of life,” Kelly said from the European Parliament in Brussels. “This horrific act of terrorism sadly shows that Schengen free movement, and lax border control across the EU, now presents itself as a huge threat to our security. David Cameron said we must stay in the EU for our security. Well, I’m sitting here in the middle of the European Parliament. A bomb has just gone off half a mile away. People have been killed. And believe me, it doesn’t feel too safe here today.”, advertisement, “It’s incredible… the head of Europol — which is like the European police, the federal service — said there’s 5,000 jihadists at large in the European Union, having slipped in from Syria,” he continued. Kelly marveled that there were some “94 returned jihadists from Syria” living in the same small area that gave Paris massacre mastermind Salah Abdeslam refuge until just a few days ago. “For me, it’s just incredible that these people are allowed to come back… murder people in Syria and come back, and live, and walk around as if nothing happened… in the center of Brussels, which is supposed to be the center of the European Union,” he declared. “This whole thing of free movement across borders, in the European movement, allows these fighters to travel wherever they will. It allows them to move their guns, and their explosives, as they like. And we see, now, the consequences of this ridiculous, this stupid, this just incredibly stupid policy of the European Union. Free movement means free movement for fighters, for guns, for explosives, and they can go and carry out their atrocities at will.”, Kelly found the argument, advanced by such European Union proponents as British Prime Minister David Cameron, that keeping Britain inside the EU will enhance its security to be “so ridiculous, it’s beyond belief.”, “We’re all stuck inside a building, we can’t go out, bombs went off half a mile away,” he said of the atmosphere inside the European Parliament complex. “And these people — because of EU policy, Schengen, open borders — these people can, with their fighters, their guns their explosives, go all across Europe at will, and basically shoot up and bomb people as they like.”, He said terror attacks so close to the European Parliament were “not only barbaric, but it’s also a symbolic act, which blows this whole security argument out of the water.”, Kelly described the lockdown across Brussels after the morning terror attacks as similar to conditions in Paris following the jihadi massacre there, adding that enhanced security with military personnel has been in evidence around European Union offices in the city since the Christmas holiday lockdown – conditions that host Stephen K. Bannon recalled other visitors to Brussels describing as “tantamount to martial law.”, Kelly expected Brussels to remain on a high state of alert for some time to come. Staff and journalists at the European Parliament were strongly advised to remain indoors throughout the morning, pending further notice from security officials. He thought improvements in the security situation were unlikely unless the authorities got serious about dealing with the dangerous elements infesting certain Belgian neighborhoods, through such actions as rounding up the known veterans of Syrian jihad immediately. “How can they be allowed to just swan around and act as they like? It’s just incredible,” said Kelly. Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00AM to 9:00AM EST. You can listen to the full interview with Hermann Kelly below:, \n",
      "Hillary Clinton continued her West Coast fundraising trip Tuesday afternoon at the Los Angeles home of pop star Justin Timberlake and his wife, actress Jessica Biel, where the Democratic presidential candidate sat for lunch with A-list celebrities and Hollywood power players.[The $33,400 per-person luncheon featured such notable guests as Jennifer Aniston, Tobey Maguire, Jamie Foxx, Katie Holmes, TV powerhouse Shonda Rhimes, ICM Partners chief Chris Silbermann and Justin Bieber manager Scooter Braun, according to Variety. advertisement, Actor Leonardo DiCaprio had originally planned to host Clinton on Tuesday at his Los Angeles home, but said a scheduling conflict with his latest film had necessitated his presence in New York.

      "PARIS (AFP) – Europe’s migrant crisis and devastating terror attacks will combine with the plunging oil price and China’s economic slowdown to give the elite of the political and business worlds plenty to talk about when they gather in Davos from Tuesday.[Over 40 heads of state and government will join chief executives, NGO leaders and Hollywood stars as they converge on a Swiss ski resort — transformed into a highly secure fortress for the occasion — for their annual attempt to try to plot a way through the world’s complexities. advertisement, Vice President Joe Biden leads a heavyweight US delegation that also includes Secretary of State John Kerry and Defense Secretary Ashton Carter. They will rub shoulders with far-left Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, who will lock horns once again with German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble in what promises to be an animated debate. Argentina’s President Mauricio Macri makes his first appearance at Davos since his election in November and will lay out his case for economic reform in a country with a turbulent recent past. Afghanistan’s President Ashraf Ghani will seek understanding for his country’s ongoing unrest and Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari will face questions about his handling of the Boko Haram insurgency in Africa’s most populous country. Pressing the flesh with the invitees will be Oscar contender Leonardo DiCaprio, a long-time environmental campaigner, who will no doubt take the opportunity to remind the world leaders present to keep the commitments on climate warming they agreed in Paris in December. With migrants apparently undeterred by the winter cold in their bid to reach Europe as they flee war in Syria and other countries, their plight is featured heavily in the meeting. The deaths of dozens of people in an attack on a hotel in Burkina Faso on Friday was a reminder of the fear sown around the world in the past 12 months, and the conference organised by the World Economic Forum (WEF) is sure to mull over the economic and social effect of such outrages. – Strange bedfellows –, Davos always throws up unusual meetings — for example, will the Iranian foreign minister speak to his Saudi counterpart even though their countries are currently at each other’s throats?, The theme of the meeting is the “Fourth Industrial Revolution”, which WEF founder and chairman Klaus Schwab describes as the “fusion of technologies across the physical, digital and biological worlds which is creating entirely new capabilities and dramatic impacts on political, social and economic systems”. Despite the optimism about the future, it will be the collapse of the oil price, China’s economic growing pains and the stuttering global economy that occupies much of the participants’ thinking, especially the impact of such factors on emerging economies, who will be represented by South African leader Jacob Zuma.\n",
      "VANDALIA, Ohio (AP) — Republican presidential candidates Marco Rubio and John Kasich suggested Saturday they may not support Donald Trump if he becomes the GOP nominee, as violence at the front-runner’s rallies deepened the party’s chaotic chasm.[Tensions ran high at Trump’s latest rally, when U.S. Secret Service agents briefly formed a protective ring around the presidential candidate, then left the stage and allowed him to continue speaking at an airport hangar outside Dayton, Ohio. advertisement, Trump’s campaign said the agents rushed the stage after a man attempted to breach the security buffer. The man was “removed rapidly and professionally,” spokeswoman Hope Hicks said. A defiant Trump has denied that he has encouraged violence at his events. But the scenes from his aborted rally in Chicago on Friday night appeared to be a final straw for some rivals who had pledged, despite deep concerns about his qualifications, to support the billionaire businessman if he were to become the nominee. Rubio said it was “getting harder every day” to keep his word. Kasich said the “toxic environment” Trump is creating “makes it very, extremely difficult” to support him. “To see Americans slugging themselves at a political rally deeply disturbed me,” Kasich said while campaigning in Cincinnati. “We’re better than that.”, The extraordinary shift by the two came just a few days before Tuesday’s elections in five delegate-rich states, including their home states of Florida and Ohio. President Barack Obama, speaking at a Democratic fundraiser in Dallas, said those who aspire to lead the country “should be trying to bring us together and not turning us against one another.” He said leaders should also “speak out against violence”, “If they refuse to do that, they don’t deserve our support,” he said. Trump insisted he’d done nothing to exacerbate tensions, despite having previously encouraged his supporters to aggressively — and sometimes physically — stop protesters from interrupting his raucous rallies. Trump told CNN late Friday: “I don’t take responsibility. Nobody’s been hurt at our rallies.”, He did several interviews as cable networks broadcast footage of the skirmishes both inside and outside the Chicago arena where he had planned to speak. At the event near Dayton, the audience chanted Trump’s name as the Secret Service agents rushed the stage. Trump did not explain what had happened, but said: “Thank you for the warning. I was ready for ’em, but it’s much better if the cops do it, don’t we agree?”, Trump also had stops scheduled Saturday in Cleveland and Kansas City, Missouri. The brash billionaire’s unexpected political success has roiled the Republican Party. Most leaders expected his populist appeal would fade as voting contests began and largely avoided criticizing even his most extreme comments out of fear of alienating his supporters. But after 24 primary elections and caucuses, Trump remains the front-runner and leads his rivals in the all-important delegate count. GOP leaders are grasping for a last-ditch idea to stop Trump from claiming the nomination. They’ve talked about a contested convention and about whether to rally around a yet-to-be-determined third-party candidate. All are long shots at best and would probably rip the Republican Party apart. Rubio and Kasich must win their home state contests Tuesday to stay in the race. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, closest to Trump in the delegate count, has urged both to drop out so he can take on the front-runner in a head-to-head contest. Cruz said late Friday that Trump has created “an environment that encourages this sort of nasty discourse.”, “When the candidate urges supporters to engage in physical violence, to punch people in the face, the predictable consequence of that is that it escalates,” he said. The chaos in Chicago was sparked in part by Trump’s decision to cancel his rally after skirmishes broke out in the crowd that, unlike past Trump events, was packed with protesters — many of whom had organized ahead of time with the intent of keeping Trump from speaking. Many anti-Trump attendees had rushed onto the floor of the University of Illinois at Chicago Pavilion, jumping up and down with their arms up in the air after the event was called off. Some isolated confrontations took place afterward and police reported arresting five people. As Trump attempts to unify a fractured Republican Party before Tuesday’s slate of winner-take-all primary elections, the confrontations between his legion of loyal supporters and protesters who accuse him of stoking racial hatred have become increasingly contentious, underscoring concerns about the divisive nature of his candidacy. In a telephone interview after postponing his event in Chicago, Trump said he didn’t “want to see people hurt or worse” at the rally, telling MSNBC, “I think we did the right thing.”, But Chicago police said they had sufficient manpower on scene to handle the situation and did not recommended Trump cancel the rally. That decision was made “independently” by the campaign, said police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.\n",

      "The newly appointed Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt will welcome President Donald Trump to the massive EPA government building on Tuesday. The president will then sign an executive order that will start rolling back the Obama-era Clean Power Plan.[Trump’s executive order will be another major step for Pruitt’s effort to restore the EPA to its limited authorities. advertisement, “We’re going to roll it back, those things that were unlawful, we’re going to roll back those things that were an overreach, we’re going to roll back the steps taken by the previous administration,” Pruitt said in an interview with Breitbart News inside his office at the EPA federal building in Washington D.C. The enormous federal building is right across the street from the Old Post Office building, recently renovated into the Trump International Hotel. Trump’s entry in the building will likely trigger renewed sadness for some agency bureaucrats who were reportedly in tears after Trump won the election. In February, sources speaking to Inside EPA suggested that demoralized employees would be unlikely to attend an event with Trump and Pruitt, as they were deeply dissatisfied over the administration’s proposed changes the agency. Trump’s budget outline, released earlier this month, threatened to slash the department’s funding by 31 percent. The executive order will not only order a review of the Clean Power Plan but also change Obama-era executive orders on climate change and carbon emissions regulations, a dramatic change from Obama’s legacy that prioritized a regulatory agenda. But Pruitt feels energized by the president’s visit, kicking off a set of new priorities for the agency that he believes lost its way in the Obama years. As Trump’s EPA administrator, Prutt will also sign a series of rules and procedures during the president’s visit to reform the agency. Rescinding the Clean Power Plan, Pruitt explained was “a snapshot of the future” of how the Trump administration would approach regulatory reform. Under the Obama administration, Pruitt said that the oil, coal, and natural gas industries were under federal “regulatory assault,” which killed energy jobs around the country. “I think the greatest impediment we’ve had on economic growth is regulatory uncertainty,” he said. Trump, he explained, understood that the regulatory process had become so tangled that it was difficult for companies to invest and grow. Pruitt’s philosophy is an example of the Trump administration’s goal to dismantle the federal government’s overbearing bureaucracy, for the sake of boosting economic growth. “We have situations here, and this is not just unique to the EPA, it’s other agencies at the federal level as well that do permitting, where it takes eight or nine years to get a permit to do something,” he said. “Well that’s not a decision, that’s obstructionism.”, Pruitt explained that he wanted to restore confidence among businesses and workers in the energy industry, particularly in coal, natural gas, and oil. “Agencies at the federal level are part of the executive branch, they exist to enforce the law, not make the law,” he said. Pruitt describes his philosophy as “EPA originalism.” Part of his goal, he said, was to re-focus the agency toward Congress’s original authorities. That’s sending a different message to the industries regulated by the EPA. “I can just tell you there’s buoyancy, buoyancy across the country that there’s a different attitude, a different belief, a different view,” Pruitt said. “We can be both pro-growth and pro-environment, we’ve done it as a country throughout our existence.”, Some of the rules passed by the Obama administration, Pruitt said, actually hurt the agency as they that were “untethered” to the legal statutes, often at the behest of well funded environmental groups that donated to Democrats. Some of those efforts were halted in court, creating more uncertainty about the agency’s authority. “When you look at the outcome of that kind of agenda, it was detrimental,” he said. As the Attorney General of Oklahoma, Pruitt led the legal charge against the EPA, arguing that the agency was overstepping it’s authorities. He sued the agency 13 different times, putting many of the Obama-era rules in legal deadlock. Pruitt also has a reputation of challenging environmentalist priorities like climate change, but his critics told Breitbart News columnist James Delingpole that repealing the EPA’s Endangerment Finding on CO2 emissions were not included in the Trump’s executive order. Pruitt confirmed to Breitbart News that the executive order would not repeal the EPA’s Endangerment finding, but he appeared open to addressing it in the future. “I think that if there are petitions for reconsideration for the endangering findings, we’ll have to address those at some point,” he said. “I don’t know if they’ve actually been filed in that regard, but our objective, and our role is to do what the law requires.”, Pruitt believes that the agency should return its focus to tackling big environmental cleanup projects. Part of restoring the EPA’s original mission, he explained, was refocusing the agency on the 1300 hazardous “superfund sites” designated by the agency as priority areas for cleanup. “Many of those sites … on this national priority list have been on that list for 30-40 years, that doesn’t sound like a priority list to me,” he said. He cited the Port of Portland in the state of Oregon and the mining cleanup in Butte, Montana as two examples of designated “superfund” agencies that need renewed attention. “We need to get busy with some new ways to address those,” Pruitt said.\n",
      "A-list actors, big-shot business moguls and others with deep pockets in Los Angeles — anxious in the wake of seemingly endless terrorist attacks and rankled by a highly contentious presidential election — are increasingly building luxury end-of-the-world underground bunkers complete with all the amenities one might find in a high-end condominium.[The Hollywood Reporter‘s Ingrid Schmidt reports:, advertisement, “Given the increased frequency of terrorist bombings and mass shootings and an under-lying sense of havoc fed by divisive election politics, it’s no surprise that home security is going over the top and hitting luxurious new heights. Or, rather, new lows, as the average depth of a new breed of safe haven that occupies thousands of square feet is 10 feet under or more. Those who can afford to pull out all the stops for so-called self-preservation are doing so — in a fashion that goes way beyond the submerged corrugated metal units adopted by reality show “preppers” — to prepare for anything from nuclear bombings to drastic climate-change events. Gary Lynch, GM at Rising S Bunkers, a Texas-based company that specializes in underground bunkers and services scores of Los Angeles residences, says that sales at the most upscale end of the market — mainly to actors, pro athletes and politicians (who require signed NDAs) — have increased 700 percent this year compared with 2015, and overall sales have risen 150 percent. “Any time there is a turbulent political landscape, we see a spike in our sales. Given this election is as turbulent as it is, we are gearing up for an even bigger spike,” says marketing director Brad Roberson of sales of bunkers that start at $39,000 and can run $8.35 million or more (FYI, a 12-stall horse shelter is $98,500). Adds Mike Peters, owner of Utah-based Ultimate Bunker, which builds high-end versions in California, Texas and Minnesota: “People are going for luxury [to] live underground because they see the future is going to be rough. Everyone I’ve talked to thinks we are doomed, no matter who is elected.” Robert Vicino, founder of Del Mar, Calif.-based Vivos, which constructs upscale community bunkers in Indiana (he believes coastal flooding scenarios preclude bunkers being safely built west of the Rockies), says, “Bill Gates has huge shelters under every one of his homes, in Rancho Santa Fe and Washington. His head of security visited with us a couple years ago, and for these multibillionaires, a few million is nothing. It’s really just the newest form of insurance.”, …, Read the full story at the Hollywood Reporter. \n",
      "ExxonMobil executive Rex Tillerson is rumored to be President-elect Donald Trump’s Secretary of State, but who is the man who could be the United States’ representative around the world?[In a Fox News Sunday interview with Chris Wallace, Trump said of Tillerson, “He’s a world class player.”, advertisement, Tillerson joined Exxon in 1975 as a production engineer, his first job out of school according to the Washington Post. As of this April, he held $218 million in Exxon stock and a $69.5 million pension plan. In 1995, Tillerson was elevated to the position of President of Exxon Yemen Inc. ExxonMobil stated that in his roles with the company from 1992 to 1999, “he was responsible for Exxon’s holdings in Russia and the Caspian Sea as well as the Sakhalin I consortium operations offshore Sakhalin Island, Russia.”, He ascended to his current position of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of ExxonMobil on January 1, 2006. The Wall Street Journal reported that Tillerson shifted the company’s stance on climate change, “He embraced a carbon tax as the best potential policy solution and has said climate change is a global problem that warrants action.”, In 2011, the ExxonMobil CEO was involved in a deal on behalf of the company to develop oil fields in Iraqi Kurdistan according to Reuters. The deal was made in spite of conflicts with Iraqi law. Then, in 2013, Tillerson made his initial trip to Iraq. The report stated that the trip was made to “mend fences with the central government.”, That same year, Tillerson received the Order of Friendship from Russian President Vladimir Putin. Tillerson spoke disapprovingly of sanctions against Russia at a 2014 ExxonMobil shareholders meeting. NBC News reported that a deal between ExxonMobil and Russia, reportedly worth $500 billion, was defeated because of Obama Administration sanctions that came in response to Russia’s 2014 invasion of Crimea. As the company suffered dropping profits, stagnate stock prices, and a downgraded credit rating, it tightened its belt and borrowed money earlier this year. Tillerson even “took a well-publicized 18 percent pay cut – to $27.3 million,” according to the Post. Tillerson, 64, was already scheduled to retire in just a few short months: March 2017. Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates recommended Tillerson for the Secretary of State position according to sources cited by Politico. The report stated that Exxon is a client of both Rice and Gates. It was on their recommendation that Tillerson was brought in for an interview with Trump at Trump Tower. Tillerson is a native of Wichita Falls, Texas. He attended University of Texas at Austin where he completed a bachelor of science degree in civil engineering just before joining Exxon Company, U.S.A. When Sarah Palin took office as governor of Alaska she took a hard stance with oil companies. Palin had beat out prior governor Frank Murkowski after news broke of sweetheart deals for oil companies under his leadership and several of his negotiators were indicted. Fortune reported that Palin’s decision to not show up when Tillerson came to Juneau to meet with her early in her term shocked oil lobbyists. In the book Going Rogue, Palin wrote that Alaskans called Tillerson “T-Rex” as she described a particular hostility from ExxonMobil to moving away from relationships with the state’s previous administration. As for his campaign involvement, Tillerson made political campaign contributions of nearly $43,000 in 2011. Presidential candidate Mitt Romney and Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell were among those who received some of that money according to Fortune. In September 2012, Tillerson gave $50,000 to Romney Victory INC. In early 2015, he gave $5,000 to Jeb Bush’s super PAC Right to Rise USA. He has also been greatly involved with the Boy Scouts of America according to WSJ. His father was a local Boy Scouts administrator and Former Clinton Administration Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre, president of a Washington think tank on whose board Tillerson serves, said Tillerson was instrumental in changing the Boy Scouts policy in 2013 to allow gay youth to participate.

      "Rage Against the Machine guitarist and political activist Tom Morello will headline a nationwide concert tour to protest the Obama administration’s controversial Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) international trade deal.[Dubbed the “Rock Against the TPP” roadshow, the concerts are designed to “raise awareness of the dangers of the TPP and build opposition to the toxic deal that was negotiated in secret with hundreds of corporate advisors,” according to a press release. advertisement, “Working people everywhere have had enough,” Morello, who now performs with rap-rock supergroup Prophets of Rage, said in a statement. “The TPP is nothing short of a corporate takeover of our democracy.”, Morello will kick off the the roadshow with a July 23 performance at the Summit Music Hall in Denver, Colorado. Other artists expected to perform at the event include Anti-Flag, Downtown Boys, Jonny 5 and Brer Rabbit of Flobots and actress Evangeline Lilly. The Trans-Pacific Partnership is a trade agreement among twelve Pacific Rim countries, a major political initiative President Obama has called his “legacy trade deal.”, Criticism of the TPP has been wide-ranging, with the president’s own International Trade Commission concluding in its Congressionally-mandated study that the trade agreement will ultimately fail to grow the U.S. jobs market or expand America’s economy, and could damage the country’s manufacturing sector. “That’s why people are rising up to stop it,” Morello said. “Corporate lobbyists want to sneak TPP through Congress quietly that means it’s time for us to get loud.”, “This fight against the TPP is not about right and left, it’s about right and wrong,” Lilly, star of television drama Lost, said in a statement. “The more people learn about the TPP, the less they like it.”, “Whatever you’re passionate about, whether it’s human rights, Internet freedom, climate change or food safety, the TPP is a bad deal for humanity, and a threat to the future of democracy,” Lilly continued. “It’s our responsibility to sound the alarm, before it’s too late.”, Despite waning public support and consistent criticism, President Obama has vowed his support for, and the ultimate passage of, the TPP. During a trip to Vietnam in May, Obama maintained that the trade deal would ultimately be “good for America.”, “I remain confident we’re going to get it done,” Obama said. “It’s good for the country. It’s good for America. It’s good for the region. It’s good for the world.”, Morello’s Prophets of Rage recently announced a nationwide “Make America Rage Again” tour. The group has promised to “cause a ruckus” at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland later this summer.  , Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @jeromeehudson\n",
      "Speaking to the nation’s governors at the National Governors Association meeting at the White House on Tuesday, Barack Obama cracked a joke that implicitly referred to the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia’s death only days after Obama refused to attend the justice’s funeral.[Referring to his lame-duck status as president, Obama jested, “Some of you might be in the final year of your last term, working as hard as you can to get as much done as possible for the folks that you represent: fixing roads, educating our children, helping people retrain, appointing judges.” After a pause for effect, Obama delivered his punch line: “The usual stuff.”, advertisement, Some governors laughed. But conservatives reacted with fury to Obama’s implied reference to Scalia’s death as “the usual stuff.” Young Conservatives called Obama “The most classless president to ever grace the face of the planet.” The Conservative Tribune called the reference “a vicious joke.” RedStateWatcher titled its article, “Zero Respect: Obama Cracks Joke About Scalia’s Death.”, Obama’s ostensible excuse for eschewing an appearance at Scalia’s funeral, as the White House explained to the New York Times, was partially based on the “potential for the extensive presidential security detail to be disruptive.”, Obama didn’t miss a beat when it came to his golfing game, however, going golfing on Sunday. That was in line with his practice of preferring golfing to attending funerals when Polish president Lech Kaczynski was killed in a plane crash in 2010, Obama said he would attend the funeral but went golfing instead. Here’s a short list of funerals Obama has attended while president:, Sen. Ted Kennedy (D), Walter Cronkite, Dorothy Height, civil rights activist, Se. Robert Byrd (D), Sen. Daniel Inouye, Former Speaker of the House Tom Foley (D), Nelson Mandela, Beau Biden, Clementa Pinckney, Some of the funerals he has skipped:, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, Adolfo Suarez Gonzalez, president of Spain, Richard von Weizsäcker, president of Germany, Kim Young-sam, president of South Korea, Last April, at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, Obama offered this: “After the midterm elections, my advisors asked me, “Mr. President, do you have a bucket list?” And I said, “Well, I have something that rhymes with bucket list.’ Take executive action on immigration? Bucket. New climate regulations? Bucket. It’s the right thing to do.”, Apparently, joking about a man’s death which opens the path for a leftist-dominated Supreme Court is on Obama’s “bucket” list. After all, it’s the “right thing to do.”\n",
      "Over half of Americans say President Obama’s policies have made America less safe from domestic terrorism, and even more say they personally feel less safe than eight years ago, according to a Breitbart/Gravis national security poll conducted on September 20, 2016.[The poll, which surveyed 1,503 registered voters throughout the country, asked respondents, “Has President Obama made the U.S. safer or less safe from domestic terrorism?” 51 percent said they felt that President Obama had made the nation less safe. 30 percent said they believed President Obama had made the nation safer, while 15 percent said there had been no change in the general climate, and 5 percent said they were unsure. advertisement, , Asked, “Do you feel safer than or less safe than you did eight years ago from terrorism?”, 53 percent of respondents said that they felt less safe. 15 percent said they felt safer, 26 percent said they felt about the same, and 5 said they were unsure. , Along party lines, a whopping 79.1 percent of Republicans said they felt less safe than eight years ago, while only 34.9 percent of Democrats said the same. Independents were in between, with 48.5 percent saying they felt less safe. Most Democrats, 35.1 percent, said they felt neither more nor less safe than eight years ago. Hispanic Americans were significantly more likely than any other minority group to say they felt less safe than eight years ago, with 55.1 percent saying so. Only White Americans, at 62 percent, responded they felt less safe in higher numbers. Asian Americans were least likely to say they felt less safe than eight years ago, though zero percent said they felt safer – over 3/4 said they felt “no change.” African Americans were most evenly split: 23.4 percent said they felt less afe, 33.5 percent said they felt safer, and 31.5 said they felt “no change.”, Regarding President Obama’s performance specifically, Hispanic Americans were once again the most critical minority group, with 60 percent stating that they felt President Obama had made the nation less safe from domestic terrorism. African Americans were most forgiving, with only 8 percent responding that President Obama had made the nation less safe from domestic terrorism, and 63.9 percent saying the President had made the nation safer – more than double the number of Hispanic Americans who said the same. White Americans were only one percent more likely than Hispanic Americans to say President Obama had made the nation less safe. Controlling only for Hispanic ethnicity, Hispanic Americans were significantly more likely than non-Hispanics of any race to say that President Obama had made the nation less safe: 60 percent said his policies had made the nation more vulnerable to domestic terrorism, while 49.4 percent of non-Hispanics said the same. Women also appear more concerned that men with the success of the Obama administration in thwarting domestic terror attacks. 52.7 percent of women polled said the nation was less safe from this specific threat under President Obama more than ten percent fewer women said President Obama had made the nation safer. Only one out of eight women said they felt safer than they did eight years ago.\n",
      "PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania — Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) told supporters at the Democratic National Convention on Monday night that their “political revolution” had succeeded in forcing the party to reject the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a free trade deal that is opposed by organized labor (and has also been criticized by Republican Donald Trump as unfair).[The problem: Sanders mis-characterized the Democratic Party’s platform, which does not specifically oppose the TPP. advertisement, In his address to the convention, and to the nation, Sanders claimed: “Among many other strong provisions, the Democratic Party now … calls for strong opposition to job-killing free trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership.” The crowd cheered. But here is what the 2016 Democratic Party platform actually says about the TPP. Note that it lays out a series of guidelines that it says the TPP must follow, but does not conclude that the TPP actually violates them, or that it must be opposed:, While we believe that openness to the world economy is an important source of American leadership and dynamism, we will oppose trade agreements that do not support good American jobs, raise wages, and improve our national security. We believe any new trade agreements must include strong and enforceable labor and environmental standards in their core text with streamlined and effective enforcement mechanisms. Trade agreements should crack down on the unfair and illegal subsidies other countries grant their businesses at the expense of ours. It should promote innovation of and access to lifesaving medicines. And it should protect a free and open internet. We should never enter into a trade agreement that prevents our government, or other governments, from putting in place rules that protect the environment, food safety, or the health of American citizens or others around the world. These are the standards Democrats believe must be applied to all trade agreements, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Throughout the day on Monday, Sanders delegates protested against the TPP from the convention floor. They interrupted Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), for example, because he chaired the platform drafting committee and excluded opposition to TPP. , On Monday evening, on the convention floor, a union member from the Illinois delegation complained that union leaders had sold out the anti-TPP cause in the platform drafting process: “The people up there? I know a few of them. And they voted ‘no’ [on opposing the TPP]. The union people, the leaders, the international presidents. And that’s wrong. You know, they tell them: ‘We’re against the TPP!’ But then — but why — you’re afraid to put it in the platform? Why? What ‘s wrong with them?”, “If they had any balls at all, any backbone, anything … but to say it, to protect your ass, they make it look like there’s credibility.”, Joel B.

      "Despite record worldwide shipments of 403.1 million smartphones in the last quarter of 2015, Apple’s iPhone suffered its first year-end sales decline in history, according to the world’s leading tech advisory firm.[Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ: AAPL) sales of iPhones to customers dropped 4.4 percent to 71.5 million from the prior year’s 74.8 million. As a result, Samsung’s market share jumped from 19.9 percent in 2014 to 20.7 percent in 2015, while Apple’s share plunged from 20.4 percent to 17.4 percent, according to Gartner, Inc. (NYSE: IT). advertisement, Gartner’s numbers are far below the 74.77 million sales of iPhones that Apple, Inc. reported for the three months ending December 26. But Apple employs the controversial accounting policy of reporting shipments into dealer hands as “sales for accounting purposes.”, In the tech business this is sometimes referred to as “channel stuffing” and can seriously distort the true picture of customer demand. If iPhones go unsold on dealer shelves, they can be returned to Apple for a refund or serve as “stranded inventory” that clogs up reorders by dealers. If Gartner is correct, Apple’s suffered almost a 15 percent loss of market share compared to 2014, and sales of iPhones to customers dropped for the first time–in the typically booming last three months of a year. Breitbart News reported in July that “Wall Street’s Love Affair with Apple May Be Over.” With the stock trading within pennies of the all-time-record price of $132.54, it was clear that the “upgrade cycle for the newly released iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus was only about 20 percent, almost a third lower than previous cycles after two quarters.” We added, “It would appear that the Apple iOS ecosystem is being challenge.”, With 80 percent of Wall Street analysts calling the stock a buy, and an average target price of $165, such talk by Breitbart at the time was considered tech blasphemy. But the stock closed on Feb. 18 at $96.26, down 27 percent since Breitbart’s warning. Michael Blair at Seeking Alpha estimates that Apple added 2 million iPhones to “channel inventory” from July through September, and another 3.3 million iPhones to channel inventory during the holiday quarter from October through December. He believes the current iPhone “channel inventory” is about 21.8 million, up from 16.45 million in July. Apple has stated on conference calls that that its “plan” is to sell 4 million iPhones per week and carry five to seven weeks of inventory. But a 5.3 million increase in channel inventory indicates Apple has a significant shortfall in customer sales. That would more than justify Gartner’s call that iPhone customer sales and market share are shriveling. Channel stuffing has led to numerous corporate scandals in the tech world. The biggest recently was the shake-up at Toshiba Corporation, where legendary CEO Atsutoshi Nishida, and his successors Norio Sasaki and Hisao Tanaka, are alleged to have pushed division heads to achieve unrealistic sales and earnings targets, according to Reuters. To keep their jobs, Toshiba division leaders employed an array of questionable accounting tactics for at least seven years, according to an investigation by Japan’s Securities Exchange and Surveillance Commission. Toshiba is expected to soon admit it used channel stuffing as a tool for accounting fraud and erase years of profits by restating them as earnings losses.\n",
      "The Great Barrier Reef is dead. It has ceased to be, expired and gone to meet its maker, kicked the bucket, shuffled off its mortal coil, run down the curtain and gone to join the bleedin’ choir invisible. It is an Ex Great Barrier Reef.[Well, at least it is if you believe the left-wing media such as the Guardian, which claims today that the reef is at “terminal stage” because of damage allegedly caused by “climate change”. advertisement, Lots of eco loons have been rending their garments and throwing their (recyclable, organic, gluten-free) toys out of the pram in horror at this hideous disaster. I got to see the beauty of the #GreatBarrierReef, my children however won't get to. Australia, stop dragging your feet on #ClimateAction, — Gareth Olver (@GBO26) April 10, 2017, , But it’s OK. As I keep trying to explain here to anyone who’ll listen – and obviously, also, to annoy the greenies – is that the Great Barrier Reef isn’t in the remotest danger. Yes, it has experienced bleaching, but this is normal – especially in dramatic El Ninos like the one we’ve just had – and there is no reason to suspect that the GBR won’t recover. Nor is there any particular reason to blame man’s-selfishness-and-greed-and-refusal-to-amend-his-lifestyle for the temporary damage the reef has suffered. Even if we’d done as the greenies want and bombed our economies into the dark ages, replaced all cars with bicycles and retired to caves illuminated by tallow candles – even then, the GBR would be in exactly the same condition as it is now because El Ninos are a natural phenomenon not a man-made one. For chapter and verse on this I recommend this most excellent essay by ecologist Jim Steele, who puts the scaremongering in its proper scientific context. The problem is that the main man behind the scare – Professor Terry Hughes of an impressive-sounding organisation called the National Coral Bleaching Task Force – appears to have been more interested in generating headlines than pursuing the scientific method. His scary aerial shots of bleached Great Barrier Reef may look like damning evidence of the effects of climate change on the reef. But here’s the rub:, Aerial surveys, on which Hughes 2017 based their analyses, cannot discriminate between the various causes of bleaching. To determine the cause of coral mortality, careful examination of bleached coral by divers is required to distinguish whether bleached coral were the result of storms, crown-of-thorns attacks, disease, aerial exposure during low tides, or anomalously warmer ocean waters. Crown-of-thorns leave diagnostic gnawing marks, while storms produce anomalous rubble. Furthermore aerial surveys only measure the areal extent of bleaching, but cannot determine the depth to which most bleaching was restricted due to sea level fall. To distinguish bleaching and mortality caused by low tide exposure, divers must measure the extent of tissue mortality and compare it with changes in sea level. For example, the Indonesian researchers found the extent of dead coral tissue was mostly relegated to the upper 15 cm of coral, which correlated with the degree of increased aerial exposure by recent low tides. Unfortunately Hughes et al never carried out, or never reported, such critical measurements. And no, bleaching isn’t the same as dying. Not in the slightest. Hughes reported the various proportions of areal bleaching as degrees of severity. But that frightened many in the public who confused bleaching with mortality, leading some misguided souls to blog the GBR was dead.  However bleaching without mortality is not a worrisome event no matter how extensive. Rates of mortality and recovery are more important indices of reef health. As discussed in the article “The Coral Bleaching Debate: Is Bleaching the Legacy of a Marvelous Adaptation Mechanism or A Prelude to Extirpation?“, all coral retain greater densities of symbiotic algae (symbionts) in the winter but reduce that density in the summer, which often leads to minor seasonal bleaching episodes that are usually temporary. Under those circumstances coral typically return to normal within weeks or months. Furthermore by ejecting their current symbionts, coral can acquire new symbionts that can promote greater resilience to changing environmental conditions. Although symbiont shifting and shuffling promotes adaptation to shifting ocean temperatures, symbiont shuffling cannot protect against extreme low tide desiccation, and dead desiccated coral can no longer adapt. Humans have little control over El Niños or low tides. Why does anyone seriously imagine the Great Barrier Reef is dying? For the same reason some idiots seriously imagine that the polar bear is an endangered species. For the same reason these same pillocks think that there’s a man-made climate change problem. Because Greenies don’t do science. They do propaganda.\n",
      "The former president of the of the European Commission, the European Union’s (EU) unelected executive arm, has been recruited as the new boss of international operations at Goldman Sachs, who funded the official anti-Brexit campaign.[The American investment bank, which was accused of “serious misconduct” and agreed last month to pay out $5.06bn for its role in the 2008 financial crisis, is to hire José Manuel Barroso, the former Portuguese prime minister and most powerful man in the EU (pictured right, alongside current president Jean-Claude Juncker). advertisement, Mr. Barroso, who was president of the European Commission for 10 years until 2014 and presided over the Eurozone crisis, will help the Wall Street giant manage the so-called “fall out” from Brexit as well as other international uncertainties. His pay has not been disclosed. During his time as President of the Commission he persistently attacked Eurosceptics, including David Cameron when he announced that the British people would have a democratic say on their membership of the block. The bank has a long history of hiring EU bureaucrats. Mr. Barroso takes the job from Peter Sutherland, a former European Commissioner and ex-boss of the World Trade Organisation, who left last year. Mr. Sutherland’s anti-democratic and anti-Brexit rhetoric has been even more inflammatory. After the Brexit vote was announced, he called for it to be “overturned”.

Somehow this result must be overturned. — Peter Sutherland (@PDSutherlandUN) June 25, 2016, , In May, in the run-up to the referendum, figures released by the Electoral Commission revealed that Goldman Sachs had quietly donated £500,000 to Britain Stronger in Europe – the official, government back anti-Brexit campaign – shortly before February when donations had to be declared. Speaking to the Financial Times, Mr. Baroso said he would attempt to mitigate any negative effects of Brexit in his new role with the bank. “Of course I know well the EU, I also know relatively well the UK environment,” he said. “If my advice can be helpful in this circumstance I’m ready to contribute, of course”. He claimed that one of the most difficult areas of the Brexit negotiations would involve trade and access to the single market. “What I know for sure is that on both sides it will be intelligent and wise to have a fair negotiation,” he told the FT. “Nobody wins from a confrontation.”, While he was head of the European Commission, Mr. Barroso oversaw the banking crisis and the ensuing fallout that gripped the eurozone. “As president of the EC, I was leading an overall effort of regulation and supervision, including the creation of banking union in the euro area, to bring back stability, credibility to the financial sector,” Mr. Barroso added.\n",
      "A management-level supervisor of the Tucson Police Department reportedly refused to assist U.S. Border Patrol agents in a search for an escaped criminal alien who assaulted a federal agent. The official cited the “recent political climate.”[Border Patrol agents apprehended a Honduran national with a prior criminal history near the Nogales Station in southern Arizona on Friday. During the arrest, the Honduran violently assaulted the agent and attempted to flee the scene. The man was apprehended only after reaching a state of exhaustion, according to U.S. Border Patrol Agent Art Del Cueto, acting in his capacity as president of National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) Local 2544, and vice president of the NBPC national organization. advertisement, The criminal alien complained of not feeling well after the pursuit. Agents took the man to a hospital in Tucson for evaluation and treatment. During his medical treatment, the illegal alien managed to escape, Del Cueto stated during an interview Saturday morning. As agents began a search for the escapee, immigration protesters arrived on the scene. The protesters reportedly blocked a Border Patrol supervisor’s vehicle. The agents were forced to move to a Tucson Police Department (TPD) parking lot to set up an incident command center. At first, TPD officials cooperated with the search and use of their facility. “One of our agents informed me that a TPD ‘management-level supervisor’ advised the agents that his department could not continue with assisting the Border Patrol,” the local union president stated. “He said they were ‘busy with local issues.’”, De Cueto said the agents were then told, “Due to the recent political climate, the Tucson Police Department could no longer assist the Border Patrol.” The agents were then asked to pack up the incident command center and leave the property. Del Cueto noted this was not an immigration search, but rather, a search for a man with a prior criminal history “so desperate that he would assault a federal agent.”, “I can almost understand if they were too busy with local issues to assist in the search,” he explained. “But, there is no excuse for kicking our agents off the property and delaying our search efforts.”, “This man being on the loose is a danger to the community and any other law enforcement officer he might encounter,” Del Cueto told Breitbart Texas. He noted that TPD Chief Chris Magnus was not present at the time of the incident. Breitbart Texas reached out to the Tucson Police Department via phone and email for comment.

      "Oscar-winning director Steve McQueen has weighed in on the Academy Awards’ diversity controversy, saying in a recent interview that he hopes the film industry will look back at this year’s Oscars as a “watershed moment” for diversity in film.[In an interview with the Guardian, McQueen, the only black director ever to win Best Picture (in 2014 for 12 Years a Slave), said that the issue of diversity in the film business reminds him of the music business in the 1980s. advertisement, “Could you imagine now if MTV only showed music videos by a majority of white people, then after 11 o’clock it showed a majority of black people?” McQueen said. “Could you imagine that happening now? It’s the same situation happening in the movies.”, “Hopefully, when people look back at this in 20 years, it’ll be like seeing that David Bowie clip in 1983,” he added, referring to a clip of the rock star berating MTV for not featuring music videos from black artists that has made the rounds on social media since his death. “I don’t even want to wait 20 years. Forgive me I’m hoping in 12 months or so we can look back and say this was a watershed moment, and thank God we put that right.”, The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced a dramatic overhaul of its voting rules and organizational structure on Friday in an effort to defuse the renewed #OscarsSoWhite controversy, which has seen stars like Will and Jada Pinkett Smith and filmmakers Spike Lee and Michael Moore pledge to boycott the Oscars over its lack of diversity among acting nominees. While some critics like Lee and Selma director Ava DuVernay praised the Academy’s rule changes, others, including many longtime members of the Academy, loudly criticized what they called the organization’s “knee-jerk” reaction to a media firestorm. McQueen, for his part, believes the lack of diversity goes beyond the Academy Awards. “One could talk about percentages of certain people who are Academy members and the demographics and so forth, but the real issue is movies being made,” he told the Guardian. “Decisions being made by heads of studios, TV companies and cable companies about what is and is not being made. That is the start. That is the root of the problem.”, “I’m not interested in just talking,” he added. “This is an important issue. It’s an us issue. Again, this is not about black, not about white, this is about us, how we want to improve our environment and our society, and who we are. So, let’s get on with it. Let’s fix this. It’s ridiculous! There’s no real debate is there … really?”, McQueen was also asked what he would do if given the opportunity to be the head of a major Hollywood film studio. “Give people more opportunities to make interesting movies,” the director replied. “Fantastic movies.”\n",
      "NBA fans have heard some strong denunciations of President-elect Donald Trump from NBA coaches this week. Steve Kerr voiced concerns over his children’s reaction to Trump and Stan Van Gundy called Trump a “misogynist leader.” However, we hadn’t yet had anyone go biblical with his diatribe, until now.[Well, he almost went biblical. advertisement, “We are Rome,” said San Antonio Spurs Head Coach Gregg Popovich at the end of a fairly unhinged tirade. That tirade, captured by MySanAntonio.com, went on for several minutes and included insults to both Trump and his voters:, “The disgusting tenor and tone and all the comments [during Trump’s campaign] that have been xenophobic, homophobic, racist, misogynistic, and I live in a country where half the people ignored all that to elect someone. “That’s the scariest part of the whole thing to me. Got nothing to do with the environment, Obamacare and all the other stuff. We live in a country that ignored all those values that we would hold our kids accountable for. They’d be grounded for years if they acted and said the things that’s been said in that campaign by Donald Trump.”, Far from done, Popovich then called Trump a bully. He said that Trump “used that fearmongering and all the comments, from Day 1, the race-baiting, with trying to make Barack Obama, our first black president, illegitimate. It leaves me wondering where I’ve been living, and with whom I’m living and the fact that people can just gloss that over. … Now we see that he’s already backing off immigration, Obamacare and other things, so was it a big fake? Which makes you feel that’s even more disgusting and cynical. That somebody would use that, to get the base that fired up to get elected.”, Not sure where Popovich got the idea that Trump has walked back all of his campaign promises. The two provisions of Obamacare that Trump mentioned wanting to keep happen to be the most popular provisions of the law, and neither has anything to do with denying you the right to choose your own coverage or hiking premiums to some ridiculous degree. In fact, Republicans, at least twice, have offered alternatives to Obamacare that included those provisions. So, Trump has not come off his dime in any way. Popovich, however, has completely come undone. What’s different about Popovich’s rant, as opposed to Kerr’s and Van Gundy’s, is that instead of mostly confining his criticisms to Trump, “Pop” makes a point of going after Trump’s supporters. Probably not a great move, considering Popovich lives and works in a state that Trump won by nearly ten percent. Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter: @themightygwinn\n",
      "A student at James Madison Memorial High School in Madison, Wisconsin is seeking to change the name of the school, citing that President James Madison was a slave owner, a fact she says makes the school “unsafe” for black students.[Mya Berry, a senior, says the fact that President James Madison inherited slaves, along with his Montpelier plantation, from his father means her school – which, like the city of Madison, Wisconsin, is named after the fourth U.S. president – is hostile to black students, reports the Capital Times. advertisement, In a change.org petition, which currently has nearly 1,500 supporters, Berry states:, The significance of this name in association with my school has a negative effect on memorials black students. The lack of representation I feel in this school makes me feel more than unsafe. I do not feel supported by the majority of staff at memorial, especially considering the fact that I’ve gotten called n word multiple times, along with having an individual threaten me by telling me they would lynch me. Berry continues in her petition that when race is discussed at school, she is “told my perspective is just an opinion, and not anything valid to take into consideration.”, “With all the injustice I and others face in James Madison Memorial High School, do you truly think it’s appropriate to glorify a man that enslaved my ancestors?” she writes, adding that another reason to remove Madison’s name from the school is the “education disparity” between white and black students. Berry also told the Capital Times she has never reported incidents in which she was allegedly threatened because she did not feel comfortable doing so. She also said the incidents did not happen over the course of the current school year. “At the time, I didn’t feel safe. I didn’t know who to reach out to. Now that I’m a senior and I’ve become more comfortable speaking out, I’ve told more people about it,” she said. “I feel like faculty overhear injustice and they know it’s wrong. Some of them don’t speak up, and that adds to the unsafe environment.”, James Madison High principal Jay Affeldt said he was unaware of Berry’s issues. “I have met and will continue to meet with Ms. Berry and other student leaders to discuss how we can best move forward to have this dialog as a larger school community in a safe and healthy way,” he told the Capital Times. “Also, I do not believe the specific incidents mentioned in the petition were ever reported to school staff, and I am trying to learn more about these incidents from Ms. Berry.”, “It’s important to me that every student feels safe, and we take all reports of hurtful behavior very seriously,” he said.\n",
      "A Bureau of Land Management (BLM) internal working document that was leaked and reported on by the liberal Greenwire website spells out in detail President Donald Trump’s plan for making America great again.[It lists expanding production of domestic energy resources, supporting law enforcement,  the military, and enhancing border security. advertisement, “Several conservation and government watchdog groups say they’re concerned about the direction the Bureau of Land Management is headed after a draft list of agency priorities under the Trump administration surfaced this week,” Greenwire’s E&ampE News reported on Monday. “The draft five-point ‘BLM Priority Work’ list, first reported on yesterday by E&ampE News, calls for the agency to focus on increasing energy development in suitable areas of the 245 million acres BLM manages (Greenwire, April 10),” E&ampE reported. The document is divided into five sections — “Making America Safe through Energy Independence” “Making America Great Through Shared Conservation Stewardship” “Making America Safe – Restoring Our Sovereignty” “Getting America Back to Work” and “Serving the American Family.”, E&ampE gathered statements from environmental activists in response to the leaked document, which it said “calls on the agency to streamline federal coal, hardrock mining, and oil and gas ‘leasing and permitting processes.’”, “It also prioritizes streamlining unspecified ‘processes’ mandated by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), as well as ‘land use planning to support energy and minerals development and other priorities,’ including ‘rights-of-way processing for pipelines, transmission lines, and solar/wind projects,’” E&ampE reported. Under the “Make America Safe” headline, it calls for BLM taking action to “coordinate with the Department of Defense to ensure that public lands and resources are available to support the mission of our military” and to “prioritize clearance and approval process to support Southern Border actions.”, E&ampE illustrated its report with a photograph of the wall now in place along the U.S. border with Mexico, which Trump has vowed to expand. The document states that BLM will “provide employment opportunities for veterans and youth to work on public lands.”, But critics of Trump’s plans expressed horror after reviewing the document. “The Trump administration is prioritizing drilling, mining and the construction of an immoral and environmentally-destructive border wall over protecting America’s public lands and people’s health,” League of Conservation Voters Deputy Legislative Director Alex Taurel said in a statement given to E&ampE. “Our country’s public lands should be preserved for all people to enjoy and should not be handed over to corporate polluters,” Taurel added. “The priorities from Trump’s Bureau of Land Management make it clear that the administration is not planning to manage our parks and other special places for the use and enjoyment of the people, but rather for the profits of corporate polluters,” Athan Manuel, director of the Sierra Club’s public lands protection campaign, said in a statement provided to E&ampE. “America’s public lands are worth much more than what lies underneath,” Manuel said. “These are the places where families spend time together, where people and wildlife both can take refuge as they enjoy and explore our wild places.”, But E&ampE reported that a senior BLM official “defended the priority work list, telling E&ampE News this week that it is meant to help agency staff understand that the Trump administration will prioritize the agency’s full ‘multiple-use’ mission — including increased public access and recreation — and not concentrate solely on promoting fossil fuels or any other energy development.”, Under the “Serving the American Family,” BLM included in its goals expanding recreational, hunting and wildlife conservation opportunities, working with state and local law enforcement to improve public safety and streamlining grazing permits to help American ranchers and farmers.\n",
      "An employee of retail giant Target was arrested in Columbus, Ohio, after a 12-year-old boy reported that the employee was taking video of unsuspecting customers in the store’s restroom.[The arrest came after the boy’s mother called police in November to report that her son had seen someone’s hand, holding a cell phone, appear underneath his stall in the store, ABC noted. advertisement, Police reportedly reviewed store surveillance footage and found that Target employee Matthew Lively, 31, had entered the store’s restroom after the child went in and did not emerge until after the boy left. Police say that upon questioning, Lively not only confessed to recording the boy, but said that he had recorded other customers in the store restroom, as well. Police confiscated the employee’s phone and found recordings of others whom they are now attempting to identify. Columbus police officer Kelly Shay praised the boy for speaking up about what occurred. “It’s still important to talk to your children about inappropriate behavior and private body parts and when you’re in your bathroom or any restroom that is supposed to be a private space, it’s not for anyone to observe or certainly not take photos or film,” officer Shay said. “When someone is in danger or doing something that hurts another person, it’s important to tell because you’re not snitching you’re helping. You’re helping keep that from happening to the next person.”, So far, the Target employee is being charged with one second-degree felony count, but prosecutors expect more charges will follow. Lively was charged with one count of illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material or performance, a crime that carries a maximum eight-year prison sentence. The suspect was given a $150,000 bond in court on December 14. The arrest comes on the heels of months of falling stock prices as Target reaps the consequences of its corporate decision to allow transgender employees and customers to pick whichever restroom or changing room they want to use at any given time. Target Corp. released a statement about the Columbus incident:, At Target, our guests are at the center of everything we do and our commitment to creating a safe and secure shopping environment in our stores is unwavering. As a part [of] this commitment to safety, we have robust procedures, policies and trainings in place to ensure that our stores are safe places to shop and work. Target is fully cooperating with law enforcement in this case. As this is an active investigation, please contact local law enforcement with further questions. Regarding your question around employment at Target: I’m unable to share details on employment due to confidentiality.

      "MOST POPULAR[In a NPR exit interview with Steve Inskeep, President Barack Obama said in his post-White House life he plans to  develop “a whole new generation” of Democratic talent. advertisement, Partial transcript as follows:, INSKEEP: Were Democrats failing to do that at every level because your party has lost the majority of races at almost every level at this point?, OBAMA: Well, you know, I think that we haven’t done it as well as we need to. For example, we know that the Republicans, funded through organizations like the Koch brothers, have been very systematic at building from the ground up and communicating to state legislators and financing school board races and public utility commission races, and, you know, I am a proud Democrat, but I do think that we have a bias towards national issues and international issues, and as a consequence I think we’ve ceded too much territory. And I take some responsibility for that. You know, when I came into office, um, you know, we were just putting out fires. We were in a huge crisis situation. And so a lot of the organizing work that we did during the campaign, we started to see right away didn’t immediately translate to, wasn’t immediately transferable to, congressional candidates. And more work would have needed to be done to just build up that structure and, you know, one of the big suggestions that I have for Democrats as I leave, and something that, you know, I have some ideas about is, how do we do more of that ground up building?, INSKEEP: Do you intend to be involved or just give advice?, OBAMA: Well, I think it’s appropriate for me to give advice because I need some sleep. And I’ve promised Michelle a nice vacation. My girls are getting old enough now where I’m clinging to those very last moments before they are out of the house. INSKEEP: But there was a political organization that was built around you that still exists. OBAMA: Well, I’m less likely to get involved in all the nuts and bolts of electioneering. In that realm, I’m much more likely to just give advice. What I am interested in is just developing a whole new generation of talent. There are such incredible young people who not only worked on my campaign, but I’ve seen in advocacy groups. I’ve seen passionate about issues like climate change or conservation, criminal justice reform, you know, campaigns for a livable wage, or health insurance, and making sure that whatever resources, credibility, spotlight that I can bring to help them rise up. That’s something that I think I can do well, I think Michelle can do well. That’s part of what makes me optimistic about our future because I know those young people are out there ready to lead, and when they start moving into more and more positions of authority, then I think the issues that I care most deeply about are going to be well served. INSKEEP: You want to be a talent scout and build the bench that Democrats have admitted they don’t have. OBAMA: Well, not only a talent scout but I think also, you know, a coach, a friend, somebody who can build on the incredible work that has already been done by young people and that to a large degree was responsible for getting me elected.

      "Members of the Texas Farm Bureau (TFB) announced their support for Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to head up the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the Trump Administration.[President-Elect Donald Trump tapped Pruitt to be his EPA Secretary earlier this month, Breitbart News reported. advertisement, “We anticipate Scott Pruitt, as administrator, understands that common-sense policies are needed by EPA, not burdensome regulations that threaten the livelihood of those who work every day with natural resources,” TFB President Russell Boening of Poth said in a written statement obtained by Breitbart Texas. “We’re confident Scott Pruitt will steer EPA to end the aggressive and punitive approach to regulating that has unfortunately become the agency’s trademark in recent years.”, Boeing said that Pruitt intends to run the EPA “in a way that fosters both responsible protection of the environment and freedom for American businesses.” This would include our nation’s farmers who have been targeted with excessive water regulations by the current administration. The TFB president previously pointed out one area where the EPA’s overreach has had a negative impact on Texas Farmers, Breitbart Texas reported last week. At that time, Boeing called the EPA’s Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule one of the agency’s “worst ideas.” He hopes to work with the Trump Administration and Pruitt to limit regulations like this and the EPA’s continued overreach. The WOTUS rule interpreted the Clean Water Act (CWA) to apply to “almost any piece of land that gets wet and puddles,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a Breitbart News article published in August 2015. Previously, the CWA had been interpreted to only include “navigable waterways.”, Pruitt has repeatedly sued the EPA over its environmental overreach of regulations. “Respect for private property rights have allowed our nation to thrive, but with the recently finalized rule, farmers, ranchers, developers, industry and individual property owners will now be subject to the unpredictable, unsound and often Byzantine regulatory regime of the EPA,” Pruitt said in 2015. “Farmers and ranchers want a different philosophy at EPA. Mr. Pruitt is an individual who represents the real change at an agency that has been adversarial against family farmers and ranchers for too long,” Boening concluded.

      "LambdaConf, an annual gathering of programmers in Boulder, Colorado, has faced calls from social justice warriors to cancel a talk by Curtis Yarvin, the developer of the Urbit programming environment, due to his political views.[Yarvin, who wrote a series of political essays in the late 2000s under the pen-name “Mencius Moldbug” is credited as one of the pioneers of modern “Neoreactionary” thinking. His more controversial positions included detailed critiques of democracy, egalitarianism, and liberalism. advertisement, Anticipating the controversy, LambdaConf’s organisers made a pre-emptive decision that they would support Yarvin’s continued presence at the conference, on the grounds that they could not start deciding who attends a programming conference on the basis of their political views. Some attendees are amoral atheists, some are devoutly religious some are communists and others are staunch Democrats or Republicans. In fact, all the above are represented in this year’s lineup of speakers. I don’t want to overemphasize this, but even in our group of speakers, we have views that are diametrically opposed to one another, and which can make people feel very uncomfortable. If we can treat each other well, if we can behave as respectful professionals despite the many ways in which our belief systems clash with each other, then I believe there is hope. Following a feedback process from members of the programming community, LambdaConf went a step further, launching a new policy that prohibits the ban of speakers based solely on their political views. It’s a stark contrast to Strange Loop, another programming conference, which caved to SJW pressure and banned Yarvin last year. LambdaConf has, predictably, faced a backlash over their decision to defend political diversity. One attendee, who describes Yarvin’s political writing as “hateful,” is reconsidering attending the conference. Jon Sterling, program chair of PrlConf, accused Yarvin of being an “outspoken advocate for slavery” and publicly announced he would no longer attend LambdaConf. His announcement was signed with a five-pointed red star. In a Medium post, Yarvin rejected these accusations. “I am not an “outspoken advocate for slavery,” a racist, a sexist or a fascist. (On 4chan I’m sometimes known as “Moldberg,” and depicted with a photoshopped Jew-nose.) I am also not plotting any sort of world domination.” He added that he was there to talk about Urbit, his programming environment, not his political beliefs. Computer scientist Meredith L. Patterson, a veteran of gatherings like LambdaConf, said Urbit was an important tool that deserved to be discussed. “Urbit’s one of the few designs I’ve seen that addresses data validation at all layers of the stack. Heartbleed, the Android Master Key vulnerability, and Shellshock were all data validation bugs.”, “The industry’s picking these off one at a time, and we need to be killing entire bug classes. Full recognition before processing is the way to do that for data validation.”, Not all observers agree that Yarvin’s political beliefs deserve suppression either. Even those who disagree with Yarvin acknowledge his influence on political discourse. Sam Bowman, a British economist and Executive Director of the Adam  Smith Institute writes “I am not a neoreactionary, but sometimes I think Mencius Moldbug is the greatest living political thinker.”, You can follow Allum Bokhari on Twitter, add him on Facebook, and download Milo Alert! for Android to be kept up to date on his latest articles.\n",
      "Familiar political phrases including Brexit, snowflake, mic-drop, and Trumpism have been entered into the Collins English Dictionary as part of their annual acceptance of neologisms — or newly minted words and phrases.[Brexit took the position of the Collins Dictionary word of the year, noted not only for the remarkable frequency with which it is used, but also its flexibility. Britain’s Times newspaper reports it has been the most influential political word since the emergence of the Watergate scandal, which left all forms of political mishaps and embarrassments labelled with the ubiquitous suffix ‘-gate’. advertisement, A spokesman for the dictionary said the word was “inspiring a lot of wordplay around ending and separations”. As well as domestic plays like ‘Bremain’ and ‘Bremorse’, the phrase has also set the style for European freedom movements, with names like ‘Frexit’ for France and ‘Nexit’ for the Netherlands. The dictionary reports the first usage of Brexit was 2013, with a 3,400 per cent jump in usage just this year — meaning it has been a long road to acceptance by the dictionary establishment for the term. Enjoying a more direct trajectory is the phrase Trumpism, also accepted into the dictionary this year. Remarking on the inclusion, the spokesman said: “Trump is not the first politician to have had his name co-opted by language: ‘Thatcherism’ and ‘Reaganomics’, for example”. The Collins dictionary deletes thousands of old words no longer in common use, with familiar if archaic terms such as aerodrome (airport) and Charabanc (a kind of coach) relegated to obsolete status. Yet the concept of Trumpism may join them if his legacy does not endure, with the dictionary remarking: “The longevity of ‘Trumpism’ as a word may depend on his success in the forthcoming election.”, Other new arrivals include ‘snowflake generation’, pertaining to the hypersensitive, easily offended young people driving much of the West’s obsession with social justice and hate speech legislation, a Danish loan word meaning a cozy and happy environment — hygge — and mic-drop, as practiced by President Barrack Obama. The words join other neologisms in the Collins English Dictionary including, as reported in 2015, Manspreading, Transgender, and ‘Shaming’. While some of the words — such as contactless and dadbod — seem to be staying with us, others including ‘Corbynomics’ seem to have vanished as quickly as they were coined.\n",
      "The outcome of Secretary of State John Kerry’s meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin was a renewed push for a “political solution” in Syria, with a call to draft a new Syrian Constitution by August.[The UN Security Council passed a resolution with a similar target date for drafting a new constitution in December. advertisement, The BBC quotes U.N. envoy Staffan de Mistura describing talks in Geneva between opposition leaders and the regime of dictator Bashar Assad as productive, with “a lot of common ground between the two sides.”, On the subject of Assad, the BBC notes that Kerry “would not say” if his future had been discussed during four hours of talks with Putin. Kerry would say only that he and Putin “agreed on a target schedule for establishing a framework for a political transition and also a draft constitution, both of which we targeted by August.” Kerry did say that he and Putin agreed Assad “should do the right thing” and engage in peace talks. Kerry held a press conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who said Russia had agreed to join the United States in pressing the Syrian regime and its opponents to hold “direct talks” in Geneva – a step up from the informal discussions currently under way – and a move toward a “transitional governance structure.”, The New York Times judges that the “shape of any political transition to end the war remained vague” after Kerry’s marathon talks with Putin. “The main sticking point between the two countries has long been the role of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria in any political transition, and there was no indication that they had reached agreement on that,” adds the Times. Kerry repeatedly used the phrase “make the right decision” as code for Assad stepping down. “Russia will have to speak for itself about what it is going to choose to do in order to help Mr. Assad make the right decisions, but we agreed today that we will accelerate the effort to try to move the political process forward,” he said at one point during the press conference. “I believe that Russia is fully engaged in this effort and all of us are going to try to get President Assad to make the right decision over these next days to engage in a political process that results in a genuine transition and in peace in Syria,” Kerry repeated later. The NYT is brutally direct about the significance of Kerry’s mission to Moscow, noting that Russia has clearly been successful in using Syria as leverage to “force an end to the American policy of trying to isolate Moscow over the crisis in Ukraine.” With Kerry notching three visits to Russia and 18 meetings with Lavrov over the past year, that effort has “clearly succeeded.”, Reuters also notes the atmosphere between Kerry and Putin was “noticeably more amiable than past meetings, reflecting new diplomacy the two Cold War superpowers have championed in recent weeks.”, For his part, Putin was as gracious as a big winner with big plans can afford to be, declaring after his meeting with Kerry, “What we have been able to achieve on Syria has been possible only thanks to the position of the U.S. top political leadership, President Obama.”, “I very much hope that your visit will allow us to bring our positions closer on moving forward to solve the Syrian crisis and … on Ukraine,” Putin added.\n",
      "ANAHEIM — Over 100 women formed a new “Women in Business for Trump” coalition in a private meeting with the presumptive GOP nominee ahead of Donald Trump’s Anaheim rally on Wednesday.[The women in the room were clear: they reject the narrow frame of “reproductive rights” within which the left and mainstream media contain women’s reproductive issues. These women told Breitbart News that they want their candidate to champion the economy and small businesses create a job-friendly environment stop Obamacare and its damaging effects get government out of their businesses and their families’ health choices free up educational choices for their kids, like charter schools get Common Core out of the classroom secure America’s borders improve trade and stand up to the will of the biggest donors. advertisement, Several women from the crowd were called on to share the reason that they came to be a part of Women in Business for Trump. Actress, small business owner and avocado farmer Kimberlin Brown — familiar from television shows such as The Young and the Restless and The Bold and the Beautiful — said, “As a small business person we can’t afford any longer to provide health insurance.” She told the crowd that while her business used to provide it, that they no longer afford to do so. Brown also told the crowd how badly the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has “sold out Hollywood.” She continued, “how about ‘American lives matter’? NAFTA truly affected the entertainment industry.” Brown added that “the drug cartels are using the farming industry to smuggle drugs.”, Soon, Trump entered the room to enthusiastic applause. He told the women how much he appreciated their presence and their involvement in the Women In Business for Trump. He also spoke of the many women at his events. “I honor you and I respect you and I have such a great feeling and this is an amazing group of people. So I just want to thank you very much.”, Julie Collier, founder of Parents Advocate League, told Breitbart News that “A lot of moms are looking for solid school choice, and Hillary and Bernie have both said they don’t support charter schools.” She said she was looking forward to hearing more from Trump on education policy. “As an education reformer I would really like to hear more about his education stance than get rid of common core.”, Several other business women in industries from construction and tourism to movie production to real estate, finance and philanthropy joined the group and the day’s kickoff event. Maria DiGiovanni of the group MK COLLAB said that she brought several of the women along with her that are active in a broad spectrum of issues, including those facing law enforcement, business owners, and the healthcare industry, as well as PTSD and military issues. Michelle Van Etten said that she came out to the meeting from Florida and looks forward to returning home and recruiting more members of Women In Business for Trump in her state. California State Senate Republican Leader Jean Fuller told Breitbart News of her enthusiastic support for Trump, and that she was glad to participate in the Women In Business for Trump meeting.

      "National pro-life groups are heralding in a new administration led by Donald Trump as he is sworn in as the 45th President of the United States.[Susan B. Anthony List president Marjorie Dannenfelser said in a statement, “We are pleased to see pro-life President Donald Trump and Vice President Pence sworn in today and look forward to immediately working together to advance protections for unborn children and their mothers.”, advertisement, Dannenfelser continued:, Already, the difference between this administration and its predecessor could not be more clear. President Trump continually surrounds himself with key advisers and personnel who share his commitment to protecting the lives of the vulnerable, as well as pro-life taxpayers. We have been impressed by the skill and experience of the team he has put in place during the transition. Together, we will advance a culture of life by fulfilling the pro-life commitments made during the campaign. With pro-life President Trump and a pro-life Congress, we have an historic opportunity to advance policy that will save lives.”, Dannenfelser served as national chairwoman of Trump’s pro-life coalition. As a candidate for the presidency, Trump outlined four policy commitments in a letter to pro-life leaders:, “This is a day of hope for the pro-life movement, which has fought so tenaciously to protect unborn children and their mothers in every political climate,” Dannenfelser said. In a letter to supporters, March for Life Action president Tom McCluskey said, “Under the Obama Administration, our nation saw an unprecedented expansion of government abortion funding, and the prosecution of pro-life Americans – like the Little Sisters of the Poor and the staff at the March for Life – because of our pro-life beliefs.”, “I am hopeful about the incoming Administration,” he continued. “I am optimistic that in these next 100 days, and coming years, we can see a reversal of pro-abortion policies in our government. The new Congress presents the pro-life movement with many opportunities to pass pro-life legislation and advance a culture of life.”, The 44th annual March for Life will be held on Friday, January 27 on the national mall in Washington, D.C. Addressing the tens of thousands of participants expected will be President Trump’s counselor Kellyanne Conway, a longtime pro-life advocate. “We are thrilled to have Kellyanne Conway speak at this year’s March for Life,” Jeanne Mancini, March for Life president, said. “As the first female to run a successful presidential campaign and as a steadfast advocate for life and family issues, Kellyanne beautifully embodies the 2017 March for Life’s theme, ‘The Power of One.’”, “It is our hope that this year’s March for Life will encourage each of us to seek and fulfill our unique mission to the best of our ability because only in doing so we will collectively build a culture of life in the U.S. – a culture where abortion is unthinkable,” Mancini added. The March for Life is the world’s largest pro-life demonstration. It is held each year on or around the anniversary of the Supreme Court’s decision in Roe v.

      "UK Independence Party (UKIP) MP Douglas Carswell infiltrated the party to neutralise Nigel Farage, a new book from a former denier of the theory has claimed.[Carswell defected from the Conservatives in August 2014, claiming to be quitting his party in protest against David Cameron’s policies on a whole slate of issues, including European Union membership. advertisement, His motivations were almost immediately questioned by former UKIP staff members including the current Editor-in-Chief of Breitbart London, Raheem Kassam. At the time, Kassam accused Carswell and his close acquaintance Suzanne Evans of staging a “coup” against party leader Nigel Farage in May 2015. But the theory was broadly ridiculed by the establishment media including Huffington Post journalist Owen Bennett, who is the author of a new book which confirms Kassam’s theories all along. The “Brexit Club” book notes that Carswell’s move was part of a plot concocted with Tory Member of the European Parliament Daniel Hannan. They set out to fix what they termed the “Farage Paradox”, the Mail on Sunday has reported. The pair are said to have met at the Tate Britain art gallery on the banks of the Thames to hold secret meetings on the matter. “Angry, nativist Ukip risked being so toxic that if it ran the referendum it would do to the Eurosceptic cause what kryptonite did to Superman,” Carswell told Bennett, adding: “That could not be allowed to happen”. Hannan said: “Douglas felt he could hold his seat under pretty much any colours and prevent Ukip losing us the referendum with a negative campaign.”, Carswell’s defection was lauded as a “political bombshell” at the time, not least as he chose to invoke a by-election in his Clacton seat under his new party banner. At the time, he blamed a lack of seriousness on the European Union by Conservative Party leaders, among other policy matters: “The problem is that many of those at the top of the Conservative Party are simply not on our side. They aren’t serious about the change that Britain so desperately needs,” the Clacton MP told the BBC. He added: “Of course they talk the talk before elections. They say what they feel they must say to get our support… but on so many issues – on modernising our politics, on the recall of MPs, on controlling our borders on less government, on bank reform, on cutting public debt, on an EU referendum – they never actually make it happen.”, And he said only UKIP could “shake up that cosy little clique called Westminster”. His defection was welcomed by then UKIP leader Nigel Farage, who said: “What makes this even the more dramatic is that Douglas Carswell aims to test this with his constituency. “Douglas has joined a growing political force that is not a pressure group and is picking up support across the political spectrum.”, Today, Mr. Farage took a different tone:, As confirmed in @owenjbennett's book, @DouglasCarswell joined UKIP to split the party. pic.twitter.com/I3OcN1u1EV, — Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) October 2, 2016, , However, the pair soon fell out over the correct approach to take over immigration, and later backed different campaigns during the referendum on British membership of the EU, with Farage lending his weight to Leave.EU, while Carswell favoured the establishment Vote Leave campaign. In August of this year, more than 2,000 UKIP members signed a petition calling on Carswell to resign from the Party, accusing him of “destroying the party by divide and rule” and “fighting against almost everything UKIP stands for”. In the intervening period, Kassam set out to explain to Westminster establishment journalists that this was Mr. Carswell and Mr. Hannan’s plan all along. He was met by a chorus of derision, including from author Owen Bennett. Speaking today, Kassam said: “I’m still waiting for the apologies, but at least now everyone knows what a fraud Douglas is”.\n",
      "California Attorney General Xavier Becerra lashed out at House Speaker Paul Ryan in a new interview in which Becerra discussed Ryan’s defense of President Donald Trump’s interactions with former FBI Director James Comey.[Becerra labeled Ryan Trump’s “accomplice” in the AG’s interview with the Associated Press. He was referencing comments Ryan made in a Thursday news conference that occurred while former FBI Director James Comey was testifying before Congress on Capitol Hill. advertisement, By the end of Comey’s testimony he had admitted leaking information from privileged conversations with Trump to the media through a friend and that, while still serving as FBI Director, he told the President multiple times that Trump was not under FBI investigation for alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. In written comments for the hearing, Comey claimed that in a February 14 interaction with Trump, the President said to him, “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.”, Ryan was asked in the Thursday press conference about the interaction between the two men. The Speaker said of Trump, “The President’s new at this. He’s new to government. So, he probably wasn’t steeped in the long-running protocols that establish the relationships between DOJ, FBI and White Houses.” Pressed by a CNN reporter, Ryan added of Trump, “he is learning as he goes.”, Trump has denied ever having asked Comey to drop the investigation into now-former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. In the AP interview, California AG Becerra attacked Ryan’s tepid defense of Trump, “How dare you say it’s a novice mistake?”, Back in December, as Becerra awaited confirmation of his position as California’s next Attorney General, NBC News cited USC professor and director of the Tomás Rivera Policy Institute Robert Suro, who said that Becerra could become the new face of the Trump “resistance.” Suro added, “…that is a very popular idea in a lot of places, that California Democrats are going to be the vanguard of opposition to the Trump administration.”, UCLA Blue Print reporter Jim Newton called Becerra the point of the spear that is California when it comes to resisting Trump on immigration enforcement and climate change. Becerra claimed to the AP that he has tried to engage with the Trump administration on their plans for immigration enforcement, but has been unsuccessful. “I’m not trying to thwart ICE from doing its work, they’re doing some really important stuff and we’re doing some really important stuff with them,” Becerra claimed. He told the outlet that he was open to working with the administration on issues of sex trafficking and illegal drugs. California Democrats have been pushing hard and fast to pass a bill that would officially make California a “sanctuary state.” State officials have been among the most outspoken against the Trump Administration. Becerra left his seat in Congress last January to take up the position of California Attorney General that now-Senator Kamala Harris vacated. Democrat Harris won election to replace retiring Sen. Barbara Boxer. Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana \n",
      "Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) waded into California water politics on Saturday, suggesting at the California Republican Party convention in Burlingame that eating the three-inch Delta Smelt with “cheese and crackers” rather than allowing “out of control environmental policies” to kill California jobs, including those for Hispanic farm workers.[Cruz told a packed crowd at the lunch event:, advertisement, “Now I’m sure it will drive our friends in the media crazy when I observe that in my experience, three-inch fish go great with cheese and crackers. But as a result of those policies, 1.4 trillion gallons of fresh water could provide for over 6 million Californians for six years. Over 17,000 farm jobs have been lost. Migrant farm workers, Hispanic workers have been thrown out of work because of the misguided regulations.”, Water is a major issue in the Golden State, as a drought exacerbated by environmental policies has drained valuable river waters for the sake of the three-inch Delta Smelt. It is a particularly important issue in the Central Valley’s dozen or so congressional districts, where polls show Cruz with a wide lead over his rivals. “As Republicans in California, you are hearty bunch and you are used to adversity. You have seen first hand the absolute disaster, the absolute train wreck that is out of control liberalism,” Cruz told the enthusiastic California crowd. “You don’t have to look any further than out of control environmental policies that have resulted in, since 2008, 1.4 trillion gallons of fresh water being dumped into the Pacific Ocean because of a little three-inch bait fish.”, In an April 2015 video, California State Assemblywoman Shannon Grove (R-Bakersfield) detailed the pain inflicted on farmers in the Central Valley over the 1973 Endangered Species Act. Litigation under lhat legislation forced the waters of the Sacramento and San Jouquin Rivers out to sea in the name of protecting the three-inch Delta Smelt. According to Grove’s video, 1.2 million acre feet of water was flushed out to sea from those rivers in 2015 alone. “That’s enough water for three million households and enough water to irrigate 600,000 acres of farmland,” the video argued. Cruz suggested that there could rather be a win-win situation. “We can actually protect the environment and protect jobs. For example, with endangered species, the Endangered Species Act shouldn’t be used as a cudgel to kill economic development. Instead, it should have a provision for mitigation that if you increase the population of the endangered species then you can go forward with the development. “So for example, with the Delta Smelt, if you increase the population for fisheries, 20 percent, 30 percent, you ought to be able to go with sending that water on to farms and ranches and Californians who need it. That’s a win-win,” he told the conference. Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana \n",
      "On Thursday’s Breitbart News Daily, former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton said he was “delighted” to hear National Security Adviser Mike Flynn’s statement that Iran has been “put on notice” for its ballistic missile launches and other provocations.[“I think it’s the first time in eight years that anybody has really said to Iran what needs to be said,” Bolton told SiriusXM host Alex Marlow. , advertisement, “I think it demonstrates a couple of things: Number one, that the Obama administration’s nuclear deal, agreed to in the summer of 2015, is in deep trouble. I think that’s what being put officially ‘on notice’ means. Because this latest ballistic missile launch by the Iranians was a violation of the agreement, although the wording is weak and ambiguous, thanks to John Kerry, there’s no doubt this is unacceptable behavior by Iran,” he said. “It also sends the political signal to America’s allies, as well, that any notion that we will simply continue to accept this deal as written is something they need to dismiss,” he continued. “I think it’s the kind of straight-shooting that helps clarify the situation with friends and adversaries alike.”, “This deal was a strategic mistake when it was made. It’s not gotten any better with age,” Bolton said. “It’s better to be unambiguous when a mistake like this is made. Even though Iran has benefited from the deal – the release of sanctions, unfreezing of $150 billion of their assets – it’s just an example of how bad the deal was for the United States. Iran gets the goodies up front, and its obligations only came down the road.” , “But nonetheless, because I think they’re already in violation of the deal, and I think there’s evidence to show that, we need to get on with the business of looking and talking to Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel when he arrives in a couple of weeks and our friends in the Arab world who see the Iranian nuclear threat as a direct threat to them, not just a threat to us,” he advised. Marlow turned to President Trump’s executive order to temporarily suspend immigration from seven high-risk nations and asked if Bolton thought the rollout of this order has been “sub-optimal.”, “Well, sub-optimal is a very diplomatic way to put it,” Bolton told Marlow. “You have a future at the State Department if you want one at some point.”, “Thank you, sir,” Marlow said. “That’s not a compliment, actually,” Bolton said with a laugh. On a more serious note, he said things were left out of the executive order that he thinks should have been included, “for example, making it clear that green card holders were not subject to it.”, “Other exceptions were put in. This one was not,” he noted. “We all know the Trump administration wants to give refugee status to, like Iraqis, former interpreters who helped us out during the Iraq conflict. I think that added to the confusion and the publicity.”, “But honestly, this is going to be controversial even if those steps had been corrected. What I don’t understand is why the White House wasn’t more prepared for the fury of opposition that met it. It’s not like this wasn’t an issue during the campaign. It’s not like it wasn’t highlighted,” he said. , “Look, it’s a bump in the road. I’ve been through transitions coming in and going out through the government. The first couple of months at the White House always have rocky periods. The real consequence here is that they learn from it, and I’m comfortable that they will,” said Bolton. He agreed with Marlow’s suggestion that despite all the hysteria around the supposedly draconian executive order, it did not go far enough in certain ways. “It’s very limited, and I think, in fact, if people read the executive order, they’ll see that with respect to these seven nations that are affected by it, that the same seven nations that, as you said a moment ago, were tagged by the Obama administration to effectively be eliminated from the visa waiver program. So that was a step in the direction Trump took. Trump just went further,” he observed. , “But the key point was that these seven governments, for a variety of reasons, cannot supply the United States with adequate information about people claiming to be citizens of those countries who want visas to come into the United States. Let’s take a couple of examples: Somalia, Yemen, Libya, Syria. These are places where the government has just collapsed. It’s just collapsed. There is no effective government. We have no confidence that the information we’re getting is correct. Other governments like Iran, I wouldn’t trust as far as I could throw them anyway, even though they’re functioning in their territory,” Bolton said. , “The point is to give the secretary of Homeland Security time to figure out whether these problems will be corrected or whether other steps need to be taken. People complain we should have put Saudi Arabia on the list. Actually, we get a lot of information from Saudi Arabia about visa applicants that we can corroborate and check into. Is it perfect? Of course not, but the opponents of the executive order, I think to be fair, cannot have it both ways. It’s too broad, which is what most of them claim and simultaneously claim it’s not broad enough, which really is hypocritical,” he said. On the subject of Iran, Bolton described the threat it poses as “enormous,” amply justifying the Trump administration’s putting them “on notice.”, “This cruise missile story is definitely very troubling because of its implications,” he said, referring to Iran’s recent missile test. “It was reported that the test had failed, but here’s the significant fact: it failed at the reentry stage – that is to say, as the warhead part of the missile, the nose cone and what’s under it, was coming back into the atmosphere.”, “What is significant about that? When you launch weather and communications satellites, you don’t care what happens on re-entry, as long as the satellite is in orbit. What happens to the rest of the missile, it burns up in the atmosphere. You don’t care,” he explained. “The only reason you care about re-entry vehicles is when you’re delivering nuclear weapons because obviously, you can put the weapon into space, but if you can’t bring it down over the target, you’ve wasted a lot of effort. So the fact that Iran is at the point where it can launch ballistic missiles – and we know they’ve got medium-range ballistic missiles now.”, “That they’re testing ICBM kinds of missiles, capable of hitting the United States at a certain point, and they’re testing the re-entry capability, tells you exactly what this missile program is all about. So the argument that ballistic missiles aren’t intended for nuclear weapons is just another Iranian lie. That’s the only purpose of this program,” Bolton said.

      "The Canadian House of Commons has passed motion M103 which singles out the criticism of Islam as a form of “Islamophobia”. Critics condemn it as an attack on free speech.[Motion M103 was tabled by Iqra Khalid, a Muslim member of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal Party. It states the government must “condemn Islamophobia and all forms of systemic racism and religious discrimination”, was taken to vote on Thursday evening where a total of 201 MPs voted for it and only 91 voted against, Canadian broadcaster Global News reports. advertisement, The text of the motion does not clarify what constitutes “Islamophobia” and has led many to speculate what that may mean in the future, with some critics fearing it could lead to Shariah law courts. This concern has led to the circulation of an anti-Shariah petition on the Parliament of Canada website, which has so far been signed by over 24,000 people. Ms. Khalid, who was born in Pakistan and moved to the UK and then to Canada, said the definition of Islamophobia was: “The irrational hate of Muslims that leads to discrimination.”, When Conservatives asked her to remove Islamophobia from the motion, she said: “I will not do so, any more than I would speak to the Holocaust and not mention that the overwhelming majority of victims were six million followers of the Jewish faith and that anti-Semitism was the root cause of the Holocaust.”, Another part of the bill that has stirred controversy is the passage that asks the government to “recognise the need to quell the increasing public climate of hate and fear”. It is currently unknown what measures the government will take to “quell” “hate and fear” as the motion is not classified as a law and has no effect on current criminal law. The Conservative Party of Canada are currently holding leadership elections and many of the candidates have come out against M103 including one of the frontrunners, Quebecer Maxime Bernier. Mr. Bernier, a conservative with libertarian free market leanings, said he voted against the bill tweeting: “Free speech is the most fundamental right we have. I am opposed to #m103. Canadians should be treated equally regardless of religion.”, Free speech is the most fundamental right we have. I am opposed to #m103. Canadians should be treated equally regardless of religion.#cpcldr, — Maxime Bernier  (@MaximeBernier) January 26, 2017, , Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who during the election campaign championed Muslim women wearing hijabs and full face niqabs, dropped an appeal by the previous government that would not allow women to wear niqabs to Canadian citizenship ceremonies. Trudeau has also appeared at many mosques, including one where the women weren’t allowed in the main prayer room with the men but were forced to pray in a separate area upstairs. The self-proclaimed “feminist” Prime Minister said: “Diversity is a source of strength, not just a source of weakness, and as I look at this beautiful room — sisters upstairs — everyone here, (I see) the diversity we have just within this mosque, within the Islamic community, within the Muslim community in Canada.”,  Follow Chris Tomlinson on Twitter at @TomlinsonCJ or email at ctomlinson@breitbart.com\n",
      "In his Contract with the American Voter pledge, President Donald J. Trump, then the Republican nominee, promised to move America in the direction of becoming energy independent through a series of executive orders, actions, agency directives, and guidance.[Under the heading “Seven Actions to Protect American Workers” in the contract, Trump spelled out how he would advance that goal in his first 100 days in office, which concludes on Saturday. advertisement, “I will lift the restrictions on the production of $50 trillion dollars’ worth of job-producing American energy reserves, including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal,” Trump said. He also pledged to “lift the Obama-Clinton roadblocks and allow vital energy infrastructure projects, like the Keystone Pipeline, to move forward.”, In a memorandum issued on January 24, 2017 — four days after taking the oath of office — Trump put his seal of approval on the Keystone XL Pipeline that the Obama administration held up for years based on protests from climate change activists and some Native American tribes. On January 26, the State Department announced the Keystone construction could move forward:, Acting on behalf of the president under delegated authorities in accordance with Executive Order 13337 and the January 24, 2017 Presidential Memorandum Regarding Construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline, the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs determined that issuing a Presidential permit to Keystone to construct, connect, operate, and maintain at the border of the United States pipeline facilities for the import of crude oil from Canada to the United States as described in the Presidential permit application for the proposed Keystone XL pipeline project would serve the national interest. Accordingly, the request for a Presidential permit is approved:, “A significant milestone for the Keystone XL project,\" said Russ Girling, president &ampCEO https://t.co/HzvLhlYtAs #TimeToBuildKXL, — TransCanada (@TransCanada) March 24, 2017, , Also on January 24, Trump issued a memorandum on the Dakota Access pipeline in North Dakota, which Obama put on hold to appease protesters, including Native America tribes and allies who claimed environmental damage would result from the pipeline crossing under the Missouri River. But in the end, the people camping out on the land caused about $1 million in damage to the land that was repaired with American taxpayer dollars. “I believe that construction and operation of lawfully permitted pipeline infrastructure serve the national interest,” Trump said in the memorandum approving the final phase of construction for the Dakota Access pipeline. “We support the pro-jobs and pro-economy direction President Trump has taken on energy with his approval of KXL, DAPL and his actions to streamline regulations,” Sabrina Fang, spokesperson for the American Petroleum Institute, told Breitbart News. “We look forward to working with this administration and Congress on forward-looking energy policies that will help ensure the United States continues to lead the world in the production and refining of oil and natural gas and in reducing carbon emissions.”, “With the right policies, we have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to create more jobs, continue to help consumers, and improve the environment all at the same time,” Fang said. In February, Trump signed an executive order calling for the review of the Waters of the United States’ rule, part of the Clean Water Plan, which put restrictions on waters on private land, harming farming and ranching operations across the country. “Since its introduction in 2015, the rule has been greeted with frustration and litigation from many farming groups, including the Michigan Farm Bureau, which called the rule ‘a regulatory land grab of Biblical proportions,’” the Lansing State Journal reported. EPA administrator Scott Pruitt joined the president for the announcement of the executive order and issued this statement:, EPA intends to immediately implement the Executive Order and submit a Notice to the Office of the Federal Register announcing our intent to review the 2015 Rule, and then to propose a new rule that will rescind or revise that rule. The President’s action today preserves a federal role in protecting water, but it also restores the states’ important role in the regulation of water. The rule, however, was already held up from implementation because of lawsuits filed by 13 states, but Trump’s order makes its implementation virtually impossible in the coming years. On March 28, surrounded by coal miners, Trump signed the “Promoting Energy Independence and Economic Growth” executive order. “My administration is putting an end to the war on coal,” Trump said in a speech prior to signing the executive order. In the order, Trump spells out his vision for America’s energy future:, It is in the national interest to promote clean and safe development of our nation’s vast energy resources, while at the same time avoiding regulatory burdens that unnecessarily encumber energy production, constrain economic growth, and prevent job creation. Moreover, the prudent development of these natural resources is essential to ensuring the Nation’s geopolitical security. It is further in the national interest to ensure that the Nation’s electricity is affordable, reliable, safe, secure, and clean, and that it can be produced from coal, natural gas, nuclear material, flowing water, and other domestic sources, including renewable sources. Accordingly, it is the policy of the United States that executive departments and agencies (agencies) immediately review existing regulations that potentially burden the development or use of domestically produced energy resources and appropriately suspend, revise, or rescind those that unduly burden the development of domestic energy resources beyond the degree necessary to protect the public interest or otherwise comply with the law. In addressing coal in the sweeping order, Trump asked Ryan Zinke, secretary of the Interior Department, “to lift any and all moratoria on Federal land coal leasing activities related to Order 3338. The Secretary shall commence Federal coal leasing activities consistent with all applicable laws and regulations.”, The order also calls for review of restrictions on gas and oil production, including regulations on hydraulic fracturing. Trump took dead aim at the Obama administration’s climate change regulations, including ordering a review of the Clean Power Plan, Obama’s Climate Action Plan, and a slew of other actions taken during the past eight years. The order also called for the disbanding of the Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases. “The action I’m taking eliminates federal overreach, restores economic freedom and allows our workers to thrive, compete and succeed on a level playing field for the first time in a long time,” Trump said about the order. “That’s what this is all about — bringing back our jobs, bringing back our dreams, and making America wealthy again,” Trump said. And in addition to the public executive orders and memorandums, a leaked working document from the Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) reveals how Trump wants to return the vast amount of land held by the federal government to allow not only recreation, hunting, and accessibility for law enforcement and the military, but for energy exploration, development, and production. “Several conservation and government watchdog groups say they’re concerned about the direction the Bureau of Land Management is headed after a draft list of agency priorities under the Trump administration surfaced this week,” Greenwire’s E&ampE News reported. “The draft five-point ‘BLM Priority Work’ list, first reported on … by E&ampE News, calls for the agency to focus on increasing energy development in suitable areas of the 245 million acres BLM manages (Greenwire, April 10),” E&ampE News reported. The document is divided into five sections — “Making America Safe through Energy Independence,” “Making America Great Through Shared Conservation Stewardship,” “Making America Safe – Restoring Our Sovereignty,” “Getting America Back to Work,” and “Serving the American Family.”, “It also prioritizes streamlining unspecified ‘processes’ mandated by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), as well as ‘land use planning to support energy and minerals development and other priorities,’ including ‘rights-of-way processing for pipelines, transmission lines, and solar/wind projects,’” E&ampE News reported.\n",
      "Cuban state media reported Tuesday that Fidel Castro, the soon-to-be-90-year-old former dictator of the island, spoke before the assembled Communist Party Congress in Havana to warn supporters that his death may soon be near.[The Cuban propaganda newspaper Granma published what it claimed was a speech by Castro to the Seventh Communist Party Congress, taking place this week in the capital. In the speech, Castro reportedly acknowledges his age and warns listeners that he may soon expire. advertisement, “I will soon turn 90 years old, something I would have never thought of and that is not the product of any effort, but the whims of fate,” he tells the audience. “Soon I will be like everyone else. We all get our turn, but the ideas of Cuban communists will remain as proof that, on this planet, there is work with fervor and dignity,” he states. He adds, “This may be the last time I speak in this room,” and congratulates his brother and successor, the dictator Raúl Castro. The speech is short for a totalitarian known to have given 12-hour speeches in his heyday. He muses about the extinction of humanity (“like the dinosaurs”) and describes communism as “the most distorted and maligned concept in history.” He encourages listeners to fight climate change, a topic that President Obama has described as “defining” global leadership for him. The speech is Fidel Castro’s most prominent statement since President Barack Obama’s visit to the island in March. The elder Castro did not meet with President Obama, instead surfacing in a letter he allegedly penned condemning the President for imposing himself on Cuba. “We do not need the Empire to gift us anything,” the letter reportedly written by Castro reads, accusing President Obama of discrimination against Native Americans and praising communism’s “spiritual wealth.”, Fidel Castro’s words, despite their rejection of his younger brother’s friendlier attitude towards President Obama while they attended a baseball game together, were not the harshest published in Cuban state media. A Havana newspaper published an opinion piece which referred to President Obama as “negro” and accused him of “inciting rebellion and disorder.” The Afro-Cuban author of the piece subsequently apologized. Obama-bashing also made its way to the Communist Party Congress earlier in the week, when Foreign Minister Bruno Rodríguez used his time on the floor to call President Obama’s presence in Havana an “attack” on “our culture.”, Fidel Castro stepped down from his position as dictator of the island in 2007, after rumors circulated of his impending or already-occurring death. Shortly before the official announcement that his brother would assume his duties, American intelligence officials told the Agence France-Presse they had reports suggesting Castro had “months, not years” to live, as he was suffering from a “terminal” disease. Reports of Castro’s death were exacerbated by celebrations within Miami’s Cuban exile community, as well as a report “confirming” Castro’s death on the gossip site Perez Hilton.\n",

      "A teachers association in Bavaria has said it wants to see Islamic studies lessons being made mandatory in all schools in the region.[In 2009 the Ministry of Culture in Bavaria introduced a pilot program for the teaching of what they call “Islamic Instruction.” Initially the courses were offered at 260 schools in the southern region of Germany but n the coming year at least 400 schools will introduce Islamic religious courses for students reports Junge Freiheit. advertisement, The Bavarian teacher association (BLLV) wants to take the program even further. The BLLV wishes to make Islamic studies mandatory in all schools in Bavaria and has addressed their concerns in a petition to the Bavarian regional government. The petition stated the needs of Muslims to be able to receive a formal education that includes their religion and the requirement for Germans to help new migrants integrate better by understanding Islam. “Less than 25,000 of the estimated 150,000 Muslim pupils receive religious lessons in school in Bavaria,” the teachers association said in a statement to the government. They said that now with the huge influx of Muslim migrants that the need was even greater. The BLLV said that many of the migrant newcomers have children and they should change the lesson plans of the schools to include them. The BLLV is also concerned that they may be severely lacking in teachers who are properly qualified to teach Islamic studies. They complained that they were short staffed in qualified teachers because other regions in Germany had given candidates with Islamic qualifications better and more secure work. They said that as a result of this much of the potential to fully develop the subject among Bavarian children would be lost. BLLV president Simone Fleischmann lamented the fact that training opportunities for Islamic teachers were missing in the state. She said there is currently no opportunity for candidates who show a proven theologian expertise in Islam. The Islamic courses proposed would be based on the religious writings of Islam including the Quran and other books. The courses are intended to show an Islam that is reconcilable with German law and the Bavarian constitution. Advocates say it will assist in creating a space where Muslim children can form personalities in a socially inclusive environment. The expansion of Islamic studies in Germany and Austria is seen as a way to include Muslim students in a system that is very foreign to them. A teacher in Austria said that many of the migrant children who have come to Europe since the start of the migrant crisis lack basic educational skills and described them as a potential “lost generation”. A German educational expert also pointed out the fact that few migrants were even literate and said that they will likely be a drain on the economies of European countries for decades.\n",

Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby, who has been in the Senate for almost 30 years, won 64 percent of the vote against challenger John McConnell and three other opponents. If Shelby had been held to under 50% of the vote, the race would have been pushed to a run-off. Despite the crowded field, Shelby easily cleared that hurdle. advertisement, In Alabama’s 2nd Congressional District, Rep. Martha Roby fended off a challenge from Tea Party heroine Becky Gerritson and one other challenger. Roby won 67 percent of the vote, far above the threshold needed to avoid a runoff. Gerritson, who founded the Wetumpka Tea Party, received national attention when she testified before Congress after her organization was targeted by the IRS. She racked up high-profile endorsements from Phyllis Schafely, Herman Cain, Allen West, Citizens United, Madison Project, and Tea Party Patriots Citizen Fund. Rep. Roby received strong backing from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and many other Washington-based interests. McConnell, a former Captain in the U.S. Marines, was endorsed by Citizens United and several Tea Party organizations. The national Tea Party Patriots Citizens Fund, however, broke ranks with other conservative groups and endorsed Sen. Shelby. Sen. Jeff Sessions endorsed both Sen. Shelby and Rep. Martha Roby. Sessions, of course, also endorsed Donald Trump, putting the Senator’s firm stamp on the state’s politics. It is obviously difficult to beat incumbents in any environment. The electorate that delivered the state to Trump by a landslide, however, seems to have been created to challenge any incumbent. According to exit polls, 42 percent of Republican voters on Tuesday are “angry” with the federal government. Another 42 percent are simply “dissatisfied” with the government. Amazingly, though, a solid majority of Republicans, 52 percent, say they feel “betrayed” by the Republican party and its leaders. By an overwhelming majority, 68 percent, Republicans said they wanted a “political outsider” as their candidate for President. This seems an electorate tailor-made for a challenger, especially when the immediate goal isn’t to necessarily win outright, but to hold the incumbent to less than 50 percent. The challengers’s failures present three possibilities:, The results, however, also suggest that the animous building towards Washington is a little bit schizophrenic. It is simply hard to square a circle where voters back a candidate to clean house in Washington but simultaneously vote to repopulate Washington with the very same politicians. Representative democracy is very confusing sometimes.\n",
      "Officials in El Salvador held emergency meetings after seeing a sharp increase in the number of violent gang members being deported back to the country from the United States under the Trump administration.[Salvadoran authorities have held emergency meetings and proposed new legislation to monitor returning criminals and gang members that are returning to El Salvador after deportation, according to the Washington Post. advertisement, The move by Salvadoran officials comes as a direct result of the Trump administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration and efforts to deport more criminal illegal aliens from the U.S. This year the U.S. has already deported 398 gang members back to El Salvador – compared to only 534 for all of 2016. It is due to this rapid increase in deportations that Salvadoran officials like Héctor Antonio Rodríguez, the director of the country’s immigration agency, are worried about the impact the returning gang members will have in the country. “This clearly affects El Salvador. We already have a climate of violence in the country that we are combating,” Rodríguez said. “If gang members return, of course this worries us.”, Many of the returning gang members belong to MS-13, a notoriously violent street gang that has plagued communities throughout the U.S. with horrific acts of violence. Although MS-13 started out in Salvadoran communities in Los Angeles sometime during the 1980’s, lax immigration policies and weak border security helped the gang explode in size as MS-13 originated from illegal immigrants, Breitbart Texas reported. The recent murders of four teens in New York City have put MS-13 in the national spotlight with Attorney General Jeff Sessions declaring that U.S. authorities are going after the gang. “The MS-13 motto is kill, rape, and control,” Sessions said. “I have a message to the gangs that are targeting our young people: We are targeting you. We are coming after you.”, Speaking at a rally in April, President Trump highlighted the importance of removing illegal alien MS-13 gang members from the U.S.:, At the heart of my administration’s efforts to restore the rule of law has been a nationwide crackdown on criminal gangs, and that means taking the fight to the sanctuary cities that shield these dangerous criminals from removal. The last very weak administration allowed thousands and thousands of gang members to cross our borders and enter into our communities, where they wreaked havoc on our citizens. The bloodthirsty cartel known as MS-13 has infiltrated our schools, threatening innocent children. We have seen the horrible assaults and many killings all along Long Island where I grew up. We are seeing the vicious spread of transnational gangs into all 50 states and the human suffering they bring with them. I have been with the parents. It is devastation. A very respected General recently told me that MS-13 are the equivalent in their meanness to Al Qaeda. My administration will not rest until we have dismantled these violent gangs, and we are doing it rapidly, and we are sending them the hell out of our country. On Wednesday, Breitbart Texas reported that Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI), Chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, said recently obtained documents from a whistleblower show that the Obama administration knowingly admitted 16 MS-13 gang members in 2014.

      "A leaked document from George Soros’s Open Society Foundations reveals the organization was seeking to influence the positions of Latin American governments in negotiating the Transpacific Partnership Agreement, or TTP.[Soros’s organization does not appear to support the TPP outright, but expressed interest in influencing the sweeping internationalist treaty, including the treaty’s positions on Internet regulation. advertisement, The document reveals the Foundations provided a grant to a Latin American group under the project title “Promotion of Human Rights Standards in Latin American Internet Regulation.” A description of the purpose of the grant, which was for $66,920, states a main goal was to impact TTP negotiations, especially related to Internet regulation in the draft international agreement. The funds, approved April 2013, were awarded to ONG Derechos Digitales, a nonprofit based in Chile focused on public interest and technology. In the “Objectives and Goals” section, the memo, referring to the TTP as the TTPA, states:, Advocate for the protection of human rights standards in the Transpacific Partnership Agreement (TPPA): provide technical assistance to negotiators of Latin American countries (Chile, Peru, and Mexico) of the TPPA raise awareness about the TPPA in the Spanish-speaking countries. The listed indicators that would prove the success of the grant includes “protection of human rights standards in the TPPA increased capacity of civil society in Latin America to influence internet regulation a stronger network and better collaboration of civil society working on digital rights in Latin America.”, The information was contained in a document describing various grants titled, “Civil Liberties in the Digital Environment: Grant Recommendations for Core Grantees.”, The reference to influencing “human rights standards” in the TPP actually seems to relate to a globalist treaty that impacts domestic law.  There too, the grant objectives referenced Internet regulation. The Foundations memo makes clear it was seeking to “influence legislation” in Latin American countries to ensure “compliance with the Inter-American Convention on Human Rights.”, It relates:, Over the past few years, the governments in Latin America have started to regulate the online environment, mainly driven by the need to implement trade agreements. That said, this “regulation trend” is set to further accelerate in the coming years as the internet penetration rate is predicted to jump over 50%. This presents a good opportunity for civil society to help set standards and influence legislation in compliance with the Inter-American Convention on Human Rights. The Inter-American Convention on Human Rights seeks to impose a system of universal human rights and rules, and it tasks governments with altering their own domestic laws to align with those of the Convention, including rules pertaining to property rights and the judicial system.  Twenty-three Central and South American countries are currently members. In September 2013, Venezuela exited the pact, with President Hugo Chávez claiming the Commission was “campaigning against his government and acting at the behest of the United States.”, The preamble of the agreement states that the pact countries are “Reaffirming their intention to consolidate in this hemisphere, within the framework of democratic institutions, a system of personal liberty and social justice based on respect for the essential rights of man.”, The TPP, meanwhile, is an expansive trade agreement between 12 Pacific Rim countries, including the U.S. Obama has made the treaty a central part of his so-called pivot to Asia. Earlier this week, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters Obama would push for the TPP to be passed before he leaves office in January. Earnest said the president would make the case for the treaty during a speech in Laos on Sept. 6. “The president is going to make a strong case that we have made progress and there is a path for us to get this done before the president leaves office,” Earnest said. Soros himself has expressed tepid support for the TPP. Writing last year in the New York Review of Books, the billionaire called the TPP “an excellent opportunity for a two-pronged strategy” to forge a partnership with China if the treaty could be amended not to exclude China.  Soros opposed Obama’s request to fast-track the TPP past Congress, instead advocating for the treaty to be altered to help forge a strategic partnership with China.

      "MOST POPULAR[In his weekly address released on Friday, President Barack Obama opened the new year by touting the accomplishments up his presidency, but he also discussed the gun issue. advertisement, Obama vowed to criticized Congress and vowed to moved forward where he could without the approval of the legislative branch. Transcript as follows:, Happy New Year, everybody. I am fired up for the year that stretches out before us. That’s because of what we’ve accomplished together over the past seven. Seven years ago, our businesses were losing 800,000 jobs a month. They’ve now created jobs for 69 straight months, driving the unemployment rate from a high of 10% down to 5%. Seven years ago, too many Americans went without health insurance. We’ve now covered more than 17 million people, dropping the rate of the uninsured below 10% for the very first time. Seven years ago, we were addicted to foreign oil. Now our oil imports have plummeted, our clean energy industry is booming, and America is a global leader in the fight against climate change. Seven years ago, there were only two states in America with marriage equality. And now there are 50. All of this progress is because of you. And we’ve got so much more to do. So my New Year’s resolution is to move forward on our unfinished business as much as I can. And I’ll be more frequently asking for your help. That’s what this American project is all about. That’s especially true for one piece of unfinished business, that’s our epidemic of gun violence. Last month, we remembered the third anniversary of Newtown. This Friday, I’ll be thinking about my friend Gabby Giffords, five years into her recovery from the shooting in Tucson. And all across America, survivors of gun violence and those who lost a child, a parent, a spouse to gun violence are forced to mark such awful anniversaries every single day. And yet Congress still hasn’t done anything to prevent what happened to them from happening to other families. Three years ago, a bipartisan, commonsense bill would have required background checks for virtually everyone who buys a gun. Keep in mind, this policy was supported by some 90% of the American people. It was supported by a majority of NRA households. But the gun lobby mobilized against it. And the Senate blocked it. Since then, tens of thousands of our fellow Americans have been mowed down by gun violence. Tens of thousands. Each time, we’re told that commonsense reforms like background checks might not have stopped the last massacre, or the one before that, so we shouldn’t do anything. We know that we can’t stop every act of violence. But what if we tried to stop even one? What if Congress did something – anything – to protect our kids from gun violence?, A few months ago, I directed my team at the White House to look into any new actions I can take to help reduce gun violence. And on Monday, I’ll meet with our Attorney General, Loretta Lynch, to discuss our options. Because I get too many letters from parents, and teachers, and kids, to sit around and do nothing. I get letters from responsible gun owners who grieve with us every time these tragedies happen who share my belief that the Second Amendment guarantees a right to bear arms and who share my belief we can protect that right while keeping an irresponsible, dangerous few from inflicting harm on a massive scale.

      "Another prominent Democrat has trashed Elie Wiesel — the Holocaust survivor, author, and Nobel Peace laureate who died on Saturday. Dorothy Reik, president of the Progressive Democrats of the Santa Monica Mountains and a member of the Los Angeles County Democratic Central Committee, wrote an email quoting a reference to Wiesel as a “Holocaust whore” and adding: “I had met people who made their livings from the holocaust [sic] but never to the extent that Wiesel did.”[Reik had been defending Max Blumenthal, the virulently anti-Israel writer and son of Hillary Clinton adviser Sid Blumenthal, who had tweeted: “Elie Wiesel is dead. He spent his last years inciting hatred, defending apartheid &amp palling around with fascists.” Earlier this week, Hillary Clinton’s campaign distanced itself from Blumenthal’s statements. advertisement, In her email, Reik also wrote:, Sadly I have to agree with Max Blumenthal. I hope that people on this list do not use this as an excuse to attack my friends and associates, most of whom probably do not agree with me. Why do I post this at all? Because I think it is the truth and so I am compelled to speak out so that we are wary of others who are honored as peacemakers but are not. In 2014, Reik, an anti-war activist, was honored by local Democrats for her effort to “move the party in a progressive direction, focusing on electing Democrats who will move on such issues as the environment, economic justice, and peace.” According to the Malibu Democratic Club, Reik “has taken a leading role in influencing policy in the Democratic Party.”, Reid — who, like Blumenthal, is Jewish — told the Los Angeles Daily News: “I apologize if I offended anyone.”, The left-leaning Anti-Defamation League’s Pacific Southwest Regional Director complained about Reik’s statements in an open letter to local Democratic Party leadership: “While the entire world is mourning the death of Nobel Laureate and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel — often called the conscience of the world — it is particularly disturbing that this Democratic Party official would share these vicious words, even expressed as her personal opinion.”, The mainstream media have largely ignored the controversy in the Clinton camp, while focusing on Donald Trump’s tweet of a six-pointed star, which some have called an antisemitic image.

      "Former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and National Security Agency (NSA) director Michael Hayden did his best in 2016 to elect Hillary Clinton. Worse, Hayden made the inflammatory and frightening claim on CNN at the time that Donald Trump was a “clear and present danger” to the country.[Given his background, those words carried weight and contributed to the climate of fear and division that burdens our democracy today, including within the intelligence agencies. advertisement, Hayden also signed a letter last August urging Americans to vote against Donald Trump. Anything Hayden says about politics today must therefore be interpreted in that context. He is hardly a disinterested observer, and clearly resents the fact that the American people ignored his unsolicited advice. Now, Hayden tells the Business Insider that Breitbart News has an “illegitimate worldview.” He was apparently objecting to Breitbart News’ story last week documenting mainstream media reports that the Obama administration had conducted surveillance at Trump Tower and of people connected to the Trump campaign, and that it had disseminated the products of that surveillance. Hayden admitted that he had not examined those media reports themselves. Nevertheless, he attacked Breitbart, Drudge and others:, The retired four-star Air Force general said too that “there’s an amazing consistency” on numerous subjects between the information disseminated by Russian media outlets and that of conservative American sources like the Drudge Report, radio and television host Sean Hannity, and Breitbart. “You have a Breitbart News story essentially launching the Starfleet of the federal government about one of the most horrible political scandals in American history, if true,” Hayden said, adding that it was “very troubling” the president seeming to value Breitbart reports over data compiled by intelligence agencies. “Breitbart doesn’t do any creative journalism — it just moves the parts around,” Hayden continued. “And I haven’t done this personally, but I’ve heard others say, when you dig into the Breitbart sources, the articles don’t really say that.”, …, “They have a worldview, and they are playing with it,” he said. “I think it’s an illegitimate worldview, and I think it’s a non-fact-based worldview. It’s a worldview in which preexisting visions seem to be being used to distort the fact pattern that exists.”, The proper address for Hayden’s complaints is the mainstream media, and possibly the Obama administration. Regardless, the views he considers “illegitimate” are enjoyed by the 45 million unique visitors who read our website every month. The fact that Hayden and other disgruntled members of the Washington establishment still refuse to acknowledge the basic validity of a different perspective outside the Beltway and the mainstream media is precisely why Trump won in November.

      "It seems DICE is done with their inaugural entry in the Star Wars Battlefront series, and is now putting all of its focus on the 2017 sequel.[“DICE isn’t done with Star Wars,” the developer posted on EA’s official Battlefront blog, but the team behind 2015’s reboot of the cult classic multiplayer games has “shifted its focus” toward “the next great Star Wars game.” This is, of course, the inevitable Battlefront 2. advertisement, DICE isn’t hogging all the credit — or blame, depending on your opinion of 2015’s Battlefront. They’ve called their next release a “collaborative effort” between themselves and the teams at developers Criterion and Motive. According to Motive’s Jade Raymond:, A new installment of Star Wars Battlefront is currently in development at DICE, in collaboration with Motive™ Studios in Montreal. Our team at Motive team is growing quickly, and making great progress in building out a significant new addition to the game. While we’re not ready to get into specifics right now, we have started development of this game by listening to all of the feedback we received, while also innovating in new areas I think you’re all going to be excited about. While DICE’s announcement means that we won’t see any further content added to the offline Skirmish mode introduced to Battlefront last year, 2017’s follow-up will feature a full single player campaign that spans “multiple Star Wars eras,” according to EA CEO Andrew Wilson himself during an earnings call on January 31:, Our next Star Wars Battlefront will be even bigger, taking players into more locations and allowing them to play with more heroes and characters across multiple Star Wars eras. There will be new ways to play, including an all new single-player campaign and much, much more that we are excited to share with our players in the months ahead. Star Wars Battlefront was a hopeful first attempt, a love-letter to the sights and sounds of the iconic series. Unfortunately, even CFO Blake Jorgensen was forced to admit that it didn’t have enough depth to hold on to many of its most hardcore players. It was a game as praised as it was maligned, prioritizing atmosphere and accessibility over longevity. Despite its many criticisms, fans devoured it. It sold upwards of 14 million copies. The next game is doubling down on scope and depth alike, and EA is devoting those three studios to make sure it succeeds. Wilson said that they “have every reason to believe” that they’ll be able to deliver “exactly what fans are asking for.”, Star Wars Battlefront 2 will release some time in late 2017, probably in the vicinity of Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi’s theatrical premier in December.

      "Actor Ashton Kutcher sent a little love to Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) Wednesday during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing focused on ending modern slavery and child sexual exploitation.[“You were better-looking in the movies,” McCain joked to Kutcher, before The Ranch star blew back a kiss in response. advertisement, Appreciate @aplusk @thorn &amp @ecmassimino @humanrights1st's commitment to the #enditmovement &amp support of #EndSlaveryAct pic.twitter.com/RpJ9YH5mYH, — John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) February 15, 2017, , During the hearing Wednesday, the 39-year-old actor — who co-founded the technology company Thorn, which builds software tools to combat child sexual exploitation and human trafficking — delivered a 15-minute speech detailing how technology can play a role in ending the vicious practices of rape and modern slavery. “This is about the time, when I start talking about politics, that the Internet trolls start telling me to stick to my day job,” Kutcher told the panel, chaired by Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN). But Kutcher said his day job comprised of working at Thorn to fight child sex crimes, and of being a father to two children. , “I’ve been on FBI raids where I’ve seen things that no person should ever see,” he said, appearing to choke up. “I’ve seen video content of a child that’s the same age as mine, being raped by an American man that was a sex tourist in Cambodia, and this child was so conditioned by her environment that she thought she was engaging in play.”, Kutcher said his company had once received a call from the Department of Homeland Security asking for help in locating a serial sex abuser. “We were the last line of defense, an actor and his foundation, we were the potential last line of defense,” he said. “That’s my day job, and I’m sticking to it.”, Kutcher also discussed a tool that his company built called Spotlight, which allows law enforcement officers the ability to prioritize their case load. He said the program was already being used by more than 4,000 law enforcement officials in over 900 agencies. “There’s often a misconception about technology that in some way, it is the generator of some evil, that it’s creating job displacement and that it enables violence and malice acts,” he continued. “But as an entrepreneur and as a venture capitalist in the technology field, I see technology as simply a tool. A tool without will. The will is the user of that technology, and I think it’s an important distinction.”, “Technology can be used to enable slavery, but it can also be used to disable slavery, and that’s what we’re doing,” he added.

      "WASHINGTON, D.C. — President Donald Trump wrapped up infrastructure week at the Department of Transportation on Friday, highlighting his moves to reform what the White House called a “burdensome regulatory system that has left American infrastructure crumbling.”[Trump began his visit with a roundtable where state DOT heads described the hindrances that the current permitting process impose on their infrastructure projects. The heads of state Departments of Transportation, U.S. Department of Transportation leaders, and White House senior officials participated in the discussion along with hosts Transportation Sec. Elaine Chao and Interior Sec. Ryan Zinke. advertisement, From the DOT atrium, Trump spoke to members of Congress, representatives of the transportation community, heads of state Departments of Transportation, and U.S. Department of Transportation staff. Trump spoke of Thursday’s infrastructure summit at the White House which involved Secs. Chao and Zinke. They met with “state and local leaders to develop plans to replace America’s decaying infrastructure and to construct new roads, rails, pipelines, tunnels, and bridges all across our nation.”, The President continued:, We are here today to focus on solving one of the biggest obstacles to creating this new and desperately-needed infrastructure – and that is the painfully slow, costly and time-consuming process for getting permits and approvals to build. And I also knew that from the private sector. It is a long, slow, unnecessarily burdensome process. My Administration is committed to ending these terrible delays once and for all.  The excruciating wait time for permitting has inflicted enormous financial pain on cities and states all throughout our nation – and has blocked many important projects from ever getting off the ground. Trump added that the Dakota Access Pipeline was “dead 120 days ago and now it officially just opened for business.” He also noted excitement at the labor union representatives from the North American Building Trades Union and the Laborers International Union of North America that were present for the event. “You will play a central role in rebuilding America,” said Trump.  , He gave examples of how belabored the process to building infrastructure has gotten:, It took only 4 years to build the Golden Gate Bridge and 5 years to build the Hoover Dam and less than one year to build the Empire State Building, people don’t believe that, took less than one year – but today it can take 10 years and far more than that just to get the approvals and permits needed to build a major infrastructure project. These charts beside me are actually a simplified version of our highway permitting process. It includes 16 different approvals involving 10 different federal agencies being governed by 26 different statutes. Trump them spoke of a conversation that happened just 30-minutes prior, with a gentleman from Maryland and a project for an 18-mile road. “They spent $29 million dollars for an environmental report weighing 70 pounds and costing $24,000 per page,” said Trump who then moved to the side and showed the massive binders containing the report. Trump continued:, Why should we continue to accept what is so clearly unacceptable? Often times for consultants that are making a fortune because you can’t do anything without hiring them, paying them a tremendous amount of money. Having them write up this nonsense. You can’t get approvals. “I was not elected to continue a failed system – I was elected to change it,” said Trump. He assured stated and local leaders, “help is finally, after many, many decades, on its way,” pledging to give control, “back to the cities and the states.” Trump remarked that these governing bodies know best how to plan their communities, analyze their projects and protect their local environment. He then announced a “new Council to help project managers navigate the bureaucratic maze.” The Council will create a new online dashboard to track major projects through the approval process and will “make sure that every federal agency that is consistently delaying projects by missing deadlines will face tough new penalties.”, The Administration is also forming a new office within the Council of Environmental Quality. Trump announced that this office will work to “root out inefficiency, clarify lines of authority, and streamline federal and state, local procedures so that communities can modernize their aging infrastructure without fear of outdated federal rules getting in the way.”,  , President Trump said this massive permit reform is so important, but “only the first step in renewing America’s roads, rails, runways, and rivers.”, He referred to his recent comments in Cincinnati, Ohio, speaking of his “new vision for American infrastructure will generate $1 trillion dollars in infrastructure investment.”, “State and local leaders will have more power to decide which projects get built, when they start and how they are funded,” said Trump. “And investors will have a much more predictable environment that encourages them to invest billions of dollars in capital that is currently stuck on the sidelines. Together we will build projects to inspire our youth, employ our workers and create true prosperity for our people.”, Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana \n",
      "“Get ready for war with Russia” if Hillary Clinton is elected president, said progressive Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein.[“This election, we are not only deciding what kind of world we will have, but whether we will have a world or not going forward,” Stein warned, explaining that Clinton’s trigger-happy militarism “is a mushroom cloud waiting to happen.”, advertisement, While Stein adamantly opposes a Trump presidency, she explained that the dangers posed by a Clinton presidency are “arguably even more immediate and intense.”, Stein blasted Clinton’s “warmongering” that “almost singlehandedly” brought us the turmoil in Libya and could lead us into a nuclear war if Clinton were elected president. “Hillary brought us Libya almost singlehandedly,” Stein explained in a Thursday Fox Business interview. She continued:, And she has said that she will lead the charge with a no-fly zone in Syria, and that basically amounts to a declaration of war against Russia, who is there under international law, having been invited by the sitting government. Like it or not, Russia has the sanction of international law to be there. For us to go in and declare a no-fly zone means get ready for war with Russia. Both of us have 2,000 nuclear weapons on hair trigger alert. This is the most dangerous moment— according to the former president of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, who, two weeks ago, said this is the most dangerous nuclear moment ever. Stein elaborated on this view during a Facebook Live interview with progressive Marc Lamont Hill, who has endorsed Stein over Clinton: “In this election, we are not only deciding what kind of world we will have, but whether we will have a world or not going forward,” Stein said, adding:, Not only in regards to climate, not only in regards to these expanding wars where Hillary has this proven track record … of the most pro-conflict military policy as possible, and she’s calling for a no-fly zone in Syria, which means we’re essentially declaring war on Russia if Hillary gets elected–declaring war on Russia at a time when we have 2,000 nuclear weapons between us and the Russians on hair trigger alert. This is a mushroom cloud waiting to happen. So it’s really important right now for us to stand up and start building a force to do the right thing. “No one should fool themselves into thinking that the dangers will be smaller, that they will be mitigated in any way for having Hillary in White House. In some ways, they’re arguably even more immediate and intense,” Stein said. “But the dangers will be mitigated if we have created a strong force and we stand up loud and clear and we have a political base for this social movement that is coming together across this country and, really, across the world–this movement that puts people, planet, and peace over profit.”, “It’s very clear what kind of a trend we’re on,” Stein explained:, This is a race to the bottom between the greater and lesser evil. Where is the exit strategy if you buy into this [idea that one must vote for one of the major parties]? It means that in every election, we have two candidates that are more corporatist, more militarist, more imperialist, more economic elites, more serving Wall Street, offshoring our jobs, more of these rigged corporate trade agreements, more of this climate policy. … There is no exit strategy if you buy into the lesser evil. It means with each race, we come closer and closer to the cliff. “We must find and elect alternatives to the Wall Street-backed oligarchy, the warmongers, and the anti-humanitarians,” Stein wrote on Twitter. Stein, who has previously described Clinton as “Queen of corruption,” attacked Clinton for her questionable ties to Qatar and Saudi Arabia:, #RememberWhenClinton took $1M from Qatar and didn’t tell the state department? https://t.co/hNdVqTlvsC, — Dr. Jill Stein (@DrJillStein) November 5, 2016, , If Saudi Arabia funded 9/11 and ISIS too, why does Obama protect them, Clinton arm them, &amp Podesta lobby for them? https://t.co/hcA4BPdSHD, — Dr. Jill Stein (@DrJillStein) November 6, 2016, , Saudi Arabia:-top Clinton Foundation donor-lobbies US via Podesta group-got record arms deals from Obama/Clinton, -top terrorism sponsor, — Dr. Jill Stein (@DrJillStein) November 4, 2016, , During her interview with Stein, Fox Business host Kennedy blasted other members of the mainstream media for ignoring and trying to “smother” Stein’s “authentic” and “interesting” candidacy. “I’m surprised that the mainstream media has taken an interesting, authentic candidate like yourself— they were so obsessed with Bernie Sanders— and you’ve got someone, the embodiment of this new and interesting political tapestry, and they’ve essentially ignored you and smothered your candidacy,” Kennedy said. Stein agreed and said that the corporate media’s blackout of her campaign and their perpetuation “speaks volumes.” She said, “My campaign is a very inconvenient truth that there is a politics of integrity out there. … Every day, there are more revelations how both … [Trump and Clinton] are walking, talking scandal machines, and people are clamoring for something else.” She added, “The corporate media, the apologists for the Democrats and Republicans, and the political pundits are doing everything they can to intimidate people into voting for the system that’s throwing them under the bus.”\n",

Obama bemoaned the emergence of mainstream media outlets, such as Drudge and Breitbart and Facebook-shared conservations, that do not take their orders from establishment politicians, experts and institutions. advertisement, What frustrated Obama and his staff [in the 2016 campaign] was the knowledge that, in large measure, they were reaching their own people but no further. They spoke to the networks and the major cable outlets, the major papers and the mainstream Web sites, and, in an attempt to find people “where they are,” forums such as Bill Maher’s and Samantha Bee’s late-night cable shows, and Marc Maron’s podcast. But they would never reach the collective readerships of Breitbart News, the Drudge Report, WND, Newsmax, InfoWars, and lesser-knowns like Western Journalism—not to mention the closed loop of peer-to-peer right-wing rumor-mongering. … That marked a decisive change from previous political eras, [Obama] maintained. “Ideally, in a democracy, everybody would agree that climate change is the consequence of man-made behavior, because that’s what ninety-nine per cent of scientists tell us,” he said. “And then we would have a debate about how to fix it. That’s how, in the seventies, eighties, and nineties, you had Republicans supporting the Clean Air Act and you had a market-based fix for acid rain rather than a command-and-control approach. So you’d argue about means, but there was a baseline of facts that we could all work off of. And now we just don’t have that” …, “I have complete confidence in the American people—that if I can have a conversation with them they’ll choose what’s right. At an emotional level, they want to do the right thing if they have the information.” And yet in an age of filter bubbles and social-media silos, he knew, the “information” that reached people was increasingly shaped by what they wanted to be true. And that was no longer in his hands or anyone else’s. Obama’s assessment of his own powers of persuasion may not be fully justified. For example, he has completely failed to persuade Americans that his vision of high immigration and low wages is preferable to low-immigration, high wage alternative. He also failed to persuade Americans to support his government directed healthcare system or to support Hillary Clinton in 2016. Remnick is already on record complaining that his own elite publication was sidelined by Breitbart in the 2016 election. Surely, Breitbart News, a site of vile conspiracies, could not become for millions a source of news and mainstream opinion… the information loop had been shattered. On Facebook, articles in the traditional, fact-based press look the same as articles from the conspiratorial alt-right media. Spokesmen for the unspeakable now have access to huge audiences. This was the cauldron, with so much misogynistic language, that helped to demean and destroy Clinton. The alt-right press was the purveyor of constant lies, propaganda, and conspiracy theories that Trump used as the oxygen of his campaign…, But despair is no answer. To combat authoritarianism, to call out lies, to struggle honorably and fiercely in the name of American ideals—that is what is left to do. That is all there is to do.

      "In their reporting and social media coverage, Britain’s Daily Telegraph has strongly implied Islamist Khalid Masood went on a killing spree in central London because he’d once been a victim of racism in the past.[‘First picture of Khalid Masood reveals how he went from football-loving teenager to London attacker’ — the Telegraph article, which seeks to make sense of the murder with the very little information about the individual presently available to the general public, relies heavily on details of a conviction of Masood dating back to 2003. advertisement, Reporting an incident where Muslim convert Masood stabbed a cafe owner in the face with a knife, the Telegraph reports: “Masood, may have eventually snapped because of racism in his village”. This is based upon Masood’s own account of why he attacked a neighbour in a picturesque East Sussex village, when he told Hove crown court that villagers had “ostracised” him. Why they’d do a thing, given his response, one can only imagine. While this was merely his claim in defence of a presumably disfiguring attack on a shopkeeper, the Telegraph‘s social media output amplifies the certainty of the claim by stating, matter-of-factly: “London attacker Khalid Masood snapped because of racism in his village”. , The implication of the article, that Masood’s life was normal until the early 2000s and was totally thrown off the rails by an argument with “racial overtones” in the village stores, is a nonsense, and doubly so given how little we actually know. By furthering this idea, the Telegraph are falling for the leftist thought-trap of Structuralism, that societal forces can push people into crime and this is something ‘victims’ of these forces have no control over. This logic denies individuals — like Masood — their agency by absolving them for personal responsibility for actions. It is so often the case that we are told that people from disadvantaged backgrounds are pushed into petty crime by bad schools, or that majority migrant neighbourhoods show a higher propensity to criminality purely because they are poor. The same logic is so often applied to terrorists — Islamist killers — because they have apparently experienced alienation and Islamophobia. This pushes responsibility for these despicable acts from the shoulders of killers onto those of normal Western folks who just aren’t caring and welcoming enough to love-bomb the kill instinct out of religious fanatics. These ideas deny the very real free will of all humans to do good or bad regardless of their upbringing and environment, but which is sadly sometimes turned to terrorism. So, who was really responsible for Wednesday’s attack? Khalid Masood, or the people of Northiam, East Sussex. The Telegraph seem to have made their minds up.  \n",
      "Correctiv, the allegedly non-partisan “fake news” censor working with Facebook in Germany is funded by groups linked to left-wing billionaire George Soros and the establishment media.[A new investigative report from anti-mass migration NGO Einprozent has revealed who is behind the new organization employed by Facebook to report and censor what they consider to be “fake news.”, advertisement, According to the NGO, Correctiv is largely staffed and funded by those who were formerly establishment journalists, many of them writing for left-leaning publications. They say that the top donor to Correctiv is the Brost Foundation, set up by the former head of the publishing company FUNKE Media Group, Erich Brost. The foundation has given €925,000 to get Correctiv off the ground. Mr. Brost is also the former employer of Collectiv’s CEO, David Schraven, who worked as a leading researcher for Funke group until 2014 and previously worked at the far-left paper Die Tageszeitung or TAZ. The chief editor of Correctiv, Markus Grill, meanwhile has worked for both the left-wing magazine Stern, which last April associated anti-mass migration Alternative for Germany supporters with Nazis, and magazine Der Spiegel which has run a series of covers and articles directed against U.S. President Donald Trump. €114,000 has been donated by the Dutch organization The Adessium Foundation which works on climate change and environmental issues and is openly funded by George Soro’s Open Society Foundation. Soro’s Open Society Foundation has also given €26,884 directly to Correctiv. George Soros and the Open Society foundation have been linked to the funding of pro-migrant campaigns to promote Somali migrants in the past, and have spent money on trying to influence the elections of various European Union countries in favour of left-wing open borders parties, with the aim of destroying populism. All the money pouring into the organization has led to comfortable salaries for the two men in charge of Correctiv. According to the report, David Schraven earns in excess of 9,000 euros a month and Markus Grill earns over 7,000 per month, salaries far larger than that commanded by average German journalists. In January Correctiv released a report on ‘alternative media’. Every media platform listed was to the right of centre, calling into question their claims of being independent and unbiased. The German government has also been devising ways to crack down on what they regard as “fake news” before the 2017 federal election, setting up what Interior Minister Thomas De Maiziere has called a “defence centre against disinformation.”  Many have criticized the move and likened the centre to an Orwellian Ministry of Truth.  ,  ,  \n",

      "Transgender activists are furious the BBC is to show a documentary featuring an expert who believes that helping children with gender issues feel comfortable in their own bodies is preferable to encouraging them to live as the opposite sex.[Activists concerned about the film Transgender Kids: Who Knows Best? say they fear that the decision of the BBC to give airtime to the views of Canadian psychologist Kenneth Zucker will “damage the lives of trans children” and lend weight to opinions “found in places like the Daily Mail”. advertisement, Zucker was fired and the world-renowned child gender clinic he ran for 30 years was shut down at the end of 2015.  Many academics in the field of sex research say this was as a result of a sustained political campaign by activists in a fight which “resembles other culture war battles”. The Canadian psychologist disagrees with the now-widely favoured “gender affirmative” approach which identifies young children as being transgender and encourages them to ‘socially transition’ by changing their name and clothes, among other things. Clinicians at Zucker’s Gender Identity Clinic took a more cautious approach, believing it preferable to first “help children feel comfortable in their own bodies” with the view that “gender is quite malleable at a young age and gender dysphoria will likely resolve itself with time”, according to New York magazine. “The problem with putting Zucker on a programme like this is it gives further weight to those voices in places like the Daily Mail who say parents who let their children live as a different gender are evil or inhumane. It can be quite destructive,” Michelle Bridgeman, a psychotherapist for children with gender dysphoria told The Guardian. Susanne Green, the CEO of Mermaids UK — a charity which supports ‘trans children and their parents’ branded the BBC “irresponsible” for broadcasting a show which she believes will make young people’s lives “so much worse”. “The BBC have not thought for a second for how this will damage the lives of trans children, and their fight every day to be authentic. The negative environment will only be increased because it’s being done by a mainstream channel. People respect the BBC, and they believe them,” she told GayStarNews. Green also blasted the BBC documentary’s decision to discuss people who regret ‘transitioning’ to the opposite gender. “Why are you focusing on this angle?” she reported asking the public broadcasting corporation. “It’s very, very rare. When people transition, in the vast majority [sic], their lives become far better. They gave me a spiel about being ‘balanced’ and showing both sides of the story,” she said. The idea of the programme is “very concerning” according to Helen Belcher of Trans Media Watch, who warned that the promotional material for the show alone “may well already have caused harm to trans children and their families. “The BBC, as the nation’s broadcaster, should not be supporting the view that there is a legitimate debate to be had over being trans”, the Liberal Democrat activist said to GayStarNews.\n",
      "Impeached President Dilma Rousseff has been convicted on a 61-20 vote by the Brazilian Senate, removing her from power in a move she denounced as a coup.[The Wall Street Journal describes Rousseff as “a former leftist guerrilla who defied a dictatorship, but struggled as Brazil’s president amid a troubled economy and a fractious political climate.” She was the first female president of Brazil. advertisement, She was impeached because she “used illegal bookkeeping maneuvers to hide a growing budget deficit, deemed an impeachable crime in a nation with a history of hyperinflation and fiscal mismanagement,” as the WSJ puts it. (The mind reels at what would happen if that was an impeachable crime in the United States.), More specifically, the BBC says Rousseff was accused of illegally “moving funds between government budgets,” to “plug deficit holes in popular social programmes to boost her chances of being re-elected for a second term in October 2014.”, “The outcome was widely expected, though only partly because of the legal evidence marshaled against her,” the Journal writes. “Well before the trial’s final phase opened last week, Ms. Rousseff’s administration had been upended by a brutal recession and a massive corruption scandal at the state oil company that splintered her political base and devastated her popular support.”, Rousseff has been replaced by former Vice President Michel Temer, through the end of her second term in 2018. Unsurprisingly, opinions are divided on whether Rousseff’s ouster will satisfy the Brazilian public, or if Temer will, in turn, fall to widespread public anger at a thoroughly corrupt system and sagging economy. The Journal doesn’t take it as a good omen that Temer was “loudly booed at the opening ceremonies of the recent Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.” Rousseff has described her former ally as a “usurper,” and implied he was a racist for filling his Cabinet with white men. The BBC adds that Temer’s critics say he is planning to “cut many of the popular social programs introduced by the Workers’ Party.”, USA Today describes the Senate’s conviction vote as “an emotionally charged late-night debate,” with Rousseff insisting on Monday, “I did not commit the crimes that I am arbitrarily and unjustly accused of… We are one step away from a real coup d’etat.”, “I know I will be judged, but my conscience is clear. I did not commit a crime,” she told the Senate, suggesting many of the lawmakers judging her were corrupt themselves, and were persecuting her to cover their own involvement in the massive bribery scandal surrounding Brazil’s national oil company, Petrobras. “From the day after I was elected, several measures were taken to destabilise my government. And you have been systematically making accusations against me,” Rousseff lectured her adversaries.\n",
      "Deaths by suicide have risen dramatically over the past 15 years in the United States, with a sharp uptick during the last ten years, and people are now more than twice as likely to die from suicide than from homicide, according to recent studies.[While the violent crime rate in the United States has fallen steadily for decades, and modern medicine has reduced the fatality rates of disease and accidents, suicide is experiencing a sharp increase. Suicide is now one of the 10 leading causes of death in the United States with more than 40,000 people a year taking their own lives. advertisement, Earlier this year the National Center for Health Statistics published a major study on national trends in suicide. The Center found that in the fifteen-year period from 1999 to 2014, the age-adjusted suicide rate in the United States increased by a stunning 24 percent, with the pace of increase accelerating significantly after 2006. This rapid rate of increase followed on a period of nearly consistent decline in suicide rates in the United States for the prior fifteen years, from 1986 through 1999, the study notes. According to an essay by Frederik Deboer in Foreign Policy, this disturbing trend has received remarkably little attention. So whereas there are daily news stories concerning climate change, he notes—which has yet to claim a single victim—suicide kills tens of thousands a year and yet gets virtually no attention in the news. White Americans are much more likely to commit suicide than black, Hispanic, and Asian Americans, Deboer observes, a trend that seems correlated to “the declining fortunes of the white working class.”, This group has suffered economically because of the rise of offshoring and the demise of stable careers for those lacking a college education, he says, resulting in a dramatic rise in problems like unemployment and addiction among the white working class. Suicide has reached such epic proportions in the United States that sociologist Matt Wray of Temple University has coined the term “suicide belt” to describe the north-south swath of American states — Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, and Wyoming — that have particularly high suicide rates. While some of the causes of increased suicide are endemic to the nation’s economic woes, others can be tied to societal trends, such as the recent craze surrounding transgenderism. Rather than deal with the underlying psychological problems associated with gender dysphoria, the tendency has been to cater to the perceived desires of gender confused individuals, with disastrous results. Strikingly, suicide rates are twenty times higher among adults who use cross-sex hormones and undergo sex reassignment surgery than for the rest of the population, which causes wonder that such radical and ineffective remedies would be pushed with such abandon. Moreover, the correlation between suicide rates and gender reassignment has little to do with society’s views of transgender individuals, and has shown to hold even in Sweden, which is among the most LGBTQ-affirming countries in the world.

      "During one critical exchange at today’s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on FBI oversight, FBI Director James B. Comey testified about why the intelligence community purportedly believed that Russia favored Donald Trump for U.S. president over Hillary Clinton.[Comey confirmed that the basis for the intelligence community’s assessment that Russian President Vladimir Putin allegedly wanted Trump in office was not because the billionaire was, as Sen. Al Franken claimed without citing any evidence, “ensnared in” Russia’s “web of patronage.”, advertisement, Instead, the FBI chief provided two primary reasons for Russia allegedly favoring Trump over Clinton during the 2016 presidential race. One reason, according to Comey, was that Putin “hated” Clinton and would have favored any Republican opponent. The second reason, Comey explained, was that Putin made an assessment that it would be easier to make a deal with a businessman than someone from the political class. Comey’s statements provide a rare window into the intelligence community’s assessments about Russia and Trump. The comments are a far cry from the conspiracies alleging Putin held blackmail information over the billionaire.  In fact, in the exchange, Comey refused to lend any weight to those claims. Those conspiracies were fueled by a controversial 35-page dossier alleging collusion between Russia and Trump’s presidential campaign. The dossier contains wild and unproven claims about Trump and sordid sexual acts, including the widely-mocked claim that Trump hired prostitutes and had them urinate on a hotel room bed. In today’s exchange, Franken stated that “the FBI, CIA and the NSA all concluded that Russia did in fact interfere in the 2016 election in order to, quote, help President-elect Trump’s election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton. And the agencies concluded that the Russians had a clear preference for President Trump.”, Franken asked, “What is your assessment of why the Russian government had a clear preference for President Trump?”, Comey replied:, The intelligence communities’ assessment had a couple of parts with respect to that. One is he wasn’t Hillary Clinton, who Putin hated and wanted to harm in any possible way, and so he was her opponent, so necessarily they supported him. And then also this second notion that the intelligence community assessed that Putin believed he would be more able to make deals, reach agreements with someone with a business background than with someone who’d grown up in more of a government environment. Not satisfied with Comey’s response, Franken further probed whether the intelligence community believed Russia wanted Trump in office because of Trump’s business interests, claiming that Trump “had already been ensnared in their web of patronage.”, Franken asked:, OK, well, I’m curious about just how closely Russia followed the Kremlin playbook when it meld (ph) in our democracy, specifically whether the Russians had a preference for President Trump because he had already been ensnared in their web of patronage — web of patronage is a quote from the report. Is it possible that in the Russian’s views — view Trump’s business interests would make him more amenable to cooperating with them, quote, more disposed to deal with Russia as the I.C. report says?, Comey replied, “That was not the basis for the I.C.’s assessment.”, Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

      "A self-described “leading” Muslim group is fundraising on the back of “jihad” in the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, using pictures of President Donald Trump, Brexit leader Nigel Farage, UK Prime Minister Theresa May, and UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson on its material.[The Muslim Public Affairs Council UK (MPACUK) issued a tweet at 1:30pm EST on Monday May 29th with an alleged hadith (story/quote) from the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. It reads: “The best Jihad is the word of Justice in front of the oppressive ruler”. advertisement, DONATE to MPACUK this #Ramadan &gt&gt&gt https://t.co/YsMQMY5fp5 pic.twitter.com/QhXNeYFIqO, — MPACUK (@MPACUK) May 29, 2017, , The tweet, which follows with “This Ramadan Help Us Fight the Good Fight!” as well as “Money = Manpower = ACTION” comes just days after a violent Islamic terrorist killed 22 and injured dozens outside the Manchester Arena in the United Kingdom. The quote is — as much of the Quran and hadiths are — disputed amongst scholars to its precise meaning, though some agree it means “speak truth to power”. The progenitor of the hadith is also believed to have fabricated information. It is also unclear how Mr. Farage, pictured above, could be considered a “tyrant” while holding no executive office, and indeed how UK PM Theresa May would fit, given her repeated declarations in favour of Islam. Some may reflect upon the insensitivity of promoting a word or belief system that was used just days before to slaughter innocent people in the West. Islamic groups in the United Kingdom have also noted how “oppression” or “oppressive rulers” simply means any legal system besides Shariah law, established under an Islamic caliphate. The Islamist group Hizb-ut Tahrir UK notes on its website concerning the quote: “We have tried so called ‘democracy’ in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Iraq and we have seen the fruits. Whereas in the past one tyrant and his family would loot the wealth, now we have a whole cabal of so-called ‘democrats’ who are looting our wealth and pushing our countries into sectarian chaos”. They add: “‘Democracy’ is nothing more than a mirage that the West trumpets to give people the feeling that there is change. They only allow democracy if elections bring to power those they want. Zardari, Hasina, Karzai, Maliki and Erdogan are the products of this democracy. Elections in a system that is so inherently corruptible does nothing more than to give legitimacy to those who serve Western interests”. Lastly, the group notes: “The Ummah needs and is crying for change. This change will only come when we go back to our basis as an Ummah – that is Islam. Establishing the Islamic system of government – the Khilafah – is the only way that this Ummah can regain her position as a nation amongst nations”. MPACUK itself is known for a series of controversies, ranging from anti-Semitism and Holocaust denigration to the group’s former leader Ashgar Bukhari giving money to Holocaust denier David Irving, and subsequently claiming that “Zionists” had stolen one of his shoes in the night. The group is now believed to be run by Labour Party consort Raza Nadim, who has defended Al Qaeda terrorists and lashed out at “Uncle Toms” in Muslim communities. The group’s website even hosts a post claiming that the “Uncle Tom” racial slur is perfectly acceptable for those who challenge Islam and Islamism. The link in MPACUK’s tweet takes readers to a LaunchGood crowdfunding page, where they claim to be seeking 20,000 GBP ($25,000 USD) in order to build an “Anti-Islamophobia Nerve Centre”. The website quotes Sulaiman Ghani, a preacher who backs the idea of an Islamic caliphate, and has previously targeted Ahmadiyya Muslims who are routinely oppressed by Sunnis in the United Kingdom and abroad. The “nerve centre” is reportedly supposed to “mobilis[e] 10,000 Muslims across the UK and take part in social media storms that would push [politicians and the media] onto the back foot and make them accountable to [MPAC]”.

But since being taken over by Russian billionaires Alexander and Evgeny Lebedev, the paper has suffered not just a decline in its already low readership, but also a slew of journalistic faux pas. Recently, the paper published falsehoods asserted by one its flagship columnists, Yasmin Alibhai Brown, as well as repeatedly calling for smear tactics to be used to discredit Eurosceptic voices in Britain. The paper has become increasingly reliant on “clickbait” articles on its i100 website, a site that pumps out 200-word media reaction stories and internet memes.

      "WASHINGTON — Only three of the 58 U.S. Army Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs) are capable of immediately joining the fight in the event of a major conflict, Gen. Daniel Allyn, vice chief of staff of the Army, told lawmakers.[According to the general, about one-third of the 58 BCTs in the Army, the largest U.S. military branch, are deemed ready, but “only three” of those “could be called upon to fight tonight in the event of a crisis.”, advertisement, The rest would require about 30 days to prepare. That means only about five percent of brigade combat teams are ready to engage in immediate combat in the event of a major conflict. Gen. Allyn also warned that only one-fourth of the Army’s Combat Aviation Brigades and half our the branch’s Division Headquarters are ready to carry out their duties, noting that due to budget cuts and constraints the soldiers can only do what the country requires of them while assuming “high risk.”, He revealed:, In total, only about 2/3 of the Army’s initial critical formations — the formations we would need at the outset of a major conflict — are at acceptable levels of readiness to conduct sustained ground combat in a full spectrum environment against a highly lethal hybrid threat or near-peer adversary. Stated more strategically, based on current readiness levels, the Army can only accomplish Defense Planning Guidance Requirements at high military risk. Gen. Allyn’s comments came during a House Armed Services Committee hearing Tuesday focused on the state of the U.S. armed forces. He explained:, When we say fight tonight that means that unit needs no additional people, no additional training, and no additional equipment and that is where we’re at today. And those we say are ready — the [estimated] one third of our forces that are ready — require somewhere in the range of 30 days to ensure that they have everything they need to meet the demands of immediate combat. “You’re kind of hoping an enemy would be accommodating and give us the 30 days so that we can be ready,” noted Rep. Mac Thornberry, chairman of the House armed services panel. As it stands now, the U.S. Army risks a belated response to a major crisis, warned the Army general. Referring to readiness, he testified:, Basically what it comes down to is the term… from Gen. [Douglas]  McArthur “We would be too late to need.” Our soldiers will arrive to late. Our units will require too much time to close the equipping and manning and training gaps. And as you highlighted “hope” is not a method and we cannot count on the enemy providing us that window of opportunity to close those those gaps. The end result is excessive casualties both to innocent civilians and to our forces…”, Budget cuts and policy decisions have decimated the U.S. military, both in terms of manpower, equipment, and, most importantly, readiness, according to the high-ranking officials from the various branches, including Gen. Allyn, who testified Tuesday. “To meet the demands of today’s unstable global security environment and maintain the trust placed in us by the American people, our Army requires sustained, long-term, and predictable funding,” declared Army Gen. Allyn. “Absent additional legislation, the caps set by the Budget Control Act of 2011 [also known as sequestration] will return in FY18, forcing the Army to once again draw down end strength, reduce funding for readiness, and increase the risk of sending under-trained and poorly equipped Soldiers into harm’s way – a preventable risk our Nation must not accept.”, President Donald Trump’s administration and the Republican-controlled Congress have vowed to rebuild and expand the U.S. military after years of reductions. U.S. Army manpower levels stand at their lowest since before World War II. Moreover, Adm. William Moran, vice chief of naval operations, said the “Navy is smaller today than it has been in the last 99 years.”, He confirmed that more than half (53 percent) of all Navy aircraft cannot fly primarily due to a lack of funding. The 53 percent figure “represents about twice the historic norm,” notes Defense News. Gen. Stephen Wilson, vice chief of staff of the Air Force, testified that his branch is the smallest it has ever been. The U.S. Air Force has become the “smallest, oldest equipped, and least ready in its history,” the Air Force general told lawmakers. Gen. Glenn Walters, assistant commandant of the Marine Corps, told lawmakers that, under the current funding levels, U.S. Marines are expected to “experience increasingly significant challenges to the institutional readiness required to deter aggression and, when necessary, fight and win our Nation’s battle.”, Furthermore, he noted, “Approximately 80% of our aviation units lack the minimum number of ready basic aircraft (RBA) for training, and we are significantly short ready aircraft for wartime requirements.”\n",
      "ESPN’s president says that all the layoffs and retooling show that his network is addressing its problems in a “realist” manner. But, despite the recognition that the network faces major problems, none of that retooling will take aim at one of its customers chief complaints: the network’s liberal bias.[In an appearance before ESPN’s media buyers, ESPN chief John Skipper insisted that the nearly 40-year-old sports network is working hard to address its shortcomings. “The current environment forces us to be realists as well as optimists,” he insisted, The Hollywood Reporter said. advertisement, “Let me be up front at this upfront — ESPN is responding to change, and we are making changes from the most dramatic position of strength,” he added. These admissions come only weeks after ESPN laid off over 100 on-air personalities and sports reporters in an epic move deemed “more than a bloodbath,” late in April. The layoffs came just before Disney’s second-quarter financial report, and also on the heels of the company’s announcement of a major financial deficit due to high costs of keeping the sports cable network afloat. ESPN has steadily lost ground and profitability over the last decade, losing over 10,000 subscribers a month while being saddled with hundreds of millions in broadcast fees levied by the various national leagues. ESPN has reportedly lost over 12 million subscribers over the last five years alone. Many fans have said they have lost interest in ESPN because of the avalanche of liberal talking points that constantly roll out of the mouths and pens of the network’s contributors. Indeed, several new polls have shown that fans with a center-right ideology have abandoned the channel. In one case, a recent poll of sports fans found that Republicans have lost confidence in the sports channel’s brand name, and just last week a review of viewers in a swing state market showed that center-right fans have stopped watching ESPN in large numbers. But, Skipper made no mention at all about the network’s liberal bias problem. This may not be surprising because in the past, Skipper has promised that he won’t lift a finger to end the bias. “It is accurate that the Walt Disney Company and ESPN are committed to diversity and inclusion,” Skipper said in an article published last year by network ombudsman Jim Brady. “These are long-standing values that drive fundamental fairness while providing us with the widest possible pool of talent to create the smartest and most creative staff. We do not view this as a political stance but as a human stance. We do not think tolerance is the domain of a particular political philosophy.”, Clearly, Skipper has no intention of putting a lid on his network’s liberal content.

      "Author and former investigative reporter for The Washington Post and Boston Herald Ron Kessler is backing up assertions first reported by Breitbart News regarding Hillary Clinton from former Secret Service agent Gary Byrne’s forthcoming book Crisis of Character.[Kessler told the Boston Herald, “I think it’s right on. It has to do with her character, the hypocrisy of someone who claims to help the country and yet she can’t bring herself to treat other human beings who are less powerful than she is with respect and dignity. Someone like that can really get out of control once they get in the White House. They have all that power and they become even more arrogant.”, advertisement, Kessler previously penned his own book on Hillary’s time in the White House when her husband Bill was president. “She would actually, even recently, tell agents she didn’t want to see them when they were at events. She literally wanted them to hide behind curtains,” Kessler told the Herald. Clinton has tried to portray Donald Trump as a “loose cannon” in interviews, but Byrne’s new book may actually give the presumptive GOP nominee evidence to turn the insult around on her. The Trump campaign fired off a press release yesterday saying the book provides “countless examples of Clinton not having the composure to handle the rigors of the Oval Office.”, While many traditional media outlets have been reluctant to cover the book so far, Trump may force their hand if he hammers away at it during his televised rallies. Breitbart’s exclusive report on details from Byrne’s upcoming book was published earlier this month: Secret Service Agent Book: Raging Hillary Clinton Threw Bible at Agent’s Colleague. One day, UD [Uniformed Division] officers met to review events at their respective postS. A bewildered new officer arrived. ‘Hey you’ll never believe it, but I passed the First lady and she told me to go to hell!’ A second young officer responded, ‘You think that’s bad? I passed her on the West Colonnade, and all I said was ‘Good morning, First Lady.’ She told me, ‘Go f— yourself.’ ‘Are you serious?’ ‘Go f— yourself!’ He imitated her, pointing a finger. At first, the unit’s sergeant challenged the story “but another officer soon corroborated” it. “Our sergeant was speechless,” Byrne writes. “We assured the rookie that this wasn’t the job’s normal atmosphere—at least, not under the previous administration. The sergeant fumed and called the watch commander, who pushed things up the Secret Service chain of command, who said they’d forward it to Chief of Staff Leon Panetta.”, At that point, the Secret Service actually “circulated a memo reminding everyone to report any ‘unusual’ First Family interaction to their supervisors.”, “The new guy (who had earned a Purple Heart fighting the Clintons’ war in Somalia) got an apology for the First Lady’s actions—but not directly from her of course,” Byrne writes. In another excerpt obtained exclusively by Breitbart News, Byrne recounts an episode in which Hillary Clinton—in a screaming, obscenity-laced tantrum wherein she referred to Secret Service agents as “assholes”—vented to Bill Clinton that she thought the Secret Service was out to get them. The book reads:, ‘They f—ed us, Bill!’ Hillary screamed. I stifled a laugh. The president tried his best to calm her down. He couldn’t. Hillary Clinton possessed no perspective. ‘We need to get rid of these assholes, Bill!’ She thought she was being tough—in command—but the issue commanded her. She fumed that the Secret Service’s Uniformed Division, my branch, disloyal leftovers from Papa Bush, conspired against the administration. ‘They’ve had it out for us from the beginning!’ she kept yelling.  \n",
      "Democratic leaders of the California legislature have hired former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to represent the liberal state in future legal battles with the Trump administration.[“With the upcoming change in administrations, we expect that there will be extraordinary challenges for California in the uncertain times ahead,” California Senate President pro Tempore Kevin de León and California Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon wrote in a statement Wednesday. advertisement, “The Legislature will work with the Governor and our next Attorney General to protect California’s economy and our sensible policies on climate change, health care, civil rights and immigration,” the statement says. “The Legislature has retained the services of an expert legal team from the nationally-renowned Covington &amp Burling law firm, led by former United States Attorney General Eric H. Holder, Jr.”, Holder, who left the Obama administration in 2015, “will serve as outside counsel to the Legislature, advising us in our efforts to resist any attempts to roll back the progress California has made.”, “I am honored that the Legislature chose Covington to serve as its legal adviser as it considers how to respond to potential changes in federal law that could impact California’s residents and policy priorities,” Mr. Holder said in a statement, the New York Times reports. “I am confident that our expertise across a wide array of federal legal and regulatory issues will be a great resource to the Legislature.”, California lawmakers’ decision to tap Holder, a lifelong Democrat, seems fitting given his public criticism of Trump. In October, Holder called then-Republican nominee Trump dangerous for implying he may prosecute Hillary Clinton for using a private email server without permission while she was Secretary of State, and destroying tens of thousands of emails on the server. Be afraid of any candidate who says he will order DOJ/FBI to act on his command This is dangerous/so is @realDonaldTrump-he's not qualified, — Eric Holder (@EricHolder) October 10, 2016, , Holder called FBI Director James Comey’s re-opening of Clinton’s private email case a “mistake,” and implied Trump’s election was “rigged” because of voter suppression. But perhaps more troubling is that the Covington &amp Burling law firm, of which Holder is partner, has a history of punishing Republicans and protecting Democrats.  , Holder’s tenure in the Obama White House was plagued by scandal, a fact not lost on one California lawmaker. “It is not surprising that California Democrats would hire someone with a record of lawlessness to represent them,” Assemblyman Travis Allen’s wrote in a statement, responding to what he called the California Democrats’ “Fast and Furious” hiring of Holder. “Eric Holder’s major accomplishments as Attorney General was allowing illegal gun running into Mexico with Fast and Furious and then being held in contempt of Congress for refusing to cooperate with the investigation,” said Allen.  “The goal of the California Democrats is clear: an open border with no restrictions on human traffickers, gun runners and drug smugglers. Eric Holder has the record to help them accomplish this goal.”, Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudson\n",
      "Ellen Pao, the former Reddit CEO who mounted a failed “discrimination” lawsuit against venture capitalist firm Kleiner Perkins, and was forced to resign from Reddit after she failed to turn it into a feminist safe space, is now writing a book on Silicon Valley’s “toxic culture.”[After a string of high-profile failures in the world of tech, Pao now plans to blame it all on Silicon Valley’s alleged sexism and racism in a memoir entitled “RESET.”, advertisement, That’s not an exaggeration, by the way. Here’s her publisher’s press release:, Ellen Pao’s RESET, a fearless first-person account exposing the toxic culture that pervades the tech industry and defined her experiences both as a Kleiner Perkins venture capitalist and Reddit CEO in telling her story as one of the few visible, prominent women of color who have reached the C-suite in corporate America and have dared to speak out about her experience, Pao, now the founder of Project Include, aims to spark a movement to empower other women and minorities. Unlike other former tech CEOs and venture capitalists, Pao is on course to be remembered primarily for complaining about discrimination and lack of diversity — something that always attracts sympathy, if not successful lawsuits, in the hyper-progressive environment of Silicon Valley. Pao is best known for her failed discrimination lawsuit against her former employer, Kleiner Perkins. Pao sought $144 million from the firm for alleged discrimination, but her case backfired as her embarrassing work history was dragged into the courtroom. In the course of the trial, it emerged that she kept a “resentment chart” to keep track of colleagues who slighted her, bullied one co-worker to tears, and reprimanded a female subordinate who took time off work to help her landlord — who had been in a car crash. Pao also served briefly as CEO of Reddit, where she helped trigger the worst period of user discontent in the site’s history, and one of the largest and most high-profile user uprisings in the history of the web, known as the “Reddit Revolts.” Pao’s attempts to make Reddit “safer” by banning allegedly offensive communities did not gel with the site’s userbase, known for their libertarian attitudes to free speech. After such dismal failures, it seems the only thing left for Pao to do is blame the white male patriarchy.

      "Far from weakening the Environmental Protection Agency, Donald Trump needs to beef it up. Or so says a guy in the New York Times by the name of William D. Ruckelshaus.[In a March 7 op-ed in the Times, Ruckelshaus writes:, advertisement, A strong and credible regulatory regime is essential to the smooth functioning of our economy. Interesting use of the word “credible” there from the worthless bureaucrat who, perhaps more than anyone, embodies what is so very wrong with the EPA and why it so urgently needs to be reformed. Ruckelshaus, let it never be forgotten, was the EPA administrator responsible for probably the blackest moment in the institution’s history: the man who banned DDT in the U.S. with consequences which resulted in millions of unnecessary deaths around the world from malaria. Sure Ruckelshaus didn’t deliberately murder all those people. But the fact remains that DDT was — still is — one of the most effective killers of the malarial mosquito and that by banning it in the U.S. Ruckelshaus helped create a knock-on regulatory effect which deprived the world of one its best defences against one of its biggest health problems. I told the story a few months back, but it’s worth repeating — and should be repeated every time this dreadful man pops up again and presumes to assume the mantle of an authority he simply hasn’t earned. As I noted then:, A lawyer, by training, not a scientist, Ruckelshaus was the man responsible for instituting the America-wide ban on DDT. He did this on no scientific basis whatsoever. In fact, Judge Edmund Sweeney had presided over a seven-month EPA hearing, examining more than 9,000 pages of expert testimony, and concluded:, “DDT is not a carcinogenic hazard to man…DDT is not a mutagenic or teratogenic hazard to man…The use of DDT under the regulations involved here do not have a deleterious effect on freshwater fish, estuarine organisms, wild birds or other wildlife.”, Ruckelshaus, who had not attended the hearings or read the report, overruled him. Which probably made not much difference in the United States. But the knock-on effects of the near worldwide ban that followed meant that DDT could no longer be used to control mosquito populations, which in turn led to an explosion in malaria, causing the death of millions. Subsequently Ruckelshaus has distinguished himself by endorsing Barack Obama for U.S. president in 2008 and most recently, by heading the Washington Blue Ribbon Panel on Ocean Acidification. [Ocean Acidification, of course, being yet another scientifically dubious scare story designed mainly to prop up the lucrative global anti-carbon-dioxide industry], I don’t doubt — as Ruckelshaus claims in his New York Times article — that the public, whatever their politics, are keen to have clean water and clean air. But the way he puts it smacks of the dishonest rhetoric of the D.C. Establishment using emotive cheap tricks to try to protect their power base and their revenue stream. Ruckelshaus writes:, Voters may have supported Donald J. Trump believing his campaign rhetoric about the E.P.A. But they don’t want their kids choking on polluted air or drinking tainted water any more than Hillary Clinton voters, and as soon as the agency stops doing its job, they’re going to be up in arm. Yadda yadda, creep. No more should we take lectures from you on childcare than we would have done from King Herod. No one’s suggesting that the EPA should pull back on its good regulations. It’s just the bad regulations that we’re worried about. And no one knows more about bad regulations than you do, Mr. Ruckelshaus. Truly, with your scientifically illiterate, politically opportunist and outrageously damaging actions on DDT, you set the bar.\n",
      "The day after he sat in the back row of the House of Representatives chamber to hear President Donald Trump’s first address to a joint chamber of Congress, Rep. Ryan Zinke (R.-Mont.) was confirmed by the Senate as Interior Secretary with strong bipartsan vote 68-31.[Sixteen Democrats joined 51 Republicans with Sen. Angus King (I.-Maine), who caucuses with Democrats, to vote for Zinke. advertisement, Zinke told Brietbart News on Wednesday he had a good time during his last his last session of Congress as a Member of Congress, checking in with his buddies and taking in the spectacle. “I enjoyed it,” he said. “I enjoyed the camaraderie and I can’t wait to get to work.”, The president gave a great speech, he said. “Like millions of Americans, I was in the audience and I think he hit it out of the park,” he said. “For me, the tone was more important,” he said. “To me it was presidential. He did reach out, not just to Democrats and Republicans, but to Americans to find common ground on the big issues ahead of us.”, Going into the vote, Montana’s only congressman said he was not worred that he would not be confirmed. ”, “I’m not particularly controversial, so I’m very confident that I will be the secretary,” he said. “There’s a lot of work to do.”, Zinke said his new boss is looking for results. “The president holds people accountable. He is a man of action and all of us understand that we are there to do a job, roll up our sleeves and get to it.”, Georgia Republican Sen. David Perdue said after the vote: “Congressman Zinke is a great choice to lead the Department of the Interior. Under his leadership, I have full confidence that America will unlock its full energy potential. Congressman Zinke’s experience and commitment to preserving our wildlife and natural resources make him uniquely qualified for the position.”, Alaska Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan said on the Senate floor Tuesday having Zinke lead Interior was good for Alaska and good for America. “Now, there’s been a lot of discussion about Congressman Zinke and he comes to this job with great qualifications,” said the Marine Reserve lieutenant colonel and combat veteran of Afghanistan. “He’s a patriotic and ethical man from a patriotic and ethical part of America: the American West.”, Sullivan said he cherished Zinke’s military service and welcomes a man of the retired Navy commander’s experience taking the helm at Interior. “He’s a Navy SEAL who’s dedicated his life to protecting our great nation,” Sullivan said. “He’s a lifelong sportsman. He’s a trained geologist. He’s a strong advocate for energy independence. He has a keen interest in protecting our environment, while not stymieing more economic growth. Sen. Mazie Hirono (D.-Hawaii) took to the Senate floor Tuesday and was one of the Democrats rising to oppose Zinke. “We need a Secretary of Interior who will protect our public lands, make investments to conserve our endangered and threatened species and who will continue to confront climate change,” Hirono said. “Congressman Zinke voted to block funding for any listed endangered species on which the Fish and Wildlife Service failed to conduct a five-year review,” she said. “It did not seem to matter to Congressman Zinke that the reason why these reviews did not take place was because Republicans and Congress failed to appropriate the necessary funding to produce these reviews,” she said. “His record and past statements demonstrate that Congressman Zinke is not the right person to lead the Department of the Interior at this juncture–at this critical stage, I urge my colleagues to oppose his nomination,” she said. In the end, Zinke’s nomination did not generate the animus among Senate Democrats and their base of Democrats still trying to process what happened to their party Nov. 8. Not only is Zinke an engaging and gregarious politician willing to work with Democrats, as he did a number of times as a congressman, his ascension to the president’s cabinet means he will not challenge Sen. Jon Tester (D.-Mont.). Tester was considered one of the most vulnerable of the 23 Senate Democrats up in 2018. Tester won in 2012 with less than 50 percent of the vote in a state where Trump beat Hillary Clinton by more than 20 points, 56 percent to her 35 percent. All House vacancies must be filled by a special election and Montana state law prohibits the setting of a date for a special election until after the vacancy occurs. Democrat Gov. Steve Bullock is required to set the date for the special election within 100 days of Zinke’s swearing in. Shortly after Zinke’s confirmation, senators invoked cloture on the nomination of Dr. Ben Carson for Housing and Urban Development Secretary. The motion started the chamber’s 30 hours of debate on the nomination, which should be voted on by the Senate Thursday morning.\n",
      "Gender studies is a fake academic industry populated by charlatans, deranged activists and gullible idiots.[Now, a pair of enterprising hoaxers has proved it scientifically by persuading an academic journal to peer-review and publish their paper claiming that the penis is not really a male genital organ but a social construct. advertisement, The paper, published by Cogent Social Sciences – “a multidisciplinary open access journal offering high quality peer review across the social sciences” – also claims that penises are responsible for causing climate change. The two hoaxers are Peter Boghossian, a full-time faculty member in the Philosophy department at Portland State University, and James Lindsay, who has a doctorate in math and a background in physics. They were hoping to emulate probably the most famous academic hoax in recent years: the Sokal Hoax – named after NYU and UCL physics professor Alan Sokal – who in 1996 persuaded an academic journal called Social Text to accept a paper titled “Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity”. Sokal’s paper – comprising pages of impressive-sounding but meaningless pseudo-academic jargon – was written in part to demonstrate that humanities journals will publish pretty much anything so long as it sounds like “proper leftist thought” and partly in order to send up the absurdity of so much post-modernist social science. So, for this new spoof, Boghossian and Lindsay were careful to throw in lots of signifier phrases to indicate fashionable anti-male bias:, We intended to test the hypothesis that flattery of the academic Left’s moral architecture in general, and of the moral orthodoxy in gender studies in particular, is the overwhelming determiner of publication in an academic journal in the field. That is, we sought to demonstrate that a desire for a certain moral view of the world to be validated could overcome the critical assessment required for legitimate scholarship. Particularly, we suspected that gender studies is crippled academically by an overriding almost-religious belief that maleness is the root of all evil. On the evidence, our suspicion was justified. They also took care to make it completely incomprehensible. We didn’t try to make the paper coherent instead, we stuffed it full of jargon (like “discursive” and “isomorphism”), nonsense (like arguing that hypermasculine men are both inside and outside of certain discourses at the same time), red-flag phrases (like “pre-post-patriarchal society”), lewd references to slang terms for the penis, insulting phrasing regarding men (including referring to some men who choose not to have children as being “unable to coerce a mate”), and allusions to rape (we stated that “manspreading,” a complaint levied against men for sitting with their legs spread wide, is “akin to raping the empty space around him”). After completing the paper, we read it carefully to ensure it didn’t say anything meaningful, and as neither one of us could determine what it is actually about, we deemed it a success. Some of it was written with the help of the Postmodern Generator – “a website coded in the 1990s by Andrew Bulhak featuring an algorithm, based on NYU physicist Alan Sokal’s method of hoaxing a cultural studies journal called Social Text, that returns a different fake postmodern ‘paper’ every time the page is reloaded.”, This paragraph, for example, looks impressive but is literally meaningless:, Inasmuch as masculinity is essentially performative, so too is the conceptual penis. The penis, in the words of Judith Butler, “can only be understood through reference to what is barred from the signifier within the domain of corporeal legibility” (Butler, 1993). The penis should not be understood as an honest expression of the performer’s intent should it be presented in a performance of masculinity or hypermasculinity. Thus, the isomorphism between the conceptual penis and what’s referred to throughout discursive feminist literature as “toxic hypermasculinity,” is one defined upon a vector of male cultural machismo braggadocio, with the conceptual penis playing the roles of subject, object, and verb of action. The result of this trichotomy of roles is to place hypermasculine men both within and outside of competing discourses whose dynamics, as seen via post-structuralist discourse analysis, enact a systematic interplay of power in which hypermasculine men use the conceptual penis to move themselves from powerless subject positions to powerful ones (confer: Foucault, 1972). None of it should have survived more than a moment’s scrutiny by serious academics. But it was peer-reviewed by two experts in the field who, after suggesting only a few changes, passed it for publication:, Cogent Social Sciences eventually accepted “The Conceptual Penis as a Social Construct.” The reviewers were amazingly encouraging, giving us very high marks in nearly every category. For example, one reviewer graded our thesis statement “sound” and praised it thusly, “It capturs [sic] the issue of hypermasculinity through a multi-dimensional and nonlinear process” (which we take to mean that it wanders aimlessly through many layers of jargon and nonsense). The other reviewer marked the thesis, along with the entire paper, “outstanding” in every applicable category. They didn’t accept the paper outright, however. Cogent Social Sciences’ Reviewer #2 offered us a few relatively easy fixes to make our paper “better.” We effortlessly completed them in about two hours, putting in a little more nonsense about “manspreading” (which we alleged to be a cause of climate change) and “dick-measuring contests.”, No claim made in the paper was considered too ludicrous by the peer-reviewers: not even the one claiming that the penis is “the universal performative source of rape, and is the conceptual driver behind much of climate change.”, You read that right. We argued that climate change is “conceptually” caused by penises. How do we defend that assertion? Like this:, Destructive, unsustainable hegemonically male approaches to pressing environmental policy and action are the predictable results of a raping of nature by a male-dominated mindset. This mindset is best captured by recognizing the role of [sic] the conceptual penis holds over masculine psychology. When it is applied to our natural environment, especially virgin environments that can be cheaply despoiled for their material resources and left dilapidated and diminished when our patriarchal approaches to economic gain have stolen their inherent worth, the extrapolation of the rape culture inherent in the conceptual penis becomes clear. The fact that such complete drivel was published in a social science journal, the hoaxers argue, raises serious questions about the value of fields like gender studies and the state of academic publishing generally:, “The Conceptual Penis as a Social Construct” should not have been published on its merits because it was actively written to avoid having any merits whatsoever. The paper is academically worthless nonsense. But they do not hold out much hope for it having any more effect on the bullshit in the social sciences industry than Sokal’s hoax did – because leftist stupidity in academe is so heavily entrenched. As a matter of deeper concern, there is unfortunately some reason to believe that our hoax will not break the relevant spell. First, Alan Sokal’s hoax, now more than 20 years old, did not prevent the continuation of bizarre postmodernist “scholarship.” In particular, it did not lead to a general tightening of standards that would have blocked our own hoax. Second, people rarely give up on their moral attachments and ideological commitments just because they’re shown to be out of alignment with reality.\n",
      "As more and more details emerge concerning Friday’s Ramadan attack on a busload of Christians on pilgrimage, the more it becomes evident that these 29 martyrs died solely because they were Christians.[Survivors of the attack said that the ten masked Islamic State militants did not merely open fire on the bus full of Christian pilgrims on their way to the Monastery of Saint Samuel the Confesor, but that the victims were made to descend from the bus and asked one by one whether they were Christians before being shot by the assailants. advertisement, According to one of the chaplains of the group, Father Rashed, as each pilgrim came off the bus they were asked to renounce their Christian faith and profess belief in Islam, but all of them—even the children—refused. Each was killed in cold blood with a gunshot to the head or the throat. In a statement Friday, President Donald Trump said the “merciless slaughter of Christians in Egypt tears at our hearts and grieves our souls.”, “Wherever innocent blood is spilled, a wound is inflicted upon humanity,” the statement said. “But this attack also steels our resolve to bring nations together for the righteous purpose of crushing the evil organizations of terror, and exposing their depraved, twisted, and thuggish ideology.”, The attack occurred in the midst of a three-month state of emergency period in Egypt following twin attacks on Coptic churches on Palm Sunday last month that killed some 46 Christians who were in church honoring the celebrations. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for those attacks as well. On Saturday, the Islamic State claimed responsibility for Friday’s slaughter through its Amaq news agency.

He also tweeted about the event, requesting prayers for “our Coptic brethren in Egypt” and highlighting the religious motivation behind the assault. Let us pray for our Coptic brethren in Egypt who were killed because they did not want to renounce the faith. — Pope Francis (@Pontifex) May 27, 2017, , While European leaders repeatedly stressed the importance of combating “global warming” during a recent meeting of the G7 in Taormina, Italy, President Donald Trump stressed the absolute priority of fighting the real and present danger of Islamic terrorism. The President delivered a powerful speech against Islamist terrorism before 55 world leaders from Arab and other Muslim-majority nations in Riyadh earlier this week. In that speech, Trump called for unity in pursuing “the one goal that transcends every other consideration. That goal is to meet history’s great test—to conquer extremism and vanquish the forces of terrorism.”, In this unique and preeminent task, Trump said, “Muslim-majority countries must take the lead in combating radicalization.”, “Every time a terrorist murders an innocent person, and falsely invokes the name of God, it should be an insult to every person of faith,” Mr. Trump said. “Terrorists do not worship God, they worship death.”, Follow Thomas D.

      "The DePaul University Black Leadership Coalition has released a five-page statement regarding Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos’ visit to the college in May.[The Black Leadership Coalition, which represents black students and faculty members at DePaul, is apparently not satisfied with the university president’s grovelling attempts to placate them, and is now engaging in the age-old progressive tactic of a diversity shakedown — give us what we want, or we’ll call you racist. advertisement, Because the college allowed Yiannopoulos to speak on campus, the Coalition is now calling for:, “The community of African descent at DePaul is deeply offended and disappointed with the manner in which President Holtschneider has handled the controversy both preceding and subsequent to the Yiannopoulos campus visit” reads the statement. “DPUBLC strongly believes that the Yiannopoulos event is merely the tip of the iceberg and symptomatic of larger racial tensions at DePaul.”, The statement goes on to express frustration at the lack of support for students suffering from “microaggressions” and “racial profiling” at the school, before also complaining about chalk signs on the campus that said “Build the wall” and “Blue Lives Matter”, a popular slogan used to defend police officers killed in duty. “It was in this charged atmosphere that the DePaul College Republicans decided to host the “Dangerous Fa**ot: Feminism is Cancer” tour, featuring Milo Yiannopoulos, “a popular media figure who routinely uses his platform to engage in violent, sexist, transphobic, and racist rhetoric”” claims the statement, calling Yiannopoulos “violent” despite his calm and peaceful reaction to the event which was interrupted by two Black Lives Matter activists who stole the moderator’s microphone before threatening to assault Yiannopoulos. The Black Leadership Coalition then goes on to blame college president Holtschneider, citing his failure to refuse Yiannopoulos entry to the college. President Holtschneider’s failure to effectively interpret likely events exposed faculty, staff, and students of African descent, as well as members of other marginalized groups, to threats of physical harm, animus, and hostility. Perhaps most troubling and potentially damaging, in the aftermath, the administration has engineered a clever reframing of events that ignores its culpability, disregards the longstanding racial tensions on campus, and places blame on the African American protesters. Although framed as a free speech issue, the event was in fact a safety issue. There is no right to free speech that justifiably places members of the DePaul community at risk. We, the members of the DePaul University Black Leadership Coalition (DPUBLC), believe that Father Dennis H. Holtschneider is disconnected and out of touch with issues facing DePaul’s community of African descent, and we are not confident in his ability to effectively resolve problems affecting it. Instead of standing up for Yiannopoulos’ right to freedom of speech and the First Amendment in general, Holtschneider grovelled to the far-left protesters shortly after the event, claiming “There is no precept of free speech known to the law, to morality, or to common sense, that required marginalized communities of students to sit quietly as supplicants while the campus that their tuition, grant and loan dollars fund was deployed as a sounding board for their own belittlement based on their race, gender, and sexual orientation”. Holtschneider also claimed that students “were still shaking from the frightening effects of the hate speech they experienced” in his statement that attempted to win back protesting students to no avail. The Black Leadership Coalition finished their statement with a list of eight demands, which include more specialised diversity staff and an “African American Center for students, faculty, and staff of African descent” before doubting the leadership of President Holtschneider.\n",
      "Campus leaders at James Madison University in Virginia have handed out a seven-page “free speech guide” to freshmen as part of their university orientation, which included a list of 35 things no student should ever say.[In a copy of the book obtained by The College Fix, it states that phrases such as “some of my best friends are,” “you speak the language very well,” and “I treat all people the same,” are “dumb but well intentioned” phrases that students should always try to avoid. advertisement, It argues that these phrases only “widen the diversity gap” at the university and inhibit the building of a “safe and inclusive environment” where every student always feels comfortable. Here is a full list of the 35 phrases:, 1. “Some of my best friends are …”2. “I know exactly how you feel.”3. “I don’t think of you as …”4. “The same thing happens to me too.”5. “It was only a joke! Don’t take things so seriously.”6. What do ‘your’ people think.”7. “What are you?” or “Where are you really from?”8. “I don’t see color” or “I’m color blind.”9. “You are so articulate.”10. “It is so much better than it used to be. Just be patient.”11. “You speak the language very well.”12. Asking black people about their hair or hygiene.13. Saying to LBGTQ people “what you do in the privacy of your own bedroom is your business.”14. “Yes, but you are a ‘good’ one.”15. “You have such a pretty face.”16. “I never owned slaves.”17. “If you are going to live in this country, learn to speak the language!”18. “She/he is a good person. She/he didn’t mean anything by it.”19. “When I’ve said the same thing to other people like you, they don’t mind.”20. Calling women “girls, honey, sweetie pie” or other familiar terms.21. When people of color say, “It is not the same thing.”22. When people of faith say, “Love the sinner, hate the sin.”23. When white men say, “We are the ones being discriminated against now!”24. Referring to older people as “cute.”25. Asking a transgender person, “What are you really? A man or a woman?”26. Referring to the significant other, partner, or spouse of a same gender couple as their “friend.”27. “Why do ‘they’ (fill in the blank) always have to sit together? They are always sticking together.”28. “People just need to pick themselves up by their bootstraps.”29. People with disabilities are “courageous.”30. “That’s so gay/queer. That’s so retarded.”31. “I don’t see difference. We are all part of the same race, the human race.”32. I don’t care if you are pink, purple or orange, I treat all people the same.”33. Asking a transgender person, “Have you had the operation.”34. Saying to a Jewish person, “You are so lucky to have ‘your’ Christmas spread over a week!”35. “Here’s another book on political correctness.”, The guide gives a detailed explanation as to why each phrase is problematic, explaining the “intent” of each statement, before adding its negative “impact.”, For example, the book states the phrase, “You speak the language very well,” is intended as a “compliment to the person who is assumed to be an English language learner,” but in reality it is a “form of racial profiling disguised as a compliment,” implying that a person “doesn’t look or sound American and also asserts there is a proper way to speak English and that all native English speakers are proficient.”, Talking to The College Fix, the university’s head of communications Bill Wyatt claimed that it was “just an exercise, prior to orientation, to get our volunteers to understand how language affects others.”, You can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com\n",
      "Jim Mellon, the investor who correctly forecast the last economic recession, now predicts “years of turbulence” for the European Union (EU) and the “breakup” of the euro currency.[Mr. Mellon — referred to be some as ‘Britain’s answer to Warren Buffett’ — has concluded from his assessment of the current economic climate that Britain is “better off outside the European Union in a comfortably appointed lifeboat in the English Channel, as the Euro Titanic sinks to the bottom of the ocean.”, advertisement, The reason Mr. Mellon’s assessment is worth listening to is because he was one of the few economists to forecast the most recent economic recession, correctly predicting that the U.S. housing crisis would be the “trigger” for that in his book ‘Wake Up!: Survive and Prosper in the Coming Economic Turmoil’. Mr. Mellon sets out what he says are the clear reasons for the impending collapse. France and Italy are in “debt traps,” meaning the are not able to grow their way out of evermore expanding debts. Meanwhile, structural reforms are not available to a French government prevented from employing such measures by striking workers, and in Italy the banks are in “perilous trouble”, as reported previously by Breitbart London. For these reasons, Mr. Mellon says:, “France and Italy are probably going to be the key factors in the implosion of the Eurozone.”, Mr. Mellon concedes that “most people don’t talk about it,” but adds “most people didn’t talk about the coming U.S. housing crisis in 2006.”, He gives it about three to five years before a “big problem in the bond markets in Europe” which will lead to the collapse of the euro and a “continent-wide depression.”  Merely being outside the Eurozone will not be enough to shield us from harm at that time, Mr. Mellon says, as:, “For sure, we will be invited or forced to join in a bailout no matter what the various treaties and so forth say.”, Evidencing this he cites the examples of the Greek and Irish bailouts, and extra money paid into the EU despite Prime Minister Cameron’s pledge that such payments would be made “over his dead body.” He states that “we can’t believe anything that Cameron and Osborne say about their future actions in regard to solidarity with Europe if France and Italy go bust” — something he believes is “a certainty”. Mr. Mellon does identify a potential for rejoining a “genuinely reformed European Union post that event”, but he sees the UK as being “better off” outside the EU. Concluding with his “bottom line message as a businessman, as an economist, as someone who has got a good record in forecasting” he reiterates that staying in the EU will leave us in “deep trouble” and “sinking with the European ship.”, Follow Sarkis Zeronian on Twitter: Follow @SarkisZ or e-mail to: szeronian@breitbart.com// <![CDATA[!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^\n",
      "The United Kingdom’s Brexit from the European Union is a “canary-dying-in-the-coal-mine” warning of disaster for commercial real-estate winners in the globalist economy, just as the Lehman Brothers’ 2008 bankruptcy was a dramatic warning of disastrous losses in middle-class manufacturing jobs.[Domestic production and jobs have increasingly outsourced to the developing world, as “globalism” became the dominant U.S. and E.U. economic strategy over the last two decades. This caused leaders to push down nation’s interest rates to offset lower domestic capital investment, wages and consumption. But those lower rates greatly also amplified income inequality by driving-up the value of commercial real-estate rents and assets. advertisement, Rather than employing the standard response of lowering tax rates and reducing regulations on businesses and individuals, the United States led the European Union to raise tax rates on businesses and individuals while radically increasing environmental regulations to supposedly fight global warming. Stimulating Western economies was left to the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, which slashed interest rates to all time lows levels. More regulations and taxes just raised the cost of production in Western nations during a recession, which ensured the outsourcing of manufacturing jobs was more financially compelling. By the end of 2012, American manufacturing multinationals were employing two fifths of their workforce outside the States. The level of outsourcing of manufacturing jobs by US multinational corporations stood at about 50 percent by May 2016, when the Federal Reserve disclosed that ‘US Factory Orders’ had declined for the 19th month in a row. The top 5 percent of U.S. Households have benefited from globalism since 2008 as their inflation adjusted incomes jumped 13 percent to $332,347. But the middle 20 percent of households’ incomes inch-up by just 3.5 percent to $54,041. This rise of inequality, means that U.S. middle bracket households now have only one sixth the income of the top tier. The E.U. multinational corporate offshoring surge started a few years after the Americans, but a 2012 study by London’s Civitas’ Institute for the Study of Civil Society found:, Over a fifth of manufacturers had offshored production to replace U.K. capacity and another fifth were planning to do so in the future. Over half were going to create offshore plants to increase their capacity and two-thirds also claimed to have outsourced some component manufacturing abroad, with a further fifth planning likewise. Just like the U.S. globalism’s outsourcing evicted millions of U.K. blue collar workers from the middle class. But the U.K. rich also got richer as heavy investors in commercial real estate trusts. Since 2008 to 2015, the demand for white-collar commercial space in London jumped by 40 percent, while regulatory compliance costs shrank the availability of commercial space by 40 percent, according to the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors. U.K. commercial real-estate trust values rose by 28 percent and paid 3 percent annual dividends during the period. But as the Brexit vote neared, the Royal Institute warned that concerns about, “Britain’s future position in Europe were weighing on investment.”, Although the June 23 Brexit passage was celebrated by what is left of the British middle class as a triumph over globalism, wealthy U.K. commercial real-estate trust investors are in panic-selling-mode as buyers have evaporated. Since June 24, the management of seven U.K. property trust funds supposedly worth $35 billion have been hit so hard with cash-out demands, they were forced to suspend redemptions. Only fund manager Aberdeen has published a “guestimate” that the Brexit passage’s 2016 impact is a 30 percent loss in value for their commercial real-estate trust holdings. After a short economic contraction, the Brexit’s rejection of globalism will be good for U.K. economic growth, jobs and wages by 2017. But the Brits’ rejection of globalism’s “financialization of economies” is an existential threat to international real estate values.  ,  ,  \n",
      "Presidential elections usually turn on a few, simple macro-issues. While daily campaign brush-fires and controversies get clicks and sell papers, most elections can be predicted with the answers to two simple questions. Do people feel safe? Are they worried about their economic future?[We know the answer to the first question, as terrorism and national security have recently spiked to be the voters’ top concerns in the election ahead. Based on events coming into focus now, we can start to predict how voters will feel about the second question when they cast their ballots. The very weak economic growth that has marked the Obama tenure is about to be flipped upside down. advertisement, Answers to both questions are about to become extremely toxic for Democrats, who have occupied the White House for the last 7+ years. The Clinton political legacy was launched with a simple observation that “it’s the economy, stupid” when it comes to Presidential elections. It is very likely the economy will provide the coda for the Clinton machine. On the first day of trading in the new year, the Chinese Shanghai Index fell 7 percent, sparking losses in financial markets around the world. While the Chinese government is likely to intervene to prop up its stock market, the sell-off is due to more fundamental forces. On Monday, a private economic survey reported that Chinese industrial output had contracted for the tenth quarter in a row. The Caixin/Markit survey of manufacturing purchasing managers came in lower than expected and at a level that indicated the Chinese manufacturing sector was contracting. Official government estimates were slightly higher, but still registered contraction of the industrial sector. Economic analyst Tony Nash, appearing on Breitbart Daily Monday, said China was in an “industrial recession” and plagued with “overcapacity” in its manufacturing sector. As Nash noted, China has been the source of most economic growth around the globe since the Great Recession. There is increasing concern that without China’s economic growth engine, economies around the world will tip into recession. Another report on Monday added to those concerns. Exports from South Korea fell 13.8 percent in December from the year before. This was much worse than economists expected and a steeper decline than registered just the month before in November. Declines in exports from South Korea were felt in every region, with the drop-off to China being the worst. South Korean exports are often called the “canary in the coal mine” of the world economy, because the nation is the source of so many products consumed around the world. The dramatic drop in exports from South Korea, which obviously are imports everywhere else, shows a steep drop in demand around the world. In the coming weeks, American companies will report earnings for the fourth Quarter. The latest estimate is for earnings across the economy to fall by 4.7 percent in the quarter. This will mark the third consecutive quarterly decline in earnings, i.e. profits. The last time American companies had such a bad stretch of earnings was at the tail end of the Great Recession. One could detail a dozen other economic measurements that point to weakness in the economy, but most of it is academic in an environment of declining world demand and falling profits for U.S. companies. Add in uncertainty in the Middle East and a credit crunch tied to volatility in the oil markets and it is hard to see how the U.S. economy can sustain its already anemic growth. Overlaying all of this, of course, is that fact that the Federal Reserve is now in a period of tightening the money supply. When the Fed increased its discount rate in December, it also indicated that it planned up to 4 additional rate hikes in 2016. Whatever economic growth has existed in the American economy has been inexorably linked to a zero-interest rate environment. The seven year period of essentially free money has expanded credit in financial markets, juiced corporate profits and fueled price inflation in markets and several baskets of assets. The Fed is ending its money party at exactly the same time the economy around the world is showing considerable weakness. If economies were already slowing down while money was free, what happens to the economy when money becomes more expensive?, There was a time that the consequences of bad policy decisions weren’t felt for many years into the future. As with everything else in our world, the pace of change has quickened. The Middle East is descending into chaos largely as the result of policy decisions made by the Obama Administration. Of course there are proximate causes that date back decades, but different choices made just a few years, or even months ago, would likely have produced a more stable environment than we witness today. The same is true of the economy. At the dawn of the Great Recession, rather than let the market sort out the winners and losers, the government stepped in to be the final arbiter. Between Congress and the Federal Reserve, the government pumped trillions of stimulus into the economy hopping to lift the world out of its recession. It worked, for a bit, on paper. Those policy decisions are now coming due, however. National security and terrorism may dominate the political discussion today, but, very soon, the economy will shoot back to the top of the issue agenda for voters. It is very likely that when voters step into the voting booth in November, they won’t feel safe and they will be terrified of their economic future. The Democrats may be doomed before the campaign even gets underway.\n",
      "New winners and new losers are being created as intelligent robots and 3-D printers shrink the payoff from international trade and global outsourcing.[Change can be very rapid, and can take us in very surprising directions. advertisement, For example, innovations in logistics and supply chain management during World War II paved the way for the modern era of globalization.  The June 6, 1944 D-Day invasion involved supply chain buildup and movements for 2.5 million tons of military supplies and the 1.3 million troops in less than one year. War planners pioneered ocean-going containers that could be transported from ship to rail or truck. An American company in 1958 built the world’s first container ship to carry 58 containers, modern ships can now carry up to 20,000 containers. Surging globalized demand for transportation led to the rapid development of Middle East energy supplies. These changes created new economic incentives. The explosion of container shipping meant that goods and parts no longer had to be made in the proximity to their users, according to Stratfor’s Rebecca Keller.  As location became less of a factor in production, the importance of other considerations such as labor costs rose. As low-end manufacturing took off in Asia, supply chains also became longer and more complex. Keller argues that the “creation of the World Trade Organization accelerated globalization by regulating the new economic environment and helping to link producers with their buyers. A number of industries, including the automobile and electronics sectors, were able to take full advantage of the sweeping changes the container ship had wrought.”, Globalization encouraged companies to take advantage of factors such as inexpensive labor and government subsidies, rather than manufacturing near the final market. Coupled with a strong pro-commerce environment, global trade increased tenfold between 1980 and 2007. Raw materials to create laptops are now be sourced from six continents. The LCD screens can come from South Korea, computer chips from Malaysia, other components from Vietnam, and final assembly performed in China. Even the extremely high-tech Boeing 787 is now pieced together by nine different countries in North America, Europe and Asia. But this multi-decade process of globalization is being reversed by the next wave of technology. Advanced robotics, artificial intelligence and additive manufacturing are dramatically lowering the costs of production. Robotics have been around for decades, but innovations in the complexity of programming is allowing increased robotic dexterity to perform assembly of more intricate products, such as those involving complicated wiring and circuitry. Automating away manual assembly processes whose comparative advantage for outsourcing was cheap labor, threatens to undo the biggest driver underpinning globalization and convert extended supply chains into costly legacies. Additive manufacturing, commonly known as “3-D Printing,” is further degrading the cost savings from globalization. Traditional “batch” manufacturing practices require a series of separate molds and multiple steps to achieve economies of scale cost reductions. But 3-D printers can produce multiple designs and perform multiple steps on the same machine. Consequently, batch manufacturing can have “diseconomies of scale” costs. Manufacturers moving to 3-D printing threatens to reverse many of globalization’s cost advantages from supply chain specialization and standardization, encouraging more parts to be made in fewer locations. Manufacturing plastic and composite parts with 3-D printers is already competitive for a growing number of products. But 3-D printing of metal parts is still generally less reliable and more expensive than globalized parts making. But in a decade, 3-D Printing will be cost advantageous. This new industrial revolution will not eliminate all the benefits of cheap labor, but it will shrink the number of countries that can industrialize, diversify and grow their economies. This will make trade more regionalized as production migrates back toward consumer countries. Stratfor suggests that trade blocs such as NAFTA could become virtually self-sufficient over the next couple decades. Regionalization of trade has clear benefits for the United States as a highly-educated and high-wage nation and Mexico as a less-educated and lower-wage nation. But poor nations in East and Central Africa, as well as parts of Southeast Asia, that thought globalization would allow their cheaper labor to eventually replace China as the world’s next manufacturing bases, could face continued stagnation.\n",
      "Fox2Detroit reported Thursday that “a Muslim woman said her boss fired her because she refused to remove her hijab at work. Najaf Khan said the highly controversial comments recently in the political arena are making it harder for people of the Islamic faith and she sees her story as an example of that.”[That is utterly false. What is becoming increasingly difficult in this country is refusing to submit to the blasphemy laws under the sharia. Khan’s case is a pattern, a very deliberate pattern to impose Islam on the secular marketplace. advertisement, One detail of Khan’s case reveals the whole strategy. According to Fox2Detroit, “Khan was entering her third day on the job this past Monday as she walked in wearing her hijab at the Fair Oaks Dental Care in Fairfax, Va. She said her boss immediately took her into his office and told her she couldn’t wear it.”, Why did she only go to work wearing the hijab on her third day there? From the perspective of an outside observer, it seems as though she misled them into thinking that she would dress in accordance with the “neutral environment” they wanted to preserve, and then switched on them after she was already hired. A Muslim woman sued Disney for the very same thing. She, too, applied to and worked for Disney sans hijab. Subsequently, she insisted on wearing the hijab despite Disney’s dress code. Disney’s strict dress, the Disney Look, has been company policy since 1957. Disney issued this statement about the case:, “Walt Disney Parks and Resorts has a history of accommodating religious requests from cast members of all faiths. We presented Ms. Boudlal with multiple options to accommodate her religious beliefs, as well as offered her several roles that would have allowed her to wear her own hijab. Unfortunately, she rejected all of our efforts and has since refused to come to work.”, Of course she did. Disney tried to accommodate Boudlal’s demands, even designing special headcoverings for her that went along reasonably well with the “Disney Look.” But she was unmoved. American Civil Liberties Union attorney Mark Rosenbaum revealed that the suit was all about making Disney bend to Muslim demands. He said: “You never see anyone working there wear a hijab. We want those practices changed, and want training for employees and managers. It’s about getting Disney to change its policies and practices.”, In all these cases, the company bends over backwards to accommodate these supremacist demands. But that’s always taken as a sign of weakness, and accommodation gives way to more demands. In another case in New Jersey, a Muslim woman teamed up with the Hamas-tied Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) to file a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). Why? Because her boss asked her to remove her hijab for safety reasons. This is reminiscent of Samantha Elauf, the devout Muslim who sued soft porn retailer Abercrombie &amp Fitch because she wanted to wear the hijab. She won that case and got herself a healthy cash settlement – and Abercrombie and Fitch had to change the way they do business in order to accommodate her demands. That, in my view, is no doubt part of the objective here as well. According to Fox2Detroit, Najaf Khan “said she didn’t wear her hijab to the office until this week and that is when her boss told her they wanted to keep a ‘neutral environment.’ Her employer asked her to remove it because the Islamic head scarf would offend patients and they wanted to keep religion out of the office.”, But Khan has contacted Hamas-tied CAIR, which will be working hard to make sure that religion is going to be in the offices of Fair Oaks Dental Care whether they want it there or not: “The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) is standing behind Khan and her story. They are calling on the dental office to reinstate her and offer her reasonable religious accommodations as mandated by law.”, Khan suggests that this is all about the false propaganda concept of “Islamophobia”: “Khan said there is a lot of misinformation about the Islamic faith and she hopes her story will at least inform people so it does not happen again.” What there is a lot of misinformation about is the Muslim effort to impose Islam on the secular marketplace. At a certain point, we have to say “Enough” and stop accommodating these arrogant and aggressive demands.

      "Journalists at Berlin’s public service broadcaster were surprised to discover hardline attitudes to newcomers among established migrants in Germany, with some of those interviewed admitting they would like to see many newcomers deported.[Migrants who have lived in Germany for decades said a recent influx of foreigners to the area has had a negative effect on residents’ quality of life, and feel that politicians are not representing their interests. advertisement, The footage has recently come to light after an English-language translation was published to YouTube. Although references to the programme survive on the network’s Facebook page, the original video which aired in September is no longer on the broadcaster’s website. Asking about local issues in Berlin’s Neukölln and Kreuzberg districts, reporters heard “refugees” have driven up rents and damaged the atmosphere in the neighbourhoods they inhabit. Rbb24’s first interviewee, a woman who has lived in Germany for 40 years, described the recent migrant influx as a “catastrophe”. “The refugees, they have to go away!” she exclaimed. Asked whether she believes they should all be deported, the woman shrugs, asserting “they don’t belong here”. “Today’s refugees get social housing, welfare payments. And this, and that, and this. Why?” the woman questions. Asserting, “I’m a foreigner myself”, she proudly tells the reporter she votes for the nationalist National Democratic Party (NPD). A woman wearing a colourful hijab also expressed annoyance at the way resources are being used on migrants. Commenting on the recent surge of foreigners to the area she says: “It’s become a little… terrible around here. Not like it used to be.”, ”Too many people came to Neukölln. When they come they have to earn a living. They have to give something else — don’t give them our apartments for example. Don’t give them our jobs,” the woman explained. A migrant who has worked in Germany for decades also lamented the effect recentimei numbers waves of migrants have had on the area. “I’ve had my market here for 20 years. It used to be good people around here that bought my goods. But now, no one buys anything any more… The Germans all moved away,” he said sadly, adding: “Now there’s only refugees and foreigners here.”, One foreign man asserted that more recent migrants are badly behaved and called for tougher treatment in dealing with offenders. “I’ve been here for almost 39 years, I’m happy, I have a family. I’m proud of my son, I have good children,” he says. “But the foreigners who come now, the ones who came two or three years ago — they’ve caused so much shit in Germany. If I were a German mayor, the mayor of Berlin, I swear to you… When these foreigners steal something — even if it’s small — deport them. Immediately. But they always ramble about a ‘free country’ and ‘democratic’. What the hell does that even mean?”, Other foreigners interviewed by the network bemoaned the effect mass migration has had on the rental market. Asked what he thinks is the biggest problem for people living in Berlin, an African man identified housing. “There’s a problem with the rental prices — it’s uncontrollable. You can no longer get an apartment where you’d like to. It has become too expensive,” he argued. Reporters heard from another Berlin resident that mass migration has sent rental prices “skyrocketing”. The man pointed out that, as a result, “people who have been living here and working here for a long time” are unable to find an apartment. A younger interviewee told journalists: “It would be nice if people who don’t have as much money — students or the unemployed, or people who didn’t have the best jobs — it would be great if they could afford a normal apartment and not only ones in the outskirts or way out in the countryside.”, On a post promoting the feature, on the television network’s Facebook page, a number of Germans remarked that white people expressing the opinions voiced by the foreigners in the segment would be labeled as Nazis.  One user wrote: “If a German went on camera and said what these people have said, they would be put in jail.”\n",
      "Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met with Secretary of Defense James Mattis on Thursday following what the Saudi government proclaimed to be a successful meeting with President Donald Trump. The two reportedly discussed tensions in the Middle East with a focus on “confronting Iran’s destabilizing regional activities.”[According to Gulf news network al-Arabiya, Salman and Mattis held a closed-door discussion for “over three hours” and created an “atmosphere of consensus” regarding the Islamist threats facing both countries in the region. The Pentagon statement confirmed that containing the influence of Iran – whose terror proxies are playing major roles in conflicts in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen – took up much of their conversation. advertisement, The prince, who also serves as Saudi Arabia’s defense minister, told reporters, “Saudi Arabia is ready to send its troops to Syria as the country would do all it takes to eradicate terrorism,” according to al-Arabiya. The network adds that Mattis and Salman were joined by “Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joseph Dunford, the National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, the President’s senior counselor for economic initiatives Dina Powel, the White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, and senior defense and foreign ministry officials.”, The conversation followed a meeting with President Trump Wednesday, after which a spokesman for the prince issued a glowing statement of the U.S. president. “Prince Mohammed considers his Excellency [Trump] as a true friend of Muslims who will serve the Muslim World in an unimaginable manner,” the statement read in part, “opposite to the negative portrait of his Excellency [Trump] that some have tried to promote.” The prince also appeared to support President Trump’s plans to build a wall on the American southern border: “Both sides discussed the Saudi successful experience in building a fence on the Saudi-Iraqi border, which led to preventing illegal entrance of individuals, as well as preventing smuggling operations.”, The prince also appeared to support President Trump’s plans to build a wall on the American southern border: “Both sides discussed the Saudi successful experience in building a fence on the Saudi-Iraqi border, which led to preventing illegal entrance of individuals, as well as preventing smuggling operations.”, Mohammed bin Salman’s meeting with President Trump occurred as King Salman attended scheduled meetings with senior Communist Party officials in China, seeking further investment into the Saudi economy. The emphasis on containing Iran highlights Saudi tensions with the largest Shiite Muslim country in the world, which it regularly accuses of playing a key role in exporting terrorism worldwide. Saudi Arabia itself has a checked history of exporting Wahhabism, an extremist strain of jihadist Islam, and Saudi government officials have been implicated in some of the deadliest terrorist attacks in the world. Saudi Arabia is currently seeking to overturn a law that allows the victims of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks to sue the kingdom for damages, citing al-Qaeda’s communications with Saudi government officials. Iran’s Foreign Ministry has taken the opportunity of the meeting between Mattis and the prince to condemn Saudi Arabia once again, calling his visit to Washington “deluded and fallacious” and accusing Saudi Arabia of war crimes. Mohammed bin Salman, Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said, was “one of the main directors of the Saudi war on the innocent and defenseless Yemeni nation, and the manifestation of terror and horror in Syria, Bahrain and other regional and world countries.”, “The history of the Middle East will teach all, especially petrodollar-dependent states who have through the fantasy and illusion [of being able] to buy security moved to offer a green light to the intervention of foreign players, that they are making a huge mistake because previous interventions by trans-regional powers have only led to insecurity in countries and the states that have summoned the foreign powers,” Qassemi warned.\n",
      "Britain must build thousands more bat-chomping bird-slicing eco crucifixes in order to stave off “dangerous climate change” says the RSPB.[RSPB stands for Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and, no, this is not The Onion. advertisement, Yes, Britain’s oldest and biggest ornithological society really has put out a report demanding the erection of yet more avian Cuisinarts – despite swathes of evidence showing that these monstrosities are responsible for killing many millions of birds around the world every year. Its rationale:, The way that we currently use energy in the UK is not sustainable. We use too much of it, we use it inefficiently, and our main sources of energy, fossil fuels, are driving us towards dangerous levels of climate change – one of the greatest long-term threats to wildlife. In order to save Britain’s wildlife from the alleged threat of climate change, in other words, we’ve got to first got to slice and dice it with the turbine blades that, by some estimates, kill 22 million birds a year. Britain currently has around 5,000 wind turbines. According to the RSPB, it could do with around 20,000 more. More solar panels too. And wave power. And carbon capture and storage. And herds of organic unicorn to harvest all waste and pollution and magically transform it to special fairy energy which can be sprinkled on the cots of every new born child so as to instil in it a true appreciation of Mother Gaia’s beauty. (I may have invented the last one), Mysteriously no mention is made of the actual cost of this exercise. We’re shown a triangle at the beginning which illustrates our ‘energy trilemma’ – Environmental Sustainability Energy Security and Affordability. But that’s the last time affordability gets a look in. To do so would be to ground it in the kind of economic reality that ideological greens like the ones that have infested the RSPB would view in much the same way vampires view garlic and holy water. I’ve written quite a lot before about the disgraceful relationship between the RSPB and the wind industry. It has made hundreds of thousands of pounds from its partnerships with wind companies such as Scottish and Southern Electricity, whose turbines are known to have killed birds including Hen Harriers – a protected species which regularly features in the RSPB’s handwringing doomsday literature. It has even erected wind turbines on its nature reserves. Many ordinary members – ones who prefer their birds alive and flying or perched on a tree rather than, say, decapitated at the foot of a wind tower – find this very upsetting. Some have resigned their membership. But there’s not much they can do because, like its sister eco-fascist organisation the RSPCA, the RSPB’s senior echelons have been hijacked by entryists from the more lunatic end of the environmental movement. Like the proverbial Japanese soldier on the remote Pacific island who refuses to accept that the Emperor has surrendered, these people are stuck in a mental timewarp, in a universe where “global warming” (which hasn’t happened for 19 years) is still a dire threat and where the renewables industry hasn’t been proved to be an unaffordable fraud which does nothing for the environment except deface it with industrial structures. Martin Harper, the RSPB’s Conservation Director who commissioned the report is a case in point. He got his Biological Sciences degree not at the University of East Anglia, as you might expect, but from Oxford. This goes to show just how deeply the rot in science academe of set: Oxford appears not to have educated this green junk-science out of him rather it would appear to have embedded it – and gold plated it with an Oxford BSc. He claims in the report:, The RSPB prides itself on being an evidence-based organisation. This is exactly what the RSPB is not. It’s a prisoner of outmoded group think, producing pie-in-the-sky eco-guff which has about as much to do with the reality of wildlife conservation – let alone with preserving the integrity of Britain’s matchlessly beautiful landscape – as Pol Pot did with enhancing Cambodia’s intellectual tradition. Yet the RSPB – morally, intellectually, and scientifically bankrupt though it is – continues to have the legitimacy of a serious, trustworthy conservation organisation conferred on it thanks to its extremely cosy relationship with the European Union. As Richard North has previously reported, the RSPB has received millions of pounds over the years from the EU, essentially to act as the EU’s sock puppet. Since the very early days, though, the RSPB has been a first class passenger on the EU gravy train, in 1994 fronting a €1,000,000 project on the Preparation of action plans for the recovery of globally threatened bird species in Europe. Typical of its projects is this one where it walked away with a grant of €846,273 – for a total project cost of €1,692,547 – to “raise awareness of the Birds Directive and promote positive land management”, the organisation happily trilling about EU support on its own website. On top of that is the Alde-Ore Project where the RSPB along with its partner in crime the National Trust is splitting €533,145 of EU money in a project worth €1,066,290. The RSPB even got its feet under the table on the “Life for the Bourgas Lake” project in Bulgaria where the lottery winners are sharing €1,775,006, of which €1,331,254 is EU (i.e. our) money. Then there is the Scottish Machair Project where the EU is funding the RSPB and partners to the tune of €1,367,515 in a project costing €2,735,031. There is also the Salisbury Plain Project where the RSPB is a partner in a scheme worth €3,482,722, with an EU contribution of €1,741,361. Between January 2009 and December 2012, there was the TaCTICS project: Tackling Climate Change-Related Threats to an Important Coastal SPA in Eastern England. This involved work on the RSPB Titchwell Marsh bird sanctuary in Norfolk, allowing the RSPB to collect €1,004,830 in EU funding, for a project budgeted at €2,009,660.We mustn’t, of course, forget the New Forest Project either, where the RSPB, with other partners, creamed off €3,744,911 of EU money, out of a total budget of €7,488,389 – the balance funded by the likes of Hampshire County Council. Nor should we forget the Blanket Bog Project in Wales, which raked in €2,824,046 of EU money for the RSPB, with a total of €3,765,394 being spent. Not content with that, the RSPB then got another €2,728,721 from a project costing €4,547,869 for Blanket Bogs in Scotland. That would have gone down really well on the Somerset Levels as a contribution towards dredging costs. All that must be added to the Wise Use of Wetlands co-ordinated by the RSPB, at a cost of €2,108,110 with the EU paying €1,052,044.Taxpayers will also be delighted to know that the Scilly rat removal project, co-organised by the RSPB, had a total budget of €1,107,871. The EU put in €553,935 of our money. With the Broads Authority, the RSPB also managed to chew their way through €1,047,116.69, of which the EU’s contribution was €491,909, on a project called New Wetland Harvests. Many commentators (rightly) complain about the cost of our EU payments, whereas defenders claim that we get the bulk of the money back, through EU-funded schemes. But these are the types of schemes being funded, with the RSPB up-front, filling its boots with our money. It’s a symbiotic relationship. The RSPB gets lots of free money. The EU gets to have its pet projects rubber stamped by a supposedly independent, world-respected conservation body – which also then frequently lobbies the EU to enact more of the environmental legislation that the EU is keen to pass, thus lending the whole exercise a spurious air of popular and independent expert legitimacy. Of course the RSPB is going to call for more wind farms and solar farms because that’s what the EU wants. But this has nothing to do with the conservation interests of Britain’s birdlife, still less with any sympathy with the British environment generally. The best thing for Britain’s birdlife would be if the RSPB were to be shut down by the Charities Commission tomorrow.\n",
      "The State Department has admitted it lost a 2012 email between Hillary Clinton aide Jake Sullivan and a Clinton Foundation employee, which may demonstrate a financial conflict of interest for the former secretary of state.[The Washington Examiner describes the message as follows:, advertisement, The email contained an attachment memo about Greek bonds — a significant detail given the heavy investments Clinton’s son-in-law, Marc Mezvinsky, was making in the Greek economic recovery during that same period. Chelsea Clinton, Mezvinsky’s wife, is a board member at the Clinton Foundation. The fact that one of Clinton’s closest aides shared insider information about the economic climate in Greece with the foundation — just one year after Mezvinsky and fellow Goldman Sachs alum founded a hedge fund that operated primarily by placing bets on international economic trends — raises questions about the many potential conflicts of interest that could have arisen from the Clintons’ web of connections. The email in question was provided earlier this month to conservative-leaning Citizens United through the Freedom of Information Act. Sent in July 2012 from Sullivan to Amitabh Desai, a Clinton Foundation employee, and Justin Cooper, an aide to Bill Clinton, the message indicates a memo titled “Solidarity Bonds Greece Revised” was attached to the email. But after a lawyer from Citizens United asked the State Department to provide a copy of the attachment, government attorneys said the agency “does not have” the original email authored by Sullivan. Mezvinsky was touting a strategy for making money by “betting that the Greek bailout would raise the price of bonds” and had attracted some big investors who also happened to be major donors to the Clinton Foundation. Mezvinsky’s former employer Goldman Sachs was also involved, bringing skills accumulated during what Fox News described as “a checkered history of manipulating the value of Greek debt, to the detriment of Greece.”, The Washington Examiner writes:, Investments in Mezvinsky’s fund came while Hillary Clinton served as secretary of state. While her discussion of the Greek economic crisis in emails is expected given the nature of her position, the fact that her team shared information about Greek bonds with outsiders raises questions. This is not the first time questions about Clinton using government information, possibly including classified documents, to assist Mezvinski’s hedge fund have been raised. Privileged information about Greek bailout plans would obviously have been very useful to the fund Hillary Clinton’s son-in-law was managing. As it turned out, he needed a lot of help because the $325 million fund went belly-up, after losing ninety percent of its value. Citizens United wants to see the “Solidarity Bonds Greece Revised” document that was attached to Jake Sullivan’s email to find out what sort of information might have been flowing from the State Department through the Clinton Foundation, and ultimately to Hillary Clinton’s son-in-law, but now the State Department has evidently “lost” that email, along with its attachment. “Hillary Clinton truly left her mark on the State Department – why do the most important emails always end up missing? The State Department should explain to the American people why this information is unavailable,” said an exasperated J.T. Mastranadi, spokesman for Citizens United.\n",
      "A former curator of Facebook’s trending news section has revealed that the company purposely suppresses content from blacklisted outlets including Breitbart News, despite Breitbart remaining in the top 25 most engaged publications on the social network for 6 months in a row.[The trending news section is located on the right-hand side of Facebook’s homepage, and it links to the world’s most popular and curated news headlines, frequently updating to provide a top news bulletin for Facebook’s over 1 billion users. In an interview with Gizmodo, numerous former curators who wished to remain anonymous discussed the working environment at Facebook’s news department and revealed that certain news outlets were favored among others. advertisement, “It was clear that Zuckerberg could squash the project at any moment,” said one former curator. “We weren’t treated as individuals. We were treated in this robot way,” said another. Curators were “told to select articles from a list of preferred media outlets that included sites like the New York Times, Time, Variety, and other traditional outlets. They would regularly avoid sites like World Star Hip Hop, The Blaze, and Breitbart, but were never explicitly told to suppress those outlets,” wrote Gizmodo after speaking to numerous ex-employees who were mostly hired by Facebook from liberal outlets such as MSNBC, New York Daily News, and the Guardian. “They were also discouraged from mentioning Twitter by name in headlines and summaries, and instead asked to refer to social media in a broader context,” the report claims. The article also revealed that most employees were in their 20s to early 30s and graduated from America’s top Ivy League and private schools. “We choose what’s trending,” said one former employee. “There was no real standard for measuring what qualified as news and what didn’t. It was up to the news curator to decide.”, This would explain why Facebook’s trending news section frequently contains headlines such as “Spanx: Kylie Jenner Shares Image Wearing ‘Body Shaper’ Stockings” and “Eminem: Rapper’s 19-year-old daughter, Hailie Scott Mathers, updates Twitter profile picture” as the top news of the day.  , , , Former curators also admitted to Gizmodo that they had the power to “deactivate” certain topics from trending, meaning stories would be blacklisted from appearing at all on Facebook’s trending news section. “I got the sense that they wanted to keep the magic about how trending topics work a secret… We had to write in the most passive tense possible. That’s why you’d see headlines that appear in an alien-esque, passive language” explained one former curator. Breitbart has remained within Facebook’s top 25 most engaged publications for over six months in a row, and was at number six in the most commented-on English-speaking outlets last July. In March it was revealed that Breitbart sat at number 14 for the largest news publications active on Facebook during January, and in October last year Breitbart sat at number 9 of Facebook’s most shared publishers, just behind the BBC and ahead of Yahoo.\n",
      "A Canadian oil sands group has apologized for an attention-grabbing ad after being subjected to the SJW outrage machine.[The tongue-in-cheek, yet attention-grabbing advert depicted two attractive women kissing one another. Its slogan urged the public to support the oil industry of Canada, where “lesbians are considered hot” as opposed to Saudi Arabia, where lesbians are executed. , advertisement, It thus used humour and sex appeal to convey a serious message to the public. Its effectiveness in grabbing attention also can’t be denied — the picture has already gone viral on social media.  , , Despite the challenge to Saudi Arabia and its patriarchal, homophobic values, social justice warriors still found something to complain about. , “That poster was disgusting,” said one user, according to Global News. “Fetishizing queer women and reducing the existence of lesbians to something for men’s pleasure – for something for men to find ‘hot’.”, “Queen relationships between women may be beautiful but they don’t exist for men.”, Robbie Picard, founder of Canada Oil Sands Community, the group that posted the ad, was initially resilient in the face of the pearl-clutching brigade. “If this draws attention that we are getting fuel from countries that butcher gays and lesbians — I mean, butcher them, hang them, publicly beat them —  then I’m OK to take a few shots if that means it draws attention to the bigger issue,” said Picard, according to the CBC. “I will go on the record saying all lesbians are hot, and I think that people in Canada really need to understand Canadian oil is the best choice. It’s the best choice when it comes to the environment. It’s the best choice when it comes to equality.”, “It’s obviously targeted towards a heterosexual male demographic,” stated Dallas Barnes, former president of Calgary Pride and current InterPride co-vice-president. “Sure, some girls do look like that, but it’s demeaning. It sexualizes.”, Here were some of the other comments left on the group’s Facebook page:, , After receipt of these comments and many more, Picard released an apology. “As a gay Male, I apologize for the poster I posted,” said Picard. “It was not my intent of demeaning women or any people of any sexual orientation.”, “It’s was [sic] rather to highlight injustice done by other countries we are purchasing our oil from. I certainly don’t want to divide our community I believe in equality and human rights.”, Some individuals were still not satisfied. , Canada Oil Sands Community published the following, rather more serious advertisement as a replacement, yesterday. , , While some commenters admired the group’s bravery standing up for gay rights, others were still unhappy:, , It seems Canada Oil Sands learned a valuable lesson: you can never please SJWs.

      "In an email to top Vatican personnel and shared with his network of influential friends in Washington DC and around the world, Leonard Leo has blasted Pope Francis and the Vatican for the cozy photo that was allowed to be taken of Francis with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani that ran in newspapers around the world.[Leo, Executive Vice President of the Federalist Society, one of the most respected groups in Washington DC, wrote a scathing letter to Vatican Secretary of State Christophe El-Kassis, Monsignor Peter Wells, the highest ranking American in the Vatican Secretariat of State, American Greg Burke, the Vatican spokesman rumored to soon be appointed as chief Vatican spokesman. advertisement, Leo wrote, “This morning I was welcomed at the breakfast table with a front-page Wall Street Journal photo of Pope Francis and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani posing together with what only can be characterized as joyful, gleeful, and beaming smiles. I was deeply embarrassed for my Church, and each of you and every other official in the Holy See should be as well.”, Leo said “A fair debate could be had over whether, at the present time, it is advisable for the Holy Father to meet with President Rouhani, I will assume, for purposes of this correspondence, that there are reasonable grounds for doing so, and will not quarrel with that decision.”, “But the gracious and cordial atmosphere depicted in this and every other photo…demonstrate an utter lack of sensitivity to the disgusting and deplorable behavior being undertaken by Iran at this very moment, and, further demonstrate very poor judgment in how to handle a duplicitous and callous human rights abuser like President Rouhani,” said Leo. Leo said he thought it is fine “to meet professionally and quietly with a country and leader” such as the Iranian president but that the way the meeting was carried out and publicized “was a far different thing to undertake such a meeting in ways that outwardly provide a horrible totalitarian regime with legitimacy or moral equivalence and that offer those who are a part of the many religions they oppress and disdain with a sense of hopelessness.”, Besides being Executive Vice President of the Federal Society, which has boasted Supreme Court Justices in its ranks, Leo also served as a commission and chairman of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom. Leo specifically pointed out Iran’s treatment not only of Christians but Bahai’s, Suffis, and Sunnis as well. He pointed out to the Vatican officials that Rouhani has also called for “death to America” and then defended that to the international media. Leo wrote that he hoped the Pope engaged Rouhani on such abuses but that to treat Rouhani and Iran “with such graciousness and cheerfulness is deplorable. Imagine how those Christians in prison would feel if they saw copies of the photos that were splashed about the world in leading newspapers. Perceptions and process matter a great deal in the world of public diplomacy, because that is often what drives leverage and influence. Today was a big mistake.”, The Italian government angered everyday Italians and the Italians press by covering up the statues in perhaps the most famous Roman museum so that the naked figures would not offend Rouhani’s Muslim sensibilities. The Vatican has yet to respond to Leo’s strong missive.  Follow Austin Ruse on Twitter @austinruse\n",
      "Singapore has announced it will begin requiring Islamic religious teachers, or asatizah, to register with the government in January, with a one-year grace period for all currently practicing teachers to qualify.[Asian Correspondent reports the measure is intended to curb Islamic radicalization. A registration system has actually been in place since 2005, but it has been voluntary until now, with an estimated 80 percent of Singapore’s asatizah participating. advertisement, The 20 percent who did not register reportedly mostly teach at private institutions. This includes many older teachers and those who received only informal training from individual mentors. Mandatory registration was reportedly encouraged by Muslim leaders in Singapore, as they were concerned about “the spread of extremist ideology through the Internet via foreign religious leaders,” including ISIS recruiters. The Jakarta Post writes:, About 20 community and religious leaders asked for the scheme to be made mandatory on Saturday at a closed-door dialogue with Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Yaacob Ibrahim and Environment and Water Resources Minister Masagos Zulkifli, where they discussed issues such as the economy and the threat of terrorism. The recent arrest of two Singaporeans who were attempting to join the Islamic State in Syria is mentioned in just about every report on the new mandatory Islamic teacher registration initiative. The Jakarta Post adds that eight citizens have been detained under the Internal Security Act for terrorist activities since January of last year, with many of them “radicalized through the extremist teachings of foreign preachers they came across online.”, “It will be an important assurance to the community that the young get guidance on religious matters from those who are qualified to teach the religion, particularly in the context of a multi-religious Singapore,” said chief executive Abdul Razak of the Islamic Religious Council. The chairman of the board that handles asatizah certification, Ustaz Ali Mohamed, spoke of the need to ensure teachers “have a vision of Islam that is compatible with Singapore as a secular state.”, At a rally on Sunday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said:, I commend the Malay/Muslim community for taking the initiative to deal with a sensitive problem. These measures will ensure that all asatizah in Singapore understand how Islam is practiced here, and can guide their students to live in harmony with fellow Singaporeans of all races and religions. Lee denounced those who “preach separation between believers and non-believers,” according to The Straits Times. “They condemn those who practise other faiths, and sometimes even those who practise the same faith, but in different ways. They advocate practices and customs that would cause grave harm in Singapore,” said Lee. “The Government has to be consistently firm no matter what the religion, in order to safeguard our religious harmony.”\n",
      "MOST POPULAR[On Friday’s “Real Time with Bill Maher” on HBO, host and comedian Bill Maher interviewed Breitbart News Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow. advertisement, The two discussed Breitbart’s coverage, the media, Russia, free speech, the shooting at a congressional baseball practice, and political rhetoric. Marlow said that Breitbart is “not going to cover the exact same stories the exact same way as all the other outlets. We’ll leave that to the rest of the establishment press. We’re very much anti-establishment, trying to highlight stories that we don’t think get their fair day.”, After the discussion turned to Russia, Marlow stated that there was no evidence of collusion or obstruction of justice, adding, “You guys continue to talk about this story in the establishment press instead of talking about the president’s agenda, which is by design. Because you guys won’t apologize if it turns out there’s nothing, no one will come out on MSNBC, they’ll just move on to the next hysteria, and that’s a huge advantage for people like me who are covering the rest of the news.”, Marlow later said, “I love highlighting Muslim voices who are progressive and reformist and want to take out some of the misogyny and some of the hatred associated with radical elements of it. And I think that’s an important place to start, but to bring back what Breitbart does different than anyone else, is we cover stories the establishment press doesn’t want to cover.”, On free speech, Maher and Marlow agreed that if the depictions of the assassination of President Trump were of President Obama, the reaction on the left would be different. Maher then raised corporations pulling ads from people who engage in speech they do not like. Marlow said, “This really started–in my view–in the modern era, with Breitbart–where a lot of people are boycotting Breitbart. And what they’re doing is, there’s a lot of anonymous people online, cowardly people. We don’t know who’s funding them. We don’t know who they are, who are putting out all of this misinformation about who we are and what we stand for, and they’re trying to round up corporations to boycott us. And so, what’s happened is that corporations are now deciding what’s free and fair speech, who can make a living, what opinions you can make a living saying now, and, of course, now, you’re seeing the right fight fire with fire and want boycotts of when the left takes it too far in their Trump hatred. So it’s a very dangerous path we’re on, and I really do think, Bill, and I appreciate you giving me this opportunity, people on the left and the right who are free speech advocates need to come together right now and say that corporations are not going to define the First Amendment and free speech in this country.”, Marlow said that he does not believe Bernie Sanders is at fault for the congressional baseball practice shooting and continued, “When you have a climate where you have, CNN, for example, calling Breitbart to the number one platform for the Nazi salute over a video we never played and CNN played, when you have the New York Times accusing Breitbart of putting racist dog whistles out, when the media lies so much about people, calling Trump supporters racists, despicable, deplorable, all of these things over and over…”, Maher cut in, “They have been racist, despicable, and deplorable.”, Marlow concluded, “I encourage everyone to go to breitbart.com/people. You can meet some of the Breitbart reporters, the Breitbart editors. They’re the most wonderful, diverse, influential journalists on the planet, and no one is interested in their real story because they’re so quick to call people racist. And it’s not working. That is why so many Democrats are losing across the country. … And so, if you want to play that game, Bill, if you want to keep calling us racists, I don’t think it’s going to work for you, so please, have at it.”, Follow Breitbart.tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo.\n"
