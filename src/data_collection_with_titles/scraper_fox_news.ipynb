       "'A recent poll ranks climate change and the environment second only to healthcare among the most important issues to Democratic voters in the first-in-the-nation primary state. The hot-button topic is already a main pitch among progressive Democratic candidates flocking to the state ahead of its February primary and residents say the state’s tourism industry is directly impacted by ongoing environmental changes.GREENFIELD, N.H. – The 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls flocking to the first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire could encounter voters who say they are feeling the effects of climate change in their pocketbooks -- as they seek to woo Democrats who count the environment as a top issue.Tourism is the Granite State’s second-largest industry and accounts for a large portion of the state’s economy. The ski industry alone contributes on average about half a billion dollars a year to the state, but it’s been forced to make some changes over the years to combat a rise in winter temperatures -- an average increase of nearly six degrees since 1970.“We’re a climate-sensitive industry…we rely on cold winters and cold weather,\" Ski New Hampshire president Jessyca Keeler told Fox News. \"We did a four-year study looking at the economic impact of the ski industry in the state of New Hampshire…we can see the impacts of climate change on our operations.\"\\n      \"The New Hampshire environmental community is very strong and Democrats seem to respond to environmental issues much more than they would probably in other parts of the country,\" said The New Hampshire Institute of Politics Executive Director Neil Levesque. Scenic landscapes like this lake near Ossipee, N.H. are easily accessible across the state to residents. (Allie Raffa/Fox News)\\n      OCASIO-CORTEZ, SANDERS CALL FOR CLIMATE CHANGE EMERGENCY MOBILIZATION, SEEKS A RE-DO OF FAILED GREEN NEW DEALSki resorts have experienced environmental changes like higher temperatures and shorter ski seasons, forcing them to use snow guns to keep skiers mobile on the slopes with artificial product and potentially harming industries that profit off of winter activities. They have also started offering summer activities like obstacle courses and ziplining to mitigate economic losses across the ski industry during slow winter seasons.“The rural beauty of our area is what brings people here,” said New Hampshire Democratic voter Dani Shaw. “So it’s very important that in areas that rely on tourism that we put our best foot forward.\" Shaw added: \"We are a beautiful state.”\\n      Cranmore Mountain Resort in Conway, N.H. offers summer activities like obstacle courses and ziplining to mitigate the ski industry\\'s economic losses during slow winter seasons. (Allie Raffa/Fox News)\\n      Keeler says the losses cause a ripple effect.“If we\\'re not doing as well that\\'s not just impacting us, that\\'s impacting whole areas because you\\'re going to probably see less employment or people getting laid off…you\\'re going to see restaurants, retail shops not doing as well. It\\'s not just the ski industry, it impacts entire communities,” she said.A recent CNN poll ranks climate change and the environment second only to healthcare among the most important issues to Democratic voters in the Granite State, an indication of how the topic is playing a prominent role early in the 2020 contest.Democratic candidates -- and voters -- have called on the Democratic National Committee to hold a debate dedicated exclusively to climate change.
