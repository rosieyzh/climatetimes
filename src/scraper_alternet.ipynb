       "['\\nIt is no longer a question of “if” the unthinkable happens, but a question of “when”. And the “when” could happen sooner than you think.\\nFor decades now climate scientists have been worried about what happens if the vast West Antarctic ice sheet melts.\\nThe melting of the ice-sheet, which is greater than the size of Mexico, has always been seen as somewhat of a doomsday scenario as it has to the potential to rise sea level by several metres. This is due to the fact that much of the ice-sheet sits on the ground, rather than floats.\\nScientists have known about the threat for decades. As the respected British environmental journalist, Paul Brown, wrote twenty years ago in his book Global Warming – can civilization survive?: If the West Antarctic Ice sheet melted “it could add between 4 and 7 m (13-23 feet) to sea level rise … such figures appear to create the potential for a series of large-scale catastrophes.”\\nBy its very nature, any sea level rise of this nature would be catastrophic – wiping out most coastal cities and low-lying areas.\\nMaybe because the thought is so unthinkable, it has been easy to dismiss. The deniers and climate sceptics have long responded that this kind of speculation was scaremongering.\\nThe other source of comfort is that even in their worst nightmare scenarios, scientists thought that this would happen over a period of hundreds, if not thousands, of years.\\nBut not any more.\\nScientists now believe that that the vast ice sheet is melting much more quickly than before, in part due to rising air temperatures as well as rising sea-temperatures.\\nYesterday a paper, published in the prestigious journal Nature predicted that “Antarctica has the potential to contribute more than a metre of sea-level rise by 2100”.\\nAdded to melting ice in other regions, this means that sea level rise could be some five to six feet higher by the end of this century.\\nAs the New York Times reports: “That is roughly twice the increase reported as a plausible worst-case scenario by a United Nations panel just three years ago, and so high it would likely provoke a profound crisis within the lifetimes of children being born today.”\\nIf this is not mind-blowing enough, the scientists add that sea level rise could be “more than 15 metres by 2500, if emissions continue unabated”.\\nIt is worth reading the next two sentences twice from the Times, allowing them to sink in:\\n“The long-term effect would likely be to drown the world’s coastlines, including many of its great cities .. New York City is nearly 400 years old; in the worst-case scenario conjured by the research, its chances of surviving another 400 years in anything like its present form would appear to be remote.”\\nFor those of us who have written about climate change for decades, we have often wondered when the tipping point will come that spurts governments into radical and urgent action.\\nGreat storms have come and gone, cities have already been plunged under water, destructive droughts have killed millions, and yet we carry on roughly as normal. Yes, renewables are gaining hold, but not nearly fast enough and governments still subsidise fossil fuels to the tune of billions.\\nThe obvious response to my last paraghraph is to argue that we are not carrying as normal, that only a few months ago that Governments signed an historic agreement to tackle climate change in Paris.\\nBefore that lulls you into a false sense of security, the deal is not nearly enough to save the West Antarctic ice sheet. It does not go anywhere far enough to reduce carbon emissions to the degree necessary.\\n“The bad news is that in the business-as-usual, high-emissions scenario, we end up with very, very high estimates of the contribution of Antartica to sea-level rise” by 2100, Professor Robert DeConto, at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, who led the work, tells the Guardian. “This [doubling] could spell disaster for many low-lying cities.”\\nThis article originally appeared on Oil Change International. Read the original here.',\n",
       " '\\nAs the presidential campaign circus dominates headlines across the U.S., glaring signs the planet is undergoing abrupt anthropogenic climate disruption (ACD) abound.\\nA major study published in Nature Climate Change shows that the planet is warming a stunning 50 times faster than when it comes out of an ice age. The implications of the rapidity of this warming, for those who care to digest it emotionally, are horrifying.\\nThe study shows that even if carbon reduction targets are achieved and the planet\\'s temperature is kept below the 2 degree Celsius warming threshold, sea-level rise will still inundate major coastal cities around the world, forcing one-fifth of the total world population of humans to migrate away from the coasts. New York, London, Rio de Janeiro, Jakarta, Cairo, Kolkata and Shanghai will all be underwater.\\nAs though to reinforce this point, NASA recently released data confirming that February was the warmest month ever measured globally, at 1.57 degrees Celsius above the preindustrial baseline temperature average. The new record easily smashed the old global temperature record, which was set just one month before, in January.\\nThis means that while it took from the advent of the industrial age until October 2015 to warm the planet 1 degree Celsius, humans have managed to warm the planet another .57 degrees Celsius in just the next four months since then.\\nLet that sink in for a moment before reading further.\\nAs if that isn\\'t enough, a study recently published in the journal Nature Geoscience revealed that carbon emissions are now the highest they have been since the age of dinosaurs, 66 million years ago. According to the study, the current pace of emissions is even beyond the highest-known natural surge of carbon that exists in fossil records, an event that occurred 56 million years ago that was believed by many to be caused by the release of frozen stores of greenhouse gases from the seabed.\\nThat ancient release, which drove temperatures up 5 degrees Celsius, is now surpassed by our current surge of carbon release. \"Given currently available records, the present anthropogenic carbon release rate is unprecedented during the past 66 million years,\" the scientists of the new study wrote.\\nAnother ominous sign of escalating ACD: The entire Northern Hemisphere surpassed the 2 degree Celsius mark for the first time since human civilization began. Bear in mind that 2 degrees Celsius is the arbitrary, politically agreed-upon warming limit, above which warming is considered \"dangerous\" to humanity. Former NASA scientist James Hansen debunked that goal over two years ago, when he published a paper showing that 1 degree Celsius was the scientifically proven point of no return.\\nParts of the Arctic were 29 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal in February, which even brought large portions of the Arctic above freezing and into temperature levels more common in June.\\nDozens of countries across Europe and Asia set or tied all-time temperature records, and cities across the United States saw record warm temperatures, in which the 2015-2016 winter was the warmest ever recorded.\\nWinter in the US, according to meteorologists, technically takes place from December through February. This year, that winter was 4.6 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal, breaking the previous record, which was set in 1999-2000. This winter, all six of the states that comprise New England had their warmest winters ever. Meanwhile, every single US state had winters nearly 2 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal, and Alaska\\'s winter was an incredible 10.6 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal.\\nUnderscoring the severity of what is clearly a planetary warming crisis, the New Scientist reported in early March that earth had its highest-ever annual increase in carbon dioxide levels ever recorded, with atmospheric levels breaching 404 parts per million.\\nThe Arctic is where warming continues to be the most blatantly obvious. In early March, the start of the famed Iditarod sled dog race looked more like something out of a dystopian science fiction movie, as snow-starved Anchorage had snow hauled hundreds of miles down from Fairbanks to cover the dry streets upon which the dogs would run. Then, the typically 11-mile long ceremonial start was shortened to three miles.\\nMeanwhile, melting in Greenland is occurring so intensely and quickly that it is \"feeding on itself,\" according to a recently published scientific study. Greenland alone contains enough ice to raise global sea levels by 20 feet.\\nThis information is emotionally challenging to take in. It is understandable that people prefer to distract themselves with the minute-to-minute antics of the political and media charade that is the US election cycle, yet it has never been more important to understand what the planet upon which we live and depend is undergoing.\\nEarth\\nThere are several indicators this month of how rapidly the planet is changing under increasing stressors from ACD.\\nIn North America, millions of acres of forests are struggling and under increasing threat, due to the fact that the speed at which the planetary climate is changing is now far, far ahead of the forests\\' ability to adapt to the hotter and drier conditions ACD has ushered in across vast areas of the United States and Canada. New research shows that all of the forests in the US are officially under threat from ACD.\\nAnd it\\'s not just forests that are being impacted. The agricultural sector is in big trouble, as crops are being impacted dramatically by the rapidly changing climate.\\nFor example, in Montana, a recent study shows that agricultural losses due to ACD could total up to $736 million annually.\\nPanning out, another recent study shows that food scarcity caused by ACD would cause at least half a million deaths across the world by 2050, due to food production being impacted by the effects of ACD.\\nMaking matters worse, a group affiliated with the UN recently released a study showing that an ongoing decline of pollinating species now poses a very dire threat to the global food supply. The report warns that the species responsible for pollinating and promoting the growth of hundreds of billions of dollars worth of crops are facing extinction.\\nAnother study, this one published in Nature Climate Change, shows that high-latitude insects, like those in Scotland, face severe declines in population from ACD, due to the fact that they are far more sensitive to warmer temperatures than previously believed.\\nEven as far north as the Arctic, ACD\\'s growing impact on insects is obvious. A recent study published in PLOS ONE shows that warming temperatures are impacting beetle populations, and hence the entire biodiversity of the Arctic. The temperature change is causing the insects to migrate into new habitats, which is having a domino effect that is upsetting the natural balance.\\nFor humans in the far north, ACD\\'s impacts are even more obvious. Intensifying heat is threatening the way of life of the Indigenous population in the Arctic. With the ice disappearing and temperatures continuing to rise, the life cycles and numbers of fish, marine mammals, caribou and polar bears are being altered, which is causing Indigenous communities to face food shortages.\\nThe leaders of First Nations and Inuit communities in the Arctic are now also speaking out about the mental health cost of ACD. The Native populations of the Arctic are dealing with growing despair over the effects of ACD on their lives and communities, and observers are connecting this to a growing array of mental health and social problems.\\nIn addition to this, ACD has caused the onslaught of rising sea levels, melting permafrost and other impacts that have positioned residents of the Arctic in a losing battle to stay in their homes. Housing shortages are now the norm as land is washing and melting away into the rising seas.\\nMeanwhile, across the lower latitudes, recent satellite images show that tropical rain forests ranging from the Amazon to the Philippines are vanishing far more abruptly than was previously believed, according to recent research. As usual, ACD, drought, wildfires and deforestation are to blame.\\nWater\\nAs usual, ACD-induced extremes of water, either far too much or far too little, are stark this month.\\nIn Africa, at least 36 million people are facing hunger due to record-high temperatures and drought, which have had a catastrophic impact on crops across the eastern and southern regions of that continent.\\nMeanwhile in the Arctic, February saw alarming melting of Arctic sea ice, where record-high temperatures brought with them other records—including record lows for that month\\'s extent and area of Arctic sea ice.\\nUntil this year, the previous records for sea ice extent and area for February were set in 2011. Moreover, the total volume of the Arctic sea ice, which many scientists see as the most important factor determining the health of Arctic sea ice, reached its second-lowest level ever recorded that same month. The record low for sea ice volume was set in 2012, a record that could fall this year or next, according to scientists.\\nGlobal rainfall extremes continue to be elevated by ACD. A new study published in Nature Climate Change basically warns us to get ready for rain, and lots of it. The study shows that ACD is already driving increases in rainfall and snowfall extremes around the world, even in arid regions. This trend, according to the study, will continue, and likely amplify further.\\nIn the oceans, things continue to look grim.\\nRecent research shows that coral growth is already being weakened by increasingly acidifying oceans. One-quarter of the carbon dioxide released as a result of human activities is absorbed into the world\\'s oceans, where it alters their chemistry and reduces coral growth.\\nMeanwhile, a severe coral bleaching event in the most pristine portions of the Great Barrier Reef in Australia has caused authorities there to raise an alarm over severe local coral bleaching, caused by warm ocean temperatures.\\nAnother study shows how ACD is pushing fish toward both poles, which means that traditionally poorer countries near the equator have even less access to one of their primary food sources. The fish migrations are due to global temperature increases in the oceans.\\nMeanwhile, sea levels continue to rise ahead of worst-case predictions. A study recently published in Nature Climate Change warns that in the continental United States alone, millions of people are already at risk of being forced out of their homes because of sea-level rise. The study shows that sea-level increases will cause the homes of 4 million Americans to be inundated during high tides with three feet of sea-level rise by 2100, although the pace of sea-level rise is consistently ahead of that projection.\\n\"Once you take into account growth of population, the numbers end up being two to three times more in terms of overall population that\\'s going to be impacted than if you just look at current populations,\" said Stetson University landscape ecologistJason Evans, who contributed to the study. \"Florida really pops out.\"\\nWith six feet of sea-level rise, which many scientists believe is inevitable, more than 4 million people, in Florida alone, will lose their homes.\\nFire\\nIn the Southern Hemisphere, ACD-fueled wildfires continue to burn apace.\\nIn Tasmania, bushfires have grown so severe that 1,000-year-old trees are burning to ash while dried-out peat bogs are on fire. Experts there are warning that what is happening in Tasmania is a human-caused calamity as severe as the razing of the temples in Palmyra by ISIS.\\nIt\\'s also worth noting that in the United States, wildfire season is already underway (albeit earlier than normal of course), with one massive wildfire having already burnt more than 72,000 acres across Oklahoma and Kansas.\\nAir\\nThis month, there are many bright neon warning signs in the Air category.\\nAtmospheric carbon dioxide levels have reached new heights, signaling an alarming increase. February 2015 to February 2016 saw the highest year-to-year growth ever recorded.\\nPieter Tans, lead scientist of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\\'s Global Greenhouse Gas Reference Network, said the new record accompanied four straight years of increases of over 2 parts per million in the atmosphere. Of this, Trans said, \"We\\'ve never seen that. That\\'s unprecedented.\"\\nTemperatures across the globe continue to escalate.\\nMelbourne, Australia, saw its hottest March night ever recorded, breaking the previous record by more than 1 degree Celsius. The previous record was set only three years prior.\\nMoving northward, the rapidly increasing temperatures in the Arctic prompted climate scientist Dr. Peter Gleick, president of the Pacific Institute in California, to warn that this accelerated increase could have a \"catastrophic\" effect on the planet\\'s climate. He explained that the higher temperatures are driving the creation of dangerous storms across the Northern Hemisphere, and that since early February, the area of the Arctic covered by sea ice has been lower this year than any of the last 30 years.\\nGleick posted a graph of the diminishing sea ice on Twitter with the message: \"What is happening in the Arctic now is unprecedented and possibly catastrophic.\"\\nIn parts of the Arctic, February shattered all previous temperature records as the entire month reached a staggering 18 degrees Fahrenheit above normal in some regions. Fort Yukon, Alaska, a place that has recorded the lowest temperature on record in that state, is experiencing record warm temperatures, causing people there to say that the warming trends \"have robbed the Arctic of its winter.\"\\nTo make matters worse, methane, a greenhouse gas 100 times more potent than carbon dioxide on a 20-year time scale, spiked in February to more than 3,000 parts per billion in the atmosphere. This was the largest spike of methane ever recorded.\\nDenial and Reality\\nApparently, impending catastrophe doesn\\'t mean much to some of the United States\\' wealthiest people. Once again a report has arisen documenting how fossil fuel millionaires pumped more than $100 million into Republican presidential super PACs last year. That means that $1 out of every $3 donated to Republican candidates coming from hyper-rich individuals came from people who made their fortunes from fossil fuels. In boosting GOP politicians, these funders were simply acting to protect their cash cows from those of us who happen to give a damn about the planet.\\nA recent report by the Center for American Progress Action Fund shows that more than six out of every 10 Americans are represented by someone in Congress who denies the reality of ACD. According to the report, 59 percent of the Republican House caucus and an amazing 70 percent of the Republicans in the Senate deny ACD is real. The report also reveals that, according to the US Census, 202,803,591 Americans are represented by an ACD denier.\\nFlorida, a state notorious for having a government led by ACD deniers, faces yet another reality check from ACD. Fort Lauderdale, which is a boomtown of growth and construction, and also expects its population to grow by one-third in the next 15 years, is hurtling headfirst toward the reality of ACD. Sea-level rise will eventually cause the city to be abandoned to the ocean.\\nAnother blow for deniers came in the form of recent polling data, which shows a record number of Americans now see ACD as a threat. According to Gallup polling, 41 percent of US adults believe ACD poses a \"serious threat\" to them during their lifetimes—a 4 percent increase over 2015, and the highest level ever recorded by Gallup.\\nGallup data also shows that 64 percent of those polled worried about ACD \"a great deal\" or at least \"a fair amount,\" which is the highest level recorded since 2008. Meanwhile, only 36 percent of Americans said they did not worry about it, or only worried about it a little. Additionally, 65 percent of Americans now believe ACD is due to greenhouse gases released by human activity, a 10 percent increase on this topic over last year.\\nAnother reality check came from Dr. James Hansen, who declared recently, \"We have a global emergency\" due to ACD. Hansen noted that ACD is poised to render large parts of the world essentially uninhabitable by 2100 due to extremely hot temperatures.\\nRecent data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration revealed that the planet saw an \"explosive\" amount of annual carbon dioxide growth in the atmosphere during 2015, as the amount of carbon dioxide saw its largest single annual increase since record-keeping began.\\nA recent study by the University of Queensland gave yet another sobering warning, stating that global temperatures could rise much faster than expected, possibly even breaching the 2 degree Celsius mark much sooner than predicted (thus missing the politically agreed-upon goal of keeping warming below 2 degrees Celsius).\\nThe final reality check for this month\\'s dispatch comes in the form of a cruise ship. For the first time ever, the Arctic passage that connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans is going to be opened up to cruise liners this summer. The first of them, the Crystal Serenity, will take more than 900 passengers paying over $100,000 each through the perilous route that at one time foiled most explorers, due to there being too much thick ice throughout the summer—given that it is, after all, the Arctic.\\nNot anymore.\\n ',\n",
       " \"\\nThe world’s greatest reservoir of ice is verging on a breakdown that could push seas to heights not experienced since prehistoric times, drowning dense coastal neighborhoods during the decades ahead, new computer models have shown.\\nA pair of researchers developed the models to help them understand high sea levels during previous eras of warmer temperatures. Then they ran simulations using those models and found that rising levels of greenhouse gases could trigger runaway Antarctic melting that alone could push sea levels up by more than three feet by century’s end.\\nThe same models showed that Antarctica’s ice sheet would remain largely intact if the most ambitious goals of last year’s Paris agreement on climate change are achieved.\\nThe new findings were recently published in the journal Nature, helping to fill yawning gaps in earlier projections of sea level rise.\\nThe models were produced by a collaboration between two scientists that began in the 1990s. In those models, rising air temperatures in Antarctica caused meltwater to seep into cracks in floating shelves of ice, disintegrating them and exposing sheer cliffs that collapsed under their own weight into the Southern Ocean.\\nSimilar effects of warming are already being observed in Greenland and in some parts of Antarctica, as greenhouse gas pollution from fossil fuels, farming and deforestation warms the air. Last year was the hottest on record, easily surpassing a record set one year earlier. The ice sheets are also being melted from beneath by warming ocean temperatures.\\n“Sea level has risen a lot—10 to 20 meters—in warm periods in the past, and our ice sheet models couldn’t make the Antarctic ice sheet retreat enough to explain that,” said David Pollard, a Penn State climate scientist who produced the study with UMass professor Robert DeConto.\\n“We were looking for new mechanisms that could make the ice more vulnerable to climate warming to explain past sea level rise,” Pollard said.\\n\\nThe breakdown that they discovered was not triggered when warming in the models was limited to levels similar to those called for under the Paris Agreement—something that Pollard described as potentially “good news.” That agreement aims to keep warming to well below 2°C (3.6°F) compared with preindustrial times. Since then, temperatures have already warmed 1°C.\\n“You need to have a lot of melt to do this,” Pollard said.\\nAlthough the Paris Agreement contained highly ambitious goals, individual countries have not come close to committing to action plans that would ensure that the goals are actually realized.\\nIf pollution continues to be released without being reined in, the modeling showed that high Antarctic air temperatures could lead to melting that would push up sea levels by dozens of feet during the centuries ahead. Warmer ocean waters would prevent a recovery for thousands of years after that, the scientists found.\\nOngoing work is planned to refine the projections, which remain imprecise, but are nonetheless being hailed by climate scientists as an important step forward in understanding the planet’s future.\\n“It’s an important paper,” said Luke Trusel, a Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution scientist who was not involved in producing it, and who has recently published high-profile research on Antarctica and climate change.\\n“It really starts to look at some of the more underappreciated aspects of climate change across Antarctica,” Trusel said. “They’re starting to look at how sensitive ice shelves are to climate change.”\\nAssessments by the United Nations and others have previously assumed the effects on Antarctica’s ice sheet would be negligible as temperatures rise. The new study is the latest in a growing list of peer-reviewed papers that rejects that optimistic scenario as unrealistic.\\n\\nIn major East Coast cities, where land is sinking at the same time that seas are rising, an independent analysis by Climate Central shows that the rapid Antarctic melting described by the new modeling effort would push tide levels up by between five and six feet this century alone.\\nClimate Central’s analysis combined mid-range values from the new projections for Antarctic melting with previous mid-range projections regarding global sea level rise, along with local factors such as sinking that naturally occurs in some areas. It illuminated the dangerous collective impacts of the different ways that climate change is expected to affect sea levels.\\nIf climate pollution is quickly and dramatically reined in, the analysis shows sea level rise in major East Coast cities, including New York, Boston and Baltimore, could be kept to less than two feet—which could nonetheless see developed stretches of shorelines regularly or permanently flooded.\\n\\nProblems associated with sea level rise are expected to be worse in Louisiana, where stretches of land are being lost to erosion caused by flood control projects and gas and oil exploration. New Orleans could see more than seven feet of sea level rise by 2100, Climate Central’s analysis of the new findings showed.\\nWest Coast cities would experience four to five feet of sea level rise by 2100, Climate Central found.\\nThe new paper by Pollard and DeConto was received positively by sea level rise scientists. That contrasts with overwhelmingly skeptical responses to a recent apocalyptic scenario that was finalized and published last week by a team of researchers led by well-known scientist-turned-activist James Hansen.\\nHansen’s 52-page academic treatise, published in the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics following an unconventional peer review process, described a dystopian near-future in which climate change triggers superstorms and more than 10 feet of sea-level.\\nJohn Church, an Australian government scientist who specializes in sea level rise projections, cautioned that the experiments used to produce Wednesday’s paper were based on too few models to give him total confidence in the findings. But he said his “overall reaction” to the paper was “positive.”\\n“Yes, the projections are larger than previous estimates,” Church said. “But not in the unrealistic range like Hansen et al.”\\nThe recent Hansen paper was a “worse-case scenario,” said NASA scientist Eric Rignot, one of its coauthors.\\nRignot said the Antarctic study published Wednesday was “absolutely realistic.”\\n“I think it is setting up a new paradigm for sea level projections, because their numbers are much higher than those from traditional ice sheet models with incomplete or simplified physics,” Rignot said. “Once the ice shelves are gone, melted away, calving of big walls will be the dominant process of mass wastage. It is a great paper.”\\nTo create the maps in this story, Climate Central adjusted existing local sea level rise projections to account for DeConto and Pollard's new findingsâ€‹,â€‹ roundedâ€‹ resultsâ€‹ to the nearest footâ€‹, and took matching screenshots from our Surging Seas Risk Zone Map. We used local median sea level projections from Kopp et al. 2014 and replaced the Antarctic component with the average â€‹of the central projectionsâ€‹ from the two main scenarios in the new paper.\",\n",
       " '\\nSeveral of the nation’s top state law enforcers have banded together to investigate Exxon’s alleged fraud and defend Obama’s Clean Power Plan against attacks from Big Oil. On Tuesday, several state attorneys general announced a new partnership on crucial initiatives related to climate change, including an ongoing investigation into ExxonMobil that may extend to other oil and gas companies. The inquiries are seeking to find out if Exxon intentionally misled investors and the public about the negative impact its business has on the planet\\'s climate.\\nLed by New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, the group gathered for the press conference—which included AGs from Massachusetts, Maryland, Connecticut, Virginia, Vermont and the U.S. Virgin Islands—and announced their commitment to pursuing an ongoing investigation of Exxon for what climate activists have decried as a long-term campaign of climate denial and deception.\\n\\nThe other state AGs participating in the joint effort are Kamala Harris of California, Matt Denn of Delaware, Karl Racine of the District of Columbia, Lisa Madigan of Illinois, Tom Miller of Iowa, Janet Mills of Maine, Lori Swanson of Minnesota, Hector Balderas of New Mexico, Ellen Rosenblum of Oregon, Peter Kilmartin of Rhode Island, and Bob Ferguson of Washington.\\n“Years from now, this meeting by Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and his colleagues here today may be well be looked back upon as a real turning point,” said former Vice President Al Gore, who raised the public’s awareness of the dangers of climate change in the 2006 film An Inconvenient Truth.\\nGore was invited to speak at the press conference, where he vividly expressed the magnitude of our current situation:\\nThe AG’s investigation was initially provoked by published reports, based on internal company documents, suggesting that during the 1980s and \\'90s, Exxon used scientific research on climate change to plan its business, while arguing publicly that the scientific evidence of global warming was not clear. The reports were cited in stories by reporters from the nonprofit InsideClimate News as well as the Columbia University Energy and Environmental Reporting Fellowship, which published its stories in partnership with the Los Angeles Times.\\n\"This is about facts, and science, and transparency,\" said Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey. \"Fossil fuel companies that deceived investors and consumers about the dangers of climate change should be, must be held accountable,\" Healey said, noting the \"troubling disconnect between what Exxon knew, what industry folks knew, and the company and industry chose to share with investors and the American public.\"\\nSchneiderman addressed critics of the investigation who argue it is interfering with First Amendment rights:\\nThe historic alliance of state AGs demonstrates the depth of the issue and its importance to the nation’s response to addressing climate change. \"The scope of the problem we are facing, the size of the corporate entities and alliances and trade associations [fighting science-based climate policy] is massive and it requires a multi-state effort,\" said Schneiderman.\\nAG Claude Walker of the U.S. Virgin Islands said Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands are already \"experiencing the effects of global warming,\" noting coral bleaching, the proliferation of seaweed and an increase in the severity of hurricanes as evidence. Walker castigated the oil industry for consistently putting profits over the planet:\\nThis particular legal narrative in America’s ongoing climate wars goes back to September, when InsideClimate News published the first installment of an exposÃ© revealing that ExxonMobil was aware its primary product contributed to global warming. The following month, Schneiderman issued a subpoena demanding a wide range of documents from the company, including emails and financial documents dating back as far as 40 years.\\n\\nIn January, California AG Kamala Harris launched a similar investigation. The investigation now seeks to ascertain not only if the oil giant knew about the climate impact of the greenhouse gases associated with its activities, but if it knowingly propagated false information about climate risks among shareholders and the general public.\\nExxonMobil has denied any wrongdoing.\\nComparing the behavior of Exxon and other Big Oil firms to that of the tobacco industry in the 1990s (which also faced prosecution from state AGs), Al Gore said, “Commercial interests that have been, according to the best available evidence, deceiving the American people, communicating in a fraudulent way about the reality of the climate crisis and the dangers it poses.”\\n“Big polluters have done everything in their power to deny climate change. It is time for our justice system to take back the climate debate,” said Annie Leonard, executive director of Greenpeace, in a statement released after the press conference. “If the AGs rally behind a unified call, they can make history,” she said, noting that their efforts could spark an investigation by the Department of Justice, which launched a similar inquiry into Big Tobacco’s efforts to deceive the public about the link between smoking and cancer. In December, Leonard backed Bernie Sanders’ climate plan, saying it “shows that he has broken free of the corporate and 1 percent money that has held back climate policy for far too long.”\\nKatherine Sawyer, senior international organizer for watchdog group Corporate Accountability International, explained the similarity to the Big Tobacco investigations in an emailed statement following the press conference:\\nHailing the newly formed coalition of the nation’s top cops \"for standing strong against the fossil fuel industry,\" Sawyer also noted Exxon\\'s \"efforts to undermine the Clean Power Plan.\"\\nThough the Exxon investigation took center stage at Tuesday\\'s press conference, the attack by Big Oil on the EPA’s Clean Power Plan (CPP) was the backdrop: Officially, the gathering was held to mark the occasion of the joint amicus brief the state AGs filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, supporting the EPA’s authority to limit emissions from existing power plants through the CPP, one of President Barack Obama’s landmark initiatives in the fight to protect the climate. The CPP can save the average American almost $85 a year on their energy bill, reduce health costs for illnesses related to air pollution, prevent 3,600 premature deaths and 90,000 fewer childhood asthma attacks every year, and can help create 270,000 new jobs.\\nThat authority has been vehemently rejected by the power industry and numerous states, several of which have filed lawsuits to block implementation of the plan, which would set a national ceiling on how much carbon dioxide the United States can emit, enforceable through federal law. The CPP’s ultimate goal is a nationwide 32-percent reduction in CO2 emissions from the energy sector, but its implementation has been delayed by the U.S. Supreme Court while the D.C. Circuit court considers challenges to the plan.\\nThe overwhelming majority of the world’s scientists have long argued that the Earth’s surface temperature is unnaturally rising, primarily due to CO2 (and increasingly, methane) emissions from such massive contributors as the meat industry, coal-burning power plants and transportation. The proven impacts of global warming are many, from melting polar ice caps, rising sea level and extreme weather and food shortages, to increased disease transmission, the destruction of coastal economies and the rise of climate refugees and climate-related armed conflicts. However, even with evidence linking all of these effects with anthropogenic climate change, the issue remains starkly polarized and heavily politicized, with the fossil fuel industry, energy lobby, Republican lawmakers and other so-called climate deniers arguing that either the Earth’s average temperatures are not rising or that humans are not to blame.\\nSchneiderman was forceful in his defense of the investigation, pointing out that some Big Oil firms have already raised offshore oil derricks to account for higher sea levels and are even drilling in areas once beneath Arctic glaciers, many of which have melted due to rising temperatures. Yet he remained vague on any potential resolution he and his fellow AGs may seek if Exxon and other companies are found guilty of committing fraud. “Financial damages alone may be insufficient,” he said.\\n\"This creates a huge sense of momentum,” said May Boeve, executive director of 350.org, in a emailed statement following the press conference. “Exxon may have been able to brush aside a few isolated inquiries, but with more states jumping on board, these investigations are sure to generate some serious waves. The Exxon revelations may turn out to be the largest corporate scandal in history. We\\'ll be looking for the Department of Justice and many more cities and states to get involved.\"\\nAG George Jepsen of Connecticut added some important perspective on an issue that will have grave implications for the future. “It\\'s time that we stand up … and take on what is the most important issue of our generation,” he said. “We owe it to our children, our children\\'s children to step up and do the right thing.”\\n[Editor’s note: In conjunction with the April 1 deadline, a broad coalition of groups interested in halting climate change and promoting clean air filed amici curiae, or “friends of the court” briefs, with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C.

       " '\\nIt’s been a really rough few days for ExxonMobil, the world’s largest publicly traded oil and gas company.\\nFirst, on Wednesday, the Rockefeller Family Fund announced it would divest from the oil giant, saying it would “eliminate holdings\" of Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM.N) “effective immediately,” asserting that the company associated with the family fortune has misled the public about the risks of climate change.\\nBecause of the long-established threat posed to the planetary ecosystem by fossil fuel extraction and use, the fund said “there is no sane rationale for companies to continue to explore for new sources of hydrocarbons.”\\n\\nIn a letter posted on its website, the fund slammed Exxon\\'s conduct as \"morally reprehensible.\" They write:\\nExxon tried to frame the fund’s move as unsurprising. In a statement, Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers said, \"The Rockefeller Family Fund provided financial support to InsideClimate News and Columbia University Journalism School which produced inaccurate and deliberately misleading stories about ExxonMobil\\'s history of climate research.”\\nBut Stacy Feldman, executive editor of InsideClimate News, stands by those stories. \"Exxon has never specified what is inaccurate or misleading in the series, nor has it requested any corrections,\" she said in a statement. \"But our investigation of Exxon\\'s climate duplicity has won five national journalism awards.\"\\nThe day would only get worse for the multinational energy firm, as the Securities and Exchange Commission ordered a vote on a shareholder resolution that would require the firm to disclose how climate change—or regulations meant to combat it—would impact the stability of the company’s finances.\\n\\nThe SEC’s move comes just weeks after an investigation by the Government Accountability Project, which revealed that, for years, Exxon had lied to the SEC in its 10-K filings.\\n“Exxon has done a masterful job of hedging its bets, both by omission and commission: omitting mere mention for many years, and then grossly understating, the vast array of direct and indirect risks it faces as a result of climate change,” said Climate Science & Policy Watch, a GAP program that promotes governmental integrity in the use of climate science. “Even worse, Exxon has overtly and flagrantly overstated possible financial and economic risks associated with regulating carbon and other GHGs, both here in the U.S. and in nations around the world.\"\\nOn Thursday, Exxon got even more bad news. New Jersey State Senator Raymond Lesniak called on Acting Attorney General Robert Lougy to join an investigation launched by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. California Attorney General Kamala Harris opened a similar probe.\\nThe investigations just keep piling up. The FBI’s criminal investigation unit is currently conducting an initial review of evidence that Exxon knew about the “catastrophic” impacts of climate change.\\nWhile the problems and negative press continue to mount for Exxon, traders remains fairly bullish on XOM stock.\\n“Even if oil prices would retreat in the upcoming weeks, it is still not the right time to sell Exxon shares,” research analyst Arie Goren wrote Monday on Seeking Alpha. “In my opinion, XOM\\'s stock is an excellent long term investment. … Although Exxon\\'s dividend yield is lower than that of the other supermajor integrated oil & gas companies, it is sustainable, in my view.”\\nBut sustainability on the stock market is very different from sustainability in the environment, and ethical investors increasingly want nothing to do with the oil industry.\\nThe Rockefeller Fund’s announcement follows the recent decision to divest by a prominent Rockefeller, Neva Rockefeller Goodwin, who serves as the co-director of the Global Development and Environment Institute at Tufts University. In my interview with Goodwin last month, she noted the patently illogical stance that may undergird the decision-making at Exxon and other fossil fuel firms that continue to put profit above the planet:\\nGoodwin also points out that a more sustainable and sensible alternative to doing business exists:\\nIn its letter, the Rockefeller Family Fund emphasizes its support for the overwhelming science on the effects of climate change and what must be done to prevent its worse potential impacts:\\n“For decades, Exxon has done everything in its power to cover up the impact climate change would have on its business and the planet—those chickens are finally coming home to roost,” said Jamie Henn, communications director for 350.org. “Exxon is increasingly caught in its own web of deception. Instead of addressing climate change when they first found out about it decades ago, the company has aggressively pursued a business path that is incompatible with a livable planet. That’s opened them up to divestment, regulation, and now, potential prosecution.”\\nAll of this activity centering around Exxon’s malfeasance suggests that the momentum is growing behind the #ExxonKnew campaign, which is calling on state AGs across the nation to join New York and California in opening investigations into the energy giant.\\nWith total assets at nearly $350 billion, ExxonMobil is one of the world’s biggest companies. It has the resources to change the script; to invest more heavily in renewable energy and green jobs to help move the nation and the world toward a low-carbon future. But will it? As the pressure mounts for the company on multiple fronts, it may have to.\\n\"If Exxon doesn’t show how it plans to adapt its business to a carbon constrained world, it’s time for shareholders to divest,\" said Henn. \"There’s no other responsible option.”\\n“Climate change will increasingly cause events like hurricanes that will destroy large swathes of property, kill numbers of people, make many homeless,” Goodwin told me. “In the long run, producers of fossil fuels will have to lose. The only question is how much the people and ecologies of the world will lose before our economies cease to make the situation worse.”\\nh/t Kyle Moler']"
